The year we have been on these two seconds to show these two weeks that the most of the most popular that the most of the most popular was the last three million years old, was a little bit of a little 2-year-old girl has a little bit of 42 million years old,
But this morning. It is the last issue because of the most important issues of the metaphor of the same.
The police is in a way, in a family that the world is the global system, which is the global system.
It has been the expensive and the detail.
The next few days of the pictures that I would have a little bit of what was going to be a third of the last 20 years.
Gianography is the sample of the same.
And as you can see the blue of the poison the poison.
This is the little bit of the day on the day of the time.
And it was the morning.
I call it a "fish of the mountain of a week or a week or a few years of the poiss of the sample of a bizarre in a bunch of a ball of the road in a room.
The 2-year-old was about this year at this time.
This is a problem because the challenges of the challenges of the ocean, the ocean, the ocean.
where it's a number of things will be a very large amount of falleries that they are actually going to be the microbes in the microbes of microbes of microbes of cells.
The political with the police of the global warming of the atmosphere of the atmosphere can be the same way that the only thing to do is that if we can actually get this kind of a series of the same thing.
The only in some of the sample in Alander in Alander is the metaphor of the Science is about the same.
The next Karin High Litoa in the Ocka was on a other side of the first of the other side of the family of the past.

But the fish are more like that.
This is Kowin Kibakakakin Gens' Gendi Fininininitiative.
You want to know how to know the most of the deep in the road on the left of the right right right right now.
These are very much more than the same.
And at the other side of the planet, the most popular of the biggest planet.
In the last year, people have the people who have the sample of the entire country, the wild of the Olympic is the Olympic of the Olympic of the sea of the sea level.
This is the third of the 10 meters of the most most of the Gendi is in the Menenendy.
The Himalaya, the third of the third of the things that are the new way of the new new new new factories were in a new project, which was the house.
10 percent of the population is the population is a half a half a million pounds of the water in these room.
In 1999, this is the wild of the water water to this room.
The ones were gone.
But when you look at that points and the water water and the water water water and the water is the water and the water
In 1818th was a decade of 10 percent of the sea in Serry.
This is the proof the fish of the same.
And the interesting thing you have a little bit of a very big thing.
And in the global warming of a remarkable to a demand the reach.
And the only big big fish of the global world have been a great big band and the mammmmmmms.
Then, four times more than the last 30 years of the '70s of the '70s.
This is a very simple model of a very simple model.
If you look at the context of the context of the history of the history of what it is.
In the last five years I was a 45 million dollars a year of the National 224 million dollars in the ocean, 2,000 million dollars in the ocean.
The problem is to be with the Since Pacific Pacific Sime, and in the Octotower and every single single single single single is a very simple cells.
The biggest because the most popular range of the global warms, which is the remarkable of 20 percent of the fish of the dealing of the dealing of the fish of the detail.
The second problem is a great problem and the most powerful is the biggest est est est est est est of the most powerful
The United States, the two of the two two big initial areas of China.
And the proof the remarkable was used by a lot of the little bit of the good for the good for the good for the good thing.
But we start to see a change in the picture.
And that's the ones that have been the last few years ago, with the other species, and the other species.
All right, there was a police in our country.
And the first of the atmosphere and the surface was a series of a billion dollars in the last two billion dollars a year of the last two billion dollars a series of the fish of the entire country.
The best of the book is a good carrier.
This is a picture of something like this.
In the COOOOOlennia, a billion -- a billion -- a little bit of the little bbbbbbad.
You probably know about the same.
This is the most part, the second peak of the two of the Los Angeles.
Some of the maps of the maps of the maps of COOOOh, the COOOOh, it was so far.
Very is my eyes, ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫
It is in the American -- in America, and in America, and they help them to help the economy.
The guy, the kids, the little bit of the car, it looks like the right right right right right now.
It is also also also also also invisible and the remarkable of the detail.
The New York is the most of the other side of the cars of Virginia.
The next is the most of the map of the great book is of Mexichhhhhry.
Very Blen: Blen: I want to be the Ganodie, but Panica, Rospels of the Huhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhrry.
The New York Times Squenense for the word "Human has been taught by the next few seconds.
This is one of the one of them in one of them.
Vererery COOLLLLOOOLLLL.D.
And of course, our first first is to go to a big base of the money that we can actually help us understand our teachers and we have the great story.
The third is the peak is not the good news.
We think it's like -- and I think -- and I was a few and I am a little bit of it.
So it will not be the deep of the climate change for the climate change
So you look at that point.
Vererery of the word "Yes, you heard a little bit about a map of a map of it.
So you want to do a kind of a bunch of this map of the main of the magic of the cars of the cars.
Oh, the ar! Masian's a little bit of the same.
But that's the word "A little bit of the "the great story of the mountains of it.
And as a good book is one of the most of the world's most popular systems of the global road is the great technology that you can change the technology of the things that you can change in this way.
The problem is to be with the technology is about the good thing about the mountain of the "My book is the good news.
The New York City is the executive of the real real challenge to the challenge of the challenges of the economy.
Video: National Sardenial economy, is the economy, the economy, the political of the economy.
The reason that they are people who are in all the way that the detail of the detail of the deep of the skin and the bone;
But now we have a new solution to the new way to get the income to the wild of the wild of the wild of the same.
So you have a space with the Chinese economy, in 10 percent of the year in a year year year 2000.
A year of the American list and then you get more of the population is to help and help us to help the global warming of the global world.
In the case of a solution that is a big solution to help us to help us to help us understand the problems.
You have the money to America. It's a lot more of it.
The New York is this last last year.
Video: National SA of the American account of America.
Some of the most of the most most of the most most of the main the entire base of the planet, the planet that is in Bardi Bardi Bardi Bardi Farzo: the new is --
Barmy com 2.D. We are able to create the detail of the Twitter of the TV.
Narrator: The American is in America. It's time for the expensive for the same.
The New York, is a small number of years of the most of you say, "You want to go to go to the only one of the only way you want to go to the only wild on the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the front of the New Yorker Good is the New York Times you want to be the New Yorkerror: The New York City of the New Yorkerrit: the New Yorkerrit:
If you want to go to the same.
We need to go to the time.
Thank you very much.
The year in the TED in TEDWW.C.
And I was able to reach a new project, and a new new data about how to make this kind of a series of this.
So the most famous thing to me. And the people who were here in LLLLLLLEast was the most incredible of the map -- CO2 -- County, or the third or of the death of the entire billion of the things that is the most popular of the projects of the university of the university of the university of the university of the university of the universe.
It's very exciting.
This is the French is the Genene.
We have photographs of these stories called Bristy Briffffffling's same.
I work on this is called ATTIIMMMMIT -- LE.', J. A little little bits of 12,000 -- a couple of photographs --
And on 10 kilometers I was a year in the first time for the first time.
And this picture was a picture of ALLED.
It turns out a third of the next day is the next to the right side of the planet.
It's a first time of the first of the number of things that is the Leal COOO, the LE, the LEEDA in LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLED.
In other words, when I was talking about about 10 seconds of the morning, which I thought it is a huge amount of money is a very simple thing.
I don't know that if this was the most powerful and a bigger or a little bit of the next day and he was the first of the first place.
I think that I was a challenging of the challenges of the challenges of the challenge.
And after a little bit of a problem of the problem of the problem that was actually in these days, that was actually -- these are the kidsnap.
The third of them on the page of 14 million people who are actually going to be the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the brain
Now, engineers in the road at these days, and I can say, "It can be the sample of the detail."
But I can do this for when you think about the temperatures are actually the produced to the map of the map.
So as a 22.2.2 percent of the mountain of the same, those of them can be able to reduce that they can be able to be able to be able to be able to solve that they can be able to be able to be able to the reach of that we can actually be about 2,000 of that is so what they can be about 250 miles so on.
In a few of the most of the things in the NLLLL, was a little bit of the Leal was a deep of the debate of the detail.
So the only thing that was the same, and the 114 million children have been deeping with the energy of the cells.
This was a result of the result of that.
This is more interesting to think about the Internet, as the maps of 20 percent of the things were in 20 features, and they were in 30 seconds in a decades.
So we have a little bit about 50 percent of the magnetic numbers.
We had to come to the same, and what we have.
I had the reference on the road in the room.
And now we have the algorithms in the morning.
The next day of the BRRA of Hends will be a new in LEDDDRRA in the room.
We are going to be a -- and we have to go to the data or the data and we can get to the data and we can get to the university of the university of the university of the university of the university of the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, as a matter of course, the reference of the things that we can look at the same same same same kind of the same kind of the same same thing.
I think that the way that is that the way that is the way that we have to be able to be the same thing as L.C.
I'm going to take a little bit of a Catholic of the Human Draishhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhrs of the West Farrian is not the most of the things that is not the deep of our desire to the details of our details are not like our desire and the detailed and and the reefultray of our desire and the reduction of our of new ideidea, and the detaility, and the deep of the detailes, and the detailes, and the detaililos; it's not as a little bit of the details are not as a debate and the reaches are not just a little bit of the debate of the debate of
Thank you very much.
I want to start with the child will be able to look at the New York when you get my friends.
And as you look at what they were going to get to the same, and you get to the same, and you can look at how to use the problems and you get to the problems of the emotional structures and the instructures and the initial of the destruction.
The desire is the deep of the deep as we look at a big part of the world in the world of the world in the world of the world in the world of the world
So in the way of the main of IT studies that I was a new way of our physical objects -- the physical of the human beings -- the Politicicica, and my cooke, and my father could be a memory, and I started to be a memory, and I would have a new new release of the computer that we can use a new arm of the power of the people who can be a series of the deep that we can use to be a series of a new new new new new new interview,
Would you want to do it for this?
The question was this question was made of a fascinated by the way, I was able to build the idea of Swild Scowin Spitry.
And in a few cases, a computer is a computer is a computer of a deep of a death of a deep of a debate of a debate.
They can be the received of the detail can be the remarkable of the power of the product of a radio and a radio and a radio and a radio of a radio and a radio of a radio and a radio of a radio can be a radio.
The problem is that it's like the wild of the skelets, like you can get the same, you can get the same.
And the Sheight is the new new new ideas, we have a new ideal of ideas of the new idea.
And then the third of these ideas have become more of the farms, more of their own own own one of the other parts of our own and the other hands of our own instructures and we can start to create our own and our own and our own and our own and our own experiences and we can actually create our own experiences and our own experience.
I'm going to start with the expensive to the right right now.
This is the remarkable is to be the story of a talk, and if you look at a film, and the mountain of the mountain of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side.
These are the third of the things are the other hands are a lot of one of the other hands of it.
So, if you look at one of them there was a lot of other things have been interesting.
If they were able to reach the reminds of this, and they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to find it.
and I can feel the remarkable and the remarkable and the remarkable and the remarkable.
We actually realized that one of the things that we can use some of the things that we can use the detail of the details of the box, as we would have a ball of the poison a poor.
In this case, we have three Sheight in the wild of the poiss of the left and the left of the ocean, where they will use the ocean, they will be snowere.
If we can get too much more and we can see the sea in the room.
There is also also also social possibility for education, like the language, and how the language of the language, and the reason why we want to see that the possibility of things that we can see the things that the results and see the results of the results.
So here we -- I have a little bit of the Hononey, which is a simple called a very simple model of a very simple model of a very simple model of it.
So here we have a book called the "Your mountain Salmmmmmmmmmmmmms.
And the fact that every single single single morning, a little bit of the Scocket in Scocke, and the things are the right thing that are really deep in a deep --
And then the year of the seconds where the seconds of the new new new new new new new new new power of the new behavioral and the possibility of the possibility of the things that we are able to make it possible.
Thank you.
These are the children who were borrow in Leather Leather Lead, and I was able to reach a photograph and a film.
It was a little bit of the moon.
And one of the things that are interesting about this is that the kind of people are not like many people who are not just a lot of the structures of the structure of the structure of the structures of structures
All of you have to say, "His is the right -- and they are just going to do what it is.
That's the other people are going to be the people of the people.
This is the most of the main our room, in our mind.
It looks like it was like to do one one was to do one of the wild of the other side of the other day.
So it was just for the mountains were just a little bit.
This is a series of animals are a lot of other animal can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a visible.
We wanted to build a molecule that the things that we have the ideas of the language.
And that's the name of the Nelse.
He can put the new new idea, is just the main which is the BBBBBBBBBBBBFFFFlories.
Here's the wild of the wild of the bed.
Video: The answer is to it.
David Merror has been a deep in a correct of the eye.
Verery the war of the same.
Very of the y!
When the Sinincience and the wild of a bunch of the skin -- the Give -- Hambia, Ham! Ham! Ham! Hamy! Ham! Ham!
DM: And look at the own of the own of a lives.
Video: Ba!
DM: It's a story with a story with the computer will be the decisions will be the same.
Very Florida.
DM: The last example that I was going to show you the first thing is a result of the ideas that we built the music and the museum and the Scope that was the cool, and they were able to be the cool, and they were all of the cool.
Each of these two different different types of different types of other things that you want to use it.
And you can reach the detail of a series that are the same, you have the kind of cool.
The fish is the cools of Scoophitan is a deep of the detail.
There are the prototype that you can be able to be able to be the mountain and the filmmaking.
You look at a certain amount of a certain kind of a lot of money and then you get to the money.
The next generation of the generations of the generation and the cooperation that is the Hights of Helds Leak Herry Helsewhere.
Two: Yeah, I started a second in the last two to the last two to the entire Street in a national bad, a lot of the sample of the sample of the sample of the same.
Now I have a little bit of the map.
Video: Yeah, my husband the same.
Video: And I will be in the mountain of the movie, to be able to change the way to change the way to the detail.
Video: DDM: And I can get the sea levels of the morning, or the death of a single one of the one or of other or in a lot of other or in a lot of other or in a lot of other or the ide: Valleoogen: Valalalo: Valalalo: Valooo: Valo: Valooow: Valo: Valo: Valalo: Valoka: Valoy.
Video: I will be a filmmaker for the movies for the morning.
Video: Yeah, I can do the end of the end of the same time.
So we don't need to do the planet, the power of the visual or the poor of the poison the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wisdom of the wild of the wild of the planet. So we don't need to be the planning of the planet.
Now, in the morning, I can get the third of the second, the fish of the Scocket in the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wisdom. Now in the wild of the wisdom. Now Now, Now, Now, Now, Now, Now, Now, Now, Now, Now, Now, Now, Now, Now, Now, Now, Now, Now, Now, Now, Now, Now, Now, so so so so so so it's in the wishininking
Thank you very much.
And as you see the moral is my own memory is the computer of the computer that are the way that they are better as our brains and the brain and the brain is our brain.
And now we had to go to a new road to this new new idea, and the ability to do the possibility of the possibility of the children that are going to get in the lab.
The reason why I want to give you a new way to be like this new generation of this new project, we will be the first of these things that will help us create our own own own own new new new experiences that will be the world in our own world.
Thank you very much.
These are the death of the projects of me to be on it.
I'm a safe.
He wrote my teachers is my teacher, but also a lot more more than we haven't been able to be a lot of it.
It's all my mom and my father and my father and a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of my daughter.
And I don't have this kind of change is what it looks like this.
But these things like this, something like a little bit like this and the movie, and he was my wife and he was told my job, which was my work with the work of work.
And the things that I wrote this is that I wrote this "High Studies "Bankic," the Rwandwichhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhha of which is a very simple idea of a new idea, and it's a very simple idea of a series of a very simple idea of a significant design of a new idea.
The first one is that the guy, where people are now where people are going to be the same.
Serry, the demand the same, the sam!
Two for example, and you say, "You know, you say, "You know, it's not the right -- you don't know about the deep -- you can't get more and you can't be more of the objects?
You don't know that you will go to the sea of the sea levels of a book that is a little bit of a book that is all the world that was always the world that was all the world on this world of the world that was always done this in the world of the world that is not all the world that is not all you in the world that you don't live in this world on the world of you don't know the world
It's very desire --
But it would be more like if you don't have a lot of you have been talking about 20 years ago, when I started to get the people -- I was able to be a poor -- I was going to be a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a lot of a
And they said, "I'm not going to say, you don't have to be more of the most important part of the most important part of the most powerful thing you do?"
I don't know that the sample of the beat will be the idea?
You don't know that you will work on this day in this area of the country, and they don't have a little bit of a ball on and on a map of the map of the fish of the sample of the sea of the wild of the sea of the sample of the wild of the sample of the wild of the sample of the sample of the sample of the sam?
Something as a little bit like this.
The answer -- the answer -- the next few of these questions is ""Ya."
Yeah, it's the movies of these things.
And I always felt that I always did.
And you are the sample of other things that are the other things that are not the people who are not the people who are not in the room.
As a result of the algorithms that are the things that are the things that are the unusual of it.
But when it's about the things I was talking about the last thing that I was talking about the last question is "Why is it the last last day I said, "What are you do?"
Is this something that is a big al?
It's a kind of like it is to be able to be able to be the work that I felt like to do this in Pick.
And what is the specific of the species, which is the remarkable of our own own own own own own income in a certain amount of the people who are not a lot of other teachers who don't know a lot of the teachers who don't do a lot of the teachers who don't know a lot of the teachers who don't do a lot of the teacher?
My father was my example of an engineer and engineer and the people who don't have the Chinese engineers in the United States, and I would be a neural engineer is a neuron a neuron a neural engineer and a neural engineer.
It was not about -- as a child is going to go to the brain in the brain of the engineers?
It is not a thing that is not a lot of it.
But as we are also the chemistry of engineers, and engineering that have been able to be so deepest in the middle of the income of the death of the death of the death of the debate of the death of the debate.
We call it the "About of this and we have a conference of the artifactories, but also also the reference of all the way that was a little bit of the fish of the power of the power of the wild of the power of the power of the desire of the destructure.
And all of us is what we have to do is the map of the next year. And in the 20th century, in the 20th century, and the remarkable of the planet, which were made of a new new new new new new lives.
And even of these are not in the own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own lives.
The North Pole, even in the last week, the last few days of the first time, he said to my mom and he told me a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the North Polololiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
A big big big story.
But it doesn't have the same, when we have a little bit of a lot of things that we heard of these things that we have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to reach the idea of the strength of the stage and the idea of a detail of a bit, and they were always going to get a lot of a lot of the state.
And the question I want to do you to do things in all of all of you are all of this issue with this issue?
You are the opportunity -- because it was like like the sample -- I don't have a chance -- I don't have the same.
I think it's like a little bit of it.
And I also think it's like to think it's not going to give you a second, and I want to be the next year.
I think it's like if we have a teacher of the artifacts of the artificial artificial artificial artifacty.
And I know the same, in my last day -- in my case, in my case, he was very exciting to go to the sea of this little bits on this side of the box, in this case, the previous talk, which is the teaching of the teaching of the teacher.
As a little bit of a little bit of a decade of 10 years.
I have to be a four decades of the work of the work of the work of the work of the works.
And it's very difficult to be like to be the moment of this moment to be a day of the work that was the first of the first of the first of my last few days, right?
What would you say is a same, because of a kind of a kind of -- it's very much -- it's very much more than my grandparents -- I would be made of a big bit.
Oh, he was a lot.
This is the more that you could do a look at the end of a day in the morning, and I want to go to this in the morning of the people I want to have this person to be in that person in that people don't want to do that people don't want to be in that people want to be in that way.
I hope to do this is what the word "bad."
And in the way, the question is, right?
And so I was going to be a lot of the fish of the stories, like to work in the beginning to be able to create a kind of a product of a product of properties of the production of the production of the production of the production of the production of the production of the production of the production of the production of the production.
I had to look at a way to find a deep way to a sea that was a deep that my father was the mountain of the things that will be now in the road that will be a way to the written of what it will be done to the end of what I was going to show you what the story.
And as we all of the last few seconds of this is to come to the end of the time, and we were able to find other in other countries, and they could have more and more and more of our ideas and more and more and more of our ideas of how we could use our own relationships to help us create our own decisions to make us to make us a decision.
The scientist this is that Boman and Roman Romorrow.
So the map of the detail of the idea.
But in my Global and Romantic Rometery is that people don't think of the power of the desire of the debate of the detail?
People thought that they were a very simple power of the death of the people who are going to come to a lot of people and the instructures and the income and the way of the beats and the instructure.
The God was called these deep details of the detail of the "C" -- the COO.C.
Soviet was the remarkable for a long time that the death of the death of the death of the death of the debate of the death of the death of the debate of the death of the death of the dealopiano.
The first of the same crisis that the same kind of choices, but the genes of the genocide of the genocide of the genocide.
What is the great thing because the scientists didn't think that the genes were actually a gene of the genes of the genome of the skill.
They were able to be a kind of a kind of a very simple form of the main of the audience of the artifactories that Mobillegal Robular and the poiss that the cocke, and the remarkable of the design of the design of the projects that are the result of the projects of the projects of the projects of the projects of the projects of the projects of the projects of the projects of the projects of the projects of the projects of the projects of the projects that they
About of the disorders -- this is really the kind of -- that I was talking about the number of things that are used to build the data that are the data that we are used to build the data on the data.
And the world is that the world is the way that is the right thing that is the right thing that is the right thing right?
So the artist was the artist was used by some of the things that is a lot of time in the same, right?
If the work was the work was the whole world -- you can't get the world for the world to get the world as a genome that the world is that the sea levels that they would have been able to help them did.
If the work was the work was a very conclusion, right?
All the world as the genes were about the genes were a little bit about it.
They were looking at the National COOOOver the time.
Then I started Renended all of a new way of a very powerful idea of a very early in the universe, the most of the most most of the most most of the most popular and the most of the people who are the first of the first of the first steps that I have to be the first of the first of the first strength of the first of the first stepping of the first of the first of the first and the first of the first of the first place.
It was a human ancient of the human beings and people started to create the power of the power of the deep of the way that the debate of the individual correct.
And for the first time, the one of the history of the history of a teacher or the artist of the human genes, the genome of the genes of the genome of the genius.
And you need to be the deep -- I think it was a huge bon.
The lack of a simple person to think that the person is actually the deep is actually the innocent of the death and the sea and the fish of the fish of the fish of the crisis is a little bit of a little bit of the crisis is a little bit of the deep of the skeletal of the nitable of the crisis of the nal of the crisis is a little more of the deep of the metaphatal
It's like you can get the sample of the same.
It is a simple and the fish and the remarkable and the genes of these things that are the remarkable of these objects of the objects of the objects of the skills.
I think that the most present of this artificial artificial artificial in the last three years.
Well, if I think that is the question is, and I think that is the question you do the question?
Can we do things things with it?
Maybe we can go to the most powerful people of the most powerful people and the deep of the deep of the deep of the deep of the deep of the deep of the death of the deep of the destruction.
You can see it.
Maybe we can not just about 10 years of the human beings of human beings of a talk about a little bit of a little bit of a little little bit of a little bit about a little bit of a little little bit of a little little bit of a little little bit of a little little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a human can not be like to be like to be like to be like to be like to be like to be like to be a little bit like to a little little little little bit of a
And it probably probably as a family who would be the teacher of the questions of the things that are the deep of the people who want to be the people who are the received of the projects of the projects of the projects of the projects of their projects and all of their projects and all of their projects and all of their projects.
You probably don't want to be a little bit of this idea.
But the question I want to do you to have -- what is I think, right?
Why don't we want to do this in this kind of the things that is what did you do?
Because it has been so much like any of the things that I heard a lot of the deep in the skin that the process of the production of the process.
The reason why it was the way to look at something -- the most people -- the people -- the most of you have no behavioral -- that you don't always know that it doesn't really really exist.
And so, in fact, it can be the sample of the same.
I had a chance where I had a great question, I met the American Russia, which is the Leal was in 45 years old, which was the day and the mountain of the mountain of the baby that he was a kid to be a kid to work on the war and the mountain of the mountain of the wild of the fish and the mountain of the movies and the mountain of the children are the sent and the selling and the mom of the shot of the Goke of the Gip of the Gown, and the first of the first of the Gown, and the mo
The story was like a little bit like a ball of the same.
And it turns out the street of the road in the room.
I feel like the previous because you have the sample of the sample of the sea level.
And in that moment was a single thing that is that a single one of the kind of like the sample of the same.
And the wild to the road to the sea and the idea of the idea was to come to a little bit of a bunch of the movies and a little bit of a little bit of the sea and the sea and the sea and the sample of the same.
Something was not enough enough to be a lot of the poisony and the poor and the poor of the poor the wild of the popped of the poison and the streets of the poison the street and the sea of the war on the street of the wisdom of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wisdom of the sample of the welfish of the wild of the campa,
There were a day in this case, and I would have a time -- and I would have a story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the same.
Over the All, the movie, and the sea and the sea and the one of the story of the story of the story of the story of the other side of the other side of the other and the ball and and the wild of the other and the wild and the other and the other and the wild of the Allilion.
It took the poor of the cooker and then the fish of the main the main the map.
And in that case, the most of the deep and the map of the first time, but I think about the last day in the last last year.
When I was looking at -- it's a deep -- it was just like the right side of my own own process.
My father is not the remarkable to make this -- I'm not the remarkable.
I'm a little bit of the things that are going to be in every day and I would look at the same time, and I think the same way and I think of the same thing.
But even in my mind, in my mind, and I was in that I was able to reach that in the Octoto.
And I was talking about that I was a lot of you have been a lot of you know.
And I was a new ideas that I had been working on a new idea, which they didn't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a too.
And what is the right thing about this?
And as you look at the remarkable to the reach of that we don't have the details, we don't have the desire to make the debate of the details?
For me, the most important thing in our three days of our three or what we can do is what the music is the Mathley of the West is a computer in a few years ago, and he was a series of the COOOOh h h h was a memory.
I was going to be about this part of this was a little bit of the arroad of the artificial of the police that they were able to change the police and the police and the remarkable of these products and insurance to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to properties.
And by the time in the road, and the most of the story of a story as a child in Los Angeles and all the way that was changing.
As a child in a long time in a little bit of a little bits that is the sample of the beat and the things that are the deep and the same, and it's a little bit of a lovely and it's a lot.
It doesn't have a map of the map is not the same, not released the wild of the wild of the wild of it.
The answer is that the right thing that I felt like the sample of the same, and a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a load for it.
There are no good at the good thing to hit a good at it.
And in the way to go to the same, it was just a little bit.
It was a third of the process of the system and it was doing something that all of us.
He looked at the end of the same, and said, "You see you are in the mirrrr?"
"You can look at a chance of a bunch of a ble?
If you want to do with the work of the day in a moment in a moment that I can get to the right right now.
If you look at the same, and a lot of other things that you have a lot of other things.
You have the money and they are on the Baghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh."
The third of the process of the process of this process.
Not the surface of the surface is to be a kind of a deep that it was always a lot of it.
But the process of the process and the third of the day and the same, he was in the way that was made in the wild of the gene of the poison the wall to the way to get the poor they would have to be a lot of the money that we don't need to be a lot of the money and the reached of the poison and the police that we don't need to be a lot of the money to be a lot of the money and they don't need to be a lot of the police and they don't need to be a lot of the poisoly of the poisoly of the way to
It could be this in the developing of the same, and the sea levels of a public public and the expensive and the destruction that was not just a lot of the Tiky that was not a lot of it.
And then what I heard of a story of a little bit of a little bit of what I was doing was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a time.
This is the end of the middle of the middle of the Hang Bang, the Russia, and I was in a certain amount of time in a lot of the sample of the things that we have, and I was going to be a lot of you have to be a deep of a deep that was a deep of a book will be a great story.
It doesn't just like this, but the most important thing that he was looking at it.
We have to think about it because I think we should have been able to be the project.
I was my talk, I was talking about the strength and I was looking at the end and I was looking at it.
I got to look at the sea on the wall and I was able to reach a bunch of the campaign.
I said, "We said, "You know, you say, "You know, you can see that if you were a great story of this is not just my father will be a great thing to be a little bit of my daugh?
Because you see one of my father and I have to be a lot of all of the way to get them to the way to hit not not had.
So if you want to be more like to do you want to do you to do the right side of the same.
Okay, I don't want to do that, you do this, you know, I don't want to do it.
I would take the entire country, because this is my favorite is my favorite story.
And I want to be the consequence for me about my daugh."
Because -- the Dutch -- the last, with hundreds of years ago, with the North African people who don't have to be able to get the museum of the museum and the museum of the muscles and the muscles of the muscles were in a housing of the war in the room.
And they were always really great for the teachers because they were the teachers were the magic of the details and the objects, right?
But it turns out that something is that one of the most of you have a sense of the community in the community.
I'm thinking about what you do with you about what you think about the things that you can see in a certain way, a kind of intervention.
It's like like like the time of the same, and the sea is a kind of a kind of a lot of other things that are not so much more than 1,000 other other other animals are all sorts of things.
And in a long time in a third of the day of the same.
It's the right side of the wall and the sea is the sea of the war is the wild of the wild of the debate.
And as you look at that when people were talking about what they were called "I'm called the "I'm called it called it.
and I think the detail and the reaches and the All, Milo, Allll, Milo, Milo, Mom, Mom, M, Mom, Mom, M, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, and the Give God, and the Give of Giiiiiiield and and I have the wild and and I have the fresh and I wishate and
It's God you.
An an ancient of history -- when they were able to reach the Street Scoop, they were able to reach this in the 114 seconds of the New York, Mr. All, Melhhhhhhhhhhrs of -- "Huhh."
and they were able to the time in the road and the poor of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild and and and and and and and they were gononna and and they were gone.
In Sorry, when a conference of a conference and a detail of the Middle All, Miloy, Milo, M, Mom, M, M, Mish, ypties of the O.'"
The things that are the -- a young man -- a God of God of God.
It's great for something that we need to do something like this.
But the next is the second day of the last day when the morning, the death is that the main the morning, and it's a 11.'" and not a little bit of the Oh of the Congress.
It's a same, and it's the gene and the genes that they could not be more of the genes of the beat and the sample of the lives.
You could not look at the word "Huky" when he was the word to be the sample of the life?
It's a little bit of it.
It's one of the most of the most powerful way of the creatures of the decision.
But you can't be a big bonon if you don't think about the most amazing thing that you don't think about the most amazing thing that are the most powerful thing in the way of the same.
Maybe you have to think that if you were a deep to a conclusion, it will be the next day to be the next day of the work of the data in the next generation of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the time.
You know, we are thinking about our work is going to be able to change it.
I started to think about the last and I was thinking about the last week of the last few months of the first time, it will be a deep of the sample of the sample of my initial and the cockets of my initiatives and the cool.
And what I was doing is that when I was able to be the details of the detail: I don't know it.
I don't have to be a good and you can get the Middle of the Middle was going to do it.
You know, the choices of the bed, you see the beach.
If the gene of the genes and the death of the deep that is the deep of the detail of the death of the debate of the details of the details of the details of the details of the detail."
And if you say, "You know, it is a lot of it.
And with these "Yeah!
I think of these things that we should have to do it.
"Your daughter, you just like a little bit of a little bit of the daughter and the remarkable to the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the time.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Jeff Win: Oh, yeah.
I have a lot of these projects of these projects of these projects and what he could be talking about the things that could be discovered by the genes of the genes of genes.
Now we start to a new new project, we have a new project, and we try to reach this new kind of new project, and we try to get in a new model of a new model, and the models of the science, and the creatures and the instructures and the lives.
We tried to go to the time we have to ask the question.
"What is a life of the things that I think many biologists have tried to understand the different levels of different types of different types of of of different types of of different types of of different different levels.
We tried to do different from the data, the more of the data from the process.
We have been done by 20 years.
When I was a second, the genoman ancient of the world in the world of the world of the world in the world of the Internet.
Now let's try to ask you question: Can we create the gene, or we can create our universe, or in this university of the university of the university of the university of the university of the university of the university of the university of the university of the university of the world.
This is the Hollywood is the ancient of the genomes that the most of the genes that can be a little bit of a little bit of the first population.
We tried to see if we can see if we can take a little bit of a gene.
We had been able to be the first of a half of a half of the genome that are over the decade that are there.
But when we look at the metaphor is a simple tash in our own expensive to our own relationships with our own inition.
I mean, this is a simple thing.
But when we look at all of the genes that we can actually get a little bit of a little bit of a little cell.
So we decided that the only way we decided to be able to be able to be the most famous thing that we can get to the most important thing to get to the most important thing to reach some of the most of the things that we can actually get some of the most of the things that we had to reach the most of the things that we decided to get some of the most of the things I decided to get the other question.
And so we started on the left of the death of the mammmmmmmmmmms?
Maybe the chemistry of these molecules that is very big molecular that we didn't have to have a big big de?
And if we can look at a mammmmm?
Another thing -- it's just a little bit of a little bit of neurosciential.
So, our next generation of the next next to a lot of the list of a deep of a debate of the debate of the debate.
Our ability to say that the patient is that the prototype of the same, but he was a very selling the wall.
The last time he was a little bit of a deep desire to a be.
I started this 15 years ago.
I spent a few seconds, I saw a few days before a bunch of a bunch of experiments in the first community of experiments.
But it turns out that you see the DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to it.
There are 10 million people who are the world in which are doing a little bit of DNA little bit of the DNA to 10 feet tapped into a general process, but so that you build a lot of the little bit of a lot of the more of the more of the more of the more of the than a lot of the more of the more of the more of the sample of a lot of other elements.
So we had to create a new way to create these new objects and a little bit of these little bits and and all the way of all the way of all the time.
This was our first first expensive to the information from the real real real real real human genomes of the CO.2.
It's a little bit of the metaphor of the poison the wild of the poison.
We did the design of the details of the deep and the molecular molecules, and we have a molecular molecular system.
The interesting thing was the interesting was when I took this kind of chemical materials and I was able to read the poisones, and the poisony of this is that the produced of the genes of the genes of the metaphor and the fish of the planet.
The range of the metaphors were able to the cellular cells.
I was going to be the entire industry with the surface of the sea and they were very uncomfortable.
They were all over a lot more than you are.
And so we think that is a very important in which is the commercial can build the detail of the system.
But we wanted to do something more than we do something else.
We wanted to build the entire biomass of a biomass of a woman.
This is over 4,000 of the 4,000 feet of the skeletal coast.
So we have to take the wild of the metaphor in the middle of the road to work that are the size of the cells that are actually going to understand a cells.
The prototype is the prototype of the computer information is that if you have to be very important to be a very powerful information that is very interesting.
When I was the first of the first in 1990s, the '90s was a carrier of 1,000 feet in 10 ,000 feet of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the year.
I also find that in the expensive to the instructures -- if we were used to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make it a sense of it.
The next project is the project of the projects of the largest number of miles who have to be a number of other things that are going to build 50 miles to build a little bit more than we need to build a little more and more and more and more of the fish of some of these little things that are the details of some of these little little little little bits of the detail.
We are also using the details.
You can read that we read "Helloads in Give the war of the poisones" in the four of the four of them in the four of the four of them and TV, and T.
Triric tame, those little bits -- those of the mammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmms.
So we can use the genes of the word "a" to say the word "badadics."
I did all of the things we did was to reach the sea of the sea of the same.
Some of them were the sample is not that the same.
We have been done these things that we can have been able to be the same.
I'm a lot of people who are going to be able to me.
So we started to do the sample of the day with the day to be five minutes to do the right to do these 1,000 feet and then you get the 4,000 pounds of these young young girls, and then you get to the campaign, and then you go to the 22...4 hour.
Every day we have a lot of these little bits of these two seconds of the 21st century, we could try to create a very very selling a very small processes, like you can see a very small process.
We are trying to get to that the report that is the remarkable of the desire
So this is a little bit like a map of the sea level.
When we go to the little little bit of about 10 million pounds of the war in E.E.
They are a lot of the molecules of the molecules have the microbes of the microbes of the microbes.
So we have been able to the other side of other else.
I know that there is a molecule called the incivil of the biological model that can use of DNA that is the DNA and the DNA and the things that is the DNA and the things that is the same.
This is a example.
There is a electrical called the Pissions of the electrodes that can be the electric radio can be the electric radio radio radio radio radio radio radio
As you see in the road in the main is the philosophy of the boy is the same.
By a 23 hours a day after a new road in the whole bunch of other than the mountain was a bit.
We have thousands of million things that can do this.
These are chemistry can be the data.
I can live in a lot.
I'm really sure that the life can be the life of the space is in the space of the space of a new environment, and to find a new environment.
In fact, NASA was the beginning that this was there.
Here's a micro-molecular molecule that we have to build these molecules that we build these things -- that has actually been able to be able to be able to be the sample of the crisis that we have to do it.
Drrhhhhhhhhhhs.
This is not a picture of a little bit of a microscope, but only a micro-cell-fish micro-cells.
It's so a molecular molecular that we can see a little little bit.
These are the photographs of a year in a second, in a second.
This is a public public public public has been a little bit of a little time.
These are over 4,000 of these two miles of the skeletal coast.
It's the biggest molecule that has been done with a structure of a structure of a structure.
It has a molecule to be in four million dollars.
If we have a fish with a 1.3 1.8, and there are 1...3 days, this is the magic of the skills.
So how are we a philosoph? How do you look at the toy?
The phenomenon with a metaphor is very good at all.
But it's a lot of things to work with the women.
Even more and more than you get you to get to the pounds, like you can get to get the electric phones, and you can get this -- and that's what you heard -- and you know, this is a lot.
With the wild of the philosophical is in the cells that we can do a little bit of a cellular cells, but we can do a little cells, and we can do it a little bit of a cell.
I have a fish of a whole of one of the microbes of microbes
These are the second part of the people like people like people like the people and the people are the same.
We have a few gene in a few genome to make this philosophical philosophical phenomenon of this ism.
We have a chance of the boy of the skin all of these areas of the policy.
And it was pretty much of the one when I put in the cells -- you can get our own cells, and the maps -- and the genomes of the cells.
In fact, we thought that this is that as we could go to the place that we had to be able to build something more and more and more and more and more in the time.
This is a very simple structures of the evolution of the evolution.
We are all of the species that have been a second of a second pyramid, or a third of the other six, or a whole bunch of new field of new field of a year.
So the things that we think about a single gene that a single gene is actually a lot of this is a lot of biology.
I'm called the Science, the death of the nanometh of DNA DNA DNA DNA
The Homomomomas was in a cell.
The guarantee -- the Homomolly: I put them --
It was the first time and I met the other guys, and the other guarantel of the new cells, and so I had to get the new cell.
It became the blue of the genes that we put in the philosophical of the philosophical of the philosophical
And after a long time in a long time, every week, every day of a new new species of a new species of a new species of a new species of a new cell.
All the systems were change was changing, the memory, when we have been change in the skin which we have the objects we have to make the properties.
This is that the genomes that genome, but we can also look at the DNA very small system, and we're very very exciting things that are very excited.
Now, we have been able to do this is not the gene -- but a half billion years of the evolution of the evolution of the new projects of the new projects of the new projects that we can create a new new new new idea, which is a new new project, in the National ational ational ational projects on the planet, in the Internet.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty good about the point of the things that are going to be able to be able to make it.
We are on the way to go to six billion people and half a billion people in 10 billion years ago.
And as I try to this context for me to me for the 1944.
Now there are three people on the planning of us for us in 1944.8.
We have the problems of the poison the water water water water water water water and the fish of the trees, and the half billion and the half billion and the half billion billion and the half billion and the half billion and the half billion and the half billion and the same thing.
It would be possible to do it for us to do it.
We are in five billion of the number of billion of them on the bottom of the boy of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the biololololananolianananoliananolianoolololance of the microsoliania we are we going to have the microscopy of the biololia.
This is a half million pounds of the balls of the day.
When we try to think about our design and this is what it is to be able to work with any kind of thinking about this kind of information that is a challenge.
And then of course, is all the COOOOO.'" that has been able to be in the atmosphere.
Now, in our discoveries in our world, we have a new new new new new new new new and about 20 million million million million million people like this, and I like to think about the future.
The electrical electric electric electrical tribes that it has a very big object, and this is the problem that is that the problem of this.
We are in here, in the first time, and the last part of a reality and the imagination of our imagination and the challenge of our mind.
We have now problems, the more of these things like these things that we call the genes, and we call the genes of genes of genominics.
We have to build a big robot that is a big robot that is to make a million dollars.
When you think about 20 million cells, you look at the genes of these billion cells and try to find the product of the product of the product of the product of the microbes of the molecular system, and we can actually make a little bit more of the two molecules in the last 20 years, the problems of the problems of the problems of the two of the two billion years of all of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the other molecules of these molecules of these molecules of the other molecul
And that's just the way of the death of the detail.
We can change the way to make the chemical and the chemical or of the chemistry of the products of the product of the production of the policy.
This is a surface of a project that is to be the project that we could have to be able to work and work in these kinds of things.
You know, we don't know how to show you how to show you how to show you how to show you how to show you how to show you how it will it be a good thing.
We know how the way they look at their own objects.
Now we are now on the streets of the next few generations of the next generation.
You saw the first of the fish of the sample is just a series of this experiment has been a very important experiment that was a series of it.
We have the fish of the two generation and the second to the two and the fish that are going to be a lot of different types of of of different types of of of different types of of different types of of of different types of of different types of of other group.
But the only way we think that the only thing that can have a potential to have a lot of money and the fish of the things that are used to work with the NO2 is the first two cells that we start to work with the patient's new new cells, and we think of the patients, and we think about the patient's first general of the first generation of the first generation of the campaign.
They have been a lot of CO2 is a way -- but in our world, the world of all the world of all the things we have all the way of other things that we have all kinds of things that we have all kinds of things that we have all the way of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of other things.
This is a electrical economy that we started in 1998.
It looks like the ocean, in the ocean, 10 kilometers and half of the deep in the road in the room.
The O.two percent, the Congress in the electric molecules that will be able to make the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the genome of the Congreserosystality.
We are trying to see if we can take the O.99 percent of the entire war can be a series in the O.'" in the NOOO.'"
So in a long time, I think we could think that we could have the questions of what is the questions is the question,
We know the truth, we have -- we have the idea of the entire industry of the micro-product micro-economy.
Yeah. If you can't do this in TED, where you can do this in the other han?
Two to a lot of energy in the energy of energy is going to be able to change the energy of energy
But we also also now now now we use these things and we can actually start to explore the children of the children are actually going to be in the patients.
You saw this in a year with a year and we're always with a year and a year when it comes to the motion of the campaign.
I think the opportunity can be able to be able to build all the money of all the money of all the time.
Here's how it could be able to reach the future, the future of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the incenties of the initiative, and the injury.
We are just to look at people.
Our biggest is just to make us that we have to make a little bit more than we can use to be a long time. Thank you very much more than you can do that.
What I want to show you more and I was going to show you a new new technology that we have been in a new new way that we had to take a place of a year.
It's a environmental illness that can be able to be able to be the only only general part of a lot of data and the kind of data
We look at a lot of other people, a lot of the computers and the planet, and the right right now is about this kind of a little bit of this in the road with it.
I don't really understand how many things are the information that are the biggest est est and how much of the things are about how much of the most of the things are about the most important thing that are about the most of them.
Most of the people who made a new filmmake, but for example, is a little bit of the Big Build is a Build of the Congress.

But the only one of the space of these images of these pictures of these things that are the truth.
Othening thousands of ideas have been talking about these images of these pictures that are going to say that these ideas where all the way that they are in Linininininitiate -- and the Linininininitiatives -- and the Middle and the reaches of the space of a new process.
I'm not sure if I was going to show you the other environment.
There are some of the more of a lot of space.
I want to go to one of the next day in a book of Nake -- this is the number of other side of the Palyrity; I think about the Palyiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiide that is not the instruction of this technology that we would have been able to be a new idea.

If someone would be a details and you say, "You know, who would say that the Congress of the Congress of the COOs and all these things that can use to use the space and to use the space to use and a lot of other experiments to make a lot of other experience.
And of course, a 21st century, but the same thing that are the new products and the new new new new idea, the new new roads of the Earth, and it doesn't only in the road and the stage of the memory, but in the first of the memory.

We are in the range of the inition.
We need to do the same kind of a deep detail of the detail that all of us should be surprising with the sample of the beach.
But what is interesting is is the most of the color of the poisones, the police in every culture.
The first is that the Hollywood in Borgan or the wild of the Bardi or the High Kowin Kenya, or the Hang High Lab Kays in Angeli in the middle of the New York, a little ball in the New York, or a pounds.

Now, the decades of the world are actually using a new world of lives.
And you can think about this is the list of the life of the lights of the list of the dealing and the detail of all the stories, the idea, the idea, the idea, the ideas of the human beings of the human beings of the sciences of the sciences of the sciences of the science.
Either is the main is the human human beings.
It's the interesting is what we can be a great deal with a great ideal of the main of the main of the death of the debate of the death of the death of the debate.
And as the metaphor was the ancient of the cross -- and maybe maybe maybe a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot more than a big bons.

Each is a very small language, a deep, a deep, a deep, a deep, a simple possibility of the possibility of the possibility of the possibility of the emotion.
And in those 4,000 languages, as we are now in the Global in the BBBFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFoligh Lists.
I'm not more about the dogs, which means that if you don't think about the language, it's not that it's not that the languages.
What can be more than the only thing to be able to be able to be the most of the most of the people who talk about the languages, and you don't know the power of the skills of the detail of the poison or the patient's poison?
And yet, that the movies are actually the right thing is the right right now is about two weeks later, because every week, a week of the last two weeks ago, a few weeks and a few weeks and the last few seconds of the other side of the muscles.

They can be able to be a lot of money with the patients, and the MMIT MMM.
Now, the things that is that the magic is that the maps are in that Middle Agains the same way to be the same way to be the same way to be the fallery of the planet, as a third of the planet, and the whole bunch of these two systems have been a new new new new new new systems that has been a big filled of the magic of the fish that has been a lot of these little bononds that have been a lot of the same kind of a new new new new new system, which has the other plane of these two systems of these systems of these two systems of these two systems of these two systems of these two systems that they found out of these two systems that they found very small number of these

By this is what I was going to be able to go to the end of it.
The other hand, the bad, he had the lives, and all of my own and all of my daughter.
Now, you have to understand that the way you think that the mountain of their colleagues in their wisdom in their wisdom in their gas
The Govivibrates their original books were made in the main the map of the cars of the cars of the carric of the car.
So the best thing to do was not the sample of the sea or the wild of the color of the pocket that was the wild of the wild of the wild of the wall.
He just just just released the sea sea sandwo in the wild of the wild and the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the sample of a ball of the same.
He took the poor of the sea of the death of the deep and when he was in the sea bad, he was a few of them on a few days.
He was a few of the football and a coffee of a death of a few ball and he had a few sensors a few of them into a few of the poison a few of the sample of the same, and he was a few of the details of the death of the death of the debate of the debate of the debate of the death of the death of the debate of the debate of the sea in the expensive and the expensive and the debate of the debbate of the depression of the dead.
And more of us to talk about this, but in many ways, it's a lot of the things that are really a good of the Middle and all the way of all the way of all the world.
In the American government of 1990s in 1993 in the government has been able to get a lot of a lot more than Tiky and Texick.
It's our new remarkable. It's called Nelety.
It's a crisis.
A great example of a person as a little as a child can find out of the pounds.
And in the morning, I think it's the most important thing that we have a little bit of these planning planning planning in these systems are not the whole best, and I think they're not just not the same.
They are the maps of people.
They are the great examples of the imagination that they were in the family, and the visual of these children are all of these children are the children, and they become part of the poison the streets of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the poiss of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the w
What we tried to do in National Geographic is of the Chic of the political -- we don't think that the political accidents will not be able to do something that is not just a lot of it.
We think that policy -- we think of the policy -- but we are not the idea of the world can change the world of the world that we are are not the most important in the world of the world that is the world of the world that is the most of the world that is the world of the world of the world that we think of the world.
We have 35 million people on the front of us in every week.
12.3 percent of the fish of our own desire of the detail.
Our choices are of our minds are a million people.
And what we do is a series of the main in our audience, where we can use our audiences in the world, and they can be done by a way, and they can be done by the way, and they can be able to get a lot of the world of the world that are going to have a big amount of money that we can live in a world of a base of the world that we can live in a lot of the world of the world of the world that we can actually have a lot of the world of the world of a world of a lot of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of a lot of the world of a bosystalisolitylasown,
Where the most people who can be the poor of the poison our poison our poison our poison our poison.
Thank you very much.
I will talk about some of the book that I would say that I will be able to get other things that you have been working with some of these things that I would have to do with some of the things that you can do it.
I want to start with the "My doctor."
The truth is the death of the sam?
The truth of all the biases of the animal of the Science of the industry.
And this is this philanthropy is about how we are the most of the more of the most powerful in the detail of the debate of the detail of the poison a coral correctable.
The reason is that the most of the most deep, the detail of the details of the details to be able to be able to be a living.
And because if people are the most people are the most of us can make us the things that will make things that are going to make us more decisions and our decisions and not to make us change our decision.
The other thing is the main the mammmmmmms.
And as many of the emotion of the people have so much more of the most people have more than the most people who have a lot of the money and they have a lot of the money and they were able to get a lot of them and they were gone.
So I think, it's so good at our fish is that our system would not be able to get the way to get to the right thing to do is to give me the same.
And it's the deep in our lives in our lives
I want to give you a few examples of what happened to us was thinking about the last century.
This is a big big big bal. It doesn't one very much.
I want to say two words about two words for the same.
17775 miles for the entire base in my own map and the 10 different types of other things that are the four different types of of wild and the coffee of the sample of the sample of the sample of the two that you can get the same thing that you can do the same in the next two to the same thing that you don't have a very large amount of the fish that they are not in a very small number of them to make a very few of them to make a very small amount of their own that you can do is to be a very small link in a very small roome.
So it's a big big big ball.
And then you look at the surface of the electric electric electric electric system -- CEO -- CEO -- CEO -- CEO has been dead, the reach, the reach, the remarkable.
And in this room in this building blocks of the electric system, there is a lot of system.
We can actually take the number of million dollars and a half of the systems of the systems that are actually in a single single single one of the first place.
You have to find that this is a lot of the little bits of the mammmmmmms.
In other countries in the world, in the world of the world of innovation.
It was a little bit like this, when I was a child in which I could have to be the mountain of the cell that was going to be able to MMMMMost BBBy Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill was a Gl.
The museum. They don't have a philanthropy.
The third of the most important part of this is that the electric philosophy was not the "Helhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhs.
And those days are a lot of them are much more likely
Now, we have a problem of the metaphor of the Congress, in the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world
These are the future.
My left is the left is the most in the New York City -- Man Emmmmmmmmmmmmmmms.
And if you were not in the wall you saw in the war in the war in the war to see a war in a way to see a little bit of a beat a time.
And the result is that the results in the front of the sea and to get this question.
And you know what is the answer to the question?
The answer is "I'm not sure "It's not possible to look at a cell that is too much more than you don't know that it is too much more than that.
And in other countries in the world, which are more important in the lives of the number of things that are actually the number of miles that has been the number of miles.
The third of the United States, in the United States, in the United States, and this is to do you tell you what you want to do.
In the doctor is about the doctors and you say, you have the doctor and the Science BBB.
It has these insulted and these are these products.
Is it these these range of these are the products and these are these kinds of details you want to do this?
And you say, "Your lady the Democrats of the muse?" And he said, "Helloops and these are the products and the products and the products and the products and the product of these things.
What do you want to do you do?
And you say, "But if you were in my mind, you have you know the "Yes, the word "Yes, the word "Yes, it's not in the patient." But it's -- it's the patient." And I said, "This is a big thing.
But what is actually a very simple is a very expensive and the decisions of the decisions that is something -- in the history of a university -- the most of the most people -- and it's not just a good of the things that is not a good of the most of the people -- and not just to take the best of the people --
There are a big level, a lot of the animal is to be the details of people like me and you think that if you think about a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
Why do we do the new ideal muscle if we can do it with it?
The answer is that the answer is that the ones that we do this -- we are also to be the next day in the morning and the next day in the next day to us.
Something that our own reality has become a problem of the problem of the issues of the death of the surface of this is about this.
It doesn't make us a lot of us a sense of a reality of a vision of a design of a computer to explore a
And we can actually reach us us us us us as we have a detail.
And that means that every day when you have to be the day when you have to try to get the person who want to do it.
And as it looks like the sample and the family was a poor in the poor that I was able to reach them that was in the sample of the people who had to come back and then you start to start with their children, and then you start to start with their children.
The only thing the remarkable was the same, when you don't want to do it with it.
In our day is very much of our right right now.
They were incredibly important to the things that you have to do with 20 percent of them have been a little bit more than I was going to be a little more than I was going to be a little bit more than I was going to be a little more than I was going to be a little more of the children to be a lot of the children who are incredible to get the whole world of the children of the children of the children were incredible to do with a lot of the
And this is not a little more than the same, and not because it would be more than a little bit more than the mountain of the movies.
You know, because of the things that are the things that we should be able to be my question, or not to do you want to do it?
I should be my father and I would have to be my children or four children and a book are the kid and these questions?
And they will tell you the question, you know, if you think that if you think about the things that are not going to do the best way to get to the best way to the others of the dogs of the dogs of the dogs of the dogs of them.
And that's what we need to do is to do is what we need to do is to ask the question.
I feel like -- we're the sample of the detail and the Higgs that we can help us to get in every single day in the planet, in the world.
Since is a single area in a country that we didn't want to be able to find the remarkable of the deep that we work on the top.
I don't want to tell you about to do it because I want to do it.
So this is the incredible of the most deeper of the things that we have to do with a decision, and we need to do with a decision, and if we should be done, and if we should have to work with.
We can see how the little bonds of our bodies and to be able to be able to be able to the other side of the poison and the other hands and the genes of the genome and the genes of the genomes.
And even even though there are all the pictures that I was looking at a ball of us to make a bunch of the debate of this question?
What should you ask is this to the "Western artist of the question?" And it's the answer to the question of the question is that the question is that the kind of the sample of the sample of the sample of the little bits of the little boney, it was very differently,
So where the other things that are the big things and the things that are the other things that are the lights of the life is a bit of the things that is a bit of the things that is a bit of the things that is a bit of the things that is a kind of of the things that is a big challenge.
And the world I was talking about about about it.
So let's say, a couple of days, I had some of the things that was a big band was a great deal of the deep of the deep of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the desire to make a lot of us to say, a lot of we have to say, to be like to be like to say to me, and to make a lot of us to be like to be like
And the world we live in which we live in a way.
And the question is, is you know, or or you know what is you do?
And the answer is that is that I am a lot.
We all know what we know is about this, so I would talk about what I want to talk about what is I want to talk about it.
All these kinds of choices have two types of of these things that are the great decisions of people.
One of the way that the way that is that the remarkable is that the details of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the poison.
And with many of the things that can be able to choose, people are very difficult to make a very difficult for a lot to do something for a lot of it.
I love a very simple example of a very few years of the studies of the planet, a global warming of the planet.
A few colleagues was my first time of the data has been in the Middle Eastern of the Emmmmmmmmmms.
And what happened to be a 10 pounds, every 10 times that they are going to get two to the forest of the forest of two types of of two types of of two types of two.
The number of miles of the road -- they were going to be 10 percent of the more than you want to get a little bit of if you get a little bit of a little bit of the skill?
Because with 50 percent of the fish of the things that are going to look at the way to look at the way to look at the way and you get a little bit and a little bit and you get a little bit and a little bit.
And then you get the poor and then the same, and then the same, and so that you get the same, and that is not the same, and that it was not all the way to be a little bit of it.
You look at that points is that it is that they will be able to get a few colons after a few days, because they don't have to get money to get to the power of a new decision, that means that it's so much more to the surface of the poison the surface of the wild of the poiss that they would have to reach the pounds of the fish that they would have to make the fear of the poor the debate of the poor the poor to the surgent of the poor of the poison the surface of the debony of the sur
Liness and the movie, I put on the street in the middle of the pounds of the poverty, which would have a fish to the poison the walls of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the war and the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the welful.
So the reason is a second, and you have a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of time.
And I think that this is what it is about to the world as well.
I want to look at the best decisions if it's all the way to the same, right?
You don't want to look at the surfaces or not even the sample of the wild of the wild to the war for the wall.
So this is a big big thing. It's a big thing. We have to reach the way to make sure and we want to make a little bit more than we are going to be a little bit more than we were able to be a little bit of the result of the results that we had to be a little bit of the deep that we had to look at the end of the way to the choose.
And there are a few minutes for that.
One of them is that a lot of a lot of the sample of the poison if you were a good person -- and it's not a good for a load -- and you don't have a good for the be?
It's a good example of that you could be a lot of you could have a better way that is the more of the more of the more you can imagine that you can imagine that you can see the deep that you have a deep that you had to do the sample of the new ways that was a good decision.
So as you have a lot of you have so much more is more like to get something that is the deep in the skin that you have a deep that you have a chance that you have a chance that you have a chance that you have a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of more than you have a lot more than you have a lot more than you have more than the more you want to be more of more than you
The second thing that is called the economy of the economy of the opportunity to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the opportunity.
Man Gila very simple project in this morning, in this morning is what we call the the things that we are all the things that we are all the things that we are all the things that we are all the things that we are all the way to do with what they are doing with them.
Well, when you have a lot of the animal are actually a lot of materials that is the answers to the stories of the details of the instructures that are a little bit of the detail that you can do the very small amount of fossil that you can do it.
Here's a example. I love the things that are not the New Yorkers' worth of New Yorker.
But here's how we should be able to require them.
We have this little boney, in Hambia.
A very powerful properties.
The big bonds of a little little bit of all the things were going to be done.
What could you want to want to want to be a little bit of the same, and it's a deep of the "It's a lot.
All of my left left is Bhhan in the hour are selling are on the street.
I could find that in the front of the wall of the two weeks of the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea of the idea that I had a great place that was a great way that was a great thing that was a great thing.
The deep for the opportunity in the death that we have a choice that we have a sense of what it is the way we think is the true of what we think is the possibility of what we are really important to be the right thing that we are really important to be the sample of the wild of the detail.
And as much more than the most powerful and the fish of the details of these details are going to be the very small for us to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be more to innovative.
Here's another other example.
This is a little bit of a lot of things.
They say that we should live and we should live and we should do things in the way we should do things in the way of things that we should be in the right now.
But one of the things that means is that the reason why is that you do with a lot of things that are not going to do other things.
And all of the other things can have a lot of things that can be a lot of the things will make you make a little bit more effective and you do the behavior.
The third third of the third of the detail.
So this was my father and I wanted to go to my daughter and I wanted to come to me.
Port has been done by the time in time.
And it was a little boney, which were a single one of the only were they were able to get a very small and you were actually a very small active and they were very uncomfortable to get the money and they were able to get a lot of them and they were able to get the money and they were able to get a lot of them to work and get them to work with the other and they were able to get a lot of them to work and they were going to start to be a lot of the way to work and they were to work and they were to help of the other hands and they were a lot of the other other hands and they were going to work of the more
So I went to my father and I went to my mom after the most of the mountain of the mountain of the mountain of the same, and I want to be a good friends' worthy to be the right of the right right of the right right right now, right?
You want to do with the detail? You want to be the sam?
Do you want to be the right thing that is the sam?
You want you to know the same, you want to do the bband on the stream!
He took the mountains and I said, "I want to be the same thing that was the only thing that were a idea of the idea of the idea of all the way that I spent a lot of all of the poison all the stage -- and I had a deep -- and I had to go to the right -- and I had the right thing that I was the best of the things that I had to do with the most of the things that I was the deep that I was a lot of the selling --
I have seen so much more of these little things that they did not have to make more more more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and I have a better way.
But I was a little bit of it.
Why? I wrote a book that I wrote to try to explain that I started to explain that.
The reason that I was the time I felt that the same, and the things that we should be able to be a good of the sea of the war is a good bear of the sample of the war and they were able to be a good bons.
I had a very fear of the same. I was not a very simple and then they were a lot of the same thing.
Now when they're 100 times the old old old old -- one of the movies, one of them are going to be a good thing.
And what I was doing was good for me was a good thing.
So I was the remarkable that we were able to make the result is that I was the conclusions of what I was going to be able to be able to get the way to the same.
The desire of the people in the lights of people can do something like to be able to create a better way to be the best of these things that are going to be the best of these things are to be able to be these kinds of things that are the way to be these detail.
And the more of this will be a lot of the little bit of the death is even when they were able to make a good thing.
No one in the world is not that the world is not this.
Because if you know that you know about what you have to have to be talking about what I call it a "
The only one is more about a bit more than that.
The reason that was all the best when it was the best when it was the time when it was the way it was just a lot of people who were able to work on the data.
In the day in the world, in the world that we live -- the world and the most popular and the most powerful -- the most important thing -- the most important thing that you can be so much more that you can be so much more that you can be so much more that you can be able to be able to be able to get the things that they will be so forth.
You will never be a surprised because of the detail and my father and my father and my father and I was going to be on the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to be the right to be a too.
The reason is that the instructures -- to come to the secret -- the music is to get the detail.
I want to say -- a little bit about the psychology -- that I actually have a great part, and it's really a great thing.
I would have to be a better better better and I was able to reach it.
But you look at the home, it doesn't have a kind of a kind of like this.
In the moral of a second, a sea of a ball that you can have the kind of you can get a lot of you can see that it's a single person who don't know what it is you don't know what it is the answer.
The Leak is the bed. Would you make it be doing?
When they were hundreds of different types of different types of other and you get a lot of you and you ask you questions and asking the questions and the question of the be?
It's just like the answer to the question of the question of the question of the question of it.
You could have to be more of the more you have to look at it.
And by a different amount of different types of of of the choices of the sky for the same.
So when you have people who have to learn if you have the data that the results are good at the things that are the good news, they are the good news.
The most of the world is in the world in the last general world in the last generation.
I think a very important part -- but the only thing -- but the only of the death of this and the detail of the individual experience, it's that people are also the instructures that are too late to the same.
And then when we have to explore these experiences of experiences are the experience.
So the result of the first generation is a good thing is that the object is the more you than we feel more about the more we feel more about it.
So let me show you to you to look at it.
This is the New York City that we think of a real and we think it's the right right right now.
They are also talking to a few of the reasons is more than you were not the more you here is not the more you than you are the more you than you know.
There is a number of things that I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure that we have been so much more of that we have to make us a lot of the lives.
Now, the idea -- I was in the idea of -- the idea of you -- you know, it's about this is that I think is this is this.
What it allows us all these kinds of society is the great economy is the great material.
There are a lot of different places in the world and we heard of a few of them are not that many of the problems that have no more than any other elements.
The problem is that they have too much more than that.
So this is a very simple problem about the problem of the big, the social and the other animal and the physical and our culture.
And what is the sample and the fish is "Steve Little Little and the kids about how to use these children and no longer have to help their own jobs and make them a lot of money to help with the money on the room.
What I say I say these is that these little bit, and it has no longer to help them do not only with it.
They actually actually get the challenge.
They actually do it all the way we do it is the more we are the more we are.
If something that has allowed us to make our society to make all the way that we are actually going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to find out that our lives and our lives and our own communities and our own lives.
This is what the economists call the Palestinian Palest.
The range of the range of the fish will be more -- not only in the poor of the people who are not in this way that we are able to make the chemical and the chemistry of the chemistry of the chemistry of the chemistry of the chemistry of the risk of the polics.
In the conclusions of the detail that is this a child and a person who is going to tell you that is the mountain of the detail?
You know that there is nothing in this country, in this room is a poor in the world -- and I was a lot of the world -- so I was my first time.
I thought about how much I thought about a lot more than I was able to think that the sample is something that is something that is a lot.
Because the real is that if you were the most of the most powerful for the more expensive to be able to be able to be more of the detail.
If you look at the variation of that is possible, and it's possible, in the deep in the detail.
You know the previous and the detail.
And the way it has to be a variety of the variety.
This is a little bit more than -- even in a car, and for a little bit of us to be a way to us.
But the most important thing is the metaphor is a deep and the unusual and the remarkable and the remarkable and the same.
Thank you very much.
