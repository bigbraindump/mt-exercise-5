This is one of them, a part of the one of them.
Vide: Actu: At the COLOALi we see our change as a three-dimensional three.
So our goal is to spend a big money for the public transportation that is to help us help us help us help us make our complicated.
The device is actually the good cars is not did.
We think it's curious -- and the mix and mixed out.
So it will not be the climate change for climate change for the climate change
You have this in our ways.
Videa: Actu: The Carcur, Carcur, you have a map of it.
So you can do a tool of this particular manifest, the paralyzed of the car.
Usas! Masitan's gypties.
But this is the sound of the good technologies.
And while the good news is one of the global intuitial causes of global remarkable technology that you see the technology that you can change the whole technology that you can change the whole thing.
Up of the theater, this is technology to the cartoon today to the car.

Thank you very much.
The year at TED I did a TED Fellow to LHC.
And I promised it to come and give it a data about how this devastating device.
So in this room for those who have been here for those who have no scientists that was asked the most scientific experiment that was asked by 27 kilometers -- the 27 kilometers or is to recreate the pressure or of a fear of a billion-year at the universe.
It's extremely so much of the light.
This is the Genevela.
We are photographs of these minds of the Bangs" in the decades.
I work at this one. It is called the ATLS -- Lungeline -- Lung 22 meters of 22 meters here is the photography of ALS --
On the top 10 sedstage of the first time.
And this picture was the ATLASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSLALALALLALALALLALLALALALS.
It caused a very similar remote to control control the room.
It's a first picture of the number of particle that has been deep in the LHC, the LHC of a LHC in LHC in LHC and the particle in LHC and the particle in LHC in LHC and the world is detector.
In other words, when I had this picture of 10 per seat that the top 10 cthumb, which is a successful success.
I don't know whether this was the most ellives, or when he went to the Google and the first page, and you can see the first page of the first page.
It means I did a cultural impact on the street of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution.
And then this is a strengthening problem with the device, which was actually made these songs.
Those are transporting 13 thousand ampons when the power of the power of power power to the mobile phones.
Now, engineers in the War and say, "You can't transport the amppers.
But I can do that when they're in the temperature temperatures are called the superconductor of the superconductor of the fish.
So as a 27-7, because of the hospital of the hospital can transport that are able to transport that they can transport the board can transport the board can be transportation.
At one of the laws of the next 9,000 magnetic networks in LHC, was a refine of factory of the factory of the factory of the factor.
So the company has been sick, and those 13 thousands of among ampons of amphidden resistance to the electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressions like the magnets are being able to get over 20 to 20 task, and they have been 30 chapters almost 30 chapters.
So I have a magnetic required.
We had to go away, which we have to do.
We reconfident that we received the town.
And now we take magnetic magnetic requirement in subterroristan.
The end of the first stage of the HC of the HC is will be as new as well.
So now we're going to start with us and we have to pay data in the unit or of the research or the research and we will continue to find the universe.
So of course, that in a way, those accident accident of the important thing about the important thing to do is to be able to fly into the extreme to fly to fit to fit to fit out.
I think that the fact that the fact that we have a way that we have young people like HC.
So I'm going to go to the physics of a scientist of the physicist Humphily, who I think that the experiments of the experiments of protecting the protecting the protect of the protecting of human health, and he said, "Nimmoral progress for human minds to prevent human minds are not that our minds are not that our minds are not that our minds are not as our own disorders are not refinance as our world, as the world are not finance and the world as a cruelownery of our to the world."
Thank you.
I want to start with the end of the young art, when you play with the baby of the baby with the baby bodies.
On the magic source that you invest to get them and get them and get them and get them and get them to the disease and sold to the other people and choose the wild of the hospitals.
The hospitals are propyramid of how we understand the world as a lot of the world of convicted world.
So in the way of the method of the meant of our physical objects with our physical objects, and my physical therapy of the artifacts -- I was the collaboration -- I started to take my own -- I started to go -- I started to get a computer -- where they could be a computer -- when we use a digital computer, and this is that if we use a digital bunch of digital didn’t in this room that could be a magnetic field that could be a bend of a magnetic and a TV or a Tuplific information that he could be so much of this in this whole badake of this whole digital bosystalleet and a lot of this whole bad, and this styphasessor that I could be a moungain, which is that he could be a mastyphasessor a digital mastyphabit
With that we want to not?
The question was taken by fascinating this fascinating as I had to think of the research.
On the short, Siftable is a computer, a computer interaction of a map of a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of a little bit.
They can be manufacturer -- they can perform, and they can perform the way the bed, and a radio and a stage of the stage of the strengthose.
The most important is that are like palpably palpably you can see them as only watching them as a water.
And Sifting the examples of a new ecosystem of the digital tools of the digital process.
On the magic of the tools are more like their own initiatives of their own initial board, and the initious acties of our nutritions and addiction of our new and destructive active active active active active to interact with interaction.
I will start with a simple example.
This Sizarred is confident to the video, and if you include image, and if you include the film, if you include in the other hands of the other side.
These are the data that are the other things that are the other things that are the other size.
So if I put them one onto other words, it becomes interesting.
If you have inconclusion, and they can become a confussion.
And you can feel the rise and inclining.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction of the interactions of the others of the elders, like the way we have a light-bed.
In this case, we have three Siss of the style of your poor and can use them to use their culture in the center of the center of the center of the center in the center of the center of this --
If you get too much, we can take a little bit of the water.
There are also interesting to educate interesting, like education, like the mathematical language, and mathematical senses and happily in which we want to be able to see the same thing to look at the results.
So here I -- this is a ronacal of the Kbonacy, which are doing with a simple program.
So here we have a game, a kind of rule, a kind of combined by Scross and Boke.
So every one of the first first first of all, a letter of the Siftar and the magic of the mountains of the words, are the worst of the worst of the voice.
And then the time of 30 seconds of the residents, and you have a new set of letting us and possibility.
Thank you.
These are the kids who came in the Middle Eastern Middle and returned to be able to get them to the movie,
It took us to the crazy.
And one of the interesting things that kind of applies of this kind of applies.
All the thing that we have to do is "F" and they know what to do.
Here are the people who are the people who are hurting on it.
This is the most anthropology of our right right right in the right right there.
It seems like he wanted to do everything that was to do is to do the Sifest Sify of the other day.
So for him.
This is a apply of animator.
We wanted to build a instrument for those who invest language.
And this is Freex.
He can introduce new persons in the stage of the War Siss that are the main which they are the person.
So this is the arrow of the sound.
Video: The Surch.
David Merrill: Now he reduced a tractor in the scene.
Video: The Tractor of the piror of the wildlife
Very of those.
Missssssets and assume and the sample of the people can interact -- Video: Ham!
DM: It creates and narrative.
Video: Oh, yeah.
DM: It's a conference with the open-source storyteller.
Videa: ZZibodies of her.
DM: Ul, the last example I had to show today is a instrument and interpretation and interpretation and in which we built the sound of the sound of the sound of the soil and all the sounds of the sound of the sound.
Each of these different variations of different variations that you want to use it.
And you can rejection that are the successful of the result that you can have all the time.
Inducts are the sound of the soil of the soil of the so-called Serotttsets of success.
There are effects that are the effects that are reversed, like the pherery and filmmaker.
You can see a certain kind of sound and then they include the hell to help it reach it to help the help of the help.
The next thing that is general effects like the sample and the volume of the His to see His His to see His to see it.
Videa: DM: YM: Your world is the second of Saturn Switch in the success, a serious range of a serious expensive, and I have a lot of it.
So now I put a basic line.
Videa: DM: Now DM: Now I add a little bit.
Videa: DM: And now I will add the filter to the tower the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the light: Videa.
Videa: DM: MM: More threaten inclined in the clinical or of the inclining of the inclinic.
Videa: I would like to think about the bagging of the bags of the same.
Vide: DM: I can receive the time that the amount of time.
So you don't have to do the planet, can improvise, they can improvise, or the same.
So in the end of the initially can use of the Sify of the volume of the volume of the volume of the clinical trials in the clinical --
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is the creation of us is the creation that are better than the brain that functions and our body that functions and our body is the brain and our body of our brain.
And today, I had time to show this new coordination of this new text of design, and how we have to go from the law that we try to get them from the lab.
The Gand's reason to retiny is that we're in the free of the new general tools that will bring the digital tools that will help with our own rules in our world of our rules of our rules.
Thank you very much.
And so the destruction of you can all talk to you to you.
I'm writing.
He wrote the book is my teacher, but then it's more than that.
It's all my mother, my mother, and fascinating.
And I don't think that this is to change it.
But these are the one that was made of the very few of the books and my career, which was trying to require my initiatives me to my work with the workers.
And the thing that I wrote this book is that magic of biography of the Roaging "Mananca, Roage," which is the way to a lot of my books to a lot of the books of my feature, and became this kind of a world that is a very important that the cool of the international sympherosphalalalalalalalalal-the-the-the-the-the-the-international international confer that is that you have been written as a little bit of international international nervous international nervous
The theory is that the theory is that people are going to go to the part,
Serosophy -- confidence of the convicted of it.
With the walljorships, and you say, "You don't know is the theory of the performance of performance that you can't even even even more password ""performan?"
You don't have the theory of your life to write the list of the life of the same, which is the way to do the world that ever ever ever ever ever do the world that ever ever ever ever ever ever do the world go?"
It's very linear line.
But it was also the lesson if you didn't have to be able to do it as a few years ago, when I was adolescental -- I want to be written by the same letters.
And people said, "You didn't have a theory like you can't have no more than the success?"
Do you don't know that the illusion will be the idea?
You don't know that you're going to work in this field of life in this field of your life and nothing will be a morning of the dreams of the dreams of the rain the rain the rain the rain the wild?"
Something that is that kind of thing.
The answer -- the short of the short of those questions is ""Yes."
Yes, you feel the theory of all those things.
And it always was it.
And you know, it's the remote of other things that people are not going to be intuitive.
As an example of the magnitude and other things that are crossed as a cross.
But when I was written to the work that I found out and what I did is "Where is "Where is "Where are the "Why?"
Is it something rational?
It's a logic is to be that anybody can be able to do that they feel like the Pame.
And what is the specific specifically of the creative of creative creative that is true of their own health workers are not a way that other teachers don't do it?
My dad was engineering by engineer and not by the author of the four years of the engineering, or the chemistry of engineering, or whether it's not a engineering.
It wasn't happened, John, how does the stage of the chemical?
It's just not going to happen this.
But that are to be honestly, engineering as a group of chemicals that have not so much of the reputation of the elements of the elements of the elements of the phenomenon.
We write the insects we have this remarkable reputation and not only writers, but the artists, and the artistic of all the things that have been a lot of people who have a lot of the remarkable to be powerful and remarkable to be powerful and remarkable to be very powerful to the reputation of the insssss;
And all of us have to look at our numbers of the numbers of the 21st-century remained in the 20th and the minds that have died by the list of your own lives.
And even those who didn't have the own initially inhabitat of your own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own
Norman Mailer, even in the last time to my first interview, he said, "Easter was a little bit more of my book."
A great great great extraordinary of the work of a living.
But you know, we don't have a cupies when we heard that I heard that I heard of things that I heard of a lot of times and unable and unit has to be able to be able to ensure and suffering the idea of it, and it will make it all the way to fine.
And the question I want to add that is all here today is all the problems of the impact of this idea?
You can comfortable with -- as as you can see the eye of the eye of the eye of this -- I don't really think about the bedset.
I think it's like odid.
And you also think it's dangerous and not to give it to a fear of the future.
I think it's better if we encourage our artist's great artist's to wear the shock.
And I know with the case of my situation, my situation -- my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to go to my carry car, especially in the neighborhood, especially in which I was teaching about teaching.
As a example, there are pretty much like 40 years.
We probably probably have been able to be in the workers.
And it's probably probably all what I would write with this moment to be judge of the human beings like what the work that the work of my childhood was the last of my childhood, right?
What would say is to the same, because of the same thing that we're already -- it's probably probably probably the most successful to be happened.
Oh, Game, which is what gandy!
This is the way that could do someone else could do it anybody in the morning, and I don't want to reach that person.
So I mean that the message that message that I love it.
And then the question is, right?
And so I think the many, the man who had to work that I have to work now, to try to go now, to write a way to write a way to create a way that we have a way of building democracial climate climate climate climate climate change, right?
I had a way to find a way to go to the fly to the fact that he wrote the nature that he wrote that he was going to write the natural law that he was going to write that it was now in what he was going to write to the thing that he was written to write that he was talking about.
And as I have all the last year I started to go through the time, and I started to find other society, and I try to find other society to find other society to have better ideas to be better and healing to the people that are helping people people people to change the function of how to creative.
The science has been taken me and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma
So you know, the magic of the skin is the incheck.
But in fact, the Grand Romantic Romantic thinking's part of the creative of the areas of the human beings.
People thought that the creativity, the creative of the people who are reaching the people that are the unintelligence and unintelligent and unactive in the streets and unintelligent and uns.
The reason that were the named these spiritual creatures of the creative of the human nature of the terrorist "proce."
Socrats was the main because it has a demand that the creature.
Romans had the same fish, but they called the creative creature, the immoral of the choices.
What is wonderful -- because the romance of the romance of the noise of the cross of the crossed of the crossed of the end.
They thought a genius had a magnificent of magnetic field of the war of the war of the war of the war and the wild of the wildlife and unitable to be the original of the worker, and the result of the worker, and the result of the worker workers of the worker, and the result of the workerror of the workers of the workers of the workers that the worker of the worker
Absoldier -- this is the distant thing that I was the distant of the psychological psychological decisions that protect the result of the works.
And all the world as it is that it works, right?
So the artist's artist was protected by certain way, like a lot of things like too much narrow --
If you have the basic work was the street could have the same thing for the world as the world as the way that he had helped this list of the world that helped it.
If the work of the work was completely critical, it wasn't completely recool.
Everybody has been like the gene of the gene was a critical way.
So they look at the people in the Vest creativity.
And then it came to the Renastly, and it all the mared, the idea of the main the center of the universe, and the universe is to all the universe, and the mysteries of the universe, and the mysteries that are the first of the desire to the mysterious des.
It was the world of human rational, and the people have started to create the creative creativity, and the people are all the way in the individual world.
And for the first time in historical history, and the other artists, and the other artists, in place to be a genius.
And you have to remain and I think it was a huge error of error of the error of the error of the strengthose.
Maybe the task, a simple person, a person, and it is actually receptor is actually receptor and the surface and the source of the mystery and the source of the mysterious responsibility is too much of the human beings of the bodies of the board of the bodies of the board of the board of the bodies of the bodies of the her.
It's like you have a cool of the so-called so-called so-called so-called sound.
It just also is the incotton and reforms of the reforms of these astephypes on the performance.
I think that the pressure of this artist's artist's artist's in the last 500 years.
And if it's true -- and I think the question is, what do we do we make accurate not?
Can we do things like that?
Maybe we go to back to the most old relationship between the relationship between people and the creativity.
Maybe nothing.
Maybe we can't just stand to fly by human rational-ration-ration-race talk.
And you probably have the public public people that would be the same questions that are the layers of the theater that you want the people to pressure that people are actually going to be all over their projects and the projects and all the world.
It probably probably never want to cooperate on this idea.
But the question I want to ask is -- why don't I do it -- why don't you know what?
Why don't we think about that?
Because it has a lot of that kind of as a lot of something we've heard about what we look like the creative process.
It is that anybody who had to create something -- in the fact that you can do something -- you know, it's not always the behavior.
And in fact, sometimes maybe it can be the right of the right of the paralleanal.
I had a great initial where I met the amazing American American Rutch Stone, who now has been in the judge of 90 years and that was going to be when he was asked when he was the story and he told me when he was the story and he had a wided and he had a wided and he had a stuck and he had a stropage and he just heard the stock and he had a pound and just heard of the camera.
The story was like a ville of the Arab of the air.
And it turns out the roads.
The point is that the income is called the flower flower under the legal corner.
In that moment has a single thing that has a single thing that is that the applied of the air.
And it goes to the house to the house to the hurt of the haging idea was to reach a map and a map of map and a creative that when the third and he had a little bit of the map.
Sometimes it wasn't enough enough enough to be able to go and others and the other, but it doesn't reach it in the households and the poems and the poems and the poems and the war and the wild of the roads of the road.
They were also the moment -- and this is not going to look at this -- the moments that almost almost losing the story of loss.
The other goes home, the main and the main and the third and the forest of the creature of the creature, and the story of the other and the other person was going to go with the other and the other and the other and the other and the other and the other and the other and the other and the other words.
And the reason that the code and the recover and the receiving the main the magic of the magic of the map.
So in the situation, the commitment of the perfect phase and it was in the last time to the last word.
When I was just -- it's the only one of my own process.
My father creatives don't reduce this -- that's not drive!
They are a catch and how they work that work to go into the same day and you can go and go and go and go and go and go and go with strong.
But even the way I was in my hair, and I was able to know that phenomenon of that phenomenon of the phenomena.
And I have a kind of like you were many of you who are many of you are.
And I had the projects or ideas that have been working on a source of which they didn't know to identify it.
And what do you do that?
And how it would it be remarkable to report that we should be losing our minds, to make us wind our minds, to help us help us remore?
For me, the most relevant examples of our days that we have the musicians that we can do is the musicians took a piece of Wa's interviewer with the reviviously.
I was going to be the subject and Tom was almost all the way of the artist's initiation of the artistic of the contemporary of these immune emergency and to the creative efficiency of these impulses of these immune repairs.
With the time it was the story of the story of the story as a day as a day on the Los Angeles and then everything has been changing.
While the time I was a short of a short of a long style that comes in and magnetic and the magnificent and a remarkable and a repair and a light-in-in-in-in-ending.
It doesn't have no retirement to be able to cool the report.
Incement all the symptoms that the ecanxiety in the room and the paper, and the paper for all of it.
It's not enough enough to reveterin."
And instead of all in the panicon, just it was just waste.
It was the whole thing that I did and everything with everything and everything else.
He has been raised and said, "You don't see that are the volan?"
"Can you tell you that could write a track of the accurate of the actor?
If you really want to be able to be in the moment of you can go into your youth in your life.
If you go and the same thing you can do is another thing.
Take and the BBBy and the Cohen."
The fact that the process of creative process.
It didn't have the operate in the same way that it would always be unbelievable.
But the process, and the remote processor in the moment that he took the time in the moment that he had the wildlife and only because he had to go back to the road, and then he had to go back and look at the end of the way and you can come back and look at the city.
It could be collaboration and the great base in the former former of the same, string of the exterrorist and the exterrorist that wasn't that Tomano that was not like Tome.
And then what I heard the story I started change a little bit of the way I was saved it.
This approach me that I was in the middle of the "Manuca, Roaging Procect, and I have a kind of the wild," and I had all the way that I was not to think that when I was a reported to the most display that it would never have a recover to be a refriend of this is going to be a refriend of this is going to be a consistent.
Not only that the most propositional that he ever told it.
We just thought that we should think that we should have the project.
So I asked my father of his hospitals and I asked the openness of opening and I asked her and I asked it.
I have the way to the manuser and I brought the commitment and I had a collection of the camera.
I said to your voice is "Asculp," and I love if this book is not the amazing thing is not going to be the extraordinary of my daughter?
Because you can see that one of the things I have to go to the wall, and more than it would ever be able to do not anything.
So if you want to be better than you want to do you to do the stage and you can do the strengthose.
Okay, if you don't do that, you don't do that, you know, to all of it.
A continent to writer because this is my message.
And I want to consensus to me, I did my job as I did my job as a tree."
Because -- the Conclusion -- hundreds of years ago, hundreds of years of the North African people are going to take the poor music, and music, music, and music, music, and music, the music, and the music,
And they were always wonderful many, because the dancers were remarkable teachers and were remarkable to remarkable and were remarkable to remarkable and were remarkable to be very wonderful and they were all wonderful elsewhere, and they were all wonderful --
But sometimes they are very routine, and one of the real world of the real community.
They are sure you all know about what I would be the things that you all have to be a certain kind of interpretation.
It's like the time that the passes and the chances of the password is not doing nothing different, you know, in the other 1,000 33,000 serts, everything is that they are all differently.
Tince has no more seems to be in the trees.
It's the list of the right-hand and the same.
And as you know, when they were the people who were the named and they said the number.
And the fact that they were removed and receptor and said, "Hlay," Dame," Game," Gamambodies and Gamame."
It's God.
A Mamannouncement -- when the main Spanish of Spanish Spanish and the initially turned this into the Alladies in "Allay" -- the Allayy" -- and the wood."
and they hear the time in the fight of the wildlife and the judges and the coffee and the coffee and the coffee and the flowers.
In Spania, when a rerererererererererererehase and the Allay, Allay, Allaw,
It is the unintelligent of God --
It's wonderful because we need to have a so that we need something like that.
But the second is the second day when the morning when the meant is the reporting of the reports, 17 morning, 10, and it's not a scaling scale.
It's a diet that has been did, and that are the genes that are not going to be more and more and more inalone.
Would it be more to your name is the name of the Domas he had to do what it should be able to do with the rest of your life.
It's hard.
It's one of the most effective active accurate in your life.
But it can't be a great chance if you don't think about whether you don't think of the most amazing part, as the most amazing parallel of the people are coming from the inside of the areas of the inside of the inside of the inside of it.
Maybe if you think that they were immediately immediately immediately a source of the moments of the moments of life of the next few other words, when the data were going to be more of the bears.
If we think that all that is all the beginning.
I started thinking about it, and so I thought it was that the last months of this book, which is going to be published by the way, and cross and crashing and crashing the forest.
And what I did I do is that when you lose the cure of the bed; it would be awesome.
It wasn't the hospital. It just just the requires of the Contin, anybody would be done.
If you look at the same, then the dance.
If the gene of the human gene is that you are repartied to the theory of the extraordinary to go through the eye of the former forms of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the former forms of the human forms and the gene the gene of the human gene and the initial gene of the human gene to
And if nobody is worth words.
And with all these "you!"
I think about these things and I think we should have to prefer them.
"Wat!" for you, all you can just a load loves for the human beings and inforce to participate in continuous life.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I talked about some of these projects, about the genome, and what could be the present of us to the discover of new stories.
Now we start in fact, from a new point of point of biology, and now we're trying to start to start the digital master from this new biology, and to go into a new biology, and to go into a new biological and to life.
We tried to figure out the questions of us to have a big question.
"What is life?"
We tried different approaches, simple waiting for the basic components.
We also also also have about 20 years.
When I have sequenced the genome, this has been taken from the digital biology of the digital biology in the digital world.
Now now we try to ask the question: Can we create new force of life, or can create new forces in this digital universal world.
This is the map of a mice, Myco-Ryco-gene genius that the most of a species that can replant species that can replant in the lab.
We tried to see if we could come with a genome and smaller genome.
We have been able to receive the order of a gene of a gene that are there.
But when we look at the metabolic map of metabolic map with our main compared to our own requantitary with our own resistant.
So let me think of this is simple thing.
But when we look at all the genes that we can only get a moment to a single single single cell is probably a little bit of your life.
So we decided that we actually decided to be as a cross that we can actually have this cross to the treat the most fundamental components to the most fundamental components to the most fundamental questions.
And so I started on the room, "We can we have a crossed of the cros?"
Maybe the chemistry allows these molecules that we never did before?
And if we can possibly a cross of a cross of the cross of the phososomologistication of the genome.
A crosis, by the way, by the way, by chemical material.
So our speed digital world has been reduced to a confitery of the exponential rate.
Our ability to describe the genetic code that very very slowly started, but it required,
The last time he had been a curricular of the exponential cure of the exponential.
I started this right now better than 15 years.
We went through a few days of the beginning, in fact, with a bio-o-o-o-theory before the first experiment.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult to DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to do.
There are 10 of thousands of cars in the world that make small DNA little DNA to 50 to 50 kilometers from 50 to 50 kilometers a generation, so that you build a long time, so much more and more and more and more and more ertainers.
So we had to create a new way to make these new types of new things, and the right and the right of the people.
This was our first step, the first of the digital data from the digital brain of the digital genome of the Ph..4.
It's a little virus that are little virus that are little of back.
We did the design of the symptoms, we went through the right of the DNA of DNA DNA of DNA of DNA by about 5,000 letters.
The interesting thing I came to when I took this piece of chemical materials and I put it in bacteria, and I put it in bacteria, and the back, and to require this box and to require the virus.
The truly of viral viruses were released in the cells and they have come back and they have been initive.
I was going to be with oil-industrial industry and they were really clear this model.
They have rightweight more than you have.
And so we think that's a situation where the software can be able to build their own master system.
But we wanted to do something else.
We wanted to build the whole cross of a bacteria.
This is over 58,000 feet tasterish.
So we said, we have to put the wall, to the fly of the bottom of the size of the bottom of the size of the city, that are the size of a cell phones.
And the design of is critical critical, and if you start with digital information should be very initiative.
When I have this first time I have this genome in 1995, the standard was a role in 10,000 feet of the war from the war to 10 pockets of the war of war in the war of the war was in 1990s.
We find it regret in the residential -- 30 to the original areas could be able to be activated.
The book is the design of the design of the design of 50 kilometers that have to be able to get all the other other dogs to build 50 feet tons to build more than a little bit of a little bit of other people are so much with each other with each other with each others.
We are remarkable elements of elements.
You might read that we put the market.
Tririving in those letters, those letters about 20 minutes of the table -- one literally memory every memory of a literally measured every memory of a memory of a memory of the lesson.
So we can use the genetic cockrow to write, the proposition,
So the thing we did was to hear that we had been able to hear the code.
Some of them were removed to the poetry is not poetry is not the poetry is not the poetry was unapplied of some of the bedles were reamong other were reamong remote to the other were reambid were reambid of the bodies were removed to the husband that was reamong was
We designed those little bit so that we can be with so that we can be with the enzymes.
They are sweet and they are all and they are all them.
So we started to do the gload with five to five to seven thousand and and and fit through the 24,000 letters, and then put the stations of these layers in these lawyers in the air.
Every time we have these great gas to be in the absence to the report to the sequences of the world -- as you can create a very fast processing -- as you can see a mind.
We try to reach that point in that point of the automation of the automobile of the automatizy.
So this is that a remarkable theory of the baskets.
When we get to the very big stories, over 100,000 different ches of the wall, they don't think about the E.
They are all the other molecules of biology biology of biology.
So we have been regreted to other hand.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the biology that biology is that the biology that is Arab uses DNA that makes DNA big, and which is that it makes a little bit of it.
This is a example.
There is a organism called Deincockropen that can be the phase of radio hundred million rates.
As you can see in the panel of the cross-on the street is remarkable in the street.
12 hours later, he took 24 hours later, he put in the layers like it was at the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be asserved all of the organism.
They can live in lives.
I'm absolutely sure life can be in the space in the space of the extreatment, to go through a new environment to find a new environment.
In fact, NASA has been shown there.
This is a molecule that we have built the molecule that we built using these proccleaning to the design of the design of the bodies that we put the code.
Droja phrase.
This is not a picture of a microscope, but only a microscope, but only one of the micro-master phones.
It's so a molecule, that we can see a microscope.
These are the images of about about six seconds.
This is a audience that we've been a little bit of time.
These are over 58,000 feet tasterish.
It's the biggest molecule made of people, with a structure of people, with a structure structure structure.
It has a map of the molecular molecule.
If we have a foundation of 10 and no space and 142 pages to be able to add this genetic code.
So how do we start a crossy cross?" How do you account me?
Evil with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
Estate, even more easier when you get to the nuclear nucle: You can only put the nucleus and put it on the other and this is something that you all heard --
With the welcome in the back, the cross-on cells, but I showed you that we can do a completely transplant and make a completely filled of a cell phone, and we can activate it.
We have a crossed of the microbial in the microbial species of the microbial speculation.
These are the second as as as people and the people and the people and the other sides.
We added some genes in the plus that we can select the cross-genome.
We have been looking at the enzymous to the protein.
And it was pretty amazing when we put in the cell -- you will request of our cell phones -- and the cross of the cross of the cells are going to go into the cells of the cells are going to go into the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells that are pretty pretty soon as we put in the cells --
In fact, we thought that this is how much as it can go and try to go and do something more than that.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are all sorts of species that have been insated by a second cross or a third of the tree, or a thousand new characteristic characteristic characteristic characteristic characteristic characters.
So those who are actually really to evolution just change in biology is just a lot of biology.
They are called the restricted restrictions, which actually had the DNA that actually had DNA DNA
The phosphenomenon that was not a cell phones.
The philosophy -- the cross-one-to---
It was exposed to recognize the other cross-manyer as the skin, he had a strange, and so I had just released with the cross of the cross of the new cross of the new cross of the new crossed and the new crossed and he was conceived and he was conceived and recognized.
It became blue because of the genes that we put in the cross-genome.
And after a very short time -- all the characteristic characteristic species, and it was a new set of new technologies that we put in the software that we put in the software that we put in the software that we put in the cell that we put in the software that we put in the very short period of the long time.
All the proteins were changing, the memories were changing, when we look at the genetic code of the genetic code.
That can sound like the al-genome, but we could move to DNA that are very dramatic to change things very dramatically release to the things that are very dramatically remapped out of the same chemistry can sound like this.
So we received that this is not gene -- but half billion years and half years and half years and half years of evolution; and we have a new version of the Cambridge Cambridge Cambodia, which has a new species.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obviously of the need of need to be nearly nearly nearly nearly nearly nearly nearly to be awesome.
We're on the way to go from the billions of billion people over 40 years.
So to give this in context for me in the context for me in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet, for us in 40 years, in 40 years, will be four years of the 20-year-old will be four.
We have problems of the wild of water water and the drugs of the treatment of six billion and a half billion and a half and a half and a half and a half and a million and a half and a million and a half and a million and a few and a lot of the problems of the wildn't.
It will be difficult to do it for new new one.
We are now using the good book, more than 30 billion cars, more than 30 billion dollars.
That means a hundred million bars per day.
When we try to think about properly biological or any of the processes that will be a challenge.
And then of course, is all that CO2 in this material, which is that it requires in the atmosphered.
So from our discovery of our world, we have a data of the world, we have a different data of gene, and I like to think about these components of design design as a component of the future.
The electronic electric has only a footprint, or so something that is the diversity of the various components that has been in this road.
We're the first step, the first biological reality and our imagination.
We now have the techniques of these methods, to do what we call what we call the gene of the genuine genuine genuine genes.
We have the ability to build a big robot that make a million cross on the day.
When you think about this 20 million genes of genes of genes to try to make sure you proclean, or productive, or productive, you can change the pharmaceutical tech and productivity to change more molecular biology than the last 20 to the most of the biology of science.
And that's just the standard of the standard of the standard of it.
We can control for the phenomenon of chemical chemistry or diseases or products, products, productivity of vaccines, which is the incidence.
This is a way of the screen of design design that we could work that we could have to be able to go to the same in computer.
You know, we don't know how it would show you how it would show you how it would you look at it.
We know exactly how their genetic coffee of genetic genetic code.
Now we focus on the two-generation of the next generation.
You saw that in the middle of the wild of the elephant.
We have comfortable to the second generation and the third and the third of the third and that are going to be a lot more valuable valuable values of different types of of flowers.
But the only way we think that the biology can have a major impact without a product of food and the fast costs of their own initiatives and the first of the CO2 as the first stem cells to design the cells to design and the first generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the next generation.
Lald and CO2 is a way of our -- but in our discovery of our world, but in our world, we have all kinds of ways.
This is a organism that I wrote in 1996.
It goes into the deep ocean, about two kilometers and half of the street and half of the temperatures.
Transform CO2 in metan used molecular use as a molecular molecule as a source of energy.
We try to see if we can take the CO2 inforce that can be easily transported in the country, and converted that CO2 back in comfortable to the product, to conclusion this happen.
So in a short long time, we think we could have the question of what is the question of what is the question of "What is the life?"
We don't know -- we have the objects of the same chemical models of the chemical industry.
Yes. If you can't do that at TED, where in other way?
Give the amount of energy.
But we also work to use these same sources to invest these areas to the buildings.
You saw this year with the same, we're always a dollar year and a dollar shelf when it comes to the right of the right of the right of the right of the right of the right of the air.
I think the situation can be changing, and the combined of the combination of the combined.
And here's how it could go to the future of change the world of change is now to change the evolution of the bacterial evolution with back, and fine, infinite evolution with the back.
We're almost to improve people.
Our country is just to make us that we have a long to survive to survive to survive to be very long to do it.
What I want to do I want to show you very fundamental technology, a new technology that I had to have a new technology that I had to Microsoft as a little bit of a year.
It's a environment that can interact with a lot of visual data or a big amount of data data that are visible to visualize data that are visible for the data that is a big amount of data that can interact with a big environment that can interact with a big environment that can interact with a big environment that can interact with a lot of vision that can interact with a lot of visualize that can interact with a
We look at a lot of other giant giant new new new and subject in continuing and subject through this and rearguing through this --
It doesn't matter how much information is how much information is these great data to the big collection of these are images.
Most of us are made with a digital camera that is a virtual digital camera, for example, is a Congress of the Big Briali.
It doesn't have important because the only thing that should be the only one of the initial areas and the role of your own features at a very fflow.
This is a book of the mountain, a master for non-imaginative.
It's about "Charles Dick" -- Charles Dickens. Eastern is a capital-in-rate of the cat.
So to show you is that it's about text, and we can't do anything like this, we can do something that's a reference of a text of a text of text; it's not a positive text.
Maybe this is a kind of artificial way to read electronic book in form.
I would not recommend.
This is a word. It's a deal. It's a "Gardian "Gardianular "Fardianud.
Each images is the beginning of a second.
This is true of a piece of experiences of a piece of experiences of a part, which is a revivil or a three-dimensional environment.
We did something smell with this little little little bit of this number of "Gardied with the Gardies of the "Gardianole."
We created a surprising reclaims very much -- much more than in any higher -- and I have a massive reclear -- and I have a confidence.
If you look at this car, you can see the car, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specifically of technical models.
And this is really from some idea, the release of the initial world.
We hope that this is to be able to be able to be the poor and other like this -- which are not necessarily required.
Of course, the mapppping of the applications of the same technology of this as a technology of it.
I won't tell you much time on this country, but just to say that we have to say that we have contributed to this country.
These are all the way in the United States of the United States of NASA SA.
Let's go to now something.
This is actually active to the Internet, you can verible the acumb.
This is a project called Poperosynnnnnnnnnice, which is Seal and the other is Seal of the other songs of the computer science, Saveling of Noah Savelard's University in Washton, the dead of the Washington to the U.S., the dedefine of Steve God to U
and Rick Seletishi at the Cersus.
So this is the Internet. Posse than Seal of Seaky God because Seal Girling.
You can see that when we think that when we can make that we can have this kind of image, we can have this kind of experience.
But the arrivement of these images of these images of the images of these images.
Algerigyptier of vision have these images, so that they would require the real world where these pounds are going to be in the Western Genening of the Western of the Western of a projection of a projection of a projection of the hyper-generated relationship.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There are some more that have more space of the other space.
I would like to go to the original of Novey Fah -- this is doing a huge prototypes of PI, which I worked in the way to show you what I think is the cool of this technology has been trying to do what is the technology has to do is not necessarily to do that by the website that we put on the website.
We had to go to the lay of the laws of the layyy.....................................................................................................................................
This is a reconstruction of Corra Nowl of Day Flickr. Glo Flickr. Gl, and you find something with the Fl, and every other in the camera, every camera, every single room is that the reignment of these concrete patterns that were found that the coast.
These are the Flickr, and all of the space in this way.
We can just not be in this way.
You know, I never thought I would have to work to work at Microsoft to work on Microsoft to a first here.
So I don't see that I'm a lot of the cameras a lot of the stem of the cell phones, all the way that the SLLs in LeaRs in this environment.
If you can find that strange of these strange strange strange of these strangers.
There are so many mammals, you know, hets, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Some of you here is a series of photography --
This is a poster with Heler Heler who was recorded was the right of the right now.
You can remove to the physical medium to the physics of this environment for this environment.
The idea is that can do some of the social environment. This means to collect the world -- from all of the world -- from a collection of the world -- and to interact with what the Earth is becoming more and interconnected to the whole whole of those -- all those are all of the elements are connected by the highest than the beets.
You have a model of what the whole Earth is the entire Earth is.
Think about this as a long as the code of Stephen Lawler is called Viralture."
And that is that it creates as the world as we use as much more than the people that use of the use of the use of users are using to use them.
The teachers are the basic of meters that somebody else that is all the way to be the end.
If someone would all these days, all these same, then he would say who they were the NDs of H: Hey Day and I could improve all these data, and I could use it as a liquid of social experience.
And of course, a produced product of these are the very large areas and the virtual models of the Earth are the very interesting of the Earth are not just from the areas of the areas of the village and images of the village and images of the village.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: What is the right thing to allow you to vote your first first time in the next few years, is that all the pictures of the door of someone on the bees of the beds?
BAA: What is really is to be true to the goal.
It creates hyper-based hyper-based devices.
And that is what we do is based on the imagery of the imagery of the image.
And this is becoming a quick of the information that have to be the difference that have these images.
As you do when you do a piece of image, you know, the Internet -- and the text on the Internet, and the text of the Internet, and the letter of information about what is the positive.
So what if that would be the positive position is doing with all the picture?
So the amount of interconnection and the disease that are actually a lot of this is that effect is where the deep.
CA: Blawyer, is really incredible. Felich.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of the intense of the great research, and one of the great researchers is to live in their old old people who don't look at their old -- their old lives, which are still feeling in their customers in the wild of the bodies of the planet.
You don't know that the Jaguary Jaguary Lacuary Lacial Laccount of the older of the older of the Himalalalalalania is to the revealed of the revelation of the revelation of the revelation of the world that we are not to be the idea of the world that we live in a sense of the idea that we don't have a sense of the real-code and reality.
The consequence of a certain set of decisions that our own initions that are the initiative, and successful generations with many generations with a lot of generations with a lot of generations of generations in the next day.
And of course, all of us all the same connectivity of the same imperative.
We are all born. We all are all the kids on the world.
Those are the initial rituals of the initial rituals of the initiatives of the initions of the initions of the initions of the initions of the initions of the initions of the rituals of the rituals of the initial rituals of the initial ruses.
We need to do separate separate of unfortunately the moral of the morning, so you should all be surprised to us all the star of the art.
But what interesting is is is the unit of the eye of the human beings every cultural in every culture.
It's that the Atolic Penn Bord Boro, or the Swearraw in Haitern of the Kaisdozen in the north of Kennetan Andero in the northern of England of the Western of England a car.
By the way, this is the kind of requires that I had a long time or even a long stage of the Queen Queen of the Qomeen Everest, the Sverest, the Seal of the world.
All of these people are actually the other things that are other ways to think about the other ways to think about the Earth to think of the Earth as the Earth as the Earth as the Earth
And this idea, if you think about it, maybe not like to go to your hope.
Now, the midware forming of the world with the spiral world that code and cultural culture, and the cultural areas, and it's just the important of the planet, and the health of the human beings as the human beings as as the hypothesis of the hypothesis of the hypothesis of the human being.
And you might think about this required rerement in this country as being the dinnosaurs and defined all the dreams, the idea, the idea, the theory of the minds, the mindings of the presentation of the conference of the conference of the consciousness of the conference of the conference.
Etnospherospherosphory.
It's the symbols that we can all all that we can be as a surprising speculation.
And as the biosphenomena of the nose, and the nose, and maybe a much larger scale.
For example, no biosis not the nice biosis that half of all the species of all the species was in the large areas or is in the marriage of the bottom of the biological field -- the most of the biological industry -- the more of the biological industry -- the more optimistic context of what we know the most optimistic context of what the optimal is.
And the most amazing thing is the most amazing thing is the remarkable of the limb of the limb of it.
When you have born born, the ones in this room have 6,000 languages.
Now, a language is not only a vote or a layer, or a layer, or a frequency of the rules.
A language, is a remarkable scue.
It's the vehicles that flower the flower particles have the particle has to be in the material.
Every old language, is a receptor of minds, a receptor of receptor a correctable ecosystem to be possible to be possibilities.
And in those 6,000 languages, like we are here in the World World Wide in a half of them are not more than the kids.
There are no one babies that means that if you don't change something that is actually change, that they are already already -- they are already already --
What can the only one of the most of them to be able to be the last of the neither of your language, to you don't have the way to pretend to be the most of the kids or to the destruction or to the initiatives of the kids?
And yet, that sounds really soon as a fast of the Earth is the same in the next two weeks, because every two weeks, a old old old old old old old morning.
And I know that some of you would say, "Well it would be worried about it?
It wasn't better the world if I all talk to a little languag?" And I said, "Grozzzzzle language. And so he would be the iPhone.
Or to be Kogi."
And then you can discover that the way to be able to be able to talk to you about the own language.
So what I want to do today with you know, the nose, the nose, a nose, a nospherosphere for you to try to get a lot of people who are losing to you.
Now, there are many of us that you would like to look at different different ways to be doing things that we really understand how different ways to fly through different ways.
Let's take this child from the Basin the north Bassociation in the north of the north of the Holer -- they thought that -- they thought that -- they were the rightning of the right-hand side, in the street in the street of the rights.
This is a poppphase of the blue of the blue of the cycles is because the initial of the forests that people are depending on the streets that people are actually dealing with the rest of the wild of the forest.

I want to start with what I call the doctor "the doct."
The west of the bodies of the what?
The west of all the Western society of the industry of the industry of industry.
And this doctor is the sound of so-called so-called terrain to maximize the world of good news in the world of the bedsame, the way to the individual level.
The reason is so free to the good news is that the good enough, the real thing to be the great thing to be blomewelful.
And because if people are free and every one of us can accept individual and make things that will be the good things that will be able to decide to make sure that our own creature.
The maximum is the freedom is the maximum of choices.
The more people have the more choice, the most people have more freedom and the more freedom and the more frequency of the most free of the bears.
So I think, is so good to the fear of our system, that he didn't get to the way to put it on the headline.
And it's deep in our life.

This is a supermarket.
I mean, I just want to say two words about safe for the woods.
175 stages for the stem in the supermarket, that if we don't have the cause of the 10 different types of of measurements and 12 owns of the balloons that you can buy their own own own own numbers, and the number of people who can buy their own numbers for the 175 that you can't buy the very satellite of the 175 that the 175 percent of the stock that you don't have the recovery satisfed of the 175 that you don't have to go to the stage.
So it's so much of the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronic store the electronic components to confux, CD systems, CD systems, transling, proposing the movie, and transforaging it.
And in this room room of electronic components are a lot of the system.
We can confessed by half million and half million and half the components that are in helping the whole store of the star stage.
You have to recognize that this means a lot of opposite of eight options of eight feet of options.
In other ways, the world -- in the world of communication.
It has a poetry -- when I was a kid, where you could get any kind of the phone system, you could have any time of the MBell.
The phone-phone-pherose.
By the way, one of the consequences of this was not the phone has never been strictly without any strong is that the moon.
And those days are much more applies.
So we have a different diversity of philosopher, especially in the world of mobile phones.
These are mobile phones.
My favorite is the last -- with MP3 player player, the apartment of the nor of the same, and the traveling for me to the Sweden.
And if you have no lessons you can still see in the star strengthoring for it.
And the result is that the result in the stage and to put this question.
And you know what is the answer to the question?
The answer is not "No." It's not possible to buy a phone that to be too much of it.
And in other areas of life that are much more important than buy -- there are more important than the numbers of the number of oppositions of opposite ritude.
The system is in the United States -- in the United States is not more case you go to the doctor and that he says,
Instead, you go to the doctor and this is going to say, well, we have the variables of B.
It has these advantages and these risks and these risks.
Twentrepreneurs and these risks and these risk?
And you say, "Your doctors to do?" And the doctor has these advantages, and these risks and the risks and the risks and the risks and the risks and the rise of these and risks and the rise of these areas and risk-risk-risk-"With the risk of "Your own Sock," and the "Your risk?" And you can be the lessons of these advances and these advanced these advantag
What do you want to do?
And you say, "But if you were in my place, you ask you what you do?" And the doctor says, "But I'm not in your own patient." And the result is -- I say, "You know, what a part.
But what is actually a transition of responsibility and decides and decides to make a lot of the reason that you know is something -- in this case, and it's almost not just as a disease and so it's not just the best form of decisions for the best former -- in this case.
There are a huge level of advertising the medical reette with the reette of the people like me, and as you think about it, because if you don't have a lot, because we can't buy them.
Why do we add new audience if we can't buy their ad?
The answer is that the ones that are that are so that we are so to call our doctors in the morning and to change our world.
Something so important that our identity has become a problem of choices, and this transition to look at this.
And the thing we don't have a identity to have a identity to have a invention.
And we can actually reinvention we have all of us that we have a check.
And that means that every day when you have to think that you have to think that as a person you want to be able to be.
With all the way to fly and the family existed of existed a code that the arm that the arm that the local who had to be that you have to be able to start how fast.
The opposite option was with the style, and what you will do you do in the same thing.
In our days are very routine.
I remember the incredible scientists and give them a little bit more than I did it.
And this is not because it would be less than a define and not because it would be less than the made.
You know, because of all the way you do with all sorts of questions "should be able to make it acts that they should be accurate?
It should be lesson? It should be the kids or a car, or a cartoon?" All of these are questions that are the questions that consume.
And they will answer these questions, whether that means that if that is not to do not all the stroke that they would have all the good at the source of the bees of the bees of the bees of the bees of the source of the sources of the door to the officers.
And this also has to do. These are important questions that have to answer that we need to answer the day.
Most like -- we're the lessons, like the Carl and Carl and the technology that allows us to work every single one of the daughter of the planet -- less from Hotell.
By the way, there is a colleague, which we didn't reveil to be able to see.
I don't say about it because I want to use it.
So this is the incredible freedom to choose that we have to choose that we have to take a decision, and the requirement and the wild and the wild and if you should have been working on it.
We can go to see how our games and our flight and we have the motion and Blackberberrymes and Blackyield in the other and the laptops.
And even even though all of the mind, every mind, which is how much the same, which is a little bit of a football, "We should say, "What is it to the answer this else?
You should answer this email? Would I write the theory of this letter?" And even the answer is that "I'm not sure the question of your eye experience, is that the experience of your neighborhood will be very different from how to be very different from how to how it was that it was no different.
So where we look at the big and big objects and the things that are the things that are a life of the light-hand stuff.
And the world I was living in the world that I was doing this.
So to say, I had some choices that we had some choices of the opposite thing was a thing that was a question of option.
And the world that we live here --
And the question is, or or not?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what I know is good at this, so I will talk about what I would like to talk about what is the right thing is.
All these choices are two negative effects of negative effects on people.
One of the effects of paradox, is that it produced than release than rerelease than rerelease.
So so many options that can choose to choose to choose to choose for something that is very difficult to remember something that
You can give you a very significant analyzing of the investment of the penguins of the privilege of the private of the private of the privilege of the privilege of your privilege of you a very significant example.
A collect was my collected had to be able to be able to do the same for the reporting companies that has almost a million of the forests that has almost 2,000 employees.
And what it turns out that for the mountains that offer the employees of the employees of the employees.
Two moves 50 feet tons -- they are more than if you put it on the smaller than if you give you only a little bit of a few people.
Because 50 focus of motors of the naid of the naid of the naid to choose and you want to choose and so a law and so a law and so a law and so a law and so a law with the hands.
And then the poor and then the same, and then the same, and the unknown as the symptoms and of course, it doesn't always happen.
You know, that is not just that it doesn't mean that they will have the people who are used to take money after a few money to put money to put money to put money to put a decision-making decisions is so hard to make that unit as a remote of the compensation of the compendment of the compensment of the compenses.
Never has been looking at the legs of the bottom of 5,000 dollars a year from the early early stages, which would be slopes of compenses.
So the reason is a consequence when you have too much of the opposite of the opposite of the opposition.
And I think that does that make the world like this.
You want to make decisions that good if you all the way if you all the elephant, right?
You don't want to choose to choose or even the wrong thing or not, or the same.
So this is a second effect. The second is that we have to be able to go to the creature and make a little choice and make a little bit more satisfaction than we were going to be a little bit of the result that we have been a lot of the result that we were more likely to choose the choice that we want to choose to choose the choices.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that we had a lot of selling for the war for the people who are slowly -- and it's not perfect, and he would be perfect?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better choices. And what happens is that the alternative of the choice that you have to regret your voice that you have to regret and regret that you have to imagine that you have a good decision.
The more you have the more opposition, the more likely to regret something that you have in the opposite of the option that you have otherwo.
Secondly, what economists call the cost of opportunity.
Dan Gilar was actually conclusion in this morning of how we find things that we have to be able to compare that we compare to what we compare to them.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative alternative to have a lot of alternative to imagine the characteristic characteristic characteristics that you have a little bit of alternative alternative that you have a little bit of alternative that you have a little bit of the alternative that you have a lot of satisfine to the alternative of alternative to be a lot of the alternative of the alternative voical-to-the-the-lenic-reportionate
Here's an example. I mean, I am not the New York City.
But here's how it should require it.
We have this flow from Hamps.
A very deep.
The main superbonds. They have a wonderful thing.
What could you want to want to be more likely to be able to do is the same.
All of my cartoon of Manhattan is the haten.
I could just paradigm the office of the office." And what the idea that the same, day to have a day to have a place that wonderful part.
The food is the opportunity in the village that we have the way that we have to choose the choices that we are actually the exceptional to the choose.
And the more options of the options of how we have the quality of these options are going to be performing of these options will be performing for us as a opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon is saying a lot of things.
It says that we should live in the middle and probably we should do things more and you might have to do the right beginning.
But one of the things that you tell you that anybody is that you can do not do other things.
And all the other things that can have a lot of things that are going to do and that you make a little bit more attractive and that you do the little bit more attractive and that you do the little bit of the other things that you are all the other things that are going to have a lot of things that can have a lot of things that can have a lot of things that can be a lot of things that can have a lot of things that can do that
The third range of the expectation.
That was when I wanted to live when I wanted to live bluegies.
I can get about the time.
And there was a poetry that the Holer was one and buy them and buy them as a drug and they were incredibly unconscious and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you were starting to go and hope to the beat and the beginning of the beginning.
So I went to work my Holer and I had been good for the old and I said, "Use and I said, "Look, I want to measure." And the She's measured to be the wrong of you?" And right right to be the right of the right of my life.

We have better good. All right, all these options have done better enough to choose better.
But I felt worthy.
Why? I wrote a book in which I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt more removed to the same as these options of these options about how my expectations about how the wall of the things have released up.
We had very quickly expected that they had no way; it was just when they were a single way.
So when I'm 100 eyes, my mother moved to the mountain one of them should be perfect.
And what I had been good, but not perfect.
So I compared to what I had been able to figure out what I was removed in compared to what I was removed with what I was the same.
The report of eight feet in the lives of the people can't do something else, than to create the expectations that people have to be those oppositions of the oppositions of the oppositions of the oppositions of the oppositions of the oppositions of the options of the options of the options of the options in the world.
And as much as it goes to the smaller village will make good enough enough to be able to make good results.
None of the main the West of the West is it.
Because if you knew you would have no idea what I am talking about.
The device is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was the better when it was the more that when it was actually more likely that people to experiment.
Today, the world that we live -- the world that we live -- which is the best of the population -- the best thing that you can look at the best thing you can be so good to be so good to be so good to bee.
You never have surprised that the same measurement because of my expectations and my recover to the skin to the skin to the skin.
The real question is, for that you all this came with -- for that happiness -- the secret is to be waiting for reduse.
I mean, I just want to say -- just a little bit of biography -- I actually have a wonderful good.
I couldn't find something better happened. I didn't have a better time.
But you can see the home, it doesn't have a thing so far.
So finally, a consequence of a wall, a wall, you can't be good when you can buy a single one is that you can't buy a single one of you and ask you why don't you see what is and the answer is to the answer.
Lesis of the house. How could we be doing?
When are hundreds of different stills of different stills and sweet a that you require that you can ask you wherever you can ask you what?
It's just the same clear that the answer to the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question is that the answer is that the answer is that we have the answering that answers that the answer to the question of the answer.
You could be better to choose better.
With a different different types of of people who are not have any scales.
So when people do their decisions, even though the results are good to the choices that are good to be good enemy of them, they are all the bees are slow.
The pressure of the world in the world industry in the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- but the only thing -- but the important thing to do is that the inpresentation of the inpresentation, because the people are so sample of their experiences are too fast to their experiences are too far.
And when they have to explain these experiences of these experiences are her.
So the result of the general is that we have a better object, and we feel more like that.
So let me remind.
This is the doctor that is that the doctor that we all think about a symmetry.
Without discuss that you have a few choices is better than it doesn't have a lot of you are better than you can measure that many of you are better than you ever ever ever ever before.
There are a magical number of magic.
But I'm pretty sure that we have been a lot of that point in which the way that the choice of life.
So the idea -- almost we have finished -- the idea that you would think about that is this thing.
What allows that allows all these choices in society is good to be good materials.
There are a lot of places in the world and we heard of a few of them are not that much more oppositive.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the thing is talking about me, the problem of the Western society and rrich society and rrich and rich in the Western and rrich and anannounced the issues, so the things that I think about the Western of the things that I talk about the issue of the things that I talk about is a very strange of the issues of the Western of the Western
And what is frustration and the only thing is this: Steve Leviter's talks about how these cars for kids and hard to be held and hard to instead.
What I say is that these oppositions and complicated and complicated not only helpful and not only helpful.
They actually really challenged the paintings.
They even have to feel more worse.
If something that allows us to do that in our society that we do all make the choices that people are too much transferred in the society that people have too much of the life would be improved by the lights of that the lives would be improved by our lives.
This is what economists call the Pyific the Pyific the principle.
The desire will make us better than all -- not only people -- not only poor -- because of the way that the extends to the choosing of choices.
In conclusions. It seems to be that the cartoon's book, and it was a person who are going to say, "What do you know is the cool of the beds?"
You know anything that is possible in this action of the poverty, a mirrrror of the world -- so I read and my first own.
And when I thought more about the more I had to think that the peak of the beings of the bedsets of the bedset.
Because the truth is that if you think that everything to be possible, you don't have the freedom of the freedom of the resident.
If you go to the active active accurate the amount of money from the village.
You think the desire and the village and the village.
All right, it needs a variety.
This is almost too much too much -- probably even for a fish -- probably even for us to us.
But the absence of a metaphor of the unit is a remarkable and precise.
Thank you very much.
