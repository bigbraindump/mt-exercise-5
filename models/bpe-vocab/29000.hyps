And the year we showed these two diaps to demonstrate that the entire polar to demonstrate that the city of the last three million years of the last three million years of the last three million years of the size of the marine of the march of the march of the march of the march of the two percent of the march of the second big was in a little bit of a little dirty percent of the whole die of the
But this moral mortality of this particular problem because it doesn't look at the black of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blacks.
The polar of the polar is, in a way that the global climate system,
She was extended to the bottom and the scale.
The next next slide I will show you will be a very quickly going to be a very quickly in the last 25 years.
Gheight is the steps is the marriage.
As you can see is expanded by the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of blue of the blue of blue of the blue of the blue of the

And it goes to the summer.
Asad the fecal guys, with a five or more years or more than a five or more than a body can see that it's almost like the births of a body.
In 25 years of getting from this one.
This is a problem because the death of the death of the dead of the ocean around the history of the article around the article around the article around the article of the article because of the ocean.
where the carbon is going to be the carbon fun scape, which when they dig is transformed in metan aism,
The computation of the pollution of the global crisis in the atmosphere of global warming could take this extreme if we go to this extreme point of extreme way of doing this extreme point of extreme way of the crude of the pollution of the pollution of the pollution of the pollution of the crude of the crisis.
Of course, a little bit of a little bit of Alasks of Alass is the spring-pelled metaphor.
The Katey Walter at the University of Alaska was on with a team of the Alaska a little law with another one of the other one of the past.
Ano. Oh, oh, okay. The question is if we are going to be anymore.
And a reason is that enormous "wor" is Groenland is Groenland in the northeast of the northeast of the northeast of the north.
This is a range of the year.
But the volumes are much larger.
This is Kangerlussuain the West Groenland.
If you want to know how the other people are going to make the topier of the topier of the place where it gets to the big place.
These are debt are growing very quickly.
And at the other end of the planet, Antarctica largest main of the planet.
The last people have reported as the nest as the continent of the continent is the dark is negative of the Antarctica of Englancy of the Antarctics of the island of the island of the island of the island of the island of the people are all over quickly.
This is the equal nest in the largest level, as in Genland.
In Himalaya, the main the third of the main of the nest size, the summer of the new forms of the new cycles.
40 percent of the population of the world of the world of the water in the water of the water in the water of these topirs.
Today, this guy's source is the surround of the water for this town of the house.
The dead of the ground.
But when it dies happened, the same water --
In California, there was a 40-percent of the Sierra Sierra Sierra.
This is the water spring.
And predicting, as you read it and I'm serious to me.
On the entire global near has led to a dramatic creative creditself.
And the disasters of the world have been flying with a grassround and the fall of the previous and the birth of the predatory of the predatory of the dead of the world.
four times more than the last 30 years, the 75 years of the 75 years of the year.
This is an absolutely unusual model.
If you look at the history of you can see what happens.
In the last five years we add of 70 million of pounds of carbon dioxide every 24 hours of every 24 hours every day every day every day every day of the ocean.
Up to the theme of the Pacific area of Pacification of America, and every part of the subcontinent of the individual Indian where is a radical radicallic of the ocean ocean oxygen.
The biggest because the only one of the global warming global of dead, which is the represented 20 percent of the fossil of the fossil of fossil fuels.
The peak is a problem and the goodness is the most serious of the greatest one.
The U.S. is one of the two big emits, of China.
And the proposing was to build a better marker for the car.
But we start to see a all change.
Here's the people who have been ased in the last few years with the ecological alternative alternative alternative to the same
All right, there was a fight of our policy.
And the carbon industry and the oil, and the oil, a billion dollars in the last year,
promoted what is a forest of what is a forest of the town of the tooron.
This image of something like this.
In the Cracial Cracial Lenness, a billion, a billion, a billion-star cartoon's been improud of the book was improud of the Cracial charge.
You've probably seen it at stirs.
This is, the whole big fish, the second big deversaries in America has happened in America has happened in the Cracial Span.
One of the reclaims of the cartoons, was about the Cracial OOctober was this.
Video: â™« Frosy, the man with the car, is a flow and you see the girl and you see it.
He's from the abundance here in America, and helping to the economy.
Frosty, the gold with the car, it becomes more soon.
He's also adorable to the workers of the slubits of slue.
Al Gore: This is the key of the cartoon's sister of Virginia.
The Minner on the most graphics of Massey is the Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship: I want to be clear to be clear the Pelosi, Harry Reihabar have not about what I talk about.
Al Gore: So as Alianta for Protectia Climate Climate Climate the next campaign.
This is one of them, a part of one of them.
Video: Actor: Actortually, we see the climate change in the climate change in our businesses as a very serious three-dimensional three-dimensional threat for our business.
And that our main is to spend a big amount of money for the public for the public forces that we could help us show us the complicated to help us show the goal.
The real thing is -- in fact, the cars is not did.
We think it's a little bit -- and I was box.
So it won't be going to be the climate change.
You can get this in our way.
Video: The good coverage: Come about it.
So let's do a check of this particular case of this potty forest of the cartoons.
I send it. Massist is about the noise is pretty soon as well.
But this is the sound of technology technology that go,
And as the good cartoon is one of the main of global inquiry of global remarkable technology to the whole technology of the goal.
Up to the attack of attacks today to the cartoon the cartoon the cartoons.
Al Gore: In the advance of the alternative challenges of the economic challenges and the problem of the security of nationals.
Video: Nard: Narrator: The economy of nationality, the nationality, the crisis.
The remaining that all the way to do the whole addiction of the carbon compounds of carbon footprint on the basis of the mountainly her.
But now we have a new solution to the needle to the incurcle to the incurcle in the hour of the hour of the caves.
You may be able to get America with electricity -- in 10 years ago.
A plan to put America to the third thing, and to help us do more save us and help us to the stops and help to stop the world.
In the end, a solution that is to help us solve our problems.
You may be America. You have more than that.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: Narrator: It's about the re-energy.
One of the most quickly the fastest way to inlatural ady of the old combat our planet, the world is killed by our planet is here in the Earth: The Like is here.
Barbered to create the investment to create the good jobs to create good platforms.
Narrator: Real of America. It's time for action.
Al Gore: The Gore's an old African that says, "If you want to go fast, you want to go fast, you go away.
If you want to get back to the good!
We need to get back to the right now.
I will thank you very much.
And the year at TED I did a TED introduction to LHCHCH.
And we were promised to give you a data about how they work on their apartment.
So this is going to work. And the people who have never been here, the LHC is the largest experiment, which was the largest scientific experiment, the Cirumpy or is to recreate the recreate the previous predatory of a fear of a fear of a fear of a fear of a billion-second fe-second fish to the universe, the panish -- the panel of the universe -- the panel of the universe.
It's extremely quote.
This is the Genevelopment of Geneva.
We do photographs of these minds "Big Bangs" in the decades.
I work on this. It is called the ATLAS -- Lunged -- Lunged 44 feet diamons, a 3-foot photographer here of the ATLS here is going to see the ATLS in the building will look at the proportion of the AT-ALS detect.
And the 10 years of the year I went on the first time I started the first time.
And this picture was the ATLAS was made of ATLAS.
He caused a huge celebrity in the room.
This is a picture of the first cross that quote in the LHCH.C. H.C. H.C. HC is a part of the LHC deliberately is a part of the LHC is a very detector.
In other words, when I saw that image of 10 pums that 10 pbrilliant acts that is a huge success.
I don't know that if this was received the largest own, or this is going to go on the Google and he saw the first page of the first page of it.
It means I have a cultural impact on the law of the impact of the science of the intelligence.
And then about a year I had a problem with the machine, which actually had to do with these days, and he had to do with these days.
Those are a transportation of 13 thousand the work of the mountain the mountains to the maximum of the power of the power of the moon.
Now, engineers in the back of the door and said, "You can't transport the attempt to the amps. They're beet."
But I can do this because when they're at the temperature of the temperature of the superconductive flow.
So as a 271 degree of house, and the hospitals of the strength of the strength can transport that way.
At one of the laws of the ones in the 9,000 LHC, was a define of factory in the factory of facility.
So as the company was a little bit of the 13 ampigs, and those 13 ampions have innation.
This was the result.
This is more impressive, as they are being spened over 20 tons and moved over 30 pounds of ton, and they moved to 30 miles.
So I have a little bit about 50 magnetic main here.
We had to take the end, what we have to do.
I reconcusion, I repair and I repair
And now we go to the subterm and then in the subterm.
And the end of the March of the LHC will be like new LHC will be like new as well.
We're going to start to start on again, and we get the data in the hulia, and we're going to keep the research and we will continue to find out that are the elements of the universe.
Now, of course, that in a way, those accidents of the fact that the important thing about the important thing about the extreme of the extreme is going to get to the extreme to break it.
I think that the fact that it's so much like this is so difficult to have the fact that we have young people like LHC.
I'm going to leave the words of a man of a British man in the British Humphrey Davy, I think of the nest experiments of the protection of the protection of the protection of the protection of human beings are not more dangerous to the progress of our minds are not the real progress of our minds are not the mystery of the human beings are not the convictim and as a lot of natural detering are not the world and as a few are not going to be over."
Thank you.
I would want to remind you to remember the kids, when you were playing with the board.
And as you invest to get them to get them up and get them to the waste and get them to the way to get them to the way to get and sold and solving the other way to be intelligent and manipulate relationships.
The vision of the hospitals is the law of how we understand a big part of the world of the inconclusion.
So, in the quality of IT as a re-inspired IT by the interaction of our physical objects, and the physical objects of my physical goods, and my collaborator and my collaborator -- I was trying to use a computer -- I was trying to use a computer -- I would be able to use a computer to do a computer a computer -- I would have a computer that would be a little bit of digital tricky to be a little bit of the demanding to the way to treat and watch and then we could have both avoid and get to the deeply to the inter-informed to the inter.
Warn how do we want to now?
And this question was so fascinating by the fascinating thing that I was going to try to build Sissets of Sttable to build Sisset.
And as a short of a Siftable computer, is a way of interacting a bism.
They can be a remarkable to be perceived to the reef, they can perceive the other their, and they have a screen and a radio wireless and a radio wireless of a wireless wife.
The most important is that it's palpable, like the game, you can just play them as a missed as they just get them to watch them.
And Sifs the example of an example of an ecosystem to be a new tool.
On the main of the devices become more palacably, their mission of their mission of the other consistence, and the consistent of the nutritions of the nutritions and destruction of our nutracks and fun to interact with interaction.
I'm going to start with simple.
This Sifer is confident is to present picture, and if you include the movie stand a strength of the other part, if you include the other part, they move back to the other part, they get back back back.
These are the interactive of the other ones are a whole.
So, if I put them one of the other langle of other, they become interesting to it.
If they are inconfident will be a little bit of it, and they can be a little bit of confused to be a little bit of confused to be a little bit of confusion.
I can also feel like the mission and inclinic.
We realized that one of us that one of the interaction of interactions is that we can use the same way to manipulate the data, how we could have the same culture as we would have a cold of a light-to-to-the-to-the-the-the-the-co-to-
In this case, we have three Siscotton as the museum and they can use them to the color of the color in the center, where they will be amongst in the center, where they will be fun of the center, where they want to be filled to the end of the day,
If we could get too much, we can take a little bit of back.
There are also interesting possibilities for education, how would be games of education, mathematics and logical music, mathematical and logical things that we want to have the possibility to see the results in the immediately and see the results in the immediately of the immediately possible.
So here I -- this is a Fibonacy, which is doing with a simple program that I do with a simple program --
Here's a game game game of the words of the words of Scrabs and Boggles and Boggles.
So in every single single single first of all, in every Siftag, and the main every Sif, and the main the main of the words, they're very great, they are grew with a dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds of the same way that he resides the letter of the letters and we have a new set of blind.
Thank you.
These are the kids who came to the cure of the Media, and I went to the Media, and I went to the Media, and I was going to filmmake.
They like the crazy.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of application is that you have to do a lot of people who are many people in the structure.
Everything you need to say is "From the word to do it.
Here's people who are other people who are going to get it.
This is the most tangible testing of our right right in the right,
It seems like everything wanted to do was to do was to do one of the Siftable to do the other ones.
So for him were just a customers.
This is a animal applicatory of animal animal animal --
We wanted to build a tools for those who invest to the language of the language of the language.
And this is Felix.
He can introduce us to the stage in the scene, just the rainforests of the Switzerlands that they are the person.
So here is the sound.
Video: The race.
David Merrill: Now he introduced a stage in the scene.
Video: Tractor of the portrayer.
Very of yes.
Missties and you see one of the langer and the langer can make the characters of the shape of the shape -- Video: Wideo: Ham!
DM: It makes the narrative.
Video: Hello.
DM: It's a final story with open, and he decided, and he decides the sun will be debt.
Video: Her peak --
DM: The last example I would look at today is a thing that I was an instrument and interpretty, and the interpretation and the interpretation of the sound of the sound of sounds like the role and all of the sound like baggas and all of the sound like baggas and all of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound that we were going to be a rit
Each of these four different variations of different variations that you want to use it.
And you can get the sound of a succession that you can have a good job at the time you want.
The sound goes up the sound of the sounds of sounds of a sounds of successful of success.
There are effects that you can control the poor control, like the reverberal and the film.
You can see a certain point of a certain sound and then includes it.
The next general effects like the general effects and the volume that are the volume of Hill to see the His to see the His to see
Video: DM: And I was going to start with a second Siss of success, we were in the last serious amount of serious and we were in a serious amount of time and we have a rital.
Now I'm now I'm a basic line.
Video: DM: Now add to the dangerous dangerous.
Video: So now I'm going to add the top, to control the top, to control the effect of the effect of the effect of the light.
Video: DM: You can get the entire venture of the inclinic in a part of a part of a part of a part of a or elephant or else:
Video: I will now go to the movie for a more expression.
Video: YM: You can do it for the long time.
So I don't have to do the planet, they can improvise, they can improvise, or a shorter of the worth of the word.
Now, in the end, I can get to the Swe'd get to use the Sisscscar of the volume of the volume of the volume.
Thank you.
As I was a little bit of the passion is the interface, the computer that is the way to get better with our brain.
And today, I had time to show you a coordinate of this new hospital of design, and some of the possibilities that we were trying to get them from the lab.
The Ganda who would want to retinder is that we are at the new generators of interacting with the digital interaction with the midst of interacting with the middle of the rules of our rules of the rules of our rules of rules
I will thank you very much.
These episode nervous nerve to all of you.
I'm written out.
He wrote the book is my teaching is my teacher, but of course, more likely to be so much away.
It's my mother, my mother's all fascinatory and fascinating a life.
And I don't have this kind of thing to change it.
But these were like, something like a little bit of a long way to the meat and in my career who was trying to recycled me to require my job to work.
And the strange thing is that I wrote this book for the "Manancient mography of "Manan" -- the Roager Roager Ragest, which is the most of my career than a very reasonably, and became a very important point of every other person who was so important, and he became this important mega-sensitive megathered to a international sense of international concept of this international medital.
The result is like where I go now, people go now, people are going to be dead.
Serios -- I was confused to be dead.
Vides of example, you have the wrippped -- you don't think it's the theme that you haven't going to be a little bit of the performance of that?
Don't you go to the time to write to the whole life of the daughter of the fall of a book that will ever be able to the world that ever get the world of this ever going on the world that ever do that?
It's very lined line.
But it was also a little bit more and I didn't know that 20 years ago when I started to marriage -- I started to marriage -- I want to get the people -- I want to become written by the same kind of red, I was a kind of a way of re-based reaction on the same side.
And people were saying "Don't be a little bit of this time would have never been going to be any success?"
I don't know that humans do the reject will be killing your ideas?
Don't you do is going to work in this field of life and nothing will be in this field, and nothing will be here and you will have a dead of a dream of dreams of the flagh of the gas of the fecal flow of the screen of the screen?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the short answer to all those questions is """"""""Wa."
Yes, you have a little bit of all these things.
And I always reached me.
And you have a little bit of the things that people are not going to get them to the nacive them.
As a great example of the marriage, and other things that are crossing.
But when it's about the work that I always thought I was all the time I was all the time I was like, "Why?"
Is it something rational?
It's the logic is to do that anybody to be the work that they feel like they were destined to do this Pame.
And what is so that it's attached to the creative of what it seems to us is true, and in a healthy health care in a way that other teachers don't do it?
My father was my chemical engineer was a chemical and not recently as the 40 years of you have a chemical chemical to be asking it to be asking him if not a chemist.
It wasn't happened, John, how does the steager the chemical blocks?
It just doesn't happen.
But as a chemists, the chemists, as a group of chemists, and they have too much more to be alone of the reputation to the other depression.
We were written in the reputation, and we have this reputation, but not only written the everyday of all the sample of all the way to be strong.
And everything we have to look at is to look at the numbers of the mortal -- in the 20th century, in the 20th century, and in the 20th and often in the summer and often died by young and often died by the light-hand side.
And even these things that didn't have to be done, and it was really excited by their own lives.
Norman Mailer, even before I was in the last time that I said, "Each of my charges told me that "Each me a little bit more than I had a little bit more and more and more of my cart."
A great great great great thing about the work of a minute.
But not the time we hear when we hear someone told us that I heard that I heard these things like these things that we have all the way and somehow we have the complete and the idea of the collective and the idea of the collective and the idea of the creativity of the creativity, the idea of the pursuit will always lead to the end of the end of the worth of the habit.
And the question I want to do that I want to do all of you here -- you know, you're all the idea?
You are comfortable with it -- because as the eye of the eye -- I don't think of the eye of the eye of the hypothesis of the same.
I think it's like it's like this.
And I also think it's dangerous and I didn't want to see it in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage to the marriage of artists.
And I know that I know -- in my case, in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start to go to the neighborhood of this one of the circumstances of this consistent to the circumstance.
As for example, I'm pretty tank, I just have a 40 years.
I would probably be able to be four decades.
And it's very likely to write the end of what I'm going to be judged by the time that the work of the first time of my footage of the last few my footprint, right?
What would be saying to the men, because of the same as a whole of those of us here we are already friends, and the largest success of my greatest successful to be happened.
Oh, Gam!
This is the kind of gas to look at the end of the housin the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I want to do this message that message that message that I love it.
And then, the question earlier, right?
And so I was sweating, as a lot of meditation, that I need to work now, to try to write a kind of a way to try to create a kind of a way to create a kind of a drug of protective production, right?
I had to find a way to find a way to go to to the claim a safe, and my father who was writing, and my graduate was going to be before I was going to be before I write the reaction to what I write to what I write to what I write to what I write to what I write to what I write to what I write to what I write
And as we all went to the last year in this sense, I started looking at the time, and I tried to find other society to find other society to find other society to get better ideas, if you could have better ideas to be helping people to be helping people to be helping people to be held to be helping people to be helping people to be helpful to be helping people to be held to be helping people to be helping people to be helping people create the people to be helpful to be helping people to make sure how to be better
This is the research has been taken me in Greece, and Roma and Rome.
So you get the circle of the circle is the same.
But in my Grection and Romers and the Romers are not that people who didn't think the creativity of the human being being in the human being?
People thought that the creativity was a spirit was a disruption of people who are going to be in a surround and unintelligence and unintelligence and unintelligent and uns.
The solutions were called these spirits of creatures are helping to the terrorists with the terrorist "profound the terrorist."
Socrats was fairly because he thought he had a department that has a department of the department.
Roman were the same pared, but they were called that creative, the imattractive creativity.
What is wonderful because the novels were not believed as a very much as a black genius.
They thought a genius was a kind of magical entities that are actually going to be the effective of the wall of the way that Dobby, as Dobby, the snape, the snasy of the work that the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the workers of the work of the work of the work of the work of resident.
Absolutely -- this is the distant that is the distant that I was talking -- that I was talking about the results that we were going to protect the results.
And all the world has been working on the way that they have done, right?
So the artist's artist was protected by some of the things like too narcises that too much narcisely narcisely not?
If your work was stralucita, you couldn't get the whole thing for her, all the world of the world as you had this genius as the trest as a tryh of the world that has been held to be held of it.
If your work was criticism, it wasn't completely the house, right?
Everybody has the world as the gene was a little igning.
So they looked at people in the West creativity, for a long time.
Then he came to Renasting and everything was changed, and it was a particular idea of the main the top of the universe as the man of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe that they receive the stability to create more mystery to the debate that to the diving.
It was the beginning, and the people started to create the creative that the creation of the creation of the individual of the individual of the individual people.
And for the first time in history of people have started talking to one or one of the other artists, instead of gender, instead of the genius.
And I have to married, I think that was a huge error.
If you think about a simple person, a simple person, and he is actually the receptor is actually the receptor and the strength and the sun and the mysterious surgery, cre, creative, creativity is a little bit too many of the myth of the Min's psychology.
It's like you have a little bit like the so-called hitchen sound.
And they just define and deforms and the gene of the houses of all these these these things that are over.
I think that the pressure of this is killed one of the last 500 years.
But if it's true, I think that is, what do we do the question is, what do we do they do?
Can we do things differently?
Maybe we go back to the higher sensations of the relationship between people and the creative and the mysterious myself.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't just want to stand for 500 years of the rational thinker in a 18 minutes.
And you may find out that in the audience that would be absolutely asking the question of the questions of the novels of the people present the people press and they are all over and over the course of the projects and all the time.
It probably doesn't want to be cooption to all this idea.
But the question I want to ask is -- why not?
Why don't we think about that?
Because it has a long sense, as I heard something else I've heard about how much I heard about the explanation of the entire creative process.
The reason why anyone who was trying to make something -- very -- the fact that it is that it is not behavior of the one of the range of the one of the range of the range of the range of the cross-gray that anybody has ever been trying to do something --
And in fact, sometimes it can be the strength of the paranormal.
I had a little bit of the way I met where I met the American Man American American Ruth who was now in the '90s and who was the poetry and the poetry and the story and who was told me when the child was the strength and he told me that he told me that he told a poetry and get a little sympty and I just heard a poet and he just heard a poetry and get heard a poetry and a poetry and get heard of the poet and
The story was like a sample of the ants of the air.
And it was the way of all the campaign.
The feeling the sea sounds like the falls of the fish under the leg.
In that moment has one thing that has one thing to do, and that I read the alery as a applicator.
And the way to the earth to the marry of the marriage of the stage was to get to a very quickly and a little bit of a fast piece of map and to get it through the main and to get it through the main and to get it on the map.
Sometimes it was not enough enough to be a little bit of the run, but they weren't going to the house, and he wants and the poetry and the poetry and the poet and the poetry and the poetry and "another poetry on the road of the road of the room.
They were the moments that -- and this is not going to look at the moments of that story as a almost unbelievable.
The death home, the house of the main and the poems and the earth and the earth and the strength and the story of the other person and the story of the other man and the other man and the story of the other man's and the other man's going to be able to the other and the other too.
The main of the code and the law and then it on the core of the surface of the math.
In this case, the strength of perfect and unexpected and unlike the naselse, but on the first worst of the worst of the worst word.
When I was hearing -- it's just the right way to get the right of the creative process of creative.
My design design design doesn't really matter to that -- I'm not lead to this -- I'm not lead.
I'm a way that I'm working on the way to go every day every day and I would go every day and to transparent and to go and trick.
But even though I was like, I was my had, and I was so much to have that phenomenon.
And I imagine that as much as many of you have been and many of you.
And I was a project that I had projects or ideas that they were not to know that they don't know that I don't know to be able to identify it.
And what do you do that?
And how do we should report that we should report that we don't lose our minds, the right thing we don't lose our husband and the disappeal to the dissemin?
For me, the most relevant example of how we have to do is how we can do is the musician of Tom Waits, we took a time to be a time in the review, I took a couple of years to the review of the review.
I was talking about this subject and all of this was almost all the way to the end of his contemporary artist's contemporary of the Chinese contemporary of the Chinese and gestures and gestablished and gestures.
And by the time it was enough, and the story of the story as a day as a day of the dead of the Los Angeles and then everything was changed.
As a short time of a short fragmented a short fragmented piece of the piece that comes in the mind, as the magician and the magical and the earliest and a long way to the end, it's not the way to get the back, but he didn't have to go away.
It has no one hour of main of math, no reportof.
The tool of that the old old anxiety of the time to lose the moments, and the story of the story of the man to always have this for always a money for always to always one.
I'm not enough to requir, a redg."
And instead of the spinal and just stop.
He stopped the process and he did something with something and everything and everything else.
He was looking at the skin and said, "You know, you don't see that I'm at a volan?"
"Can you write a little bit like a track of a crum?
If you want to truly exists, back to a moment when I can do it in a little bit of you.
If you don't have any other thing to do is anything.
Get and you get to the Leonard Cohen."
The truth process, the truth of this.
not the opera is not going to be able to be the same way that always happened.
But the process of it, and the dead process, and he went around and around the moment he took the same, and he was the same, and only because he was to his way to get the road and he gave her the way to come back and where he didn't have to be something that has to be something attached and Chinese and Chinese and Chinese and Chinese and China.
It could be this collaboration and the wonderful and the bizarre in the form of a conversation in the exterrorista, the external ability that wasn't going to be too much like Toman-man.
And after I heard the story of what I was trying to change a little bit of the way I was going to be a data.
This approach me to save me when I was at the middle of "Manan," and I was the Roaged in a kind of case of the disappearing in which we all of the disappears, and I was going to be a disaster and to think of a disaster to be a disaster to be a disaster to be a disasted disaster to be a deeply to be a re-like this proposition of "
Not just the most profound this book but the most propositive.
I was just going to think that I should just abandone.
And I remembered Tom and I was talking about the open and I asked the open, and I was trying to get it.
I went to the next to the manuscript and I brought my comments to a cameras a colleagues of the camera.
I told you the voice of voice, and I know if you know that if this book is not going to be the great thing is going to be the great thing to be the end of my word?
Because you can see that one I put it on the battle on the strength of the strength of the beach, and more than that.
So if you want to be better and to be better and do you need to do your own six.
Okay, if you don't do it, you know, you know, something, to the naid everything.
And one thing to write because this is my message.
And I want to consign for me to my third six."
Because -- the Conclusion -- -- with hundreds of years ago in the North African people have had to get the poor people to get the task for the tough music, and music, and music, and the musical music, and the sacred the music, and the music,
And they were always wondering, because the dancers were teaching were demarkers and were remarkable and were remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be very wonderful and they were always wondering, right?
But very sometimes it was a little bit of happens, and one of the real estate of the community of the community.
I'm convinced you all know what I mean what I mean I all of you see -- a certain point of the interpretation.
It's like the time is stopped and the dancers is through a kind of phasis not doing anything differently, in the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other size.
And in a time seems to be in the entire field.
It's gone in and gaps is the bottom is the air is the foundation.
And when it was going to be the people who were known to call it as well.
And they were the left and they were going to be able to scanning the "Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, Gamh, Game, Game, Game, Gamour."
It's God.
A interesting amannounced -- when the main have been invased to the Sesieve Sief of Seses' and the pronounced in the Allaah, Allah's, Oh yh, Allah's, "Hi, the Allah."
and they hear the time of fight and the dancers and dancing and dance.
In Spanish when a was interpret and something impossible and magic and magic and the magic of "Allah, magic of the Allah, the moon, the Army voice."
Her -- a God of God -- a God of God of God of God of God of God --
It's wonderful because we need to have that.
But the side of the second day comes from the morning when the dancers is slow and discovered as the "Finally, 11 in the morning, and it's not a scale.
It's a dirty that is and that we have the genome and they could not be able to do not worse.
Would it be no one to the name of the Doman is the name of the Domnor when he was to do with the rest of his life of his life of his life of his life of saving his life?
It's wrong.
It's one of the most paintings of the most payments of creative.
But it may not be a big check if you don't think about the beginning, as the most extraordinary party of your daughter are coming from the inside of the wind of the inside of the world.
Maybe if you were just like you were imposed to be proud of a way of accountable for a few moments of life from the next to the next to the next time of the next to be more of the time they were the time to be more and more and more and more and more of the moments.
If we think that everything is beginning to change.
And so I started thinking and I thought that was sure that the last few months of things that will be published to the first steps of this application of the crisis of my strange and crisis.
And what I did -- I think of being repetuated when you lose the strength of the strength.
It wasn't the space; it's just the contain of the Contina to your party,
If you get dance, then dancing.
If the gene of the gene of what you think is repair to get the arts of the extraordinary to the art, even for a quarter of the shapes of the shapes of the "le!"
And if no, they die anyway.
And with all of these "fe."
I think in these things and I think we should pretend to pretend to have them.
"Helle!" for you, because you have a loade for the humans and the end, and the end, and the headline.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ohen: Ohen: Ohen: Ohen: Ohen: Ohen: Ole!
We talked about some of these projects, about the human genome, and what could be the fact that they could be predicted to the discover of genes.
Now in fact, since we start a new point of do: we built biology, and now we try to start to start to start to start to start to the digital and go to a new phenomenon, modeling and in a new former of biology, modeling and in a new former forms of life.
We tried to do all the time to ask us about the important questions of it.
"What is life?" It's something that I think many biologists have tried to understand the variety of variety of levels of levels.
We tried different approaches, simple approaching of life on the basic components.
We are already already about 20 years.
When I was sequenced the genome of the human genomic of the analogical world in the digital biology in the digital world.
Now we're trying to ask question: Can we regenerate the attacks, or we can create new forces in this digital university in this digital university in this digital university of the digital world.
This is the map of a little bit of a little genitalium, who has the most genome that has the smallest genomes that can replicate the only one species that can replicate in the lab.
We tried to see if we could come up with a genome and smaller genome.
We were able to get to the order, a hundred genes in the jail of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of metabolic map in compelling a very simple comparison with our way.
I think this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can surely the first moment is probably a little bit of a living.
So we decided that only was that the only way to think we actually to stand in this crosis, we can get the stomach of the most of the world's most fundamental components.
And so we started the road, "Can we stand the synthesis of a cross?"
Maybe the chemistry allows these molecules that we never haven't ever done before?
And if we can actually a cross-range of a cross?
A crosis, by the way, it's just a chemical piece of chemical material.
So, our speed speeds up to a life of the exponential rites.
Our ability to write code code that genetic code, but it was growing up.
The last time he got to get to a exponential curve to a exponential curve.
I started this more than 15 years ago.
I went through a few etheless, I started a bio-etal examination in the first time to do the first experience.
But it turns out that the Association is very difficult to be very difficult to do.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make small small DNA, long enough of 30 to 50 gaps, but it's a degenerative process, so it's a degenerative process, so why you build a long piece of error more errors with more errors.
So we had to create a new way to put these little little little together, and the right and the right of the errors.
This was the first of all, in the digital tentative, to the digital matchance of the British genome.
It's a little virus that killer human beings.
We did the piece of pieces of the strength of errors, and I got a molecule of DNA by about 5,000 little,
The interesting thing that I came when I took this piece of chemical material, and I put it in bacteria and I put it in bacteria and I was going to read this genetic code, and to produces the virus of the virus of the virus.
The viral Partics were then released in the cells and they were going to come back and forth of E.
I was going to be with the oil industry and they said that they understand that this path in the pattern.
They have more than you want to get more than you want.
And so we think this is a situation where the software can build their own madness in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the entire cross-to-of-the-the-the-of-the-the-the-the-the-term of the entire crosome of the entire crosome to build the entire crosome to build the entire crosome of the entire crosis.
This is about 580,000 liters of genetic code,
So we told me to put the letters in the red base of the size of the virus to the size of the size of the size of the size of the top of the high seas of the resident.
And the design is critical, and if you start with digital information in the computer, that information need to be very accuracy.
When I was the first time I was the first time in 1995, the standard was a choice at 10,000 of the war of the right to 10,000 of the basic base of the basis of the basis of the basic basis.
I found it in the removed to the 30-gravity sequences of the original sequence, this would never be activated.
The design is in designing is designing is the long-term that has to be a prapp with all of the other other piece of other piece of other letters to build the sub-united sub-units to build the sub-unit is to be compared to some of the other thing that we have to be compatible some of the tells of the other thing that we have to be able to be compatible with each other to the other needs to be a tel
We are just a little bit of tools.
You may read that I put the goals in the house.
Trike in those letters, those letters -- those letters about 20 amino noticed -- a single literally accounts every known of the one very proud of the bled acid.
So we can use the genetic code to write worse, the reason, the propositions of the food.
I did was to hear was the codth of the code.
Some were disappointed that it's not poetry.
We designed those joined so that we can define was with enzymes.
They're aszymous and they are doing them.
So we started to do the gentlemen, starting with five to 7,000 lets the gas to 7,000 lets these to 24,000 letters and then put it in the same way to put the steps to 70s.
Every time we were all these joined these pieces of abundance to sequence, and we try to make a very filled process, and we try to see a very roughly robust -- as you can see a very roughly the strength of the mind.
We try to get to that point of automatizy.
So this is what a basket of basketball of the baskets.
When we get to the very big pigeons of the bottom of the bottom of the basis of the E.
They are all all of modern molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecules.
So we went to other hand.
We knew there is a mechanisms called recombination of the biology that biology that biology is using DNA, and which is using DNA, and which is also enjoyable to be joined in the same way that they can do the gone.
This is an example.
There's an organism called Deinocockin which can be the weight of radio raising millions.
As you can see in the peak of sweats is destroyed.
Two to 24 hours later, he had a new lawyer at the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be often often all of it.
They can live in the lives.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the extreatment of extreatment in the extreatment of a new environment for a new environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is that this is going to be there.
Here's a micrographic micrographics that we built using these procle -- actually using these procavatar drugs with only the design of the design of the design of the pigeons that we put on the top.
Droddust together automatically put together together
This is not a picture of a microscope, but just a microscope, but only a micro-graphic to-micrograph.
This is a big molecule that we can see a microscope.
These are college in a period of about about six seconds.
This is an audience that I had a little bit of time.
These are over 58,000 letters of genetic code,
It's the largest molecule made made of people, with a definition structure of the definition.
It has a molecular molecular in 300 million of it.
If we put a founded with 10 and no space, 142 pages to the end of 142 pages of the genetic code,
So how do we start a cross? How do you get it to the do?
Evil with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria to work with bacteria
Estate, even easier when you get to the euplot, you can just take the nuclear nucle-nucle-nucle-nucle-nucle-nucle-one-to-day -- and it's something you heard --
With the archase of the cross-grade is integrated in the cells, but we showed that we can do a completely transplant to a completely transplant to a completely transplant to a cell to be able to active.
We have a crossed of a microal species of microbial species of the microbial species of the microal species of the microal species of the microal species of the microbial species of the world.
These are the second as people like people and the sample and the same.
We add some genes in the full of genes in the crosis.
I was dealing with the enzyming all protein.
And it was pretty amazing, when we put in the cell -- you will appreciate our beauty -- and the cross -- and the cross-down into the cell.
In fact, I thought this is how far it can work, but we tried to design something more and we tried to design the process.
This is a major mechanisms of evolution.
We are all sorts of species that have been to be a second crosis, or a third of the other crose, or a third of the other side, thousands of new characteristics of new characteristic characteristics in a second.
So those who are thinking about evolution as a single gene of change in the biological moments.
They're called restrices, called restrictions that were actually destrictions that were actually dealing the DNA
The philosophy who was in the cells not a one.
The Celula -- the cross-cross-on.
It was expressed and grateful the other crosome as the material, as the material as the giant material, and so we were just with the cross-up with the cross-new cross-new cross-new chromosome.
It became blue because of genes that we put in the crosis.
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristics of a species have lost a completely new species have lost in a new species on the software that we put in the software.
All of the proteins were changing, the membranes were changing, is the genetic code -- when we do the genetic code of the genetic code.
This can sound like alchemistry, but we move, we move, we move, we move, to change things pretty dramatic.
Now, we would have to be genesome is not genesis -- but to a three billion years and a half years and a half billion years and we suspect that we can be on the way to create a new version of the Cambrian of the Cambrian Arab of the digital magic of the digital projects.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty obviously of obviously of needs.
We are on the way to go from six and a half to a new billion people over 40 years.
To put this in the context for me to my receive in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for every one of us there were going to be four.
We have been sweating, providing the potty of potty disease, the compounds of six billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half of the time.
It will be difficult to do for us.
We use over five billion tons of the book, more than 30 billion of the bars of oil --
This means a hundred million bars per day.
When we try to think about procle or whatever the process that will replace to replace that, will be a huge challenge.
And then of course, it's all of that CO2 at this material, which is going to get in the atmosphere.
Now, the discoveries of our discoveries around the world, we have a data data of gene, and I love to think about these as the design of the design of the design of the design of the design of the design of the design of the future.
The electronic of electronics has just a due to a bunch of components, and this diversity that came from this.
We are limited there, in the first time, a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have the techniques of these kinds of things that we call what we call what we call the genymmetric.
We have the ability to build a big robot that to make a million a day.
When you think about the process of these 20 million genes of different genes or trying to do the opportunity to make the opportunity to make the opportunity to make pharmaceutical products, we can change the pharmaceutical -- just to do more biology than the last 20 years, we can change more biology than the last 20 years of all the way.
And this is just a standard.
We can sell for viable reasonably, production or chemical or of the fuel or of vaccines, production of the city.
This is a piece of design of an ecological design that we work that we work and work to wait and work in the computer.
You know, we don't know how it will show you.
We know exactly how they look at their genetic code of the genetic code.
Now we are now focusing on the generation of fourth generation.
You saw rectly, from the mixed is just a thing that was just a consistent experiment.
We have the second compounds of the next generation that will be able to get pretty soon as they are going to be more than the solar or various groups.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact on the food and the cost of the food cost of their own way and the revenue of the disability is if we start with CO2 is if we start with the CO2 is if we start to design to design is to design to this one go, and we think we will have the next to this one of fourth to the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth to be the same way of the next to the fourth of the way of the cost of the cost of the cost of the same same same same level
The solar and CO2 is a method -- but in our discoveries around the world have all sorts of other ways of the world have all sorts of other methods of the world have all sorts of the way of the solar and CO2 and CO2 is a solar and CO2 is a way of the O2 is a way of the O2 is a way of doing all of the way of the world is a lot of the way of our world.
This is an organism that I described in 1996.
The deep in the ocean ocean ocean -- about two kilometers and a half a million and a half of the fish, to the flow of fish,
Transform CO2 in metan for using molecular sounds like surrounding the energy of
We try to see if we can take CO2 capital that can be easily transported in the country, and converting that CO2 back to the O2 back to the base in the base in the base in the base in the base in the way to lead to the propose.
So in a short period of time, we think we could have meant the questions that is the question, "What is life?"
We really know -- we have the patent path of replacements of oil industry.
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where another thing is where another thing is the other side?
So let me get a major source of energy.
But we also work now to use these same surges to invest to the first vaccines of a simple policy.
You saw this year, we always saw this year, and we're always with a dollar in the minus of the right company of the right vaccine.
I think that situation can be change, and the combined vaccines of the combined vaccines of the time.
Here's how it could be looking to look at the future of changing the evolution of evolution, accelerating the evolution of the evolution of theater and theirs, and finally, the end, the end, the end, and finally, the end, the end.
We're almost to improve people.
Our bread, is just to make sure that we have a little bit of a little bit of a long way to survive. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you first to show you, is a fundamental work that I added up to Microsoft as part of a little bit of a little bit of a year. This is a year. This is a year.
It's a average that can interact is locking to be locked to a visual amount of visual data.
We are now looking at a lot of digital muscles and marriage of digital and marriage in the continuous rescue of the rearts of the rearts of anyway.
It doesn't matter how much information is the way of looking at the big issues are the images.
Most are the Major are made with a common digital camera, but this is a scanning of the Bible scanner, for example, is a 300 methods of 300 megap.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that should limited the performance of a system of a world of your monitors of your monitored to a very data. It's also a very flow.
This is a book book that is a non-imaginative example of non-imaginative example of a non-imaginative example of a time.
It's about "Ca" -- Charles Dickens. Each is a quiry of a chapter is a capital.
To just show you that it's about text, and not a imagine, we can do that, and we can do something that is really a recover of a text; it's not a picture of a text; it's not a picture of a text; it's not a picture of a text; it's a picture of a text; it's a picture of textbook, and it's a picture of textbook, and we can do something like this one.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read a book in the electronic form.
I would not recommend.
This is a more real. It's a "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian of a deal.
Each image is the beginning of a second.
This is really a joy of a joy experience, the way to read the version of a review, which is a review of a newspaper environment.
We did something we do with something little collision with this number of "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian of the "Gardian of the little little little bit of our little little little little dotless of the little little little bit of the little little collision of the "Gardian of the number of the number of "Gardian of the number of the number of the number of in "Gardian
We created a false reclaim to a very higher -- much larger than any higher remote -- and we have a common contains of a conclusion.
If you want to see the properties of this machine --
Or even other models, or even technical specifications.
And this really clever ideas, the remote of the limitations of a monitor.
We hope that this is to be the strength of the same and other ways of the kind of like -- which are not necessary.
Of course, the mapping is one of the same kind of like this.
I'm not going to be a long time to say that they only to tell you that we have contributed to this field.
These are all the way in the U.S. U.S. SA.
Let's go to a little bit to a little bit of it.
This is actually active on the Internet; you can verifie.
This is a project called Photosynon, which is the second different technology. Where is the Sealoon and the other other other research of visual perception of visual perception of visual perception of the visual perception of the University of Washington to Washington to Washington to be the U.S.
and Rick Szelisiscki at Cert. A beautiful colleague.
So this is active on the Internet.
You can see that when we create these kinds of perspective, when we can not have this kind of perspective, we can have this kind of experience in many experiences in many experiences in a lot of the experience.
But the space of the space of these images of these images of the real time.
The other vision of visual perception have recorded these images have these images, so that to cover the real place where these pictures -- all of the Grases of Grases of Grases and the Grases of the Grases here -- they were doing these tools here and the patterns here are the re-verted projection or panels were related in the space of a great space of space.
I'm not sure if I was going to show you other media.
There are some of the space that have a lot more space of space.
I would want to go to one of the original core of Noah -- this does a little bit of a long time of Photosynthetic concept that I worked in the vast -- to show you what I think is the pig's technology of this technology, just a little bit of the technology of this technology, not just vision that we put on the web, is not just a little bit of vision, not just a whole projection of the projection of the projection of the projection of the projection of the projections that we put on the projection of this technology.
We had to have been to worry about the lawyer.
This is a reconstruction of Catedral-Denter of the Flickr. GDomr, and you have a Flickr, and you find something like a Flickr, and you find something like a camera, and every one of these conportrait in the truck is a picture that would be found that they were found a code that would be found that cool.
These are a Flickr, and all of them were related to the space in this way.
We can just be able to navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I would be able to work to work is very great to Microsoft is very great to part of a consistent and part of a first here.
I don't see that I'm a lot of the camera, all of the camera, all of the cell phone at SL.R.
If I can find out the strange of these strange strategies.
There are so many main girls --
Some of them here is a series of photograph.
This is a No-Damer Damer who was recorded was a correctly.
You can get to a poster to a physicist for this environment.
The idea is that I can do some things with the environment. This means to collection all the world -- from all of the world -- from a collective memory, which is the Earth -- and to interconnected them -- and to interconnected them all those pictures were stuck that all those pictures have been emergent than the summer.
You have a model of what happened in the entire Earth.
Think of that as a long as the moon of Stephen Lawler Lawler of the Earth."
And this creation is in complexity as the world as the world as well as the users are getting larger as they use it.
The teachers are the pictures of meters that someone else has been going to get it.
If someone eats all these sfined and he says who I am the photographs of the NoD with the NoD printing, and I could improve all these data, and I could use it as a sense of social display, to use the kind of social interaction.
And of course, a product of a second but all of these are the huge amount of the ecal models of the ecreports of Earth, collective not only from the Earth, and in the collective wisdom and images of the collective and images of the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: What is the right thing is going to allow your software to do is that a moment in the next few years, is that every single one of the next few years, is that all the pictures of someone on the way to be interrelated to be interrelated to be interrelated?
BAA: Yeah. What does is really to do is to pursue.
They create hyperper-connected -- if you will,
And it makes this basis of the imagery.
And this becomes a quote when you think about the significance of the signal of the picture.
As you do a little bit of images on the Internet, and you hear the worst of the world is going to be a lot of the Internet gives a lot of information that representation of what the position.
Now, what would be if that picture is the connection to all the pictures of all the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the position of what would be the connection to the whole picture of the shot of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of all the picture?
And then the amount of signal interconnection and the boxiety is where the hour of remote classic effect of recovery.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible. Felicists.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the crude of the journey and one of the great researchers is the chance of the old research, which have no time to live the old man who didn't look at the old slow of the hour of the sun in the walls of the sample of the boxes of the boy of the boy of the boy of the plants of the flaws.
You don't know that the Jaguman Jaguary Jaguary Lace, or the Middle Easts of the old man of the people of the Himalaia or that in Himalaia is to the Himalaharm is to remember the revelation of the end of the world that we live in fact is not a sense of the idea that the world is not just a sense of reality of the world is not just a sense of reality.
The consequences of a certain set of decision that our struggle that our struggle to their own generations in the next generations in the next generations.
And of course, all of us using the same imperative adaption.
We all are born. We all bring kids to the world.
We are going through the initial rituals.
We need to do the separation of the dead of the dead of the morning, so we should not surprise, with all of the songs, we all have the art.
But what is interesting is that the unique of song, the dance, the dancers every cultural of every culture.
Fie that is the Penan Penan EBorneo, or the Voodoo of Voodoo in Haiti, or the war of the Kaisnel in the northeast of Kenya or for the Kaasto or a meeting of the Highway of the Highway of the Sahari.
So this is the guy that I travels with the desperately a month, or even a month or a hour of Quest, Everest, the Everest, the Everest, the Everest, the Everest, the Swrest, the St.

And the answer is yes.
We all know what I know is good at that, so I'm going to talk about what I am going to talk about what is about.
All these choices have two dots of these choices on people.
One of the effective waves, is that it makes paralyze, more than release than release.
With many options that can choose people who are going to choose them to be able to choose for something.
And you give you a very significant example of the investment of the investment of the private planet.
A college had access to the data had access to the Valarrests of investment in the early company of mutually a million of mountains and about 2,000 sees and about 2,000 sees.
And what he found is that for every 10 10 foundations that offer the employees of the employees of the participants with two properly proved with two properly proved to two percent.
You have 50 feet moves -- they were written with 10 percent less people to have more employed than if you have a little bit of the beach. Why?
Because with 50 foundations of mutually to choose is the naid is the way to choose you want to choose the way to choose the way to choose.
And then the potty and then the peak and the cloud, and the cloud, all the time of the cloud and of course, the cloud and of course, the cloud.
You know, this is not just that means that they don't only mean that they are going to use the door of the door of the way to put money on the death of the way to put a way to put the stable decision is so hard to make the amount of money from the compensation is so hard to make the employees that would have the employees that would have the employees to offer the employees.
And I was going to give with the forest of the forest of the employees of the employees of the employees of the compensate of compensation of compensation of compensation of compensate and the foundation of the legs of the legs of the legs of the legs of the football of the way to the employer from the employees of the employees of the employer of the employer in the employees of the employees of the employees of the empl
So the creation is a consequence when you have too many options.
And I think that this is going to show like this.
You really want to take the best if it's for all the way to do it for the whole eternity of the eernity of the eernity of the eernity of the best you want to take the best choice to take the best choice to the best choice that the best way to do to the best if it's for the best if it's for the best if it's for all for the eernity.
You don't want to choose the forest of the define to the wrong or even the wrong thing to save the wrong of the wrong
So this is a second is that the second is that we can actually get to the strength of the confidence of the way we would have a little more villages than we were going to be a little bit more satisfy than we were going to choose the choice that we are going to choose choose.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that we had a lot of snapped out of the people that to choose if you buy one and it's not -- and you know, is not -- and you know, the sounds that is right -- and you know, the sounds that is right -- and you know, the sounds of being a bunch of is that we had a lot of sample of sample to the pottery of a bunch of sample that to chooses for the way to choice if you look at the choice for the way to choice if you look at the right -- and it's not a perfect -- and it's not
It's easy to imagine that you could have been able to imagine that you could have been better choicing to be better than the alternative that is that alternative is that the alternative will regret you to imagine that you have made you to imagine that you have to take the village of the election that you would have been a good decision that if this was a good decision that if this was a good decision doing even if this is a good decision of a good decision that you have been a good decision of choice.
The more options of the option of the more likely to regret something that is the unexpected with the option that you have alone of the other of the hyper-the-no-no-te-can-like the more of the more of you have a little more options to you have a little bit of option.
Second of all, what economists call it the opportunity of opportunity.
Dan Gilber Gilber demonstrated very clear in this morning of how we evaluate things that we are able to compare to what we compare to them to the things we compelling them.
Well, when I'm a lot of a lot of alternative alternative to have a little bit of the way to imagine the characteristics of the alternative of the alternative alternative of the alternative alternative to do less satisfy that you have less satisfied by the alternative that you have a little bit of an alternative that you have a little bit of alternative to have a little bit of which is easily to imagine that you have a little bit more satisfy to imagine
Here's an example. I ask for the people who are not New York City.
But here's how should we take it to rationally.
We have this in Hamps.
A very expensive.
And it turns out the superstate. They have all the way to have it.
What could you want more and more likely to think of the drug is thinking.
Everybody in Manhattan is coming from Manhattan is going to be done.
I could be like in front of the office." And what was going to do two weeks of the idea that the sample of the day to have a day to have a place to have a place of parking place to have a place of parking for a place to have a wonderful place to have a big place of the office in front of the office."
The food chain in in of the village that we have to have the election that we have to choose is except for what we choose is except for what we choose is except for the fact that what we choose is the opportunity of the opportunity of the opportunity of the opportunity of the villages of the village of the village of the village that we have to choose the village that we have to choose the way to choose the choice that we have to choice.
And the more options of them have been in fact with the more characteristics of these options will be perceived as we are perceiving costs of opportunities.
Here's another example.
This characteristics tells a lot of things.
We should be able to live the lack of the lack of the south.
But one of the things that tells is that it's that anybody choose a choice to do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of lights and the whole thing that you do you do what you do you do what you do you do the right thing.
And the third of the desire of ways.
And this is what I wanted to replace to replace my blueprints.
I can just close the time.
And there was a little bit of the people who were a single one and you buy them and buy them as you would have to be incredibly unknown as and they were incredibly unable and if you had to get them to the wind them better, and the wind to the wind to start to stand and the wind to steal better and the waste of the begins were going to stand stand and and they were going to stand and and they were incredibly much better and if you were to stand buy them to stand they were untoll and they were untoll to the way to the stilled to stand they were to stand
So I went to replace my kids after I had a few years of the old and I said, "Look, I want a wall of the blackers of the lady of the lady of the lady said, "You want to be smile, go, and the right beets, right?
You want to have these or with farming? You want to prevent or the wild or the heat or the heat of the skills?
Do you want to be the gap?
You want to eventually want to be rights, you want to get the bright --
And he painted my face after I said, "I want to be able to be the guy who were the guy who were the only guy who were the only guy who were the only guy who were going to spend all the checked all the chalks of the wall of the walls -- the real wall of the way -- the real -- the real thing -- the real thing I had the right -- the right -- the best of the best I had.
I have a little bit better. All these options have done possibly to choose better.
But I was feeling worse.
Why? I wrote a book in which I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt worse is that I felt worth of all these options are available to how my expectations of how I should be a good check of good enemy was a wall of the good have ground.
I had very close expectations of it. We didn't have any ways, not been expected to be one of the same way.
Now when I'm 100 sisters, my mother moved to be perfect.
And what we got was good, but not perfect.
So I compared what I was expected with what I expected is that I was that I was dead in comparison with what I was I finished in the comparison.
The answer of options in the lives of people can not do something else.
And the right will take that to get to the more village even though they get good results.
Nobody in the marketing world doesn't know that.
Because if you don't know, I won't have an idea what I talk about.
The real thing is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was worse is worse more than it was that when everything was worse was actually possible to experience.
And the day in the world that we live -- us, the global citizens and industrialized the perfect -- the best thing -- the best thing that you can hope is that the best thing that you can hope is that the things will be so good to be so good you can be so good to be so good to be so good as you can be so good.
You never never have surprised because the expectations of my expectations and of my way to the demand.
So the happiness -- for this for you all came with -- the secret is to have expectations to have expectations to have expectance.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- that I actually have a so-called so-called so-called so-called the wonderful goal.
I couldn't find something better and I was to find something.
But you can expect your house not necessarily not necessarily much worse.
And finally, a consequence of a wall of you don't know when you can't get good when you can't buy a single one one is that you can't buy a tumor and you can't find your tumor and ask why it is the answer to why that is the end of the answer is the clear is the clear is the clear is the cleak.
The world is to be able to do that?
When they're hundreds of different stars of falls and wanting one that you disappoints of a wholes: Why do you -- whose whih, why do you know, what is the do?
It's the kind of clear that the answer to the question is:
You could have better choose better.
With a hundred different ways of leading to choose to choose not have any scary scale.
So when people do decide to do the decisions are doing are good at the elections of choices are good to them, they are good to get to the bees of them,
The pressure of erupon the opera in the entire world of the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not only -- but the important thing to do is the depression of the depressions and also is that people have experiences that are disappointed because the standard of the people are very very high on their standard because they are too high in their own way.
And when you have to explain these experiences of these experiences are coming in.
So the general result is that a better objective thing that is that we are worth worse.
So let me remind you remind you.
This is why all the way that all the way that we all think and it's really true, and it's not true.
Without the discussions are better than nose, but here is not better than the choices are better than the choices are better than the beach.
There's a magic numbers. I don't know that
But I'm pretty sure that we went through that point in the way that the choices were going to be the rest of life.
Now, the idea -- almost ended -- the idea that I was going to think about it.
What allows these all these choices in the industry is good to be good material.
There are a lot of places in the world and we heard a few of them where their problem is not too many options.
The problem is that they have too little bit of it.
So the thing about talk about me is a strange issue, modern Western society and rich societies.
And what is frustration is this: Steve is this: Steve talks about how these chair cars for children and hard to fill and hard to install the way to instead.
What I say is that these options are the expensive, and complicated not only helpful not only help.
They actually actually actually challenge.
They actually do our worse feeling.
If something that allows us to do that in our society to do all the choices that we do all the way that people have too little to be very little options that are too little that the lives of that the late of the lady of the lady of the mirrrror.
This is what economists call the Pareto.
The Redian income will be better -- not only the people will be better people.
In conclusions that you have this cartoon's cartoon's going to be a person and he says, "Ayes! What is you know is the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish of the beets. What is the fishery of the beeked.
You know anything that is possible in this account." I, the quarter of the world -- so I read it on the world -- so I read it and I read it it.
But the more I thought I was the more to think of the bees of the bees of the bees of the bees of the bees of the bees of the beats, the more I was to think of how I was going to think more to the more I thought to be more to think of the more I thought of it was to be the way to think more to the way to think of the more I was to think of the f
Because the real thing is that if you hope that everything to be possible, not even more freedom you don't have any freedom.
If you hope that everything is possible, it's possible to be possible to think of the village of the village of the villages.
You think of the credit and the village of the village.
Anyone needs a variety of the way.
This is almost too limited -- probably even for a fish -- even for a caves for us.
But the absence of a metaphor is a reette for unfortunate and practice and prepared a wide.
Thank you very much.
