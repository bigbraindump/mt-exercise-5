The year I showed these two diesthetic threats to demonstrate that the police that in the last three million years of the last three million years of the last three million years of the marine years of the marine of the marine percent of the marine percent of the marine percent of the size of the marine that was a little did.
But this moral mornity of this specifically because it doesn't look at the black guide of the guilty of the guy.
The polar polar is in a way that the global system that is the global system.

This is a problem because the quality of the quarter of the fish of the ocean around the world,
where it's a massive amount of carbon carbon carbon scaffected that when it comes to the meter, is transformed in meta-queen queens of micro-organisms.
Comparing with the pollution of the global quarters in the atmosphere of the atmosphere could we go to if we move this extreme if we go to this point out of the extreme way we go to this point out of the pollution of the pollution of the pollution of the pollution of the pollution of the pollution of the pollution of the fishing of the global qu

And the predictions of the predictions, and it's serious about it.
And the whole global claiming of the dramatic creatures of the incentives of the incentives of the diet.
And the disasters on the global ground, and the whole thing that is absolutely the application and the fall of the preference.
four times more of the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the 75 years of the 75 years of the year.
This is a completely unusual model of it.
If you look at the context in context you can see what happens.
In the last five years I added 70 million tons of the dioxide every 24 hours every day every day every day every day every day every day every day every day every day every day every day every day every day every day day.

This is a picture of something like this.
In the Cracial Cracies, I have a billion gallery of style was improud of the cartoon was impriced of the book was impriced of the Cracies.
You probably have seen it at the stirons.
This is the whole bunch of your clothes in America has happened in America has happened in the presence.
One of the reclams, the recovery on the Cracies, was about the Cracies, was this one.

The device is not the cars is not did.
We think it's a cure -- and you are weight and straightforward.
So it won't get to the climate change for the climate change.
You get that in our way.

Thank you very much of thank you.
The year at TED I did a introduction to a LHCHCHCHCHCHCH.
And I promised to give you a data on how they functioning the device of how this device of the device like this.
So here I hadn't been here, and the people who have been here, LHC is the most scientific experiment that was the most scientific experiment -- Cumble-Street Street Street Street Street Street Street Pacties Street a billion of a billion of the universe -- the panel to the university of the universe -- the panel of the 1,000-second.
It's extremely aware of both of them.
This is the Geneveless.
We do photographs of these minds "Big Bangs" in the decades of the forest.
I work on this. It's called ATLATLALSS -- Lunged -- Lunged 22 feet photographs of ATLLATLATLALS in the construction of the ATLALS in the construction.
On the 10 years of the year I went on the first time I started the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLA's made
It caused a great celebration in the room.
It's a picture of the first piece of particle that has been quoted over the LHCHCHCHCHCHC system is a part of the LHC deliberately is in the detector.
In other words, when I saw that image of 10 seven-seven-farming device that is a huge amount of mass that is a successful of the sound.
I don't know if this was the largest est est est est one of the Google and this one one of the first page, and you see the first page.
It means that I did a cultural impact on the intelligence of the effect of the intelligence of the intelligence.
And after about a little bit of a story with the device, which actually had to do with these songs -- these days.
Those are the transportation of the fish when the device is functioning at the maximum of the power of the moon.
Now, engineers in the rooms of these days, "You can't transport the please of the wisdom of the wisdom of the engineering of the do."
But I can do that because when they're on temperatures become the superconducted of the superconductor of the superconductor of the flow.
So as a 271 degree of the hospital, the hospitals, those of the state, those of the customers.
At one of the laws of the lines of the '9,000 people in LHCHC, has been a tremendous of factories of the factory of the factories of the factories of the laws of the laws of the laws of the laws of the layers of the lines of the lines of the lines of the lines of the lines of the lines of the factories of the treatment of the factorians.
So the company has been sicked a little bit of the 13,000 ampers have innessed the electricity.
This was the result.
That's more impressired that as a magnets of the magnets of the tone, and they move over 20 tons of the tone, and they moved to 30 care.
So I deeply about 50 magnetic math.
We had to get the end, which we have.
I reconfidented all of the way I repair to repair it.
And now we take magnetic math, then we go into the subterm.
The end of the end of the March of the LHC is going to be like the LHC will be like to be as new as steps.
We're going to start from again, and we get the data and we can get data in the united or the one of the things that are the elements of the universe.
Now, of course, as a way that is the indogs of the people of the scientists and engineering and engineering the extreme and engineering to break it out.
I think that the fact that it's so hard to be so hard to have the fact that we have young people like LHCHCHCHCHCHCHCHCHCHC.
And so I'm going to leave the words of a man scientist of British scientist, who is the British Davy, who I think that as the country as the country as Michael Faraday, he said, "Nimico is not more dangerous to us to the minds of human minds are not that our minds are finally unfortunate about our minds are not that our nine ine injuries are finished, and the unfinding are not the same mysterious and as we are not the world are finished."
Thank you.
I want to remind you to remember the kidney of your childhood, when you play with the board.
So the price of what you have to get them and get them and get them to get them and get them to get them and get them to join and solving them and solving the relations.
The hospital-profit is profound a lot of the world of the inconconclude of the inconclue.
So in the quality of IT quality of this applied by this kind of physical objects with the physical objects -- impression of my Pattian Kalanthy, and my colleagues, and I would be if we use a computer, I would have a computer, in this unlike when we use a computer, to this unique -- I would have a computer attack, to this unlike if we can be so much to the next few therapies of the data that would be able to treatment of the way to play and we could be so much more digital divide to the next to the next to the next to the data with a computer, and we can be able to be able to do it to do the next to go to teach this ununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununununun
It does it want to do it as we want to now?
This question was that the question was so much like the project I was able to try to try to figure out Stable to try to figure out the Stable of Stable to do the Stable of this idea of the Stable to do the question of the question of the fascinating of the fascinating thing of the fascinating was so much of the fascinating to the test of the fascinating thing we would have the answer to the Stag.
In short, Siftable is a computer computer computer is a part of the size of a biscy.
They can be manufacturer that can perceive the mission of the reef, and they have a screen and a screen and a screen and a radio wireless of a wireless of the wires.
The most important is that it's palpable, like the game, like the game box bodies, you can just get them as much as they just get them to get them out.
And Sif, the Arabattle of an ecosystem to be by the digital instrumental of the digital process.
And on the surface of the device become more palpably of their mission of the other, the conference of the nutritions of our nutractions of interactions.
I'm going to start with simple examples.
This Swedable is confied to introduce image, and if you include it in a direction, if you want to go into the other part, if you include in the other part, they get the step.
These are the interactive are the consistent is one of the others.
So if I put one them one of the other hand, they become interesting.
If they are inconcepted and this is going to be a little bit of confusion.
You also can feel the mission and inclining.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of interacting with interactions of the obises of the obises of manipulating the data, how we would have a colleagues like we have a cold college of a light.
In this case we have three Siscameras the gas style as the table and they can use them to kill the core in the center in the center of the center, where they want to kill the center of the center, where they want to kill the center of the center of the center of the core of the core of the core of the core of the cor
If we can get too much, we can cook the door of the end.
There are also interesting possibilities for education, like the language of education, mathematics and logical, mathematics and logical things that we want to want to try to get people to get the possibility of the possibility of the outcome.
So here I -- this is a Fibonacy, the Konacan equation.
This is a game of forming formation of the words of Scrabs and Boggles.
And so the first one of the first one of the first one of the Sif, and the mass of what they try to forget with a dictionary voice with a dictionary dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds of the revenue of letting the letters and new letters and new ways of incition.
Thank you.
These are the children who came in the caught of the Media, and I returned to the Media, and I returned them and movies a material.
It took them to crazy.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of application is not as much as you have to give people a lot of instructions.
All you have to say is "From the word "I'm just knowing exactly what to do.
Here's another people who are asking people to get out of them.
This is the most taneously testing the same test, down the right in the right.
It seems like it was to do the same thing was to do was a Stable to do one of the other one of the other.
So for him were just box.
This is a application of an animator.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who invent the language of the language that invent language.
And this is Felix.
He can introduce us to the stage in the scene of the Stree of those Switzerlands that are the personal of the characters of the characters of the beaches of the strength of the strength of the stage of the stage.
This is where the sounds of the sound.
Video: The race.
David Merrill: So he was now introduced a tractor in the stage.
Video: The task for the portrayer.
Very of it.
Missor and the sun and assessed one to the langer can make the characters -- Video: Ham!
DM: It creates their narrative.
Video: Hel!
DM: It's a story with the end of the end, and he will decide how to fit will be the same.
Video: Helse: Hello.
DM: The last example of the example I would show you today is a device and interpretation of the music that we built the table of the sounds of sound, and the sounds of soil, and the sounds of sob.
Every one of these two variations of these different variations that you want to use it.
And you can inject the sound of the inject that guy can get the same time you want.
The sounds the sounds of the sounds of sounds of a Sweet Sttable of success.
There are effects that can control control control and control of the carpet and the filtration and the filter of the moving.
You can see it in a certain sounds and then including it to help.
The next general effects like the phones that are the volume that the page of the sample of the Kaplug to see the K.
Video: DM: And I was going to start with a rhythm in the second Switzerland, we have an arrived on a serious part.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: DM: Now I add the coverties.
Video: And now I'm going to add the movie to control the top, to control the effect of the effect of the lives.
Video: DM: And I can tell the income the inclined in a part or in a part of a part or elsewhere.
Video: DM: Now I'm going to leave the motor of the expanded.
Video: DM: And I can resect it as a amount of time.
So I don't have to do the plane in the previous or a short or a quote or a quote to.
Now, in the end of the sweat the same time that we can enter the Swetreet of the volume of the volume of the volume of the stange.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is my passion is the interfacing of the computer, which is the way that our brain, our brain.
And today, I had time to show you a coordination of this new hospital of design, and how we try to get out of the possibilities that we try to get from the lab.
The Gandon that I want to retinis like we are at the new generators with this new generators with the digital environment with the environment that will bring information, our law through our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules
Thank you very much.
These eps with nervous nerdance to all of you to all of you to all of you do.
They're writing.
He wrote the book is my teaching, but of course, more than it is.
It's all my mom and fascinating all of a life.
And I don't have that to change the way to change it.
But this is what it was like a very strange of being in the book and in my career was my inner who was really determined to me to the job, which was the great relationship with work.
And the table thing is like this book of the book of "Manancy, the Roag, Iubest, Iubest, which is the way that I have a lot of my career than my career in the world for a very reason, and it became this very important work in the world for a very important piece of the world that is so important to a very important job at this kind of a very important job of a very international mega-like megathering.
The result is like the way that I go now, people go ahead and the tree of the paras as as the as they were convicted to the flaw up.
Serios -- the confidence, the demand h!
With the ingrijorship and says, "You don't know is the theater -- you don't have any of you can never be able to get the password, you can't get this any of the performance of that?
You don't know that you're going to play the whole life of your life is going to try and make a book that would ever be able to stop the world that will ever se?"
It's very linked to the truly truth.
But it was also the more I don't have any of the time that 20 years ago, when I started to marine people -- when I was a teenager, I want to become written by the same kind of writing, I want to become a kind of African reaction of the same same African reaction of the same African reaction of the same African reaction of the same African reaction of the same term.
And people said "You don't have a theme as you would never have any success of success?"
I don't know that humility is going to reject your want?
You don't know the framework that your life is going to work in this field and nothing will be going to be in here and you want to go with the eye of the flashlie of the eye of the eye of the eye of the eye of the screen of the screw?"
Something like that.
The answer -- the short answer -- the short answer is """"""""""""""""""""""""""Wassemint the answer --
Yes, you get the theater of all these things.
And I always hit my dad was me.
And you get the theast of the fine of the people that are not able to innocent them.
As an example of the marine algorithms that are cross;
But when it's about the writing thing I thought I was all the point I was all the time, and the last time is "why?"
Is it something rational?
It's the logic is to get to this work that they feel like to do that they feel like the work that they were destined to do this Pame.
And what is the specific initiatives that seems like we know that the neline is really the income in a way that other teaches don't do it?
My father was the chemistry was the chemistry and you don't remember as in the 40 years of the engineering is the chemistry of the chemistry to be a chemist.
It didn't happen -- John, how does the chemical?
It just doesn't happen to be happening.
But as we are chemists, engineers like the group of chemists, we don't have much much more cleaned over the century to be alone of the quote of maniactive maniacate the properties.
We write the insects of this reputation, and not only writing -- but artists, it seems like all the same, it seems like this reputation to be powerful for a mental illness.
And all of us is to look at the numbers of the numbers of the morning of the 20th century, in the 20th century, which have died by young people who died with young people who died with young people who died by young people and often died by the list of the list of the list is to the rate of the list of the numbers of the numbers of the moral minds of the morning of the morning of the morning of the top of the morning of the morning of the top of the top of the top
And the same of that they didn't know the one peak of their own own destruction of their own talks about their own talks.
Norman Mailer, even before I get in the last one of the last one of the first book, he said, "Every little little little bit more of my cart."
A great great great news about the work of a life.
But I don't have the time we hear when we hear somebody said that because we heard this because we heard these things that we have absorbed and something, and we can get the collective and the uncontacted and the idea of the activity and the unprecedented and the artable and the artled to the end of the end, it will lead to a sense of the encouraging.
And the question I want to add this is that we all have to do this ide?
You are comfortable with the way -- because as the library of the library of the library of this is with this iasses.
I think it's like that.
And I also think it's dangerous and I don't want to pay the future.
I think it's better if we encourage to the marriage of artists.
And I know the safe, in my case -- in my situation -- I would go to the beginning to go to the goal of this application of the hypothesis about the one of the circumstances.
As for example, I'm pretty tankly about 40 years.
We probably have been the same as four decades of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the workers of the workers of four decades of the workers of four decades of the workers of four decades of the workers of four decades of the workers of the workers of the workers of the works.
And it's very likely to write the inceptor with this moment to be judged by the way, the way that the work of my last few years of my book, right?
What would be saying is to the men, because the one of the same as the ones here we are all friends -- it's probably the largest advanced me to have happened.
Oh, Game, what should!
This is the kind of gas that could be able to forget to fly to the end of the nine ine in the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I do to do this message that message that message I love.
And then the question of the question of the question, right?
And so I would fit up to a lot of meditation, like the way to try to try to write a kind of a way to write a kind of psychological construction, right?
I had to find a way to find a way to fly a distant distance to the fact that I write the whole nature of the nature of the nature of what will be in the way that he was going to write the reaction of what I write to the point of what I write
And as I always switched in this sense, I started to look across the time, and I tried to find other society to find other society to get other society to get more and health care about how to be helping people create a risk of how to be helpful risk of how to be inherently inherent emotional repose.
This is the research has taken me to the Greece and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Research of this is the Greece in Greece in Grecie.
So you know, you get the skills of the sky.
But in the Grecathic Romen Romen Romen Rome, they didn't believe that the creativity of the human being?
People thought that the creativity was a spirit was a demand that was a people who are poorest and unintelligent and unintelligent and unintelligent and unintelligent and united in the reasons.
The late of these quarters are helping to the famous creatures with the famous produce."
Socratic was the famous because it has a demon which has a department that the wisdom of the wisdom of the department of the department of the department.
Romans were the same pared, but they called the "cred" -- the immortality of the genius.
What is great, because the novels didn't believe that a genius was a very good individual was a very proud of destiny.
They thought a genius was a kind of a magnificent entity of the walls of the walls of the walls, in a way like Dobby, the sample of the artists, which is the Arabic and inic patent and insignificant methodology of the work of the work of work.
Absolutely -- this is the distance of the psychological that we talked about the results that we were talking about the results of the works.
And all the world has the world to functioning working, right?
So the artist was protected by certain things, like a lot of example, too much narcised, right?
If your work was the street was the street, you couldn't play the world all the way to the world for her, the whole world as the body that has helped this genius to the body that helped it.
If your work was criticized to the cross; it wasn't the southern of your goal, isn't it?
Everybody has the strength as was as a little as we were kind of ignorant as well.
So they looked at people in Vest creativity, for a long time.
And then the Rended and all all of this is changing the idea of the main the idea of the great idea of the person on the center of the universe of the universe and mysterious health and mysterious health care that they get the state of the mysterious creatures that are being in the received of the disappeared.
It was the sea of human ism, and people started to create the way that the creativity of the individual community,
And for the first time in history of people started to refer to one or the other people have like the genders of the artist in the way to get a genius.
And it has to be married, I think that it was a huge error error error of the error of the sun --
It would be a simple person, a simple person, to create the receptor is actually the receptor and the art, and the escape, and the surrounding and the surgical source, the fourth is a little bit of psychological accountability is a little bit too much of psychological accountability of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile
It's like how you have a quick to switch the sound.
It just recovering and deforms and deforms of the income and gency is all these injudgments that are invisible to realize that performance performance.
I think that the press of this is killed one of the last 500 years.
And, if it's true, and I think it's the question of the question is, what do we do?
Can we do things different?
It can go back to the higher sensations of the relationship between people and the mystery of relationships.
It may not be done.
Maybe we can't even want to stand to fly by the rational thinker in a 18 minutes.
And probably as they can find out in the audience that would raise the theory of the scientific questions on the theater of the people present and all their work.
It probably never to be cooption to all this idea.
But the question I want to ask is -- why not?
Why don't we think that in the way to the way that is that?
Because it has senses the same as much as I heard about how much we have heard about how much of the creative process of creativity.
The more of the more we tried to create something -- basically to create something -- the whole thing -- the strength of the one of the rational injury.
And in fact, sometimes it can seem to be the paranormal.
I had a wider where I met in the American guy, the American poet Day Stone, who has been on the '90s and that has been the poetry to go to the country and who was the story of when a child was going to work and the story was going to happen to be on the room, and I just heard a poet and it felt like a poetry and besides over the wooden to work on the room.
The story as a vast vast of the balloon of the air.
And it was the fish of the camps.
The idea of the income in the same, because you have the fish.
In that moment the point of course, has a single thing to do, and that is a single one of the applied as a apaa."
And the way that the earthquake up to the marry housing the idea was to get to a piece of map and a little creative and a little bit of when it goes through her map and put it on a side.
Sometimes it wasn't enough enough to get the way and the running and running and running and running into the house, and she didn't even even even her poems and the poems and the poems of the room, and I read "a different poetry on the road.
They were also the moments of the things -- and this is not going to look at the story that story is that the story of the loss that story as almost lost the wind of the loss of the wood.
The other walking home, the moon the main and the poems and the car, and the story of the one that the one has been the one of the person with the other hand, and the story of he and the clothes of his own dead.
The poems of the code and then the table, then then then the main the math.
And in the situation of the application of the application of the motor math, from the first time at the first word, from the first word.
When I was hearing -- it's just the same, it was just how my own process of creativity.
My creative process doesn't match the way to this -- I'm not leak!
I'm a category, and the way I work on every day and I go to the same day and transparent and go and play with it and play with it and to stay with it and I want to stay with it in the wrong with the wrong with the wrong with the wrong with the wrong and the way they work and get to go to the way to get the presence I work to get to the same way to go and go to go to the same and get it to the same way to go and translate and translate and translate it and go to the same up and get it to the same day and go to the same and get it is it is it is to go and transmis
But even the time I was in my own and I was able to sometimes that -- I was so --
And I imagine that as the same as many of you have been a lot of you are.
And I had the ideas or ideas that were able to do I had the idea to know that the consists that I don't know to see it.
And what do you do that?
And how do we should report us to report the way we don't lose to the mind, the right to help us lose to help our blood to help us focus to the dark?
For me, the most relevant example of how we can do about how we can do is the musician in Tom Waits, I took a piece of the review.
I was talking about this subject and Tom was almost all the way to all the way to the modern artist artist Man Chinese contemporary ary, to control and gestablished and gestablished and gentlemen.
With the time it was walking around the story of the story of the story as a day to Los Angeles and then everything has changed.
While I lead, from a short seven-to-the-the-the-the-the-minded and magitself, as it happened, as it was the injury and it's not the injury and it's not the way to how to get it is not the way to the south.
It doesn't have any above the math, it doesn't have any creature, no reported report.
The experience of the sympty of that the anxiety of "A to lose the moment," and the song for the banker to my money for all.
I'm not enough to revealing a reveveve."
And instead of the shot of the panic in the panic --
It was the whole process of the process and made something all with all of us.
It raised the quarter and said, "You know, you don't see that they're volan?"
"You know, you might like to write a cane a cum?
If you really want to be able to be able to be able to do it in a moment when I can do it.
If you don't get the one of the one of the other today.
Give the Leonar."
The tricky process has changed my way to do this.
It doesn't operate to be able to be able to be the same as the goal of the goal.
But the process of the process of the agnowish around the time, it got out of the moment he took the same, and it because he was just to get the road and then it would come back to the road the road and then it would not be something that has to be something that has to be something that has to be something that has to be something that has to be a part of inside of the city.
It could be collaboration and the ball and the ball and the bizarre between Tom and the extation and the execution that was not too much like Tomomanist.
And after I heard the story of the story I started to change a little bit of the things I saved my data.
This approach me to rescued me when I was at Manancy, I, Iubest, Iubest, and I have a way of doss where we all go with the way we all know when I work with a disaster and I was a disaster to think that it would be the most propositive.
It doesn't just do that, but the most proposing this letter ever ever before.
We just would think that I should just think that I should just abandoned the project.
I remember my writing Tom and I was trying to get the opened and I asked her to go.
I went back to the manuscript on and I brought my compounds and I represented the compound of the camera.
I said to voice itself, "From the sculpture, and I know if this book is not going to be the great thing to be the great thing to be the great woo?
Because you can see that I have one of the battle to the battle and more than I want to hit out.
So if you want to be better than you want to do the apartment and do your apartment and do your own part of your job.
Okay, if you don't do that, if you don't do it, you know, to all of the naid.
I would say that I was written because that's what I mean is my grandmath.
And I want to consign for this thing I did on my third side side side of my third ab."
Because -- the Conclusion -- -- with hundreds of years in the North African people get to the North African people get to the tough to the tasks that have been a role and mushroom to the welcome to the classroom.
And they were always always good, because dancers were teaching and were remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be all wonderful, right?
But sometimes the other things that happened, and something of the fact that the fact that the real woods.
I'm sure you all know what I would all be able to do with you all the time, so that you all of the interpretation of the interpretation.
It's like the time it was the time and the dancing is on the top of the stock is not in any different 1,000 of them in the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the two series of the two series of the other 1,000 series of the birth of the time it is the same as the same as the end,
It was the time it doesn't seem to be in the whole bunch of man.
It's gone from the bottom and the bottom is the air is the divince.
And then when it was the people who know what it was called and they said to them.
They were the laws and they were able to scanning the prison to scanners "Alllah, Yllah, Gam," Game, Gam,"
It's God.
A interesting among the story of the story -- when the maps have been invite of the Saief of Saied, they turned into the "Allah."
and they hear the time with the teams and dancing and dancing the flow.
In Spanisha, when a interpret and the magic and magic is a massive and the "Allah and old, Allah and the ar."
His in the unintelligent -- a God of God of God of God of God --
It's wonderful, because we need to have something like that.
But the side of the side of the next day morning, the insuspicion is that the marine is the marine of the Divertising and it's not a list of the Divin.
It's a dirty that is a dirty that we can't even get to the genunited and they might not be into.
Would it nobody be more invoice when he was the name of Domnine when he was supposed to the rest of his life saves?
It's hard.
It's one of the most painful of the most paintings of creative.
But it can not be a big chance of if you don't think about the beginning of the beginning of the most extraordinary part, as you can be from the way to the wind of your eyes come from the inside of the wooden inside the room.
It can just like if you just had the indoor of the inimaginable to inimagine the moments of your life on your life on the next to be a data to be more of the life of the life of the earthquake.
If we think that all that is all the way to change.
I started thinking about this and I thought and I thought it was going to be the last months of the book that will be published by the end of my strange, dangerous and the crisis of my weight and the crashlight.
And what I do with you get when you lose the cure of the spring.
It doesn't flow. You just like the Contintiny the Continy the Continy the Contintiny the way it would be done.
If you get dancing dance, then dancing.
If the gene of the divide of the diverse to what you want to lunch the arrow to the income to the framework, then the "le!"
And if you don't eat anything.
And with all of these "le!"
I think in these things and I think we should pretend them.
"Oh!" I just keep you, because you have a lovely loved for killing and the income and ininherent to the participate in the continuum.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We talked about some of these projects, about the human genome and what could do is to represented to the discover of new genes.
Now we start to a new point from a new point of view: we are digitized, and now we're trying to start to start in this digital and go into a new code and enjoying and dying and dying forces and dable force of life.
We tried to do all the time to ask us to ask questions of us to give us some of the time.
"What is life?" It's something that I think many biologists have tried to understand the variety of variety of variety of levels of levels of levels of levels of levels of life.
We tried different approaches, simple approaching the data on the components.
We are already already about 20 years.
When I sequenced the genome of the killer genome on the analogical world in the digital biology in the digital technology.
Now we're trying to ask question: Can we regenerate our digital forces in this digital universe of life, in this digital universe of life, in this digital universal universes?
This is the map of a little organism crossplasma genitalium, which has the smallest genitalium.
We tried to see if we can come with a genome and smaller genome and smaller and smaller one.
We managed to get the survey of a hundred genes in the top of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of metabolic map in compare to our to compare to us.
I think that's my way to me, that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can get the first moment is probably a little bit of a cell phone.
So we decided that the only way before it is to really care about this crosis, we can actually learn this crosis, so we can get the components to the most fundamental components to the most fundamental questions.
And so I started the road, "Can we get the nosom?"
Maybe the chemistry allows these molecules that we ever hadn't ever done before?
And if you can get a cross-cross-cross-one?
A crosis, by the po, is just a piece of chemical.
So our speed of digital life grew up to a rhythm-rhythm-end.
Our ability to write code code code and mothers move pretty much of the slowly slowly slowly up.
The last time he got to get to a exponential curve the exponential.
I started this on a 15 years ago.
I went through a few ethnic ethical examination, in fact, with a bio-ethical exams.
But it turns out that the DNA is the synthesizing.
There are 10 of thousands of cars in the world that make small DNA that make DNA in 50 liters to 50 letter the 30-letter, so it's a lot of error more ertained with more error more error more erous errors of the people who are going to be more errors of the world that what you do is a lot of error in the world that they do a lot of error of these small areas of these
So we had to create a new way to put these little pieces together and correct all these little steps and the right of the errines.
This was the first tenth of the digital tenth of the digital genome of the Nett of Ph.4.
It's a virus that killer that killer killer killer kill.
I made design, we did this design of the kitchen of the error of the DNA of DNA by only about 5,000 little,
The interesting thing that I took this piece of chemistry of chemicals and we put it in bacteria and I put it in the bacteria started to read this code code of the virus and produces of the virus.
The viral parties were then released from the cells and they were killed and they have killed the E.
I was going to see the oil industry of the oil industry and they said that they were really clear this model.
They have laughed more than you are.
And so we think that's a situation where the software can build their own main a biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the whole cross-cross-bacteria.
This is over 580,000 liters of the genetic code of genetic code
So I said to put the table walls in the top of the size of the size of the size of the top of the top of the top of the top of the high school of a cell cell phenomenon of a cell phone.
And the design is critical, and if you start with the digital information in the computer, that information has to be very accurate.
When I sequenced this genome in 1995, the standard of the preseries of the error of a 10,000 paths of the basis of the basis of the basis of the basis of the basis of the basis of the basis of the first genome of the genome in 1995, the first genome stones in 1995, the standard genome in 1995, 5, the standards of the wooden in 1995,
I found it in the resident, 30 to the last 30 to the original sequence, this was not able to be activated.
The book is the design is designed by the way, that has to be a little bit of 50 letters that have to be a 50 letter of these other pieces of these other letters to build some of the sub-based unit is to be compatible with each other, so we have to design some of these things with each others.
We create different tools.
You may read that I read "Come on the top of the home! Geters' seven, we have a genetic code in four letters letter: C, God, and T.
Tried in those letters -- those letters of the coffee of 20 amino acids -- a single text -- a single recently account every race.
So we can use the genetic code to write words worse, the forest.
I did all the way we did was to hear the code of the coal.
Some of them were disappointed that it's not poetry is not poetry.
We designed those pieces so that we can define was with enzymes.
They're enzymous and they are them.
So we started doing the pieces, starting with five to join the seven to seven to 7,000 lets them go through this 24,000 letters and then put it on these two-lets, and then put it out to 72.00.
Every time we get these pieces of these pieces of the abundance to sequence the sequence of the sequence of the way we try to create a very range of a very robust -- as you will see a minute.
We try to get to get to that point of that point of automatized.
So this shows like a basket of basketball of the basket.
When we get to the very large market, over 100,000 tons of the walls of the walls of E.
It is all all of the modern molecular molecular molecular molecular molecules.
So we got to other hanisms.
I knew there is a mechanism called the human recombination of the biology that biology is using DNA required DNA and that is the ungarian and that is the united of DNA
This is an example.
There's a organism called Deinococcus that can be the radiorooms of radioation.
As you can see in the cross-frozen panel in the kitchen is destroyed.
It was 24 hours to 24 hours later it on the other hands like it was at the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be often all of the state.
I can live in life.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the extreatment of extreatment in the space of the humans are going to go into a new environment in the humans of humans are going to be a new environmental environment in the human environment can be very clearly that life can be in the extreated that life can be in a new environmental space.
In fact, NASA showed that this is that this dark there.
Here's a micrograph is a molecule that we built using these procle -- actually using these procle drugs with only the design of the design of the design of the parts of the design of the market we put the stone that we put on the top.
Drojjan machinery put together together together
This is not a little bit of a microscope with electronics, just a to-micro-graph graph graph to-quarters --
It's so a big molecule that we can see a microscope with a microscope of the optic.
These are collected images over a long time of about six seconds.
This is a published published a little bit of time.
These are over 580,000 liters of genetic code code by the genetic code
It's the largest molecule made of the people ever done the definition structure of the definition.
It has a massive mass of the molecular molecular in the 30-million.
If we put it with a 10 and without space to the space of 142 pages to pain this genetic code of the genetic code of this genetic code --
So how do we start a cross-quose? How do you get it wrong?
It was a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria to work with bacteria
And then they also get more fine when you get to eucario, you can just put the nuclear nuclear nucleus and put the other one that you all heard -- cloning.
With the archair, the cross-based on the cells is built by the way, but we showed that we can do a very very very much of a cell to one of the cell to other, and we can activate it.
I got a crossed of a microbial species.
These are the second as people and the same.
We added some genes in the plus to the cross-for this crosis.
I demit with enzymous all of the proteins.
And it was pretty amazing when I put in the cell -- you'll appreciate the beauty -- the cross of the cross-grade -- and the cross has been in the cell.
And in fact, I thought this is how far it can go and go and try to design the process of something more and more and more than ever.
This is a major mechanism mechanisms of evolution.
We are all kinds of species that have been corporated by a second crosis, or a third of the other hand, or a third of the other party, thousands of new characteristics of the characteristics of the characteristics of the characteristics of the characteristics that are the characteristics that have been embracing the specific specific specifically on the other side that they have a second crosis of the characteristics that they have a second
So the ones that are thinking about evolution just as a single gene of changing the biology of biology.
They're called enzymous restricted by restriction, which actually had the DNA.
Cosphorus that was in the cell that was not a one.
The colored -- the cross-gone that we put us --
It was extent and recognized the other cross-like materialist as the material as the gone, and so we got to the new cross-on the new cross-the new cross-the new cross-cell.
It became blue because of genes that we put in the crosis.
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristics of a species have lost in a whole new species, and it was a new basic species, which we put in the software that we put in the cell that we put in the cell that we put in the cell that we put in the cell time.
All the proteins have been changing, the membranes have been changing, when we focus -- when we focus on the genetic code of the protein that we transferred the protein.
That can sound like the hygenome, but we can move the software of DNA that DNA that is pretty dramatic atic atic atic atic things like dramatic dramatic atic alone.
Now, I supported that this is not genesis -- but half billion years old, and half billion years and we support that we can actually support that we can actually be a new version of the explosion, which has a new specific version of the digital project, which is based on the digital projects.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obviously obviously of the needle of needs.
We're on the way to go from six and half to six to nine billion people over 40 years.
To put this in context for me in context for me in the 19466.
There are three people on the plane for every one of us in 19466, in 40 years, will be four.
We have a routinely required water water water to the potable water and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half and half billion and half the billions of the forest.
It will be difficult to do it for us.
We use over five billion tons of the book, more than 30 billion of oil stills of oil
That's a hundred million barrels a day.
When we try to think about procing the biological or whatever the process that will replace to replace that will be a lot of the challenge.
And then of course, it's all the CO2 is all the way that we get into the atmosphere.
Now, from our discoveries around the world, we have a data data with over 20 million genes, and I like to think of these as the design components of the design of the future.
The electrons have just a doubt of the electronics has just a result, or the diversity that came out of this.
We are limited here, first of all, a biological reality and the imagination and the imagination and the imagination.
We now have the techniques, because of these quarters are to do what we call genymmetric.
We have the ability to build a big robot that to do a million cross on the day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of these 20 million genes of genes or try to make the occupy procle products of our pharmaceutical products of new pharmaceutical products of molecular than the last 20 years of all the biology than the last 20 years of all the science.
And that's just the standard selection of standard.
We can sell for viable to do chemical substance or chemicals or the clothes, production products of vaccines, the city.
This is a piece of screen design design that we work on the design of which we can expect to do and work on these species in the computer.
You know, we don't know how it will show you how it will show you.
We know exactly how they look at the genetic code of the genetic code
We now focus on the fuel on the box of the generation.
You saw recycle in the ethanol is just a bad experiment that was just a bad experiment that was just a bad experiment
We have the generation of the generation of the third and the third one that they will come out of the busts of the bustble flower or different types of buttons or different types of buttons or different types of buttons of the buttons of the buttons of the dollar generation of the next to the buttons of the generation of the dollar generation of the dollar generation of the buttons that are going to get larger
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact on the food and the food and the fall of the food and the fall of the way of CO2 as the first one of the first stem cells to do with the cells to design for this go, and we think that we would have the first goal of the generation of the fourth generation of the generation of the fourth of the generation of the fourth of the generation of the 30s.
Low and CO2 is a way -- but in our discoveries of our world around the world around the world we have all kinds of ways of the world have all kinds of ways of the world have all kinds of ways of the world have all kinds of ways of solar and CO2 O2 is a way of the O2 is a way of the O2 is a way of the O2 is a way of our world we have all kinds of ways of the world around the world we have all kinds of quotes around the world around the world around the world we have all kinds of other ways.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It goes into the deep ocean ocean ocean ocean ocean and about two kilometers and half in the deep, at the temperature of the farming of fierbing.
Transform CO2 in metan used molecular biology that the surface of the energy of the energy of the energy of
We try to see if we can take CO2 captured in the country that can be transported in the country, and converted that CO2 it back in the buster buster to lead this process.
So in a short period of time, we think we could move what is the question of "What is life?"
We actually know -- you know -- we have the whole of the chemistry of the chemical.
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where another part.
So to become a majority of energy.
But we also work now to use these same same source to invention starts to the surface of the vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of the same thing.
You saw this year with the boat, we're always with a year and a dollar in the right vaccine.
I think the situation can be changing vaccinated by any of the combined vaccines of any of the time.
Here's how the way they could look at the future of the future of evolution that we can see the evolution of the evolution with bacteria with bacteria and finally, eukarans.
We are almost to improve people.
Our bone is just to make sure that we have a little chance to survive pretty much long, so I can do that. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you first to you first -- it's a new technology, a new technology that we've added at Microsoft as part of a little box of a year. This is Sealololovely a year.
It's an average that can interact with a lot of visual data from visual data.
We now look at a lot of digital pictures and so many of the digital and marriage and marriage on the continue to anyone in the rearranging anything.
It doesn't matter how much information we are the inhabited of the big data or how big are the images or how big are images.
Most of the people are taken with a new new camera camera, but that's a picture of the Bible scanning from the Bible Congress, the law of the 300 meapix.
It doesn't really relate because the only thing that the only thing that the only one of the top of your monitoring pixels to a very long time of the monitor architecture of a very flow.
This is a book of the three, an example of a sudden.
It's about "Catheist" -- Charles Dickens. The coloan is a colored capita.
To show you that it's about text, and not a image, we can do something like this, to show that it's a real representation of a text; it's not a position of a text; it's not a position of a text.
It can be an artificial way to read a book in the electronic formed on the electronic form.
I wouldn't give you the recommend.
This is a more real. It's a more real.
Every very picture represents the beginning of a second.
This is really gives you a piece of joy of a plant experience of a quote table or a revia or a revia or a multi-dimensional environment.
We did something small and we did something small with this number of the number of "Gardianul."
I created a fake reclaim to a very large resolution -- much more than any clear -- and we have a common contains a consistent contains a consistent contains a contains of a confusion of a fake reclaimed reclaimed soldier to a very large resolution of a very large resolution of the resolution of the way --
If you want to see the properties of this carriage of the car, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the technical specifications.
And this really is by the ideas, the law of the limits of a monitor.
We hope that this is to be the elevating pop-based and other kinds of dirty and other kinds of as -- which are not necessary.
Of course, the mapping is one of the applications of the technology of the kind of like this.
I won't get much time on this for a long time to tell you that we have to tell you that we have to tell you that in this field.
These are all the roads in the United States of the United States of NASA.
We go to now something.
This is actually active on the Internet active account.
This is a project called Pegosynth, which is two different technologies. The other one of them is Sealoon and the other other visual research in the visual wave of visual perception of the visual perception of the University of Washington Savon Washington, released See Life at the U.S.
and Rick Szelisiski at Cerror Microsoft. A beautiful colleague.
So this is active on the Internet. Pose.
You can see that when we create that when we create this kind of perspective, when we can navigate in many ways.
But the space of space is the space of these images matched in this image.
Oghasn't been visually recorded these images have been together with the real places where these things are doing with the Grass' Lacks -- they were doing over the Lacks -- they were done by the Grassing of Canadienemies here of a projections here and these elements here are the related or panordered and these elements have been related or pandemics.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other media.
There are some of the space that have much more space of space.
I want to go to go to one of the original corner of Noah -- this does a lot of time in a lot of time, to show you what I thought in the vast -- to show you what I think is the pipeline of this technology, the technology of this technology, the technology of this technology, the Posyny. It's not just obviously just by visions the projections that we put on the website.
We had to care about the lawyer aspects of the law of the law --
This is a reconstruction of Catedral-based images of Flickr. Does Flickr. Does Flickr, and you find something with with the guilty in the tricks in the trick, and every one of these conportraits of the tricks of the code of this model of model that was found that it was found that the cooled of this model of the pattern.
These are a Flickr, and all of the space of space in this way.
We can just navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I would get to work to work on Microsoft is very quote to part of the first one of the first one of the first time.
I don't see that I'm noticed that I'm a lot of the camera, all of the stroke of the cell on the SLRs in LRs in LR-R-LR-R-L-R-LR-R-LR-R-R-R-R-R-Raissized in this environment.
If you can see, I will find out the weird of these strange ways.
There are so many trusted by fear, so many of the feature,
The only will the picture of photography --
This is a poster of Novel Dames who was recorded the right now.
You can get the poster to a physicist environment of this environment of the environment.
The idea is that they can do certain things with social environmental environment. This is to collection from all the world -- from the world -- from the world visual -- and to interconnect that Earth's visual position, they have been connected to the whole whole lot of these photographs that is more than the summer than the summer than the percent.
You have a model of what comes out of the whole Earth.
Think about this as a long as the code of Stephen Lawler Lawler "The Earth Viralture."
And this creates in complexity as the world as the world as much as the benefits of benefits as they use it.
The teaches are the pictures of metaphors that somebody else has ended up to the end.
If someone eaten all these sfined style and he says, who I call it the November Did Ds would improve all these dates, and I could have to use it as a sense of social displaying with this kind of social social interactions.
And of course, a product product, but all of these are the huge models and the virtual models of the Earth's parts of the Earth, and in the earthquake and images of the village of the village and images of the village of the collective and images of a collective citizen building.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood the right thing? What will allow the software to a moment in the next few years, is like a few years old, is like all the pictures of somebody on a piece of mush?
BAA: Yeah. So what does is to look like.
It creates hyper-lined hyper-fires.
And it does that based on the concept of the images.
And this is what it's becoming a wealth of the significant information that they have those images.
As you do a time of imaging image, you look at the Internet, and you have a lot of the Internet gives you a lot of information on what represents of information about what the position is the position.
Now, what if that picture is the connection of all the pictures of all the pictures of the posities?
And then the amount of interconnection and the disease that is the tree of this is where the classical effect.
CA: Blaise, is really incredible. Felics.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense plant plunits journey and one of the methods of the ethography is the old of the old who don't look at the old board, who don't feel the last peak in the board, they still feel the pload in the streets of plots of pload.
You don't know that the Jaguans have gone around the Callie of the Laccount of the people who are still resones with the Himalaia or that in Himalaia continues to remember the center of Dharming is to remember the center of the anthropology of anthropology, and this idea is not just the idea that we live in a sense of the world that we live in a model of reality, but this is just a lot of the world of the world of the world that we live in a lot of the world of the world that we live in the world that we live in a lot of the world of the world of the world of the world that we live in which is not just a lot of the
The consequence of a certain set of decision-makers that are the straight of our ancestors in the next generations.
And of course, we all share the same imperative adaptions.
We all are born of us. We all bring kids on the world.
We are now by the initial rituals.
We need to do separate separate from the dead, so we should not surprise, so we should all have the playing, dancing, with the art.
But what is interesting is the unit of the song, the rhythm of the dancing every culture.
The fact is the Penania in the Penano in Borneo, or the Voodoo in Haiti, or the war in Haiti, or the Saisdoo of the Kaisnel Curander, the tribes of the Saharan Davaharan Saharan Dutch of Saharan Arab Lahas' Curand.

And this idea, if you think of it, it can't play your hope.
Now, the miridges of the world with a spirit of spirit and cultural life that cooker and is the way to the planet as important for the health of the planet as the biological network of life, known as the biological networks.
And you might think about this network as being the whole life as the ethose, and you could definitely define as the suit of the intuitial of the intuitial images of the intuitial imagination of the human imagination of the conscience.

I want to say two words about the same.
175 sets of the supermarket, that if we don't code and the 10 different types of widespread and the 10 different kinds of waters and the 12 different owns that you can buy the injuries that can make your own own injuries in a very large numbers of the houses in a very big case that no matter in the case that no matter in the 75 that no one of the 175 that they don't have the whole whole whole stroke of the 175 different parts of the cities of the 175 different houses of the static static stage of the stage of the stage of the last 75-od
So it's so much of the supermarket.
And then you go to the store store the electrical components to get a stereo system -- CD, CDytotophone, the transformat.
And in this room, the electrical stereotype of the systems of system.
We can confidence six million and half million of the stereo stereo stereo stereotypt.
You have to recognize that this means a lot of options.
In other fields -- in the world of communication.
It existed a wholever, when I was a kid, where you could get any kind of a phone service as much as it was offered by the Muslim Bell.
The eye of the phone.
And by the way, one of the consequence of this actually was the phone was not the strength of the consequence.
And those days are much apused.
Now, we have a diversity of the mobile diversity of the phones that are in the world of mobile phones in the world of mobile phones in the world of mobile phones that we have a whole new diverse.
These are the mobile future.
My passage is the one of the mid--- MP3 player, apart from the nas and the tuned of the same.
And if you have never seen in the store you can still get the stuck in the stage of the state.

And you know what the answer is the answer to the question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to buy a phone that to be able to find a phone that to don't know much of it.
And in other fields that are much more important than bugs that are much more than bugs of options.
The health care -- in the United States -- in the United States is not going to take you to the doctor and that tells you what to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor and you say, we have the various various of B.
It has these advantage has these risks.
By has these advantage has these risks. What do you want to do?
And you say, "Doctors, what do you do?" And the doctor says, "It has these advantage and these drugs and the risks and the risks and the risks and the risks of these risks and risks of these risks and risks to the rise of the risks.
What do you want to do?
And you say, "But if you were in my place?" And the doctor says, "But the doctor says, "But I'm not in your own patient is -- the result is -- you tell them what it is -- what a patient do is a big thing.
But what is actually is a transition and decision-making and decision-making making accounts of somebody who knows something -- in this case -- to somebody who knows anything and it's almost certainly not as the disease -- and it's almost not in the patient -- this patient -- in this patient -- in this patient.
There's a huge levels of public public health for drugs with the reetal reette of people like me and as I think of a little lot, because if you don't know a lot, because we can't buy them.
Why do we add the narratives to us if we don't we can buy them it?
The answer is that the people who do this is expectancy to call the doctors in the morning and ask them to change our network and ask them to change our networks.
Somebody as important as our identity has become a problem of choice, and this transition of the role of the role of the role to show this.
that we don't move a identity of a identity but we have the possibility of the invention of the invention of it.
And we can reinvent any of the fine we have check the champips.
And that means that every day when you go to get you have to decide what kind of like to be able to do that.
With all the respect for the truth and family had a fear that the presuit that was just the way that the beginning, and then you have to get the kids as long as you get kids to get the kids to get the children as quickly.

I should I get to the less? I should have been children, or a car? All of you have to do you get the questions that consumption.
And they will answer to these questions, no matter if that is to not to make all the topics that are not going to take a note to the cure of my curves of my curves of my curves of my curves of my curves of my curves to the cure answers.
And that's what you have to do. These are important questions that we need to answer it.
The unlike -- we're blessed and the Carl and Carl and Carl with technology that allows us to work every mind, every minute in every mind, a little bit of every day -- less from the SRandphenomena.

So anywhere where in our lives, big things and small things that are the style of life, life, life is a kind of of options.
And the world I was living like this.
To say that, I had some choices to do it, but it was not all the way to the option.
And the world we live now looks like this.
And the question is, is good or or do?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what I know is good at this, so I will talk about what I am going to talk about what is about.
All these choices have two types of effects on people.
One of the effect, the paradoxically, is that it produces the parallel than release than release release than release
With many options that can choose to choice, people can choose to choose to choose for something like something like that.

And what he found is that for every 10 phildlife that offer the employees of the employees of the participants with two percentage of the participation.
You know, 50 feet of mutations -- they are rewrite 10 to 10 to 10 to the people are getting less than if you give you only a whip if you give you one of the bed. Why?
Because with 50 mutations of mutations of the naid of choice, is the naid to choose what you want to choose to choose and so you can get it to choices.
And then then the potttttttttis and the clusters and the clusters and the clusters and that is not the time it is.
You understand that this is not just that that they don't just like the food for the door of the food after the pension, because they don't have enough money to put money on the way to put a decision-making is so hard to make the amount of money from the compensation of the compensation of the compensation of the compensation of the compensy of the compensation.
I was looking at the left-hand from the top of 5,000 dollars a year from the employee of the employees that would pay the happy foot of compensation.
So the credit is a consequence when you have too many options.
And I think that makes the world look like this.
You really want to take the best choice if it's for all the eernity of the eernity of the ernity of the ernity of the ernity of the eernity of the choice of the decision, right?
You don't want to choose from investing or even the one of the wrong or the wind to save the wrong thing to save the wrong thing to do is the wrong thing.
So this is a effect. The second is that if we were able to keep the station of the strength and make a little bit of the election of elections than we have been able to choose to the result of the election of choice than we choose to choose to choose to choose the choice of choice.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that we had a lot of snapped out of the people who want to choose one and it's not a perfect -- and it's not a right -- and you know, is the soap for safet?
It's easy to imagine that you have been able to imagine that there was a different choice that would be better choice. And what happens is that alternate you would imagine the regret of the choice that you've done and these regret regret from the satisfaction that you get to the election that you get to the election of the election that you get a good decision.
The more options of the more options to regret to regret something that is disappointed with the option that you have alone.
Second of all, what economists call the cost cost of opportunity.
Dan Gilber Gilber demonstrated very clearly speaking about how we avoid things that we compare things that we compare to what you compare to what you compare to what you compare to what we compare to them.
Well, when I'm a lot of alternative with the alternative of the alternative to imagine the characteristics of the alternative attacks, and that makes you less satisfied with alternative alternative to get a little bit of alternative that you have a little bit of alternative that you have a little bit of alternative that you have alone.
Here's an example. I asked the people who are not New Yorkers who are not New Yorkers are not New York's here.
But here's how we should we did.
We have this box in Hamptones.
A very expensive properties.
It is a little bit of a little day. They have all the way to have the bed.
What could they want to want more and requires the draccount of the pull out of the pulse.
All of my cartier cartier in Manhattan is coming out.
I could just like in front of the office." And I spend two weeks of the idea that the snakes, to have a place of parking parking for a day to have a place that great parasyzed place to have a place that great paradigm for the desk.
The strength of the satisfaction that we have on the election that we have the exception of choice is executed.
And the more options of the most options of the people who are being in the required with these options will be perceived as we have been perceived as we have a opportunity for opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon tells a lot of things.
We should have that we should live the slipper, and probably we should do things the slower
But one of the things that we tell is that anybody is that anybody is to make other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things that are going to have a lot of attempts that you do less attack.
The third thing is expanding the expectance.
And that was what I wanted to replace me to replace my bluegies.
I see almost all the time.
And there was a way that the people were one like a single one and you buy them and you buy them as a dracking and they were incredibly unknown and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you get them to stay more than the time and the spells of long as they started to stay better.
So I went to replace my blankly after I had been good for the old and I said, "Look, I want a wall of the same, I want a tunnel to be the snakes, and the welful, sweet "Would you like to be smillennight, welcome to be sick, and the right light, and I said, "Would you like to get the old and I said, "Look at the old and I want a check for a chicken to get the old and I want to get the old to get the old to be the old to be the old to be the old and I want
Do you want to be with far? Do you want to prepared or your farming or your weight or the see?
Do you want to be able to do that?
You want to avoid it to skip the smiling flowing --
He painted me and he painted her after I said, "I want to be the guy who were the only guy who were the only kind of crazy that was the only one of the guy, so I have a blint of the walls of the walls -- the truth of the walls -- the truth -- the truth -- the truth of the wooden I had the right -- the way I had the right of the right of the ones I had the right of the guy.
I have been done better. All of these options have done to choose to choose better.
But I was feeling more worse than I was getting worse.
Why? I wrote a book in which I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt worse is that I felt worth that we had all these options of these expectations about how I should be a wall have grown to be a wall ground.
I had very flowing expectations of the way that was not expected when they were just like a single same.
When I am 100 sisters, my mother, my mother, one of them have to be perfect.
And what we get was good, but not perfect.
So I compared what I got with what I expanding and the result is that we were disappointed in compared to what I hope is that I hope to hope that I hope is what I hope to hope that I was really hopeled what I was hopeled with what I did with what I expected with what I expanding with what I expanding and I was disdisdisappointed to what I was dis
The people in the options in the lives of people can't do something else.
And the right to the next to get more satisfaction to the satisfaction of good results of good results.
No one in the market market knows that.
Because if you know, I don't have the idea what I am not having an idea of what I talk about.
The real thing is more like this.
The reason that was the best when it was the best when it was that when it was really possible when people was really possible to experts were actually going to be able to be able to be paid surprise of surprise that people are going to pay the surprise of the source of the things that was the best when they were worse was worse when she was worse was worse than when they were worse than the people to be the
Today we live -- we live -- we live -- we are industrialized and we look at the perfect and we look at the perfect thing that you can hope that things will be so good to be so good that things will be so good at how much they expect the things that they can be so good at all.
You never never have been paying the expectations of the expectations and my fingers and I would have to certainly to the sky.
The happiness of happiness -- this is to all -- the happiness of happiness is to have expectations to have expectations to have expectations.
I want to say -- just a quick moment -- that I actually have a little bit of a wonderful thing, and it's really a wonderful thing.
I couldn't find something better to find out a better way.
But let me expect your house doesn't necessarily not necessarily much of that is so red.
And then a consequence of a bubble wall of you don't know when you can't buy a single one is when you can buy a single one as you can't get your own one as that is the answer to why that is the answer is that the answer is the core response is the answer.
The world is say. Which is the wood?
When they're hundreds of different stars of different stars and buy a lot of disappear one that you can get the wrong and you ask yourself, what?
It's like the answer to the answer to the question of the question:
You could have a better choice to choose better.
With a hundred different kinds of bluggling to choose to choose to choose to the state.
So when people take decisions, even when people take decisions that are good results that are good that they feel disappoints of them, they are good to get out.
The deeply of the erupon the ground in the world of the last generation.
I think a big contribution -- not the only thing -- but the important thing to do is the depression of the synose, is that people have experiences that are disappointed because standards are too high from their experience are too high in their own experiences.
And when you have to explain these experiences believe that they are being slow.
So the result of the general is that we take a little bit more objective and we feel more worse than we feel so.
So let me remind you remind.
This is the doctrofofiticiency that we all believe and it's really true and it's not true.
And no discussion that you have a couple of choices is better than nice, but here don't know that many choices are better than a few choices are better than a few choices than a few choices than a few choices than a little bit of the choice is to have a couple of choices than a few choices that are better than the choice is to have a couple of choices than the choices of choice is better than the
There's a magnificent. I don't know that
But I'm pretty sure that we went from that point where the choice is the way that the still,
Now, the idea -- I almost finally finally finally -- the idea that I think is this.
What allows these choices to all these choices in the industrialized material.
There are a lot of places in the world and we heard of a few of them are not there are much of options.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the thing about talking about is a strange problem of the Western society and rich societies.
And what is frustrating and the south is this: Steve Levitt talks about how these chachairs for children and hard to install the way you can get the money on the gone.
What I tell you is that these options on and complicated and complicated not only help.
They actually actually required the pain.
They really do worse we feel more worse than we do.
If something that allows us to do in our society to make all the elections that we do all have been transferred in society that people have too little equal lights that people have too little lived in the options of that are the amorry.
That's what economists saying.
Redwware going to do better to be the better -- not just people -- not just people -- because of how this extension of the choice of choices.
In conclusions. They prepared that characters, and it's a person to say, "Wo! What does the cook?" What does you know is the fish cook?
You know anything that is that it is possible in this accounting, a poor on the world -- so I read it and I read it and I read it and I read it and I read it and I read it and I read it out.
But the more I thought I was the more I got to think of the knows of something that I was going to think of something like this.
Because the truth is that if you hope that everything to be possible, not have freedom of the freedom.
If you hope that all that is possible, so much possible to see the state of the satisfaction.
You think of the demand the expand.
Anyone of the role needs of the act.
This is almost too limited -- probably even for a fish -- probably a fish for us.
But the absence of a metaphor of metaphor for unfortunate and unfortunate the unfortunate and the consists of the bed.
Thank you very much.
