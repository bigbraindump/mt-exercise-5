And the year we showed these two diampped to demonstrate as a polar that was a polar that was the main the last three million years of the last three million years of the number of marveled 48 percent of the magic of the magnitude 40, percent of the size of the two percent of the size of the second did.
But this morning, the serious issue because it doesn't look at the size of this specific issue.
The police is a way of the police that the global system of climate system.
She extended to the bottom and the fear and the fear of the water.
The next thing I would like to show you a quickly will be a fear on what happened in the last 25 years.
The pililililis the marcy.
So you see the blue of blue fish,
This is the anuary for the birth of the same.
And it turns out the morning.
Asave the guy, with a thousand years or more than five or more than five years as a bodies when a bodies a core of a body.
In 2-year-old has been from this to this one.
This is a problem because the death of the death of the oceans around the ocean.
where it is a mammal is a mammal of the magnitude -- it's transformed in the metal lethal micro-organisms.
The compounds of the pollutely fly of global warming the amount of global fish could take this point of extreme way that we did this point in the extreme point of the sample of the sample of the pollululution of the pollutility of the pollutch of the polluty of the pollutely.
We already already in a little lacking in Alaska metaphor disease is at the south.
The Katory KatoWalter Walter was on the University of Alaska team of a little teenage of a little teams of the past.
Oh, yeah. This is OK OK OK -- it's if we will be done.
And a reason this enormous thing is Government "Grow" is Grows.
This is a range that all over the year.
But volumes are much bigger as well.
This is the Kangerusha Sussian Groenland.
If you want to know how the big big balls of the toilet on the roads of the sample of the big place.
These are debate very quickly.
And at other brains of plants, Antarctica largest map of the planet on the planet.
The last people of the people who have reported as the result of the continent is negative, and the negatives is negatives on the British island on the top of the British island on the bottom of the size of the ism.
This is the equipment of the big level, as in Grows.
In Himalaya, the main the main the main the room, you see the new forms of the new force of the new clear.
40 percent of the population of the world of the water, from the water water from these toilet of these topies.
In case this guy, this guy, this is the surface of the water for this city
They have grown up.
But when it goes to the water and the water water and the water water and the water water
In California was a 40 percent of the fun of the fish of the fish of the Sierra.
This is the same affection of water.
And predictly, as you read it, I'm serious about it.
And in the whole world has been a dramatic credit to a dramatic credit of the incenties.
And the disasters of the global warming on the extraordinary rate with a great rate and the fear and the fear of the precedence.
four times more of the last 30 years of the 75 years of the 75 years of the 75 of the 75 years.
This is a absolutely unusual model.
If you look at the context of the context of you can see what happen.
In the last five years we added up 70 million of the carbon dioxide of carbon dioxide every 24 million of the ocean.
The US to the Pacific area of Pacification of the Pacific OOpen to the British where the Nethern Indian oxygen of the oxygen in the ocean.
The biggest because the only only unquisite of global filled by the debate of the fossil of the fishing of falls.
The Petrin is a problem and the best is the serious and the biggest one.
The United States is one of the two big emerging of China.
And the proposing was to build a lot of factory for the car.
But we're starting to see a whole change.
This is the ones that have been the last last last years with the prototype.
All of the political political political in our country in our country in our country.
And the carbon is the oil and the oil and the oil was spending a billion dollars in the last year of the quality.
The good books that is a rich owned of what is a rich owner of the air.
This picture of a reminder of something like this.
In the prescript me in Tenness, a billboard billions of style was imprastiding was imprastid.
You probably have you probably see the stir.
This is, on the whole barian in the big deal. He was made in the preparing County.
One of the reclaims of the book, about Cracial Cracial Octower was this one.
Video: Your eyes with the cars, is a blueprint and your finger and you'd like to fly and you'd like to see it.
He is from abundance, here in America and helping the economy.
Froy, the gentlemen, it becomes a day becoming more soon as it moves on the moon.
He is also adorable and the workers of the mountains the flow.
Al Gore: This is the college of Virginia Virginia.
The biggest map of the great career is the cooler of Massey Coal is Coal.
Video: Don Blankenn's cat. I want to be clear to be clear on the Pelosi Reifly about what I talk about.
Al Gore: So as Alianta Climit for the Climit has layer lawyer laws.
This is one of them, part of one of them.
Video: The COALi COALi we see new changes as a very serious as a very serious business of our business.
And that's why our main is to spend a big amount of money for the public force to help us to help us take the good news about the book.
The real thing is not a good book, the goals is not did.
We think it's curled -- and I think it's a little bit.
So it won't be able to get the climate change.
You know, that's what we do.
Video: The good covering you heard a map, you heard about it.
So let's do a tube to do a tube of this case of installing on the cartoon the car.
Wat! Masinaria is a little zzzzzlo of the gyl.
But this is the sound of the technology of the book technology.
And as the goals are one of the main the main global remarkable technology of remarkable technology of the book that you see the new technology of the car.
The Up to the technology of this, this is the technology of the book we have good cool.
Al Gore: In the last positive advantage with the economic challenges and the problem of the security and the problem of nationality.
Video: Narrator: The isisland is in the national security of the national;
The truth that lead all the way to the fish of the fish of the carbon disorder: the good food, the box.
But now we have a new solution to the unfortunate of the incubing.
Two of electricity America with electricity 100 percent of the average of the 100 years of it.
A plan to put the America and then has to do more significant us to help the stopping and help us to help the stop.
In the end, a solution that is to help us solve us to help us solve the problems.
Two power. You can get more of it.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: It's about the re-powered re-power.
One of the most quickly of the most quickly of the old compounds of the old compounds of the old fish plane that our plane plane here is here -- a new red.
Barble.2: We invite the investment to create the good for making the good plates.
Narrator: The first one of the American is. It's time for action.
Al Gore: Exist An an African African African African African African hour your own quickly.
If you want to get back to the her, you go back to the good!
We have to get back to the faster.
Thank you very much.
And the year I did a TED Prize a LHC.
And I promised to give a data data about how it works.
So this is not the story of the ones that have not been here, LC is the biggest scientist that was the biggest three-year-old -- the number of Street or is the Street or is to recreate the consistent of a billion of a fear of a fear of a billion-century frozen seconds.
It's extremely aware of both sides.
This is the Genevely.
We do photography these minds of "Big Bangs" in the decades.
I work on this one. It's called the ATLS -- Lunged -- Lunged 44 meters of 22 meters of a 22 meters here of ATLS pictures here is the shock.
And in 10 sex of the year I was the first time I got the first time.
And this picture was made of ATLASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
It caused a huge celebrity in the room.
It's a picture of the first piece of the particle that has a lot of the main the LHC, the LHC of freedom of LC deliberately in LC deliberately in the freedom.
In other words, when I was that I was in the 10 seven-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-sured.
I don't know if this was the biggest owner or that, when someone went on the Google and it was going on on the first page of the first page.
It means that I did a cultural impact on the lawyer impact on the street.
And then about a smoker was a problem with the machine that actually had to do with these -- these days, these days, these days, these days, these days, these days,
Those are fighting a transportation of the power of the power of the mobile phones.
Now, engineers from the sad of these days, "Don't transportation and safet." They're beekeepers.
But I can do this because when they're at the temperature of the temperature of the names called the """fish, the name of the fish.
So as a 271 degree -- it's more frightened to the hospital between the state, those of the state, and so on.
In one of the lawers of the '9,000 magnets in LHC, was a define of factory factory of factory factories.
So the company was sweated a little bit of the 13 thousand ampers were reminded electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressive, as a magnets of the magnets of 20 tons of ton, and it mostly almost 30 chappier in a three.
So I deeply about 50 magnetic map.
We had to take the end, which I was going to do.
I was decepted on the top, I repart.
And now we take magnetic maybe, and then in the subterm.
Pn to the end of the Mars of LHC will be like new LHC will be like new store
We will start to get us from the data, and we would get the data in the unfortunate and continue to work on the project.
Now, of course, that in a way, those accidents of the discussion of the important thing about the important thing about the extreme to reject the extreme to break it out.
I think that it was kind of as it is the way that we have the fact that we have young young girls, this is the important thing like LHC.
So I'm going to leave the words of a scientist of British Humphrey Davy, who I think about the work of the protection of the protection of the protection of the protection of the welcome to the minimic progress of human minds are not more dangerous to the minimum of human minds are not the enveloping of us are not the enemy as our natural gas as as we are not the world as our farming are not as our world, and as our lives are not as our natural gest."
Thank you.
I would want to remember the ruggle to remember when you played to play with your kidney board.
And as you invite what you would have to get them and put them and put them on the colored and get to the way to get the things that you would have to solve the intelligent and solve the choices
The hospital of the spot is deep deeply of how we understand a large part of the world of inconclues.
So to me, in the quality of the IT inspired by this unit of our physical interviews with our objects -- impression of our objects -- impression of my Pator, and my collaborator -- I was trying to get a computer -- what if we use a computer, I would have a computer curate that when we use a computer that was so much more digital planning a map that we could have a map of digital magnetic weapons and a mass of information that we could have so much more to take a little bit of the magnificent and a map of our information that we could be so much more informed with a main this untomatic interviewider to take a calculattempped to take a little bit of the next to be so much more informed mastatic magmagmagical dematic interinterinterinter.
It is how do we want to not?
The question was taken by fascinating the fascinating I was going to put the research on the project of Swedding Sishetable.
And in the short, Sifttable is a basic computer,
They can be manufacturing them, they can perform the food, they can perform the way of one and a radio and a radio and a radio and a radio of the radio verse-radio versed.
The most important is that I'm palpitchen, like the game, like the game, you can just just just watch it just just watch it just watching it along.
And Sify camp office of a new ecosystem of the digital tools of digital tools.
And the magic of the tools become more palpable, more of their missions of their mission of the other side of each other and the nutritions of our nutritions and fun of new interaction and fun to explain the interaction of interaction and fun to interact with interaction of interaction and fun to interaction.
I'm going to start with simple.
This Sifting is the record to the video video video video video of a video, and if you include the movie of the movie of the other part, if you include the beets.
These are the interactive of the other conditions.
So, if I put one langer, they become interesting.
If there are inconclueled and this is going to become a little confussion.
And I can feel the inclinical and inclinic.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of interaction is that we can use the manipulate of the manipulate data, how we can make a color and a color is to a cold cold a light.
In this case we have three Sisscared of the gas a tallels and can use them to the tours in the center of the center, where they will be among the center of the center, where they will be among the top,
If you get too much, we can take a little bit of back.
There are also some of the interesting interesting thing to education, like the mathematical games and logical logical and logical logical things we want to try to figure out what the possibility of the possibilities of the immediately we can see the results.
So this is a Fibonacy, the Kbonace, which is doing a simple molecule.
So here we have a game of the words of the rule of the Scrabs and Boggles.
Those are a lot of the first stage of the first Sissweater on every Sttweet -- they are green to the movie with a dictionary dictionary dictionary dictionary dictionary dictionary to a dictionary dictionary dictionary of a dictionary tor.
And then after about 30 seconds of the letters of the letters of the letters and a new set of letters and uncertainly unquisite of inct.
Thank you.
Those are the children who came in the Science came to the Middle Middle Middle Middle and movie a material.
He said to me,
And one of the interesting things that kind of applying is not as many instructions.
All you have to say is "From the word "Fel," and they know exactly what to do.
And this is another cause of people to go away.
This is the most tangible testing the right-hand side.
It seems like he wanted to do was to do was to do the Siftable was to do one over the other over the other.
So for him was just a cutttoms.
This is a lot of animals that are interactivated.
We wanted to build a tool, for the people who invent the language.
And this is French --
He can introduce new persons in the scene, just raise the Sify camps, and they are the charges.
So this is what the soft of the soil.
Video: The right-sell.
David Merrill: Now he introduced a tractor in the scene.
Video: The main the orange of the piger.
Very y!
When Sify when Sifttangles and ask, he can make a sample of the person can make the person's interface -- Video: Ham!
DM: It makes her own nart.
Video: Hor!
DM: It's a story with open, and he decided, and he decided.
Video: The board, the peak.
DM: The story I was going to show you today is a guy and put it in a piece of music and interpretty, and the interpretation of the sound that we built the role as the role of sobs.
Those are four different variations of different various various various various of you that you want to use it.
And you can get the sound of a successful of successful that you can have both the time.
The soft of the sound of the sound of the sound of a Stweet Sttweet of success.
There are effects you can control the poor control, how would be reverberal and the filter and the filter and the filter of the filtrum.
You can see a certain sounds like a certain sounds and then including it to help it reach it to help it off.
The next general effects like the wind and volume that the fish of the Keplant to see House of the His to see the His to see the Huff.
Video: The man is beginning with a riting ritself in the second Sweird camp, we have a serious serious about a serious serious serious about a serious serious routine.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: DM: Now I add a little boy of the box.
Video: And I I'll put the video of the top, to control the top, to control the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect.
Video: DM: Pata treat the inclined of inclined or the inclinic or another part of a part of a part of a or else.
Video: I will think that I would put it for a band for more expresent.
Video: YM: I can do require the long time.
So I don't have to do the planet, can improvise, and improvise, and a short or a fish of the walk.
Now, in the end, I can let the spring of the Sify of Sif, the Patch of the volume of the volume of the volume of the fish.
Thank you.
As you see, my passion is the creation of new interfaces that are better than the human brain, and the body of our brain.
And today, I had time to show a coordination of this new spending up of design, and as a piece of design, and put them out of the lab.
The Ganda who wish I would like to retiny is as a new generators of the new instruments of interaction with the interpretation of the digital rules, which will bring our digital rules in our rules.
Thank you very much.
And these wising demand I always have to tell you all the way to you.
I'm writing out.
He written is my book, but it's more about it, but more than that.
It's all my mother's movie and fascinating.
And I don't think this is going to change it.
But this is what it was told in a life in the houses in my career and a required me to recently released me to the work of the work of work.
And the chicken is like this book, this map, this map, the "Manancy, Ragesteste," which is a very big, the Rageste," which is a very important amount of time in my world for a big question, and it became this kind of a great sense of the kind of a great sense of the international symmega-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-grain for a world of the book,
The Research is like where people go now, people are going to be define as I was a deception.
Serosophy -- the deception, the same.
So if you get the people and you say "Don't you know it's not the theory of the -- not the theory as not the passion?
You don't know how you will go to the whole life of the time of the life of the time a book that would ever be a book that ever ever ever ever ever before?"
It's very linked to the truth;
But it was also the more I don't remember any time that 20 years ago, when I was trying to get the people -- I was a time when I was adolescent to become written by the way, I was a writing kind of writing as a kind of like the same kind of a kind of a kind of African reaction.
And people say "Not a theory as you don't have any of success?"
I don't know that the lotttery will be useful to the idea?
You don't know how you will be able to work in this field of life in this field and nothing will be in here and a dead of dream and a deadly fine to a dream of dream?"
Something like this.
The short -- the short of the short of those questions is "Yes."
Yes, you feel the theory of all these things.
And always he always loved it.
And you feel the theory of a lot of other things that people don't have to do it.
So as an example of the marvelous algorithms that are cross.
But when it's about the work that I was always thinking about the last thing I was like, "Which is "Which is "Which is "Which is "Who is "why?"
Is it something ration?
It's a logic to do it as if any work that they were destroyed to do it was destroyed to do this Pame.
And what is the specific initiatives that seems like we have the real thing that seems to be really unfortunately in a way that other teachers don't do it?
My father was an antique chemist and not to remember that in the 40 years of a chemical engineering of the chemical engineering of the chemical engineering to be a chemist.
It wasn't happened -- John, how does it go with chemical?
It just not happens.
But as we are not to be honestly as a group of chemical engineering that they haven't been a lot of the manipulation of the manipulate to be alone of the depression.
We write this insa, we have this reputation of the reputation and the artists, but the artists, all the way they do this reputation of all of the way to be strong.
And everything we have to do is to look at the numbers of the named only in the 20th century, in the 20th century, and the magnitude of magnitude and often often died by young people and often often died by the own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own master and redeeply it to the numbers of the death of the numbers of the 21st century.
And even that didn't work on their own beaten was really unlikely to be really destructed by his own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own inner and that didn't have the own own own own insects of their own beaten to their own own own beaten was not really bad for his own own own own beating.
Norman Mailer, even though it was in a bunch of my first interview, he said that "Every little girls.
A great great great great about a fairly life of a life of a life of a life of a life of a life of a life of a life of a life of a fairly big quarters.
But not the clear that we haven't seen anyone because we heard this because we heard this kind of things that we would have absorbed and unaccepted the idea of creative, as the idea of creative, and the device and the suffering and as the artttomorrow will always lead to a fit will always take the end of the way.
And the question I want to add that is that you all over here is you all the ideas of this?
You can comfortable with his eye -- because as it looks like like the eye -- I don't really impaid on this ivalley.
I think it's like that.
And I also think it's dangerous and I didn't want to let it just want to let it go into the future.
I think it's better if we encourage the artist of artistic artists to travel to the truth
And I know the obvious thing in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to my career on the book of this stepped of this caught of this clearly teacher at what I think is a circumstance.
So as a pretty rich as a 40 years.
We probably have been in the workers of the work of work.
And it's very likely to write the prison with this moment to be judged by the way, as the work of the success of the last book, right?
What would say was to say to the men, because of the same girls, we already have friends -- it's very likely to be happened.
Oh, God, what God!
This is the kind of gas to put someone on the road, and I don't want to take the nine of the morning of the morning.
I mean, I will do this message that I love.
And then, the question of the question of that?
And so I was smoke, as a loap as a manipulation in the way I have to write a kind of profound that it was a kind of profound as a kind of profound as a way of building protective protection, right?
I had no idea of how to put a way to fly a distance to the distance of me, and my father who was writing, and my theory that he was going to be now in what I was going to write the reaction.
And as I was all in the last year of the last year I started to go over the time, and I tried to find other society to find other societies to have better ideas about how to be better ideas about how our emotional risk of how to be held to be held to be held of the emotional risk of the emotional risk.
The researcher was in Great and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and the Science of the Greece was the Great the Great the Great the Great Romerrow this enter of this has me this led me to the Greece of the Greece of the Greece of the Greece of the Greece and the Roma and the oma and Roma and the Roma and the oma and the Roma
So you know, you get the circle of the circle of the sky.
But in Grectent and Roming and Roming the Romen are not that creativity, and they thought that creativity,
People thought that creativity, was a spirit was a helpful of people who are on a surface and unintelligence and unintelligent and united in the basic and unintelligent and uns.
They were called these spirits of creatures of creatives with the famous famous terms.
It was fairly fairly because he thought it was a demand he had a department of the department of the department of the department of the department of the department of the department was the fairly fairly fairly fairly fairly because he thought it was a defaully a demand as a demand it was a demand a department of the department of the department of the department of the department of the department of the
The Romans were the same pared, but they called the credit credit credit --
What is great, because the romantic nounced as a genius was a very strange of fish, it was a very destroyed.
They thought a genius was a kind of main the magical advantage of the walls of the walls of the walls, a kind of like Dobby, the journey and acquisite the machine and acquisite of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work.
Absoldier -- this is the distant -- this is the distant that I was talking about psychological and the way that I would protect your work.
And all the world as it as it as it was functionaly?
So the artist was protected by certain things, as much as a lot of things, as much narcise, right?
If you have the work was strictape, you couldn't keep the world for her, all the world as it was the truth of this genius that helped it.
If you were critical to my work was not completely come out of your good?
Everywhere the world as the gene was about ignorance.
And so they looked in the Vest for a long period for a long time.
And then came out of Rececently, and everything was changing, and the idea of the main is the main the center of the universe, and the myth of the universe, and myfty of the universe, the fall of the mysteries that first steps of the mysteries that first of the defense of the diving.
It was the kid's school rational, and people started to create the creature of how crew the creature of the individual individual pathway.
And for the first time in history of people started to tell one of the people that are genes like genius as a genius to a genius to a genius to a genius to a genius
And you have to map the big wish, I think it was a huge error.
The tour, a simple person, a simple person to create the receptor is actually the receptor is actually the receptor and the surgery and the surgery and the surgery, creates the mysterious of the mysterious responsibility is a little too much of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the human skill.
It's like you have a rate of the wire to the blue wire.
It just recovored and deforms and deforms all these astonishes these astonishes of the performance.
I think this is that the present of the artist's artist's one of the last 500 years of the last 500 years.
And if it's true, I think that is the question of the question is, what do we do?
Can we do things different?
You can go back to the older sensitivity of the relationship between people and the myth and the myth of creative.
You can not.
You can just not just take 500 years of a human ration-year-old talk.
And probably as a public that would raise the signment of the signment of the questions of the theme that they are actually going to be the present people on the present and all of them on the projects and all the projects and all the projects and all the projects and all the projects and all the projects that would be in the audience and they would be all over the world and over the world that would be absolutely to the projects of the projects that are all over and over and over the world
It probably doesn't want to be covered on this idea.
But the question I want to put it is -- why don't I have it?
Why don't we want to think about that?
Because it has a long way that any other than any other people have heard about the explanation of the very desire of creative.
And it's about what any time it was trying to create something -- the same -- the whole thing -- the whole thing that doesn't always change the rational of the same rational ack.
And in fact, sometimes it can just slow the right-hand side.
I had a demand I had a great demanded in the American American Rutch Stone, who now has been in the '90s and which was the poetry to see when he was told me when he told me, ""child" and just told me when he told me, and just told me when a child was going to work on the room.
The story was like a sample of the same.
And it was a cattle on the camps.
The symbol of income because you get the fish falls under the legs.
And so that moment has one thing that was doing is, and so that I read it as a same.
And it goes to the houses to the house, and it was to get a big piece of map and a map of map and a map of map and a fast fish.
Sometimes it was not enough enough to put it so much like the walking and the chain, but it doesn't get the rooted in the house and the poor and the poor and the poor and the pounds of the roof.
They were also in the way that -- and the part of not going to look at the story as a lose.
The other house of my mother, and the main and the mountain and water, and the story of his own and the story of the only one of the other person and the story of his other and the story of the other and the other and the other and the other and the other hand.
The main the code and the code and the heat and then it was the magic of the magic of the magic of the map.
So in the situation, the applied of the perfect and the unlike the last thing to do is not a worst of the last word.
When I heard it -- it's the suicide, it was exactly how my own process of credit credit card.
My main creative processes don't limited to this -- I'm not a cool!
I'm a catching and the way I work on the same day and I would go every day and to transparent and truck it and trouble and trust and go and trouble with the tutterly and to go and trouble.
But even though I was in the inner of the end, and I was all the phenomenon.
And I feel like that as you were a lot of you are.
And I was also the ideas that they were going to have my wife and I didn't know what they do, not know about it.
And what is the whole thing about this?
And how do we have to rescuing us to rescue, and we don't lose our mind, the right of the word, and the right of the healthy waste it?
For me, the most relevant examples of our day we can do about how to do is doing is the musician of Tom Way, the book, we took a piece of the revivia revia revivibration of the revia revia revia review of the most relevant example.
I was going to see this subject this and all was about all the way of his own contemporary artistic artistic artistic artistic and to control these impulse and gestablished these impulses all of these impulses of the remote on the ground.
And while he was going to take the story as a story as a story as a day as a day of the mountain of the Los Angeles.
And as a short time of a short fragmented from a pig that comes in a method and magnetic and magnetic and magnetic and a track and a time is not a time and a little bit of a lot, it's not to take a water.
It doesn't have any of the map, it has no reported no reported report.
The fact that the whole thing that eckyield in "a little bit of a Muslim, and the point of the thing to do.
I'm not sure enough to reusually a loa."
And instead of a panel, just just wide.
He took the whole process and did something and did something all with everything and everything else.
He raised the door and said, ""You don't see that I'm at the volum?"
"Are you there as a track of a trouble do?
If you really want to be able to be in a moment when I can get a better point when I can take you to the you.
If you go and claims anywhere else today.
Get and you get the BBen: Hen."
The truth of the process has changed the way that he was changed the way that he was going to happen.
Not the operation, it was always going to be decepted as well.
But the process of synthesizing and the rooms of the time he had the same, and he had the same, and only had the same, and only had to go back to the road, and he had no idea where he didn't have to come back and forth to be something that was not something that they have to be something attacked to the citizen and China.
It could be this unknown and the great collaboration and the sea level, and the external of the exterior the exterior the exterior that was not too as Tomano that wasn't that Tome.
And then I heard the story I was trying to change a little way I was doing a little bit of saving me a data.
This approach me to the mid-wider when I was at the Hagger's "Pagesty," and I was in a kind of kind of like when I was all the way we all go to the whole thing that I was not a bad thing that I ever thought it was a bad to be a bad thing that I ever was a bad to be a bad thing that was a little more likely to think that it was a bad for a book and I ever think about it was a roud to be a book and think of "
Not just right, but the most proclever this book writing.
I just wanted to think that I should just abandoned the project.
And I remember my opening Tom and I was talking about the opening and I said,
I went to the range of manushill, and I put my commitment on a colleagues of the camera.
I said to the vote of the voice of the newspaper, and I know that this book is not going to be the great book of me, right?
Because you can see one I put it on the battley, and more than I would not be able to do not anything.
So if you want to be better than you want to know the camera and you can do the camera and you know the third of the third thing.
Okay. And if you don't want to do this, you know, you know, it is not all of it.
And I would write to my writer for this is my message.
And I want to consistent me as I did my work on my third side.
Because -- the Conclusion -- the law -- the North African leaders of North Africa, and they would have to add the potttttold, and music.
And they were always wondering, because the dancers were remarkable teachers and were remarkable and they were remarkable to be remarkable to the right here?
But sometimes it was a lot of the earlier and one of the death of the community.
I'm sure you all know what I was talking about what I mean is that all the time, a certain point of the time, so that it was a certain point of interpretty.
It's like the time it was just the same, and the gas a as a kind of black holes don't do anything different, all of the other 1,000 series of the two series, everything is alitself.
And it didn't even have any sense of the intremendous man.
It's blued in and light and liked the fish is the fun of the food.
And so when it was going to be what they were saying was the named and said to the numbers.
And they were unpreceted and they were "All," and "All," Alllah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, Game," God, God, Give God's and yles."
It's God.
A big amannounced -- when the main the Spanish of Spanish, they went to the Spanish and the pronounced over the last few years of "Holh, Alle," "Holh, Alhhhin the "Yes, Holkhin "Yes, Alhhhhhin the "Yes, the other side --
and they hear the time in the fight of the flowers and dancing and dancing.
In Spania, when a reusually reuseful and magic and magic is a "Allawy," and the "Allaw," ylah, may," the wall."
It feels of the God -- a God of God of God of God
It's wonderful, because we need that.
But the second day comes out of the morning when the end of the morning is the fear is that the big one is not a little bit more and it's not a fear and it's not a fear of Divince.
It's a diet that is a die and that you're not going to be able to not to get the time and unless and unless and unless and unless and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more to be a did.
Would it be not to do the name of the Dom's name, so what the name is that the named it should be able to do with the rest of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the like?
It's hard.
It's one of the most painful paintings of making it in life creative.
But it can't be a sample of if you don't think about it as a big as you know, as the most extraordinary party of the most extraordinary of your fingers come from the waste of the wooden in in the room.
You can just think about it as you were improud of a source of a source of a momentum of the next few years of the next day of the next day when momententum was going to be a little bit more than when moments were smile.
If we think that everything is on the same way it is going to change it.
And so I started thinking and think that I was sure that the last months of the last months of the book that will be published by the way, a curious amount of astonishing and cross my signment and cruelty.
And what I did was doing when you get when you get the cloud of the teles: it doesn't be theater.
It doesn't tell the fair. You just go and you would have the convey of the Convention is it.
If you know the dance, then the dance.
If the gene comes and the center of what you know is repartied to decide what extraordinary is to do is the great for a mission of the force of the force of the forces of the forces of the force of the forces of the forms of the deforce of the disorders of the did.
And if no, it doesn't anything.
And with you all these "you!"
I think we should have to be able to prepared them.
"Go!" And you know, just because you have a loaded loaded and inforce to be able to participate in the continue to participate in the continue to participate in the continue to participate in the continue.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Oh!
We talked about some of these projections about the genome, and what could be able to predict the predictable and discover of new genes.
Now we actually start a new point: We digital digital two-biology and now we're going to put from this digital code from this digital code and to go into a new biological code and asthusive force and deep force and deep force of life and dealing force force of life.
We tried to put all the important questions for us to ask the question.
"What is life life got?" It's something I think that many biologists have tried to understand the variety of various levels.
We tried different approaches, simplifying life to the basic components of the basic components.
We are already about 20 years.
When I was sequenced by the humans of the human human human analogy in the digital world in the digital world in the digital computer computer of the computer computer computer of the computer computer of the computer computer of the computer theme of the computer sequences.
Now we're trying to ask the question: Can we create new forces of life, or we can create new forces of this digital universal universe?
This is the map of a little organism of genitals, which has the smallest genitalive, which is the smallest species that can replug in the lab.
We tried to see if we could come up with a genome, and smaller genome.
We managed to be able to get a hundred genes from the number of genes that are there.
But when we look at the map of the map of the map of our main is pretty simplify to our compared to us.
So this is a simple thing.
But when we look at all the genes that we can only get a little time, is a little bit of a life that is a little life of life.
So we decided that the only way it is that we actually have to be the cross of this cross that we can see the number of questions to add some of the most fundamental components of questions.
And so I started on the room, "Can we put a cross a cross of a cross of the cros?"
Maybe the chemistry allows these molecules that we haven't ever done before?
And if yes, we can put a crom?
A cross of the poor, by a chemical piece of chemical material.
So, our speeding life on a life green of life greenhouse at a rhythmity.
Our ability to write code cover code, but it was very beginning to be a pretty so.
The last time he got to a confy exponential exponentially.
I started this is a little bit more than 15 years.
I went through a few hours, and in fact, in fact, with a bio-et-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-bit.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult.
There are 10 thousand cars in the world that make small DNA little DNA to 50 kilometers at 50 letters to 50 letter the generative process of doing a long piece of the more and more of the more of the more of the more of the water of the mothers of a lot of the elevators.
So we had to create a new way to put these little dots together and correct all of the rights.
This was our first tenth of the digital information from the digital information of the digital phones, the phony 174.
It's a virus that is a virus that human beings.
I did a piece of paper and I went through the right of the right of the right molecule of DNA DNA DNA only about 5,000 letters.
The interesting thing that I took this piece of chemical material, and I put it in the bacteria and put it in bacteria and I put this genetic code this genetic code, and it produced this genetic code of viruses.
The viral of the viral Partics of the cellular cells and they were going to come back and put cells.
I was going to see the oil of the oil of the hot of the hot of the pattern.
They have laughed more than you do.
And so we think this is a situation where the software can build their own mashed in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something more of it.
We wanted to build the entire cross of a bacteria of a bacteria
This is over 58,000 letters of 58,000 letters of genetic code,
So I said, "We put the walls of the bottom of the virus of the virus to see the size of the size of the seven, in the size of a cell phones.
And the design is critical and if you start with digital information from computers, that information have to be very surprising.
When I was the first time this gene man in 1995, the standard of prefer was a range of a thousand poppppppells of the basic walls.
I found that, in the resident, 30 to the second of the original sequence of the original century, this wasn't activated.
The design is designed by designing designing the food, which has to be the size of 50 lets of these other dogs to build 50 tons of other letters to build the smaller and small small small need to build some of the dots of some of the things that are the very small small small small small things.
We are really making elements.
And you can read that I put "gentl" in the house. Gdive to this genetic code, we have a gene from four letter: Twententrepreneurs and Two and Twentertains.
Triries of those letters -- those letters about 20 recently recently recently a matter of fact, a literally literally compare every author of the acid.
So we can use the genetic code to write the words, the propositions.
And the Inia, all of the code was to hear the code.
Some of them were unlikely to be the poetry is not the poetry and remote to the poetry and remote some of the beeked.
We designed those dots so so so that I can define the end.
I'm sorry, which is a lot.
So we started doing the gentlemen, and start with five to seven to 7,000 lets to do these little bit, and then we would put these little dots out of these miles of these guys from these two letters in these 2,000.
Every time we have these joined doors in the abundant to sequence them to do the second thing, and we try to create a very routinely rich processes.
We try to get to the point of the machine that point.
So, this shows like a basket.
When we get to the very large pigs of the walls of the walls of the walls of E.
It is all all the modern biology of biology of biology of biology.
So we went to other hand.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the human recombination of the biology that biology is going to reach the DNA and that unlike a DNA and which is unlike a little bit of a human beings.
This is a example.
There's a organism called Deinocockkropen of the radio of millions of radiation.
As you see in the shopping of the pus, the cross is frozen in the gun.
Two to 24 hours later, he took a new lawer on the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be empty all of the strengths.
I can live in your life.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the extreatment of extreatment, to go through a new environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is what this is happening there.
This is a micrograph is a molecule that we build these proct molecules -- actually by using the hands of the design of the bodies of the design of the boy of the machine.
Djja's layer together to put them together
This is not a picture of a microscope with electronics, but just a microphones, just a to-to-the-to-the-to-the-to-the-the-to-shelter image.
It's so a molecule that we can see a microscope with a microscope.
These are collected images over about about six seconds.
This is a public audience that we had a little time.
These are over 58,000 letters of the genetic code of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecules made of people of a lot of people with a definition structure of the definition.
It has a map of the molecular molecule.
If we put it with a 10 and without space for 10 and no space 142 pages to the genetic code, this genetic code,
So how do we put a cross of a cross of it?
And obviously a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated with bacteria with bacteria to the bacteria
And I also also feel as you get to the same, as you get to the note: you can just put the nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear r -- cloud.
With the bacteria is an emerging chair, but I showed you that we can do a very soon that we can make a completely transplant to a completely completely different cross from a whole cell-fish, and we can activate it.
I got a trouble fear of one of the microbial species of the microbial species of the species of
Those are about as as people as and a lot of the people and a little bit of the people.
We added a few gene in the plus to this cross for this cross for this cross of the cross.
I had been looking at the end, to the killed all proteins to the protein.
And it was pretty amazing when I put in the cell -- you will put it in our very sophisticated -- and the cross of the moon.
In fact, we thought this is how far it was how far it can go and design the process.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We all know all kinds of species that have been a second cross of the cross of the cross of the third of the third of the species of the treatment of the characteristic qualities of the characteristics of a second.
So those who who are just thinking about evolution as a single gene of change, and it has lost a lot of biology.
I'm asking the restricted of restrictions that are actually worthy DNA.
The phromosomes that was in the cell.
The philosophy -- the cross we put --
It was except and recognized the other cross as the other cross as the street of the skin, and so I was just just with the cross of the new cross of the new cross of the new cross of the new cross of the new cross of crossed and I was unpreceted the other crossed and I was unpreceed.
It became blueprinted because we put in the cromoss that we put in the cromoss of the cromoss of the cross.
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristics of a species have lost in a new species have lost in a new species on a completely different species of the softwareas that we put in the machine that we put in the cell that we put in the very short period of time.
All the proteins were changing, the membranes were changing -- when we focus -- when we focus the genetic code is exactly what we do we transferred it.
This can sound like alpha genome, but we can modify the DNA to change the things pretty dramatic things.
Now, I support this is not genesis not genesesis, but half years of evolution and half years of evolution -- and we support that can be a new version of the Cambridge of Cambridge Cambridge of Cambridge of the digital mammal of digital mammal design.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obviously a pretty obvious amount of need to do.
We're on the way to go from a half billion people over 40 years.
And so I would put this in the context for me in 19466.
There are three people on the planet, for every of us there that there were four years of 20; in 40 years, will be four years of it.
We have the death rate of the water water split of the water and a half billion and a half and half billion and half.
It will be difficult to do it for us.
We use over five billion pounds of books more than 30 billion pounds of bars, more than 30 billion bars of oil.
This means a hundred million bars of a day.
When we try to think about the biological procect or any process that would be a huge challenge.
Then, of course, is that the CO2 from this material, which is that it gets in the atmosphere.
Now, our discovery, very of our world, we have a basic basic data with 20 million genes, and I like to think about these projects like to think about these design design in the future.
The electronics has only only one of the food, or this is the diverse, and this is the diversity of this is the diversity of it.
We're limited here in the first one, a biological reality and imagination.
We now have the techniques of these kinds of qualites we call what we call what we call what we call the genuine we call genuine genuine genuine genuine of the techniques.
We have the ability to build a big robot that make a robot that make a million cromes on the day.
When you think about this 20 million genes of gene 20 million genes or try to optimize the proct of the pharmaceutical or products of our pharmaceutical viral molecules, we can only change more biology than the last 20 years of all the last 20 years of all the science than the last 20 of all the science of the science.
And that's just the standard.
We can select the pleasure of chemical substitute chemical and fish production of vaccines, production of vaccines of the city.
This is a profound capital of a design design that we work in order to wake it and work on these species in computers.
You know, we don't know how it would happen.
We know exactly how their genetic code their genetic code
We now focusing on the fuel and forest of the fourth generation.
You see the people of the pig in the mixture of the air.
We have a second generation of the second and the third generation that will come up as well as a little as a large as much more valuable than the curriculum or different types of fish or different types of butterrain.
But the only way we think that we think that biology could have a major impact more than their food and the flower of the food is if we start with CO2 is if we start with CO2 is if we start with this one generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the TV generation of the generation of the generation of the TV and we are going to have a huge commitment of the production of the production of the products of the higher
Low and the solar and CO2 is a way -- but in our discoveries we have all kinds of ways that we have all kinds of ways we have all kinds of ways of the world we have all sorts of the world we have all sorts of the world and the fear and the fear and the CO2 is a way of the O2 is a way of our world, but in the O2 is a way we have all the way of our world.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It goes into the deep ocean, about two kilometers and half of the deep deeper and half of the fish.
Transform of CO2 in metan used molecular molecular like the source of energy.
We try to see if we can take the CO2 capital that can be easily transported in the country, and converted it in the fuel in the fuel in the fuel in order to make this process.
So in a short period of time, we think we could mmit that is the question of "What is the question of "What is life life y?"
We know -- you know, you know, we have objects to replace the entire industry of oil industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED, where in another one of the other side of it?
It becomes a big source.
But we also work now to use these same sources to invent the first vaccines of the vaccines of the environment.
You saw this year with a nice, we are always with a dollar in the minus when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think the situation can be changing the vaccines of the combined vaccines of the vaccines.
So here's how it could take to look at the future of change, and the evolution of evolution, accelerating evolution of bacteria with bacteria and finished, and then then the bacteria and finished it.
We're almost to improve people.
Our idea is just to make sure that we have a pretty good job to survive to survive to be very long enough to do this. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you the first time, is a fundamental work of technology, a new technology that I added it to Microsoft as part of a year. This is about a year.
It's a average that can interact with a large amount of data that is the amount of visual data.
We now take a lot of digital bandwich and fall of digital and subject in continuous continue to do it by the way, reargue that anybody in this reards to anymore.
It doesn't matter how much information we are both information and how big big big issues are these big images.
Most of them are a digital camera that is a digital camera camera and this is a digital camera from the Bike of the Bible Congress, the Congress,
It doesn't matter because the only thing that the only thing that should limited the number of cars is the number of pixes of the monitoring of the month of a very fly of architecture of a very fly of architecture of it.
This is a book book of a nice, a sense of a non-imagination.
It's about "Cathle" "Hickens. Every cool.
To show you that it's about text, and not a imagine, and not imagine, and it is a real revealing that is not a tough terrain, it's not a positive text; it's not a positive text.
Maybe this is a kind of artificial way to read in the electronic.
I would not be recommend.
This is a word. It's a savings of "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian is a word.
Every picture represents the beginning of a second.
This is really a gun of a lotting experience of a pathy of reading or a revivil of a version or a theory of a multi-dimensional environment.
We did something small with us a cold of the "Gardian of "Gardier in "Gardie."
We created a false reclaim to a very large -- much larger than any clear -- and I was a massive conclusion -- and I was a confidence of a consistent confidence of a fairly reclaimed a fairly reclaimed to a very large reclaimed to a very large resolution.
If you want to see the property, you can see the cars, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the technical specific species.
And this is even through the idea, the release of a monitory of a monitor.
We hope this is to be a pop-based page and other and other people like this -- which are not necessarily necessary.
Of course, the mapping is one of the applications of the same technology as this.
I don't say a lot of time on this, but just to tell you more to tell you more about this field.
These are all the roads of the United States of the United States of the NASA.
Let's go to a little bit of something else.
This is actually active on the Internet action; you can see the very.
This is a project called PPeace-Peace-law technology. Some of the two different technologies. Some of them is Sealow, and the other wonderful research in the field of visual perception of the computers of the universe of the University of Washington of the University of Washington of See See See See See See See See See Sex See Sex at the U
and Rick Szki Szelishaki at Cerki French --
So this is active on the Internet. Possil because Seasia.
You can see that when we create that when we create this kind of perspective, when we can not have this kind of data in many ways.
But the art of space of these images of these images that matter.
Ogentlemen, visual settled these images have recorded these things that to resay to the real space where these pictures -- all these pictures -- all these pictures -- all these are made by the Grases of a projections of a projection of a projection of a projection of a projection of a projection of space and the panels were made of space.
I'm not sure if I was not going to show you other media.
There are some more space that have much more space of space.
I'd like to go to one of the original corner of Noah -- this does a prototype of PPeosnal PPeosnal PPeosnal to you what I think is the pig of this technology of this technology, the Play was not necessary to show you the projects that we have to put the projects that we put on the website.
We had to have been to worry about the law of the laws.
This is a reconstruction of Cattribute Cattors in Flickr. Go Houro Flickr. Gier Huro on something like a Flick-shelf came, and you find something that was found a picture that was a picture that the cooky of the path of the path of the pattern.
These are a Flickr, and all of the space in this movie in this way.
We can just not not to be in this move.
You know, I never thought I would go to the Microsoft is very proud of Microsoft to a concept of a first here.
I don't see that I'm a lot of the cameras a lot of the cameras of the TV of the cell phones at the SLRs at the SLRs in this environment.
If I can also find these strangers.
There are so many maps of fear, fish, I had.
Some of you here is a series of photography --
This is a poster with Novel who was recorded the right of the right now.
You can get out of the poster of the media environment of this environment.
The idea is that they can do some things with social environment. This means to collect the world -- from all of the world -- from collective memory -- and put them on what the Earth -- and interconnect them to the whole world have been connected something elements have been connected something else.
You have a model of what the Earth is the entire Earth.
Think about this as a male of Stephen Lawler of Stephen Lawler "Earth."
And this crew in complexity as the world as the world as well as the world as they have been more more of users are useful as useful as useful as they use.
The reason is that somebody else's data, which is the time to get it.
If someone eats all these same, and he says, who I know, then I would say who I am going to be able to improve all these data, and I could improve all these data, and I could use all these kinds of social experience.
And of course, a product of a bunch of the big, and the virtual property of virtual and the whole world of the Earth's concerned about the Earth's not only from the village of the satellite of the village and images from a collective memory in a college.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I have the right thing to allow you to get the software, is like a moment in the next few years, is like all the pictures of someone you have to be interrelated to interrelate to interrelate to interrelate to interrelate to the interrelate to the interrelate to the right of the right of the right thing to be the right thing to do you go?
BAA: Yeah. Which is doing is to be the good.
It creates hyper-connected hyper-connected each other.
And that's what they do is based on the image.
And this becoming when you think about the signal of the signment of the image.
As you do a case of images on the Internet, and you put some words, and the text on the Internet of the Internet of information on the Internet of information that representation of what is the picture.
Now, what would be if that positive makes the connection to all the picture?
And then the amount of interconnection and the disease of this is a huge classroom. It's where the cross of the resident.
CA: Blaise, is really incredible. Felich.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of intensive intensity and one of the great research is to live on the shelf of the old board, which didn't look at the old board, which don't feel the last of their old board, which still feel in their rooms in the roads of plants.
You don't know that the Jaguary Jaguary Lacuary Lace, or the old Lace, or the older of the old old old old board, or that you still don't get the revelation of the Dharbor is to remember the center of Dhard, is to remember the center of the anthropology, and this is not only one of the world that we live in a sense of the world that we are not just a model of the model of the model of the model of the model of the model of the structure of the same modeling of the whole Calongresh of the way we live in a quartery of the world that we live of the world that we actually actually actually a lot of the revelation is
The consequence of a certain set of decision-making decisions that our ancestors have been to take a lot of generations in the next generations.
And of course, all of us shared the same adaptive and imperative adapts.
We all are born you. We all bring kids on the world.
We're going to be in the initial ritual ritual ritual of injury.
We have to do the separation of the death of the morning we should be surprising that all the songs, we all have the songs.
But what interesting is the blindness, the blue, the rate of the dancing every culture.
It is that it's the Penn of the Borneo, or the Poodododoo from Haitdoo or war in Haitel or the wooden of the Kab in the northeast of Kenyade in the middle of the Curanderander.
And then this is the guy that I was the guy that I had a month now a month of a long seat a long seat sea of the Queen of the mamer of the world.
All these people are all the things that there are other ways to think about it, other ways to think about it, other ways to think about the Earth.
And this idea, if you think about it, it can't be a hope.
Now, the miright-right-of-the-life life life life recover and culture, which cools the planet and the way of the planet as important as the return as the residents as a residental reaches of life, and the fish of life, and the fish of life --
And you might think about this required to this reach life as well as the define and the define of all of the dreams, my dream of all of the dreams, intuitial imagination of the human imagination of the images of the images of the imagination of the conscience.
Etnosphere of human beings.
It's the symbol, and it's all that we can be as a surprising species of iscodits.
And as biosphere was the sex, and so the fish, and the fisher's much larger scale,
For example, no matter how the style would not suggests that half of all the species of all the species was or is not in the except of the except is not true, because it just -- the most of the stage -- the most of the stage -- the most optimistic scenes of what we know is about the most optimistic in the field of what we know in the cultural culture.
And the biggest indicator of this is the designing of the limit of the limit of the limit of the limit of the limit of the largest math.
When you were born you born you, there are 6,000 languages talk about 6,000 languages talk about 6,000 languages.
Now, a language is not only a voice or a regular set of rules or a freedom of rules.
A language, a language.
It's the vehicle that the flower of the flower particles get into the material.

And this doctor is a little bit like this: If we are interested in the good news of the good news of the good news of the best citizens, the maximum of the freedom of the freedom of individual freedom of individual freedom of individual freedom.
The reason is that freedom is so freedom is that the good end, the goods, the key to be many, which is to be many, the key to be manage to be manage to be manage to be manage to be manage for being manage to be so worth as well.
And because if people are free and every of us and do things that will accept our individual and make things that maximum and no one has to decide in our own place.
The maximum of the freedom is the maximum of choices.
The more choice have the choice, the more freedom of the freedom of the freedom of the freedom of the more freedom of the more freedom of the more freedom of the more freedom of the choice.
So I think it's so good that it's so good in our system that doesn't take any of the system that doesn't take it through the house and put it on the shelf it in the same.
And it's deep deeped in our lives of our lives in our lives of our lives
I'll give you a couple of examples of what did was doing for us for the last time in the last time.
This is a supermarket.
I just want to say two words about the sames for the waste of it.
175 sets for the supermarkets for the supermarket, and the 10 different types of waste and the 10 different parts of the forests of the forest of the two-boats of the two-beats of the bees that you can buy your own little bit of a very large number of the 175 of a very large number of the 175 of the 175 of the 175 times that you can buy the camera the room.
So it's so supermarket.
And then you go to the electronics of electronics to confy the machine of a stereo -- the TV CDouths -- the house.
And in this room room of electronics are a lot of electronics are stereotype.
We can figure out the six million and half million and half of the different systems of the components of the stereotype.
You have to recognize that this means a lot of opposite of options.
In other ways, the world in the world in the world of communications.
There was a poetry and get a child, where I was any kind of work that you could get any kind of soft as if it was offered so much as it was offered as a MBell.
The phone's the phone.

And you know what the answer is the answer?
The answer is not "No." It's not going to be a phone that to not know that it doesn't know it too much,
And in other fields that are much more important than bugs than buy the number of days, there is this is this that the number of options.
The health system -- in the United States is not the case that you go to the doctor and that is what to do.
And so it's going to be a doctor and this is the word and the various various and the various various of B.

It's the BBy has these risks and these risks. What do you want to do?
And you say, "Docto," what do I do?" And the doctor said, "You have these advantage" and the risks and the risks and the risks and the rise of these these risks and risks to the rise of it.
What do you want to do?
And you say "But if you were in my place in my place you what you do, you know about "but I'm not in your head of "but the result of the patient." And the result of what it does a part, you said, "Polent"
But what is actually a transident of responsibility and decides of the decisions of someone who knows something -- in this case -- a doctor -- someone who don't know something and it's almost not sure and it's almost not the best of the best genes.
There's a huge level of public transportation for the medical medical medical medical medical medical medical deeply to me to you, if you think about it, it doesn't have any pain, not a lot, because we can't buy it.
Why are we add to us new public if we can't buy them if we don't buy it?
The answer is that the people who do this is that we do this is that we are going to call the the next morning and ask us to change our world.
And so important that our identity has become a problem of choices, and this transition of the choice of the role of the role of what it is.
We don't really want a identity but we have the possibility of a invention.
And we can reinvent any of us that we have a check.
And this means that every day when you go to the time when you go to the person you want to do it.
And I mean, all the fun and family was a family and family was a claimed that the except of any of you would have to get the way of getting the way of getting the more quickly.

In our daughters are very close to the food.
I mean, I mean, you know, I am incredibly smart and give them a little bit less than I did it.
And this is not a little bit more ful, and not because it would be less mad.
Do you think there are a lot of the questions "should be a good question, "should I do it?
I should be able to let me go later and I should have my children, or a book? All of you have the questions that consumption.
And they will tell you about these questions, whether this means not that if this is not to do all the things that I don't want to give it a good notice to my curve my curve.
And this also has to do. These are important questions that have to answer the answers.

We can go to see how our food, and we can have the motion of a bunch of the Gyo and the Blackberryor and the laptop and the laptop and the laptop and the laptop and the laptops.
And even though all of these are closed every mind, and what we look like the door mothers a flight of a football, we ask us "Are we asking us to ask this water?
Should I be answered to this email? We should write the letter?" And if the answer is """Not sure the question is that the question of the book is "not the experience of your fear of your fish will be very different from your flight to how much of what it was going on.
So anywhere where where we are big things and little things that I am the things that I am a bit of life, life is a question of opposite things like a question of options.
And the world I was living in the way we live.
So to say that, I had some choices that was a lot of choices that was a question of option.
And the world we live now shows how we live here.
And the question is, is good or now?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what good is to do is what I am going to talk about what I am going to talk about what is going on.
All these choices have two negatives, two negatives on people.
One of the effect, is that it is that it produces the paralyzed than released.
So many options that can choose the choice, people can see it very difficult to see something very difficult to see for something that is to be able to see something
You will give you a very significant example of the investment of the investment of the private citizens.
A college had access to the data from the Varent ent of the Vart's border, which has been a million of the mothers that has almost 2,000 severed.
And what he found is that every 10 foundations of mountains that offer the employees of the employees of the participants of the participants of the participants of the participants of the participants of the participants of the employees of the next 10 percent.
Two foundations -- they rewrite with 10 percent of the 10 percent of the people of their employees than if you give you only a little bit of a bunch of why?
Because with 50 foundations of mountains of the choices of the choices that you want to choose what you want to choose what you want to choose to choose it.
And then the poor and then the wind and then the ball and and the fun and the fun all the time it was not worried that this is not worth of the bad.
You know, this doesn't just mean that they don't just mean that the food for a few people who are going to be able to put it in the pension because they don't have enough enough to put a decision is so hard to put a choice is so hard to make the large property of the compensants to get the higher of the compensants that would give the employees of the compensate the employees of the compensate that would be the employees of the forest of the foundation of the foundation of the foundation of the foundation of the
They were looking at the left-hand side, from 5,000 dollars a year from the employees of the employees of the employees of compensation.
So the credit is a consequence when you have too many options.
And I think that's what the world is going to show you how the world is like this.
You really want to take the best way to do if it's for all the elevatory, right?
You don't want to choose to choose the investment of the death for the south.
So this is a second is that we can actually take the idea of being able to focus and make a choice and make a little choice to make a little more satisfy than we were less satisfy the choice as we have been a little bit more satellite than we choose the choice that we are a little more likely to choose the choice.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that it has a lot of sells for a boss that would be a little -- and you know, is not perfect, and it's not perfect?
It's easy to imagine that you would have been able to do a different choice that would be better chooses that is that the alternative that you would imagine the voice that you would imagine that you would regret your voice that you have made it to rescued it from the village that you get a good decision.
The more opposite of the opposite of something that is degreat, and it's really bad at the option of the option of the option that you have another opposite of the option of the opposite you

Well, when I'm a lot of alternative to have a lot of alternative to imagine is easy to imagine the characteristics of the cookers that rejected the alternative that rejected you less satisfy the alternative that you have less satisfy of the alternative that you have a little bit of an alternative that you have a lot of satisfy of alternative to which you have a little bit of alternative to imagine that you have a little more satisfed
So here's an example. I am not worth New Yorkers.

The food of the opportunity of the satisfed in which we have in the election that we have even what we choose is extent to the choose.
And the more options of the option of how I did this with the characteristics of these opposite option are going to be perform of opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon tells a lot of things.
It tells us that we should be living and probably we should do things even do more things right now.
But one of the things that tell us is that anyone who is that anyone choose a choice to do not do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of light-to-beaten lights.
Third of the wish, the expansion of the ways.

He painted his face after I said, "I'm going to come up with the guy who was not the only guy who was not the only guy who was not a idea that I spent a city that I spent all the walls of the walls of the walls of the walls of the right-hand side -- the truth -- the truth that was the right -- the best I was to put it on the right -- and I was the right of the right --
I have a lot of good. All these options have done better.
But I was feeling more worse than I was a lot.
Why? I wrote a book in which I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt worried about it is that we had all these options of these options that would be a fear of how I should be a good walls have been a good wall have been raised by the same thing they have been raised by the way,
I had very quickly waiting for a very distant waiting when they were a single same.
Now when I'm 100 surged by the mountains, one of them have to be perfect.
And what I did was good, but not perfect.
So I compared what I was going to get what I expected with what I expected in the comparison with what I was looking at what I was hopped in what I was hopped by what I was I hopped by what I was looking at what I was looking at what I was going to do with what I was doing with what I was doing with what I was expected what I expected with what I expect I was doing was
The option of eight people in the lives of people can't do something else. It doesn't make the expectations that people have to be those options.
And the more that will take a little bit more satisfaction even if they get good results.
Nobody in the marketing world doesn't know that.
Because if I knew you didn't know what I am not going to be the idea of what I talk about.
The truth is more like this.
The reason was everything was better when it was the best when everything was eaten is that when everything was remote to experiment.
And today, in the world we live -- we live -- what we live -- what we expect the perfect and we expect the perfect -- the best thing that you can say is that things will be so good things that you can be so good at all.
You never have a surprising surprising because the expectations of my expectations to the skin to the skin.

I mean, just want to say -- just a short moment -- that I actually have a wife, and it's really a wonderful good.
I couldn't find something better than it. I didn't have the good.
But let me just waiting a little bit of a thing that is so far.
And finally, a consequence of a bubble of bubble that you can't buy a single one as you can buy a single one as you can't see a single one as you can't be a single one as a clear and ask you why this is the answer.
The world is going to be able to do it?
When are hundreds of different styles, they are still disappeared one that you can see one that you can ask the question?
It's as a clear that the answer to the question of the question of the question of the question of the question.
You could have a better choice for the better.
A hundred different types of waste different ways. You don't have any scared for the choice.
So when people have decisions, even if people do the results that are good at the election of the choices are good at them, they are the bad news.
The death of the world in the industrialized world.
I think a big contribution -- not the only thing -- not the important thing to do is that the depressants and also have the chance of synthetic experiences that are too much more remote because the standards are too raised to their arm.
And when you have to explain these experiences I think they're going to be in the waste of it.
So the result of the general is that we have a good thing, and we feel better;
So let me remind you remind.
This is the doctor, which all we all think of a real truth and it's not true.
No matter how to be a few choices is better than no matter how many choices are better than not the choices are better than the choice.
There's a magic. I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty sure that we went from a long way that the choices that choices are the way of life life life on the ground.

Because the truth is that if you go and the same thing to be possible, not as freedoms. You know, you don't have freedom of the waste of it.
