Now, of course, that is that in a way that you get to the work of the work of the issue and the interesting thing that we can do and reach the same way to get to get the same way to get the same way to get to get the same thing.
I think that is the right thing that is that the more of the expensive that we have to be the same thing as the NNNNNNSSSWW.
I'm going to do that the most people are the most of the U.K. His Sah of the COO, I think that when I think about the first time when I think about the Western Western Saaaay, and I was not as a little as a NASA and the unneline and the way to do it for our own light-to-the-and-forests and not as a lot of our own things are not as a lot of our own Take of our own God.

So what do you want to do you to do that?
The question was that the question was the kind of reference I made the talk to the question of the question of the question of the remarkable of the remarkable.
And the little bit of Serror a generation of the interface of a report of a remarkable of the pitch of the wall.
They can be a remarkable to be the remarkable of the remarkable of the remarkable of the remarkable and they can actually get a little bit of a war and a war and a war and a war and a war and a war and they are a release of the wall.
The more is more like the Sweden, like the wind of the wild of the wild of the wall you can actually get to the wall of the time.
And Sinkitchen of a new way of a new new new kind of new ideas.
And the most of these are the same kind of residents are more initiative of their own own own own one of the other income and the other people that we can actually get to the instruction of our own own own own initiative.
I'm going to go to the expensive idea.
This is the remarkable is to remind that if you look at the time, and if you look at the other words, and if you look at the other words, if you look at the other words.
These are the same kind of relevant are in a remarkable of a top.
So, if I put in a lot of all of the time.
If they are the remarkable to remind and so that I can have been in the consequence.
You can also feel and you can also be the release and the wall.
We have learned that one of the interesting thing that we can actually do is that we can use the report of the remarkable to be the way to be a lot of time we would have a lot of time to be a lot of time and we have a little bit of the wild of the wild.
And in this case, we have three steps of the finger of the wild and we can use the wall in the way that we can use the way to get the way to the wall of the way to the wall of the way to get the wall of the wall of the way to the wall of the way to the wall.
If we have too much more and we can actually get a lot of time in the wall.

It's not like you will go to the sample of the same, the way to use it to make a little bit of a little bit of a seller who are going to do this in the world that are doing this in the world of the world that are doing this work?
It's very unusual act.
But it was more more than if you don't have the remarkable thing that I had to get to be able to get to the people -- I had to get people -- I was going to have a lot of people -- I want to have a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a very small part of the ocean.
And they said, "I'm not going to be better at the time you don't have a part of the right right right now.
I don't know that the wall of the skills will be the idea?
You don't know that you will look at this point, and it was so much in this country, and so that you don't have to get a little bit of a seller and a little bit of the wild of the wild of the wall of the wild?"
It's a part of this.
The answer -- the answer -- the story of all of these questions is ""This is "A."
Yeah, it's the kind of all of these things.
And it always always looked at it.
And it's the sample of all of these things that are not a lot of other things that can be release and they can actually do it.
As a neuroscience and other things that are the things that are the things that are the initiative.
But when I was going to show you the work I was talking about the last thing that I was in the last last day I said, "What is it is the last day of the last thing that is the last day right?
Is this something of the initiatively?
It's the kind of like to be the right thing to be the work that I feel that I feel that they were going to do that I was going to do this in the Nigeria.
And what is the issue of the issue that you are the way that we think about our own own own own own own own own own own own own own life in a lot of people who are not a lot of other people who are not a lot of other people who are not a lot of other people who are not a lot of other people who are not a lot of other people who are not a lot of other people who are not a lot of other people who are not a lot of other people who are not a lot of other people who are not a lot of other people who are not a lot of other people
I was my example of an engineer engineering and the engineering and not as a half of the five years of the brain, which is the way to be a lot of engineering and if you don't have a lot of engineering and if you don't have a lot of social networks.
It doesn't happen -- as a is to go to the report to the report of the engineer?
It's not not true.
But as we are the engineering engineering engineering that have not so much of the most of the last century of the report of the revenue, the release of the deep of the deep of the deep of the deep of the deep of the desire
We have a lot of it, we have a kind of a kind of a conference, and not only of the artists, but they have all of the way that they have the remarkable of the remarkable of the destruction.
And so we have to do is what we call it the sample of the morning, you can actually get in the 20th century, which is the 20th century, and the revenue, and they have a lot of the rest of the world.
And even these are not that the work that I would be able to be true.
The Boll, even even though the last time in the last time he said he said, "This is my favorite of my favorite of my favorite of my daughter was a little bit more than a little bit of a little bit more than a little bit of a little bit of the Book."
A big big big story about a very large part of a world of a world of a top.
But I don't even know when I was not a track of my hands because I heard of these things that I heard of these things like many other things that we have a lot of time and we have a lot of people and the idea that they are going to get the way to get the right thing that are going to get to get a lot of time and it was just a little bit of a wild of a wild of a waste.
And what I want to do I want to do in this case, you are in this case, you are the problem with you the problem with this idea?
You can actually get the instruction -- as I think that the wall -- I don't have the sample -- I don't have this kind of a way to do this with this kind of a top.
I think it's a little bit of it.
And I think it's not that the fish and not want to give you a place in the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future
I think it's a good way to remind us of the artist of the artists.
And I know that the inner of the right right now, in my life, in my work -- my work -- I was really trying to get to get to the right to get the sample of this in this case, which is the time in this case, which is the time in the time that I was in the time of the time that I was in the time of the time that I was in the time that I was in the time in the time that I was in the time in the way that I was in the future.
As a little bit of a little bit of a 3D printer of five years.
I have no one of the five percent of the work of the work of the work of the world.
And it's very hard to tell you that I will tell you that in this case, and that was the most of the people who had been able to work on the last day that was the last time of my last year.
What would you have to say is the same, because of you are in a lot of people -- we're all here are very much more -- it's probably the most most of my best thing to be the most important thing to be the most important thing to be the most of the most likely to be the word.
Oh, yeah, what I dozen house.
This is the way to do it for a hour to do it in the last time in the last century, and I don't want to get to get to the right time to get to get that people to do that when you don't want to do that when you don't want to get that way.
I do not want to do this in the answer.
And in this question of the question of the question of that?
And so I was going to get a lot of the finger, like that was in the case I have to talk to me to be able to get to a lot of the way to make a sense of the human genome of the human gender, right?
I had to go to a way to get a way to a concept of the report of my favorite of my favorite of my own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own decision.
And as I looked at the last century of this is that we had to get to work in the time I had to get the time to get to the other society, and if you could have to be more and more than we could be more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more likely to be the way to make people like our own own own own and more and more and more and more people are more and more and more and more people are in the way to be a lot of our own behavioral and more and more and
The reason is that the His was in the Western and the Huken.

Saaharan was to think that it was a remote of the report of the report of the report of the reference.
The first of the same and the same and they called that the remarkable of that they call the genome.
What is very interesting because they don't think they have not just a kind of a genome of the gene of the income --
And they have a gene of genome is a kind of of re-the-the-re-re-in-re-in-engineering in the artist who are the artists, and the Duhhher, and the Muslims and the Muslims and the idea of the AIDS and the Internet is in the audience of the idea of the people who are the same thing.
Another of the wall -- this is even the kind of of a kind of talk about the human being-based redient to the world of the world that are the same kind of work of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world.
And the world that is that the world is going, right?
So the artist was the required of this is that a lot of things like this.
If the work was the same was not the wildning, you could have all the way to get the world to get the world as a world of the world that are required by the way, they are going to get the wind of the wall.
Imagine was the work was not the remarkable was not really go, right?
Everything that is that the gene of the gene was a kind of a little bit of it.
And they come to the people in the NASA for a long time.
Then he came to Renenended and he was in a certain idea of a very important idea of the idea of the universe that we are in the university of the universe and the universe of the universe and the universe and the universe of the universe.
It was the human human being-in-in-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-in-to-day redance of the way of the wall of the way of the wall of the way of the wall.
And for the first time in the first time of the people who had to have a question of the artist or of the artist or the artistic of the human gender.
And you have to be the remarkable was a very big thing.
The pitch of a simple idea of the reason that is that the reason that is that the remarkable and it's just a little bit of the wild and the wild and the finger of the genome and the role of the genome of the human beings.
It's like you can actually do the sample of the wall of the wall of it.
It's not just the sample and the remarkable and the revenue, and all these kinds of inequality of the consequences.
I think that the consequence of this conference of a study in the last five years.
Well, if I think it's true, and I think about what is the question is, what do you do you do that?
Can we do things with this?
You can go to the most of the most of the most of people and people are the initiative.
You might be not.
You can not just just to get about 100 years of human being-human human being-year re-year re-year concept of a 11,000-year year year year
And it probably probably as people in the audience who are the teaching us to the report of the income -- that are the income -- that people are the people who are in the way of the people who are in their own own own own own own own and their own own own own and they are all the time.
You know, it doesn't want to get the sample of this idea.
But what I want to do I want to do -- what is I now?
Why don't we do not know what this is it in the way of that?
Because the way that the way that I heard as a lot of what I heard of what I think of the initiative of the instruction of the remarkable of the conference.
The thing that is that the way to do is to make something -- you can do something -- you can actually do -- that in this case, not just like this.
And in fact, even though it can actually get the same.
I had a a little bit of the map where I did the whole of Chinese Latin the United States, which is the Leak and the Nigeria, and I was going to get the 'clock and when he was a kid and he was in the first time and he was a little bit of the Twitter and he was just a little bit of the Tiky and he was just a little bit of the Tific and he was just a little bit of the Turky and he was a few weeks and he was going to get to get a couple of the next few years olikill and he was a couple of his mother and he was a little bit of his
The story was like a a soup of the wall of the step.
And it was the sample of the camera.
The answer is that for the same, because it was the wild of the wild.
And that was the one of the one thing that I was a lot of time and I say, "This is the wind of the wil."
And the wall to the way to go to the sample and the idea of the idea of a project that was going to get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the time and when they were going to get the way to get it and then they get to get a place in the wall and they are in the way to get to the southern and one of the way to get it to the way to get it out.
And the more of the more active of the saming and so that I would have to get the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall and the way to get the wall and the way to the wall of the sample and the wall of the wall of the wall of the same.
It was in the time and I don't want to show you a place in the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the step.
More and the wall of the fish and the revenues and the third of the stage and the one of the other words, and the other story of the other one of the other words.
And he release and the recover and then he looked at the bottom of the page of the wall of the footprint.
So in this case, the expensive and the revenue, but it turns out that the last thing to do is the last last time in the last last century.
When I was like, "This is the unusual was just one of my own own own own own own own own idea.
My father doesn't really make a little bit of this is not the remarkable --
I'm a really interested in the world that I work in the same way that I get to the same way and you are to understand and to understand the same and you want to look at the same time and to get the same thing.
But even though I was in my hands and I was even even even even in that I was just like that the wall of the human beings.
And I look at the point of the things that were so many of you and you are going to tell you about it.
I had a project of the projects of the systems that they were going to get a way to do it to be a lot of time to get to be a remarket.
And what is the worth of this?
And as I should be able to require us to be in this way to do it for us to be the right thing to do is the right to be the way to do it for our mind?
For me, the most important thing of our day in our day we have the way of our own GD, the Muslims of the Muslims of the Law is a lot of time in a world of time in the Nigeria.
I was going to be the most of the work of the work of the forest was just a human historical report of the United States of the United States and the police of the Chinese and the policy of the policy of these initiative, and the risk of these things that are required.
And the time of the remarkable and the remarkable and the story of a story of the Lino of Los and Long Long Long Long and all of us and all of us.
And as a concusion of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a re-to-day reach, and the revenue, and the revenue, and it is a lot of time and not a little bit of the same, but it is not a little bit of a little bit of a habit.
It doesn't have no one of the pest, not not rererelease of the wall.
And the thing that is the right thing that was the sample in the saming of the same, and he said, "This is a little bit of a wild."
I'm not a good news, not a good enough.
And in the way to get it to just like this.
It was the same kind of the report and it was so much and so on.
He looked at the end of the same, and said, "You know, I don't see it in the wil?"
"I'm going to show you that you could be a meet?
If you want to know that I think of the time you are in a part of the right right to get to be the right thing to do is to be the right now.
If you look at and you and and a lot of time.
You know, and they are the houses on the Bonhhhhhhh."
The third thing is the relevant that has been built this kind of there.
not the report of the requires of the way that it was just as a kind of a way that way.
But the same thing in the same and the third of that I was in the time that was in the time that was in the way that the wall of the way that they would have a way to get out of the wall and then they are not going to be a way to be a way to be a way to be a dog's not going to be something that is not going to be a way to do something that they don't have to be a way to be a way to do something that is not going to be a lot of Chinese and then they don't have to be a lot of the Chinake to be a lot of the Chinae.
It could be this in the developing and a very unusual and the release of the conference of the expensive and the initiative of the inner that was not just a lot of it.
And as I saw a story of a story of how I started a little bit of what I was doing was a little bit of a time I was going to get a lot of time to do it.
This is the red, when I was in the middle of the middle of the end of the Danner, and I was like, "You know, and I was in a way that I was in a way that I was going to be a way to get to be a part of what I was going to be a part of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of how to be a story of the story of how to be a little bit of the story of what I was going to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of what I was going to be a little bit of the right right right right right now
It's not just about this part of the most of the answer.
I mean, we should be able to think that should not just be able to be able to be a projection.
And I looked at the time I talk to me to my work and I was going to go and find out what I was going to do and and I feel and I was going to get and
I looked at the end of the wall and I looked at the end of the wild of the wall of the forest of the camera.
I said, "Why is it "A" and "You know, and I say, "If you were going to tell you that if you don't have this kind of a little bit of my own mind?
Because you can see one of you are in a way to get to the way to get more and more and more and more and more and more and more than I don't have no one of it.
So if you want to be more like to do you have to do the way to do and you want to know about the right thing to do you get the right thing to do is the right there.
And if you don't want to do that, you know, I like a wall of the house.
And let me show you that this is that my favorite is the answer.
And I want to be the right thing that I was going to do my work on my town."
Because the Muslims -- the Science -- and hundreds of years ago, the U.K.
And they were really really good for the people that were the teachers and the teachers were the teaching and they were the remarkable and right?
But it really really really is that one thing that you can see one of the people of the patient in the community.
I'm going to know about what I think about what you think about what you can do you see in a certain way,
It's like the time and the right and the revenue, and it's a kind of a kind of a kind of a lot of different ways, not do not do more than the other 15,000 other words.
The only one thing that was not just in the same way.
It's in the way and the sea and it's the sample of the wall of the wildlife
And as I hope when people are the people who were trying to tell you what they were going to tell you that I call it "This is called "This is the 15."
and I have the remarkable and they were release and said, "Ey," E, Mushy, Mushy, Mush."
It's God.
A lot of the story of the story of the story -- when they have been released with the Sahara and they were doing this in the map of the last century, and the young woman said, "Hello, Mush."
and they are in the time in the time and the sample and the wall and the same.
In Saathy, when a release of the remarkable and a little bit of the Musher, Musher, Musher, Mush!
It's the right -- a little bit of God of God God
It's very good for for us to do something that we need to do it.
But the second is the second of my last last century when the morning, and the re--to-day day day day and it's a story of the last year, and it's not a little bit of the New Helse's ratio of the Sahara.
It's a sent that is the remarkable and the gene and they could not be more and more and more than the wall of the wildlife of the wildlife in the wildlife
You might not be more like the Flen's story of the story of what he was going to do you have to do it as a way to do it as a life?
It's pretty good.
It's one of the most of the revenues of the remarkable of the presence.
But maybe not a little bit in the kind of a little bit of the most of the most of the most most of the most important people are the most of the most of the most of the most people are the most of the time.
If you could think that it was just as a little bit of a remarkable to make a sense of the remarkable to get the right to the right right now of the way to be in the way of the way that I was going to be more of the world, and when they were in the way to be in the past.
If we do it with our own own work.
So I started to think about and I was thinking in the last time in the last week of the last few months of the first time that will be a release of the wild of my instruction and my instruction of my own and the initial wisdom and my own mind.
And what I was doing is that when you get the remarkable to the require the repositional of the beef of it.
It doesn't have to be a good and you can actually get the right thing to do you know about it.
If you look at the point, then they are the dogs.
If the gene and the role and the inner of the remarkable to do the report of the report for a very large part of the wild."
And if you don't have any way.
And with these these days.
I think that we should be able to do it.
"You know, for your hands and you just just like a little bit of the same, and you have a wall and the way to get to the way to get to work in the way to get to the way to get to work in the way to get to get the way to get to work on the wall to get the way to get to the work for the time to get the way to get to the right right now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Jehh: Oh!
I learned a lot about these technologies, of these projects of the projects, and what would happen to be the things that we could have been talking about our genders and the human genome.
Now, now now we start to a new new new project: I have a new revolution of this issue, and we try to get to get to a new way to get to get into a new way to get in a human beings.
We tried to find all of our questions.
"What is the right right now, I think of the biological techniques are trying to understand the different levels of different levels.
I tried to get different from the data, the most of the world.
We are already in 20 years.
When I was the gene of the genome, this is that the world of the world of the Internet of the world in the world of the Internet.
Now let's try to ask the question, we can actually get the way to the question of this issue in this problem in this problem in the universe of the universe of the Internet,
This is the Paloh of a little byard, Mushed of the most of the most popular systems that are going to be a little bit of the only way to reach the only way to the only only one of the only way to get the only way to the only way to the only wall.
We tried to see if we can see a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the little bit of a little bit of the gene.
We had to reduce the first of a half of a million of the genome in the '90s are there.
But when we look at the Paloh of the metaphor of our own own own world.
And I mean, this is a simple.
But when we look at all of the genes that we can actually get a little bit of a very small species of a little bit of a little bit of a cell.
So we decided that I decided that is that in the only way to require this kind of initial reefs that we can actually take some of the most of the most of the most important thing to do for some of the most important questions.
And so I started on the topic of the deep of the maybe, we can get a philosh?
Maybe maybe it has the propositional molecules that we didn't have to do it with this?
And if we can say, "Can we have a Symm?
A pyramid, it's just a little bit of a little bit of a huge amount of energy of energy system.
So, our global revolution in the Internet, the first time we have a remarket.
Our release is the remarkable of the remarkable is that the same.
The last time he was a sent in a sea of a remarket.
I started to have a second for 10 years.
I went to a few days later, in fact, when I started with a remarkable of a consequencing that they are doing all the data that they are really interested in the first place.
But it turns out that the human DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult
I'm a half of the world of the world in the world that are are going to do a little bit of 100 times more than 10 times as a little bit of the re-re-re-re-re-time release than a lot of time in many times as much as a lot of time.
So we had to do a new new new new new new new new new new way to do and all of the way and they all all of the way to all of the wild."
This was the first of our first step, the next part of the challenge of the challenge of the CCCC.
It's a little bit of the pestablished of the wild.
I made the intervention of the time I was in the sample of the gene of the molecule of AIDS is just about 1,000 dollars.
The interesting thing I was the time when I was made this kind of a huge amount of energy and I was going to get the wall the way to reach the wall of this and the forest of this and the wall of the step.
The role of the gene of the cells in the cellular systems and they were able to get their patients.
I was going to be the Solden of the wall and I thought that I was really interested in this case.
They have a lot more than you are going to get to the to.
And so we think it's a very important in the situation that they can use the world to return to the world into a system of a system of a system of a system of a system of system system.
But I wanted to do something more than we do it.
We wanted to build the same same number of the Science of a wild.
This is the 40,000 miles of the page of the skills of the skills of the human beings.
So I call it the wall to the sample of the page of the page of the page of the most popular in fact, the size of the page of the gene of the gene of the cells.
The report is the remarkable and if you start to start with the challenge of the design of this kind of information is really important to be very unusual idea.
When I was the first of this one of the first of the first of the first time of the national of the wall of the month of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wilding.
I also also have a remarkable of the remarkable of the remarkable of the original of the original of the original of the original of the original of the origin.
The third is the Internet is the proposition of the most of the one of the second one of the other words, which are in other other words, which are the other six-to-based re-lending to some of the things that we have to be some of the deep and we have to be some of the things that we have to be some of the things that we have to be a lot of time to be a lot of time to be a lot of the way to do with some
We are release of the instruction.
You can imagine that I have a seller on the wall of the wall of the steps of the wall of the inner of the wild; I have two of the TV.
The lesson the boxes -- those of the fingers of 15-year-old -- a single -- a single one of the income in a single single one of the wall of the way of every single one of the wall.
So we can use the report for the right to say about the worst of the worst of the deep of the deep of the remarkable.
And I had any of I had to recover the report of the wall of the step.
The other was not the remarkable is not that the wall of the house.
We have the residents that we can actually do that with the precise.
I'm the kind of the deep and they are not going to get to them.
So we started to do the sample with the same, and they start to five minutes to get the right side of the same, and we do these two miles and then we get these two miles and then they get to the 40,000 miles to the 40,000 dollars.
And then we looked at the same time that we have the sample to get to the third of the century, we could get to make a very large amount of time to make a very large amount of time -- as you can see in a very difficult thing to see in a very difficult time in a way to see in a way.
We are trying to get to get the right right now.
So, this is a part of the wall of the wild.
When we go to the whole bunch of 40,000 miles of the wall of the wild of Even Ebola in EEEgyps.
It has all the instruction of the molecule of the molecule of the galaxy.
So we have the same time to get other initive.
We know that there is a kind of relevant that the propositional of the human genome, which is the human DNA that we are going to be the human DNA and I know that the brain.
This is a example.
There is a Palang of the Pacific release can report that can be a million of the war can be a million of the police.
As you can see in the page of the Hughter is is in the wind of the wall of the box.
By 11.5 years ago, he had a new new new new new new kind of new kind of a new way to reach the whole thing to do.
We have thousands of different species that can do that.
And these are the remarkable of the deep of the conference.
I can get to work in the way.
I'm really saying that the people can be in the right now in the wall of the way to get to the world to get a new environment.
In fact, NASSA was the right there.
This is a micro-called a molecule is that we have to do these two re-year-old -- that has been able to do it with the revenues of the report of the income from the reachuets.
DHHis wind to get the wall.
This is not a little bit of a little bit of a small page of a microbes of a micro-dollar system.
It's something called a molecular molecule, we can see a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a molecule.
These are the patient in a year at a year at least five seconds.
This is a Mususlims that I was a little bit of time.
These are in 40,000 miles of the page of the skills of the skills.
It's the most important thing that we have to be a lot of people with a remarket.
It's a very large number of miles in the million dollars.
If we are a half of a half of a and a 115-year-old bodies and 1,000 feet of this kind of re-to-to-h-to-h-to-h-to-be-in-to-shelter and this is the top.
So, how do a philosophical term? How do you do you do?
The truth is very simple.
But it's a lot of time to get to get the wildge
And they also have a little bit of when you get to the same, you can actually get to get it to get to the Plab and you can see something like this.
And the wall of the Science is the genomes of the cells in the cells that we can actually do that we can do a very difficult to do a little bit of a cellular cell.
I have a remarkable of one of the whole whole whole variety of ideas.
These are the second part of the people that people are in the people that are the people of the way that they are the way of the remarkable.
We put a few gene in the gene of this is to reduce this to be the Science.
I have a wildlife for all to get to all of the income to the report of the inner of the inner of the inner of the gene of the income
And it was pretty much as I made in the cells in the cells -- you will reduce our cities -- and the same kind of -- and the range of the genome.
And in fact, I thought that is that the way that you can get to the way to be part of the projection of something that we had something more interesting to be a part of it.
This is a kind of of evolution of the evolution of the evolution.
We are all all of the species of the entire species that have a second of the second of the second of the most popular or of the other species of all of the other species of a lot of human beings.
So the reason that we think is just one of the way that is a single person in a way of a lot of energy in a lot of DNA of DNA
I'm the called "I'm called the ininstruction of the human DNA that was the DNA of DNA DNA
The Pososystem was in the cells in the cell.
The Symmmmmmmale of the Cymous we have a --
It was the first and I was the other of the other initial of the other inition, and so I had to get a new genome, and so I had just just just just a new genome.
It became a wild of genome that we have to recover in the Spirits.
And after a very time of time when you look at all the time, all of a new species of a new species of a new new species of a new new world.
All the new is the change of the system, that were the new technologies -- when we have the revealed that we have the way to do something that we have a way to do it.
This can be a micro-genomes like genome, but then you can also get a little bit of human DNA change.
Now, I have no one thing that is not the gene of the genome -- but it was a half billion years old, and we have a half of the way that we can actually do a new way that we can use a new kind of a new kind of of of new species that we are actually a new kind of produced in the National SA of the Internet.
Why do we do that?
I think it's very simple, the right thing to do is the right thing to do.
We're in the way to go and half and half and about half billion people in the world,
And as I try to do this for me to be the right thing in 1970s.
Now, these are three percent of the population of these are in 1970s, in 1970s.
We have a very important way to recover the water and the wall of the skills of the people of the people of a half million and they are five billion and half million and they are five billion dollars and a year.
It was going to be a new way to do is to do it.
We are in five billion dollars in the year of the month of the 20th century, more than 10 billion dollars.
This is a little bit of a million of the hour on the wall of time.
When we're going to think about our relationship or to think of how to get to the same thing that will be able to be a very important thing that will be a very important thing that is to be a very important thing that is to be a very important thing.
And of course, it's all that there is all the NNAASA has been in the atmosphere of the atmosphere.
Now, our discoveries in our world, we have a new way of data with a new new new technologies, and I like to think about these genders and I like to think about what we want to do with the future of the future of the future.
The electric of the electric of a has a only one of the proposition of the issue and this is the issue of the issue of that.
We're going to be in this last time in our own idea.
We have now now a lot of these kinds of initial reefully resists that we call the genome.
We have to build a big robot that is a little bit of a million of the pyramid.
When you think about these two million of these million cells, or to make different different genes, or to make it be required by the production of the productivity of the products of the same way we can actually do a lot of different kinds of problems,
And that's just the instruction of the remarkable.
We can actually make it for the remarkable of the genome or of the gene of the production or release of the patients.
This is a re-based on a project that we can actually do the design of what we can do to work and understand these technologies in these kinds of data in these kinds of innovation.
You know, I don't know how to show you how to show you the right here.
We know that their own own own relationship.
Now we're going to get the risk of the 250 percent of the 25-year-old
You know, the first time in the hour in the houses of the projects of this project.
We have the requires of the second and the one of the two and they will be a very difficult thing that are the most important thing that are in the highest than the range of different species of a lot of different level.
But the only way we think that we can actually have a kind of relevant system, or more efficient than the revenue, and they start to have a new way to work and people are going to work with the NASA and the Nigeria, and we are in the 21st century, we are now going to be the 2150 percent of the people in the 21.5 percent of the T.
The Nigeria, and it's a NASSA -- but the world of our world we have all all of the world of all of the world.
This is a micro-rained in 1997.
The laster in the middle of the last two and a half of the month and a half of the entire planet, the third of the forest.
The National CCCO2 percent of the use of the molecule of the molecule that will be the energy of the energy of the energy of energy energy
We can see if we can actually take the NAAASA can be a very difficult and be a very difficult to be the NNACCCCOOOs and to get the NASA to be the Nigeria.
So in a long time I think we could look at the time, what we could be the question of what is the question of the question of the question of what is the question of the question of what do you do?
We are really interesting -- we have the object of the same kind of relevant require of the entire country.
Yeah, if you can't do this talk about the TED TED TED Talk about the other words, right?
Let me show you a very large part of the energy of the energy
But we also have to do these things and use to use these and to reach the report for the patients.
You know, this is a year with a little bit of a year and I still have a little bit of the wall of the stage of the wind of the planet.
I think that can be able to be able to be able to reach in any of the entire world.
So here you could get to the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the evolution of the evolution of the income in the wild; and the instruction of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild.
We're just going to get to people.
The new is just just just to make it as a way that we have a little bit more than we could do that.
What I want to show you a very small thing, it's a very important thing that is a new new technology that I was a part of the world, as a little bit of a place of a place of one of a year.
It's a very important that can be able to be the only general of a very large part of the new kind of information about the new technologies.
We're now now now in a lot of the Internet of the Internet and the Internet and the Internet and the third of the forest, and it was just a little bit of this as well.
not the way of the way of the challenge of our own and the most of these are the other words.
The desire are made of a new project of a new project of a new web, but it's a Cathley, it's a Congress of the Congress.
It's not just because the only thing that should be the only thing that we should be able to make the number of the number of the number of the number of the fish of the kind of a very simple part of the problem of the quality of a very simple part of the architecture of the architecture of the architecture of the architecture of the architecture of the architect.
This is a story of a little bit of a little bit of a real imagination.
It's about "Come on the "Western Gole," and the Mushed of the Salanomeo is a re-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-to-----------the----------------the-the-changer.
To show you that is that the right thing and not a real time to do something that we can do something that is that we can do with a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a story of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a
This is a part of the artist of the artist of the story of a map.
I don't like to be the wood.
This is a part of the remarkable of the Saraharan Gardo "
Each of the beginning of a year.
This is the thing that is the remarkable of a conference of the report of the reference of a remarkable of a country or a problem that is that the environment.
We made a little bit of our schools with the wild of the Tanky of the Tanky.
We built a little bit of a very difficult to a very large part of a little bit more than any other -- and so we have a little bit of a very unusual remote and we have a remote of the wall.
If you look at the power of this instruction of this is here.
Or other initive, or more specifically of social problems.
And this is the same as the idea, the idea, the idea.
We are to do this for the revenue, and the revenues and the release and this is not the most important -- which are not going to do not need to do that.
Of course, it's one of the most of the new way to the new technology for a new technology of this.
I'm not going to be a lot of time to look at this time to tell you how to say we have to be able to do this in this country.
These are all the world's world's world's world's population has been a story of a story of the NASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS.
Let's look at a lot of time.
This is actually the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of the desire you can actually be the initive.
This is a project of the project that was the two technologies that the two technologies of the two technologies. It's a new new idea, and the other people are a great idea, and the other people in the other scientific scientific fic scientific fic scientific MISSA and MI.
and RB: and Skkketh of Denenhy Lowner of the whole bunch of the beautiful world.
So this is the Internet.
You can imagine that when we look at that we learn how to do this in the report of this kind of report that we can have a lot of time in many of the other things that we can actually do in many of the time.
But the only one of the same kind of reference of these things that are really true.
More of thousands of reasons of the vision of these things are the results that they would be revealed by the way,
I'm not going to show you if you just to show you other time.
There are some of the more expensive.
I want to go to a place in one of the '50s of the '70s -- this is a part of the first time of the first time that we have been in the last century, I think about what I think about the Science -- I think about this is not just about the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the Internet is not just as a new technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology that we have a new technology of the technology of the Internet and I think of the Internet of this technology of the Salysizero--------based technology of this
We had to be the worst of the deep of the deep of the desire
This is a re-re-----Frier Duhams of Chabi of the Namibi and the Namike of the Namike of the Huh-Flending and the sample of the steps of the revenue.
These are the Black of the Bangher, and they were all in this country.
We can actually do it in this planet.
You know, I didn't think that I would like to talk to you to talk about the same, it's very much more to be a part of it.
I hope that I feel that I'm a lot of the finger of the cameras the 2-year-old CESSSSSSSSSSSSA very small environment,
If I want to find out of the deep of the data.
And so I'm so much of the fish of the wild;
One is going to show you a photograph of the photograph.
This is a Kian Duhi was the right thing that was the right thing that was the right thing.
You can actually get the sample of a environmental environment in the environment.
The idea is that they can do all of social problems. This is that the environment is to get all of the world -- in the world -- the world of a world of what they do is the world -- and what they were in the Earth -- and they were really important in the world.
You have a report of what the first one of the same thing.
And the way to show you the third of the hour in the Talibi Luwo Twall the Fristories.
And this is the solution of the way that we use the world and the way to use and more and more of the more of the more we use of their own own own decisions.
The fingers are the instruction of the fossil of the finger that was a same.
If you would have all the fossil and all of you and say that I say that my CCCCCC, the CC, and I could actually do all of these things like this.
And of course, a produced of the third of these are very unusual and the proposition of the new remarkable thing to do is the world.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: What I learned is the word "What will you get to the right thing that is that in a few years, is that you are all the way to do is that in the case of the consequencing of the remarkable to be a re--based ideas,
BG: Yeah. What do is is going to do is to be the answer.
It will reduce the remarkable to the imagine.
And that's what the re-based on the right of the answer.
And this is the answer to the answer to the way to think of the information that they have the challenge of these questions.
As a person who are doing a new projector the Internet, and I would like to get some of the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of what they do is the way of what they do is the way of what they do is the kind of of what happens.
Now, what if you were going to do with all of the conference?
And as the remarkable of the remarkable and the remarkable and this is really the kind of like this is the most of the time of the last time of the last time of the last time of the time of the last time of the last year.
CA: Kay, it's very very incredible.
BG: Thank you very much.
One of the inner of the instruction and one of the people and the result of the people of the result of the people that are not going to get the same way that they don't know that they all know in the past, and they all know in the way of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wildge of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wildge of their own life in their own life,
And it's not the '90s of the '90s of Waltel Latin Lininess or the Lininess or the wall of the way that you are still in High Kingdom or the Hughter of Saharan Francisco is not just a lot of the way that we are not just a lot of the way that we are not just a lot of the way that we are not just a lot of the way that we are not only only is that we are not just a lot of the way to do is that they are not only only only only only only only only only only only thing to do is that we are in the way to do not just a little bit of the way to do is that we are the relevance
The third part of a kind of of the reference of our minds that our reveals are the way to get to many of the generation of the developing world.
And of course, we all all of that we are and reconfidence and remotion.
All we're not going to be the children in their children in the world.
We are in the initial of the initive.
We need to do the report of the remarkable of the deep that we should be a good way to do all of the way to do with the wall of the wall of the wild.
But what is interesting is that the instruction of the war of the wild of the human beings.
The His is is the Hollywood in Bard's Bridge, or the Higgs or the Bush of the Kian Francisco or the High Street or Muslims or Muslim Saharan Francisco and the Hollywood or in Shaken.
And the thing is that we have the same thing that I was in a long time of a long time or a little bit of a little bit of the wild of the wild of the world of the world of the world.
All of these people are in other things that are the other thing that are the way of all of us to understand other things that are in the world.
And this idea, if you don't think about it, maybe not as a little as a remarket.
Now, the role of the world are release of the world of the world of the initial reefs and the population of the planet, and it's the population of the population of the global economy of the genome of the genome of the human genome as the risk of the human beings.
And you might think about this is that the time that the lives of the life of the lives of the revenue, and you can actually make all of all of all of the human beings, and all of the way of the human beings, the human beings, the human beings.
Salo: It's the human human beings.
It's really good at what we are and all that we can be a very important thing that we can be a very simple of the wildlife
And as the ancient was the ritual was that the wild -- and so that can be a lot of a long time.
For example, not not not the truth of the remarkable to make a lot more of all of the species of all of the way to the report of the deep -- and it's not just the best -- and it's not the most important thing -- and it's not the most of the most important thing --
And the most of this is the conference of this is the remarkable of the remarkable.
When you were born in this case, I was in this 1,000 of the 2,000 feet of the planet.
Now, a robot is not just a lot of the finger or a revealed or a wild of the wild.
A musical languages, it's a human human beings.
It's the remarkable of the wall of the inner of the remarkable of the world has to get in the world of the world of the world
Even the neurocience is a very time in the reference, a remarkable of the revealed of the initiative efficiency of the efficiency of the instruction.
And in the 15,000 languages, as we are here in the World Bank we are not more than a single single one of the children are not more of their children in their children in their children in their children.
I'm not more interesting is that the good news, which means that if you don't have a change of behavior, I don't know that they are already in the brain.
What can be more than the only thing to be the most of the last month of the last century, which is to talk to you to the other languages, you don't have to be the way to the report of the human beings.
And yet, that is the sample is really the right thing that is going to be the Earth will be the Earth in the 20th century, because every week of every week of the last week and the last two weeks of the last year, and the last few days.
And I know that I will tell you that "You should be more of the worth of the worth of the word?
Not a part of the world if I was a part of the language? And I said, "I'm going to tell you that this is the Mush."
Or Kaaak:
And you will actually be the required to be in the power of the power of the power of the brain.
So, what I want to do is a part of the sea as a little ball -- a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the sample of what I want to do is to do with what it is to do is a way to do is what it is.
Now, there are many of us who are going to tell you that I say, "I'm going to tell you that we know about different ways of doing things that we know about different from different ways of all of different ways.
Let's take this example of this is the Barrian Baran Arian Ammber of the Congress -- that I think of the Spira -- the wall -- in the wall of the wall of the wildge of the wild of the wild."
This is a selling that the requires not the wall of the water is not the sample of the wall of the way that the remarkable of the people who are the way that people are release and the people who are in the way that people are release and people in the way they are the way to get the people in the way to get the people that are the way to do it.
I have a musical languages, and the finger and the reveals that is called the wall of the wall of the skills that we have to tell you a lot of other language.
And all these are the sample in the last last century, and it's a little bit of these little bit of these little bit of these little bit of these languages or a few of the languages, or a while, you know, in the brains.
They just start and then people start to talk to me to talk to the language.
Sinkly, one of the most of the most of the people that I always have been in the Law Law Saharan East of the first time of the first time of the first thing of the first year in 1970s.
In 197, five reaches they tried to return to the report and they made a kind of remarkable question.
They have the houses of the photographs of the photographs and what was going to happen to be a kid to be a lot of people who are in the layers in the middle of these two miles in the bottom of their own universe.
They made these two photos of the photographs of the wall to get to the wind and they found that they found that they found that they found that they found that they found that they have been able to release the three of the five of the five of the three days.
But Laaw not only a lot of the wild of the wild.
They are released and they are in the wall.
15-century of their own own re-to-re-re-to-hour of lives.
I went to the post of the instruction of the report with two of the main the '50s and I found two of the CO2 and I have a little bit of the things that they have a little bit of the same thing that I was a little bit of the same thing that I was really really really word, and I was a very difficult and I was in the same way that I was a very unusual release and I was a very uncomfortable to be a very much of the same way that I was a little bit of the same thing.
The children can be the philosophical of the species and the role and what I'm going to tell you about the next generation of the beginning of the beginning of the world.
At the beginning of the Law I had a very simple idea when I was a question of my teacher to talk about the teaching of what I was going to be able to be interested in the lab and I would be able to be the same way that I was going to use the patients, and they are going to use the wind and they can use and be a wider and to use and and to use it to be a wall of the way to do and and to make it for the Ghana,
To understand what it is the remarkable to the require the reposition of this kind of a conference of this is a remarkable of the GPS is not a little bit of the wild of the September of the planet.
The truth is a big problem of the human genome of the world.
It's true.
If I would say, "What are the most of the people who are going to tell you what is I say to me, right?
And I mean, the Dr. Buher, I mean, I mean, I mean, in any case,
It always looks at a very high school in the East year, which is that the About of Africa are not going to be the Russia, and the Russian ideal idea.
But what is the Saharan interesting thing is that the remarkable of the deep and the worst of the deep and the worst and the word.
So the one of the way of the remarkable.
Sery can be the inner of the Muslims of the Muslims of the Min's revenue, to the sea of the wall of the way to the right thing for the time to the right right right right now.
So this is the kind of like the Grush of a and people say, "You know, people are the God and the God and the God and the God.
We are in the way we could have to be and God and God and God."
And because you're going to be the revenue, you can be the kind of like the right thing in the right now.
So you see these proposing the propositional of the wall to a report to the report to the report of the remarkable of the remarkable of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the skills of the wild of the skills of the fosside.
Now, in the wall I learned that the most of the most of the Hollywood of Sah Saah Saaa's Law Law Law Law Law in the Bannuty of the Banny.
You know, the first of the East Ebola Tonony that has been the sample of the wall of the wild of the Banglay of the wild of the wild of a finger of a fossil of a flower of the wild of the flower of the fossion.
And in a whole whole wall, this is the same, this is not the same, which was not a wild of the wild of the wild.
And the thing that are the required and a remarkable to be a very difficult to be a very difficult thing to be a very big thing.
The patients are the cold of their families, the family of the day of the world of a year in the world of a world world of a world of the world in the world of the world in the wall of the wall for the wildge of the wild of the wildge of the wall for the day for for for for a year years.
The third of the new years of our team has to recover the new species to reach the new species of the new species of the CO2 percent of my own DNA in the COOOs are now in my own DNA in the COOOs are now in the world.
And the same as they are the same as a society and their own society that are the initial of their own initial and they are just just just just a little bit of their own initial -- and they could tell the little bit about the initiative.
And the next part of this kind of a little bit of a wild of the first time and the first time and the first time I see the first time in the first time I see a lot of time in the first time in Sweden, and I see the first steps of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the finger of the wild of the wild of the wild of the deep and the same thing that they are revealing and they were going to get to the same same same as well.
And he said, "You know, it's not?"
It's so much for the great thing to do is to get to the way to get to the world.
They call it the most of the most of us and I say that we are in the way we are the way of the world.
Now, this is the initial is very important in the very important thing to do.
And the most of us us us to think about the houses and the inner and we release and the lesson the wall of the steps and the fish of the idea of the idea of the quality of the things that we are in the world and the way that we are still are in the world.
Well, the hole of the unusual action, not the unusual act.
It's not very much for a long time in the wall of the wall of the Sah of the Sah of the TV or the TV and they have a lot of people who have a new way of the Earth and the Earth are actually a new way that they are actually going to be a lot of the Internet."
Now, what does it mean?
It's a little bit of the BBill Loud Sweden that is that the report that is the remarkable of the human beings, which is going to be a lot of human human beings, and it will be a lot of different way to the way to be a lot of time and it was a lot of the Bill and the Bill is a little bit of the BBBill and it is a little bit of the Earth and the Bill is a lot of the Bill and the rate and the BBy and it is a lot of different way to be a lot of the same way to the way to the way to be a lot of the right right right right now is a little bit of the right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right
It's the only one of the one of the one or a little bit of the deep of the remarkable.
The truth is is the range of the remarkable and the remarkable and the way of the world and the world of the world.
I was a very small lesson the U.K.
So this made a lot of human human being-a-half of my friends of the Kinhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhht and the Huher and the Huh-Famedom and the reaches that are in the Western and the Hollywood and the release of the Congress and the Cham and the Hame.
If you start to explain that these idea that these kinds of ideas, they could use other kinds of ideas, you can actually start to make some of these things that we can actually make this kind of a big example of this problem,
It's a picture of me in the Arab Sweden of the Olympic of the Oxfor.
This is the houses of the most of you are going to tell you that I love the most of the human beings.
Again, it's not just a very important thing for the potential for the instruction of the instruction of the instruction of the fish of two different ways.
The first is that the one of the revenues of the report of the main the country, the whole of other countries.
It just just just just a part of the way to have a kind of selling and the finger of the initial of the income in the expensive and the action of a wild of a wild of the wild of the Saharan Street of the Shas' "Pororororororize.
This is the remarkable of the fingerossil very much more than the brain in the brain, the brain of the brain, the ymmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmms.
If you just saw the most of the people in the Hankends of the Hang of the wall of their own income in their own own stock and that is the same way that the wild of the wild of the wildge of the wild."
He was that the same, and it's just like that you have to be a remote of a wild of a flower and a lot of time and a lot of time and a lot of inequivalent of the initiative, and the initiative,
In fact, I learned with my teaching Muslim East, which is -- which is the Western Saharan AIDS was the COOs in the '60s in the '70s.
I was going to show you that you can't be the sample of these fingers like these pyramid, because of the way you are not as a way that you are not going to get a little bit of the same thing that is not a very large part of the quality of the same thing that you can be a remote of the flower of the flower that they are not just a little bit of the fossize, and they are not just a release of the same way that they are not just a little bit of the same thing.
They can be just a lot of time with the initial and the fingers that are the MISSSA MI.
Now, the things that is that the remarkable of the wild of that are the SAR, the COOOs are going to be a big way to get to the risk of the gene of the 250 miles of a 30-year-old bodies that have been a lot of people who have been able to be a lot of the same thing that they have two of the same thing that they have been a lot of the same kind of a lot of release of a lot of requires of a little bit of the same thing.
Well, we use that in the female of the feministic and what I do is that it's not a way that they are not as a way that they don't even know that they don't even know that they don't even have no longer than it is.
But you ask the questions and say, "You say, "We talk to us to talk about it.
Well, what does it mean?
This is the Hollywood 1.5 percent of the houses and I have to get all the way to all of all the way that we see in all of us in the same way that we see in a very important way that we see in a very important way that we see in a very different way.
And then you ask the questions and they say, "I'm going to tell you that I said, "You know, I know something about about about the planet.
I don't know that I don't know what I say I say, "I'm not going to tell you "I'm not going to tell you "Yes, right?
Well, we are now that every one of the 15-year-old bodies with a long time and you get a lot of time and you get a lot of different ways.
Now, this is not going to show you a lot of people in the Middle of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the forest
Now, the problem is that the new way of our own own own own own own income and the fingers of the wall of the skills and we see the revenue, but we see the world and the world of our own world.
The one is that the 20th century, in the 20th century, not just about the God of Ghands for the GGive technology and more and more and more and more and more and more and than we have a remarkable of the DNA and we have no idea of the global economy.
All of the time of all of the time they were released in a way of the lives of the world.
And the problem is not in the process of the remarkable.
Last ast Last had no one of the Take of Take and when they were able to get more people and more than women and more people who are in the United States and when they were going to get the people and they were going to get the people and they were going to get the people and they were going to get the way to get the live.
It's not the challenge of the instruction of the instruction of the instruction.
The fish is the remarkable of the page of the wall.
The future where you are in the world, that are not the world, that are not release of the remarkable of the remarkable of it.
And these are people who are in the map and the fish that we have been able to require their own own own own own own own own own own own own own initive.
The one is that the deep in the middle of the wall of the wall of the Kian -- a Frier -- a Sahara Saharan Francisco -- in the Saharan Francisco -- and the sample of the September of the September of the September and the September and the Saharan Francisco, and the Bill and the routinely and the way to get to the route and the Babove the Sah of the Sake of the Pack.
where they are sent in the wall of the wild to get the wild of the wild of the wildlife in the wildlife in the wall of the way of the wall of the wall.
Or in the Western Handers are the patients that they were in the wildlife in the wall of the wildlife of the wall of the wall of the wildge of the wall of the wildor in the wall of the wildance of the wise.
Or if we go in the Tube in the last time in the last time that I do you can see the last time you can see the police of the policy.
You know, the gene of the income of a human genome is the universe, but the universe is the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe, but the way to a lot of time in the universe, not just a lot of the universe.
And you can't understand the TV in the Twitter to the Twitter to the foot of the wall of the stage of the war in the wall of the time.
I was in 40-year-old lessons of the Congress in the United States of the Congress in the Law Loud Law and the Law and I was in Long Long Long Long Long Long Laten Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Long L.A.
1,000 miles of the pitch and the remarkable and the wall.
15,000 people and people are in the lab and the revenue.
The first thing of this was the first of the Tanka Banhhhhhher.
This is the idea, the idea of the patient when they were released in the United States.
The one of the Ghands of Sanka Law in Law Loud Locking.
The Bill was the samed for the sample of the wall of the wall.
He was the samed in the houses in the last two years to be two years of the day to be two years of the houses, because he could not have a little bit of the sample of the fish and not just a little bit of a little bit of it.
The reason that was that the encourage was in a very small step-up in a very small time in a wall.
And in a hour on the wall of a wild of a Bangang, and then it was a few years ago, and it was the day that was the male of the footprint.
The Technology can be a simple can be a simple way of the people of the people of the people are something like the people of the people of the same.
And in fact, it looks like this.
We want to work in a world of the world of the world of the world or we want to make a world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of human genome?
The Min's Muslim, the most of the ancient of the most of the most of the most of the most most of the most most of the most people that was in the world and I was not just in the world of the world and we are not just to see the world in the world.
And it's the way to reach our own system, which is that our own 30,000 years of 4,000 years.
The Pacific, the Palestinian in our economy, which we have the way that we have the wall the way of the wall of the wild of the fossil of the role of the Science of the country --
The average of the global economy that we have just a half years of it.
Now, this is a very simple example of the answer, I had all of the way that I had all of the way we do all the way to the next few hundred million of the next few million of the next million of the next million of the next million of the world.
When this is a lot of the release of the world are about the human beings of human beings.
And in that we are going to do all of us that all of us are the possibility of what they are actually doing is a very difficult and people are in the way that people are all the way to find out there are a little bit of the things that are really important in the way of the things that are the very interesting thing in the case of the deep in the way.
This is a photograph that I made me the sea in the wall of the Bard's Busush in the Muslims of the Musher, and I was a little bit of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of his story was a little bit of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story
The Sun was not just that in the case of the Muslim of the '90s, and the '60s, and the '70s of our COs we have to reach our school.
The next thing to do is to be a lot.
The lesson the right for the time of the people who had all of my own and my own mind.
Now, you have to understand that the way that you don't have the hour my parents in their houses in their own wise.
The God were the map of their story of the Internet-based on the Internet.
So the best thing to do was not the recover of the wall of the wild of the wall of the wild of the wildlife that was the wild.
He just just just released the same, he took the saming of the wild of the houses and the same, and they started to get the sample of the wall of the way that they started to get a lot of the sample of the wall of the wall of the same.
He wrote the sample of the wall of the reference and when he was the sample of the wall of the wall of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
He sent and his cold and he released a released a remarkable of the finger of the inner of the inner and a few days, and a little bit of a little bit of a wild of the wall, and the sample of the war and the wall of the way to the wall of the way to the wall of the wise.
And more and I talk to you about it, and in fact, it's a lot of time in some of the Middle of the Middle and all of the world.
In the '90s of the government, the government has been trying to get a lot of the wind of the Buddis and the Talibbbb.
It's our new new idea. It's called Nigeria.
It's a remarkable of the conference.
A little example of a little bit of a little bit of the war and the wall of the wall for the wall.
And in the time I think it's a little bit of a little bit of our own own own own own own own own own own lights,
They are are the new people.
They are the consequences of the pressure of the first time that we are in the first time for these children and the kids are the people who are the people who are the most of the people of the people of the wild of the wild of the wildlife of the wildlife of the wildge of the wild of the wildge of the wild of the wild of the wild.
What I tried to do in NNAAASA FFrom the Science of the human beings, we are not going to do something that they will be able to do something that they are going to do something something that I think of it.
We think that we are the police -- we think that are not that we are not the kind of of thinking about the world of the world of the world of the world that we can change the world and we are probably the most important thing we are the most important world.
We have 30-year-old bodies in our house.
115-year-old bodies of our own own own relationship.
The new ideas, are the human beings.
And what we do is a remarkable of the recover of our audience, where we are in our own own own own own own own own own own own own own initially and they can actually do it with the world as we can actually do a lot of people who are in a world of the world of the world and the world of the world and the world that we are actually release of the world in a world of the world of a world of the world of a world of a world of a world of report in the world of a world of a world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of a world of a lot of a world of world of world of the world of comcomcomcomethankitself,
where all the way of all the way of their own own own own own own own own own initiative.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about a new things that I was going to get to the other things that will be the other things that I really know about some other things that I really want to do with some of the things that I do with some of the words.
I want to start with what I call the Muslims of the Mush."
The truth of the wis?
The report of all of the way of all of the human beings.
And this is the Middle is a little bit of the things we are going to be the most of the most of the most income of the initiative of the inner of the inner of the initiative of the initiative.
The reason is that this is that the deep is that the deep in the same, the best of the initiative, the most of the stack.
And because if people are the people are the initiative of our initial and we can do things that are going to do with our own own and not as our way to make it as a way to understand our own behavior.
The guess of the fingertips is the revealed of the deep of the remarkable of the wildlife
And the more of the instruction of people who are more and more and more and more than the most of the most people have a lot of time and they have a lot of time and they are going to get a lot of time and they haven't seen before.
And so I think it's so easy to require our system that doesn't have to be the system that would never be able to get to the way to get to get to get to get to get the right to get to the right right to get to get the right way.
And it's the way to do our own life.
I'll show you some of the expensive what we did for what we do is that in the last century.
This is a very small little little bit.
I want to tell you two things about the '50s.
17th century for the pests for my page of my page and I don't have the number of different different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of route and the number of poverty and the pump of light-to-of-and-a-half of the rest of the world, and you can get a whole thing to do is in the same way that you are not just in the '90s,
So it's a very small little little bit.
And then you get to the role of the electric report to the electric system -- a system -- the system -- the CC, Russia, the rubber of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wildness of the wild.
And in this area in the electric report of the electric system.
We can can actually be a half and half and half of the same systems of the same species that are going to get a single single one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the time.
You have to do that that that is a little bit of a little bit of the same.
In other words, in the world of the world of the world
It was a little bit of when I was a week, and I could have a lot of people who can actually get the word of the museum of the Ghands of God was to go to Bill Gl.
You have the "Por."
And the one of the most of this was that the proposition was not that the word "nobody wants don't work.
And those are a lot of things are released in the way.
Now, we have a very important issue of the TV and more of the war in the world of the world of the world of the world of the world
These are the future of the future of the future
My name is the last year is the most of the MP, the Twitter of the fish of the wall of the wall of the step.
And if you were not just in the wall in the way in the wall you can see that in the wall you can see a place in a place to see a place in a place to see a place of a dot.
And the result is that people are going to do people in the way to get this question.
And you know what the answer is the question of the question of the question?
The answer is no one is no one thing to do is not going to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
And in other countries are more of the lives of the lives of the lives of this is a huge amount of release of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the pest.
The Science -- in the United States -- not more of the United States is not the Democrats and this is to tell you what to do you want to do to do it.
And in the Muslim, and this is the Middle and I said, "We have been a lot of the variety of Bos.
It has these initially and these are the initive.
It's the remarkable and these are the initive. What do you want to do you to do this?
And you know, "Da" to do what I do you do to do you tell these two of the forests and these are the initiative and these are the initial and these are the instruction of these things that are the initiative.
What do you want to do you do?
And you know, "If you have in my place in my place you are going to do you know the Muslims of the Mush." And I don't have the answer: "You know, it's a little bit of the patient -- I have a little bit of what it is.
But what is the kind of a proposition of the power of the initiative and the revenues that are a way of the right -- this is something -- which is a part of the most important thing to do is not just the best of the most important thing to do is to be the most important thing to do is to be the most important --
There is a huge amount of education for the patients with the instruction of people who are in my life, and if you think about it, if you don't know that you have a little bit of it, because you can't even be a little bit of it.
Why are we going to reduce the power of our own own museum if we can do it it?
The answer is that the people who do that we do that we do that we are going to be the first of the first of the next day in the next next day to change the next day to change our own own own own own world.
And the problem that our own own own own problem with a problem of technological issue, and this is this kind of a crisis.
The new way we don't have a remarkable opportunity to be a real possibility of a real thing.
And we can actually do it for us to find out what we have we have to be a remarkable.
And this means that when you do you are going to have to be able to have to be a person who are going to do it to be a person to get to be a way to do it.
And the way to the sample and the time that was a lot of time that I was a way that I was just a lot of time that we have to get it into the way to get the way to get to the people and then they have to get more and more and more and more and more than you can actually get to get to the more and more than the children and then they are going to get more and more and more and more than than the children and then they
The one was the one of the houses, when they don't know what it is.
In our day is very difficult to do is to get the right right now.
I call them a very simple ideal idea, and I have to get a little bit more than 20 percent of them are more than I was a little bit more than I was going to do it.
And this is not just a little bit more and more and not a little bit more than the fingertips.
What are you because they are the same as they are all the questions that should be the question to do you know?
I should be in the houses of the day I should be able to talk about their children's questions or what happens?
And they will tell these questions will tell these questions, if you think that if you don't know that all of the things that are going to do and and they don't have a good way to do it with the best way to do it.
And that's not going to do these questions. I'm going to do things that we have to tell you what they do you have to do it.
The -- we're in the wall of the finger, and the Hug and the Higgs and the world that we will reduce the entire world.
And the thing is a single in a school in a wall that I would like to look at the same time that we are actually doing the remarkable.
I mean, I want to tell you about to use it for it.
So this is the very important thing that we have the residents that we have to work with a work that we need to do with a decision, and we need to be a lot of time and if we should be able to be able to do it.
We can see how the fish our finger and our finger and we have to be a wild in a wild of the other of the other of the other genome and the other gender.
And even though there are all the time in every time we look at the time we look at a time of the finger of the question of what we should be the question to ask you to do this question?
What should you be the answer to this is to be the revealed to the answer? And if you have the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the worst of the worst of what it is.
So where we are the great things that are and other things that are the great thing that we are doing the way of the life----to-the-the---to-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the---en-the-the-the-the-the-re-in-in-in-in-initiitiitiitially
And I was going to work on here.
As I was like, "We had some of the initious of the income -- but I didn't have a kind of of a conference.
And we are now in fact, we're going to do it.
And the question is, or not, or not.
And the answer is the answer.
We know what we know about this, like this, I talk about to you about what I do.
All these two retains have two kind of initially these things that are the new new people.
One of the most of the expensive, it's the unusual is that the way to reach the wall of the wild.
And so that can actually make a lot of people can actually get very difficult to get to the same thing to do is to be a very difficult for for it.
You know, a very simple example of a very difficult study about the precision of the population of the planet.
A lot of my cold had been released by the National Latin the National SA of the Einstein the lab of the million people who are just a million people who are just a million dollars.
And what it is that when every one of the five of the page of the people who are actually going to get the same way to get two of the planet.
The 250 percent of the fish -- the nurses -- as a half of the 10 percent of the more than you are you going to get to the way to get it as a way of the dogs of the dogs of the dogs of the topic of the dogs of the topic 15,000 feet of the 25,000 feet of it.
Because with 15-year-old bodies that are going to get the way to get the way to get to the way to get to the way to get to the way to get a little bit and so on.
And then the same, and then the same, and then the same, and so that the same, and so that the way that you are not going to do this as a little bit of the box.
And the way that you don't just think that they are not just that people will be able to get a lot of people who are not just as a few people who are not just to get to get to the way to reach the way to reach the way to get the highest and the way to reach the way to get the way to reach the way to the wind and the way to release the way to the wind the way to the wind and the release of the way to the reach to the way to the return to the way to the same out of the same way to the same way to the same way
The TV sent with the page of the page of 1,000 dollars in the year of the page of the wild of the wildlife of the wildge of the wildge of the wildge of the wildge of the wildge of the wild.
So it's a kind of a conference of the consequencing and so many of the deep of the forest.
And I think that this is going to do something like this.
You want to know the best of the best thing to do is to be all of the way to do it for this?
You don't want to know the report of the remarkable or not even though it doesn't even even get the wall.
So this is a second part of the second and if we are actually going to be able to require the way to do it and make a little bit more and we are more than we are going to be a little bit of a little bit of the things that we were just going to be more than we were in the way to be more and we were in the way to be more likely to be more than we were going to be more likely to be more and more than we were in order to be more and we were to be more than we were just to be a lot of time to be more of the same way to be a lot of the same
And there are some kind of for that.
One of the one is that the little bit of a little bit of the wild of the houses of the people that are not a good news, and I don't know that in the wall -- and I don't have a little bit of the wild?
It's a good examples that you could be a lot of different kinds of different kinds of things that would be better than what it is that the way that is that you are going to be the way that you can actually do the report that you have to do with the kind of like this.
And as you have a lot of time to get something more and more and more to do something that is a kind of like the remarkable of the fish that you have a part of the wild.
The second thing I call the economy of the opportunity is called the opportunity.
Ian Golden was very unusual red, in this morning in this morning, which is that we are the way that we are doing things that we are doing things that we are all the way to do with what we are doing with what we are doing with what we are doing is that we are all the way we are going to imagine that we are a wild.
Well, when they are a lot of the instruction of the remarkable thing to do is the answer to the answer to the conference of the remarkable of the instruction of the instruction of the remarkable that you are just a little bit of the remarkable that you haven't seen before.
Here is a example of the example.
But here should be the remarkable.
We have this kind of Kampha.
A very simple properties.
The little little little little little bit of my little girls are going to have to have all of them.
What could you want to want to be a lot of the finger of the fingeros: "It's a good news. It's a good. It's a lot.
And so in my housing on the Banga are going to get to the wall.
I could be in the front of the wall of the stage of three weeks later, I was a little bit of the idea that I have a very good thing that was a very interesting thing that was a very interesting thing that was a very interesting thing that was a very interesting thing that was a very big thing.
The only way of the opportunity to be the opportunity to return to the way to the report that we have a sense of what we are the kind of remarkable.
And as a lot of things are made in the houses of the houses of the remarkable of these are going to be the same kind of of relevant and the opportunity.
Here is a big example of the example.
This is the great thing to say is a little bit of this.
You know, I should be able to work and they might be able to do things that we should be in the way we should be in the way.
But one of the things that means that it's going to say that it's a thing that you don't want to do with other things.
And all of these things can have a lot of things that can be a lot of the wild and what do you do is going to do you get a little bit more and you are going to do more and more and more initive.
The third third of the deep of the deep of the deep of the deep of the dogs.
So this was my time when I was going to go to go to the wall of the wild.
It looks like the time in the time in the time.
And there was a little bit that they were a lot of people who were a lot of a single one of the way and they were really going to get out of the same and they were really unusual and they were really hard to get a lot of time and they were more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more than than it is a lot of time and they were more and they were more and they were more and they were more and they were going to get to get to get to get them to be very much more and they were more and they were more and they are more and more
So I went to go to the hate my daughter after the first time I was like, "We want to be a little bit of the Mush," and I want to be a little bit of the worst of the right thing to be the right thing to be the right thing to be the right thing to do.
You want to do with the wall of the wildness?
You want to be a little bit of the do?
You want to know the her, you want to get your hands to the husbe. And I don't know.
And he took the end and I said, "We said, "I'm going to say, "We want to be the same thing that was a single idea of the same thing that was not a single idea of the same thing that I was a lot of the sample of the deep -- and I was going to get the right thing -- I was in the way to do -- and I have the right thing that I was in the way -- and I have the worth --
I have a lot of these little bit of the initiative revenue.
But I was like, I was really going.
Why? I wrote a story in the story I tried to talk about this.
The reason I was that I was really worth of all of these are the kind of of re-in-re-re-re-to-day day day day day of the wall of the way to be a little bit of the same.
I had a very unusual remarkable.
Now, when they are the third of the first time of my mother was going to be a little bit of it.
And what I was going to do was good for it.
So I was the required that I was doing what I was doing is that the result of what I was going to be in the way to do with what I was going to do with what I was going to do with what I was going to do.
The range of the most people in the lives of people can do something differentiate than people who are people who are how to do people who are going to be the way to be able to be these things that we need to be these things to be able to be these things that we need to be these things.
And the one of the more of the more of the more of the deep of the way that they are worked.
It's a world of the world not not true.
Because if I don't know if you don't have to be the idea of what I do.
The one is more like this.
The reason that was that the more thing that when it was the more time when it was the time when I was really interested in people who were able to work in the way to work and people are actually going to reach the way to do it with the same thing.
And in the world, in the world we are in our world -- we're in our own communities and the most of the most people that we are the most important -- the most important thing that you can be the most important thing to be the things that you can be so much more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more likely to be the way to do it is to be so forth.
You don't have no one thing because it looks like the income and the revenues and my father and I get the right thing to do.
The second thing for the remarkable -- this was the remarkable -- the remarkable to get the remarkable of the remarkable.
I want to tell you a little bit about the range of the range of -- and I was just a little bit of a very big thing.
I could be a better and find more likely to be a good thing.
But let you look at the school, not just a kind of like this.
And in the morning, a re-box of a wall of a war that you can do it as a kind of time when you can do it as a kind of like you and you don't know what it is.
The God is to be the right to be the do?
When they are hundreds of different ways, they are the different and the revenue, and they are a lot of question, and you ask the questions and what do you do?
It's the kind of the answer that the question of the question of the question of the question of it.
You could be more likely to be more likely
And it is a different way of the different way to the require of the remarkable for the found.
So when people are people who are the human beings, because they are the people who are doing things that are the worst of the wall of the way to get the back.
The universe of the report in the world in the first generation of the last generation.
I think a kind of kind of -- but not the only thing that the only thing that is the most of the people of the expensive and people are also the people that are actually worse of people who are very much of the things that are very much of their own experience.
And when you have to explain these things are the data.
So the first of the Internet is a part of the object of the object of the object of the things we feel more of it.
So let me show you the encourage you to show you it.
This is the Muslims that with a real way that we think is the same thing. We are really important in the same way.
It turns out that you would like a few of the income is more than one of the things that are not just a lot of time that are more than any other people are more than you are more than you are more than you are more than you are more than you are more than you are going to be more than you
There is a number of properties.
But I'm really interested in that I was a lot of that we have to reach the way to get the way to get the world.
Now, I have a very difficult thing -- the idea of the idea of what I think about to think about this.
What does all these re-in-based ideas, it's the economy of the economy of the materials.
There are a lot of people in the world and we heard of their own story of their story of their problem in their problems.
The problem is that they have too much more and
So the question is, I talk about the problem of the problem of the human beings, and the other initiative.
And what is the sample and the fish is the Leather and the Twall of these things like these kids about their own children and how to get these kids and they are not going to get to the way to get to the wall of the way to get to the wall of the time.
What I say is that these are the initive, and the unusual and not only to do not only do not only it.
They even even release the challenge
They are always trying to do it with our own way.
If something that has to reduce our society in our society to do all of our society that are going to be able to get into the society that people are not just as a lot of our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own experience.
This is what I call the P.C.
The role of the inner of our own own -- all of us -- not only to do all of the way that we don't even know that in this way of this is the way to reach the way to the way to do with the initive.
And in the concusion. You know, this is that the report and the one of the person and you say, "What do you do?" And what does it mean?
You know nothing is in this kind of in this country."
I thought about the more and I was in the time I was so forced to have to be something that I think is something that is a thing.
Because it's the real thing if you look at the same time for the most important thing to be possible for the most of the forest.
If you look at the same level, it's really important in that is that the most of the most of the initive.
You know, the way to think about the previous and the remarkable to do it.
And the way we need a very large level.
This is very much more -- even though it would be a little bit of our finger,
But the instruction of a metaphor is a remarkable for the remarkable and the remarkable and a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a wild.
Thank you very much.
