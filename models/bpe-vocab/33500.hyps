And the year we showed these two diaded degrees to demonstrate that the police that the most of the police that the most of the last three million years was the size of the size of the marine of 48 percent of the marine of 40-percent of the marine rate with 40 percent of the year.
But this moral moral issues because it doesn't look because it doesn't look at the black hets.
The police is in a way, in a way, the heart of the global climate system.
It goes down and it goes down and it is contracts and it is contracts and it is the acts of the same, and it goes down and it goes down and it goes down and it goes down and it goes down and it is extent and it is the act.
The next slide that I will show you a very quickly going to be a quickly on what happened in the last 25 years.
The pumpeman-pan-ended with smell.
As you can see blue blue fear of blue fear of blue fear of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of blue cats.
This is the anual annual for the nose.
And it looks at the summer.
Asad the guy's fall of five years or more years or more, you can see that it's almost like the sangs of a body of a body of a body of a body.
In 25 years of the end, at this point.
This is a problem because the inner of the depth of the finger around the ocean around the world,
where it's a massive amount of carbon carbon amounts of carbon needyhtheless is transformed in meter, is transformed in metal catch in the micro-organisms.
Compart with polluting the global warming global warming in the atmosphere could go to if we go to this extreme if we go to this extreme way we go to this point in the way we go to this point in the way we go to this very clever of the polluty of the global pollutely.
It already already in certain lacks in the Alaska is on the Alaska is on the soup of the water.
The Professor Katey Walter at the University of Alaska was on with another team at another lac at a little late from the past.
Again: Oh, yeah, it's OK -- it's OK -- it's if we are going to be there.
And a reason is that is that enormous "wor" is the Grow's Grows.

On the whole world has led to a dramatic creative credance of the incentives of the incentive of the world of the incentive of the world of the sea world.
And disasters on all the world grew up with a very extraordinary rate and the summer.
four times the time in the last 30 years of the age of the 75 years of the age of the 75 years of the other day.
This is a very unusual model of it.
If you look at the history of you can see what happens.
In the last five years I added 70 million tons of carbon dioxide in every 24 hours at every day in the ocean every day every day in the ocean every day in the ocean every day every day in the ocean every day in the ocean every day of the last five million tons of tons of the next five million tons of tons of near tons of near t

And it was going to build it was built more factories for a good factories for good character.
But we start a whole lot of change.
Here are the people who were anulated in the last few years with propositional to propose.
All you have a policy in our own policy.
And the carbonate industry and the oil was spending a hundred dollars in the last year of the last year of the enforced year

This image of a reminder of something like this.
In the previous Cracial Lenness, a billion-billion-stage charged was imprastid.
You probably have you see it in the stirony.
This is, on the second big deals in the second big depression, the second big depression.
One of the great industry of the cartoons, about the Cracial reclaim was this.

So our main is to spend a lot of money for the money for the public forces that are to help us look at the public forward about the book.
The truth is not dirty is not dirty is not dirty
We think it's curious -- and I have got it -- and best.
So you won't get it for climate change for climate change
You have that in our understanding of it.

Thank you very much much so much.
The year at TED I did a introduction to LHC.
And I promised to give you a data data about how they work is working.
So I hit my sister and for those who have not here is the most scientific experiments that was the most scientific experiments -- the Street Scopyright in the Street or is to recreate the consistent of a billion times at least a fraction of a billion times at least a billion times on the way to the university of the universe -- the panel -- the panel from the universe.
It's very much more than both usually as well.
This is the Geneva.
We do photographs of these minds "Big Bang" in the decades.
I work on this. It's called the ALS detector ALS -- Lun4 feet diamond, diameter of 22 feet photographs of ATLS here is a picture of ATLS in the building of the ATLS will see is going to see it.
On 10 seven, we went down the year and the first time I got the first time.
And this picture was made of ATLASS.
It caused a great famous to control the room
It's a picture of the first piece of the particle that has been criminated across the LHC, cross HC, cross Souning a lot of LHC deliberate in the desert is detector.
In other words, when I saw that image of 10 seven, I knew that the apartment of the device functional, which is a huge success.
I don't know if that was received the biggest or that, when someone went to the Google and I saw it was the first page that the first page of the same way.
It means that we did a cultural impact on the Russian impact.
And after about a week I had a problem with the device, which actually had to do with these days, these days, these days.
Those are being transported 13 thousand fill when the apartment is working on the moon.
Now, the engineers in the arrived, and they say, "Not can be transport."
But I can do this because when they're at temperatures become a superconductor of the green temperature.
So as a 271 degree of it, we have a cold of the hospital in the hospital can transport these cuttttable.
At one of the layers of the next to LHCHC, was a factory of manufacturing factories.
So that the company was sweater and the 13 of the 13 of ampers were in the way of the electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressible to the magnetic magnetic magnetic in 20 ton, and they moved almost 30 chapters in 30 chapters.
So I have deteriorate about 50 magnetic magned.
We had to take it outside, which we have to do.
I represented it all over the way to the top, I repair
And now we are maybe, then we go to the subteran.
And at the end of the march of the margins of the LHC will be like new ones.
We're going to start again, and we go back and get our data in the idea, or we will continue to get the research and continued to find out that are elements of the universe.
Now, of course, as a way, those accidents accidents about the important scientists and engineering, and engineering, and we put them on the extreme to break down to break.
I think that it is because it is attacked to the fact that we have young inals, this is the important thing we have LHCHC.
So I'm going to leave the words of a scientist of Britanic scientist, Humphrey Davy, who I think that if you had to go away, this is Michael Faraday, he said, "Ny" is not more dangerous than we can put our science and we prepared the science of our science are not in our minds are finding and as a matter of our science, and as mysteries are not in our finger."
Thank you.
I want to remind you to remember your childhood, when you play with your board.
On the main resistance to watch them and get them and get them to the colo, and you actually invite them to how to get and sold and manipulate and manipulate the relationships.
The spatial of the spot is deeply to a lot of the world in the world in the world in the world of the world in the world in the world in the world of the spatial world.
So to say, in the IT inquire IT re-in-inability to interact with our physical objects -- impression with my consultant skill, my color my color of Kalanthia -- I started to go out -- I was starting to go -- I was going to go to a computer, where we can use a computer, where I could use a computer to take a computer to a whole bunch of mountain and a little bit of the mountain and a little bit of a new way to go and we could both apply to a little bit of the mountainly to the mountain and we use of the next to a computer, and we can be both of the next to do it to take a computer to go to the next to a computer, and then go avoice and then apply to a computers and then apply to a committeamong the next to a computers and
It looks like what we want to now?
The question was so fascinated by the fascinating we had hoto. We had the answer to build Stweet Stttable to the Stttable to the question of Stttable to this idea of the fascinating Stable.
In short, a short computer, it's a computer interactive computer, is a computer interactive of a biscal biss.
They can be manufacturer they can perceive it, they can perceive the way on the other side, and a radio and an ultra-radio wireless and a wireless wireless of the wire.
The most important is that they're palpable, but like the games of play, you can only get them as much to get them on them.
And Sif, the example of an example of an ecosystem of digital manipulation of digital manipulation of digital manipulation.
On the magic of what these instruments are becoming more and more and more and more constantly constantly of each other, and the constantly activists and fun of our units of intervention.
I'll start with some examples of simple.
This Siftable is confifident to represent image, and if it includes in a movie state, if you include it in the other part, they get it back to the other part, they go back back to the other.
These are the interactive intervention are constantly constelling one of the other.
So, if I put them one langer, they become interesting.
If there are unconscious, they will see and that, and they can become a little confused and become a bit of confusion.
and you can feel the mission and inclinic.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of interactions is like we can use the same way we can use the data, like to manipulate the data, how we would get a college of how we would get a liquid a liquid liquid on a liquid liquid of the interaction of the interactions of the interactions of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction is that we
In this case, we have three Sifwscan of voice that galls and they can use it to use the color in the center, where they will be fit in the center, where they will be fit in the center, where they are going to mix it.
If we go too much, we can get a little bit of back.
There is also interesting possible for education, like education, like visions and logical and logical logical and logical things we want to want to be a very quickly, and to see the results in the way to see the results right now.
So here I -- this is a Fibonacire of the Fibacious program that they do with a simple stuff.
Here we have a game game of the words, a combination of the Scrabs and Boggles.
So every single one of the first one letters in the first time in every Siftweet and to forget what they trying to formed, are the way to forget with a diction-theial dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds up about 30 seconds are reseem and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities for us to inclever and new possibilities of the end.
Thank you.
Those are kids who came to the excurious Laborator Laborator and I had reduced them to get them to work and filmmaker and filmmaker and filmmaker.
It liked them to crazy.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of application is not that you don't have to give them many of the people of the structure.
All you have to say is "From the words, and they know exactly what to do.
Here are people who are people going to get them out of them.
This is the most tangible testing to our own right, down in the right.
It turns out that everything that wanted to do was to do was to do it on the other Sifttable to do it.
So for him were just cuting.
This is an application of animator.
We wanted to build a instrument for those who invent language.
And this is French --
It can introduce us to new characters in the scene, just lift on those Sifwiss that they are affected.
So here it goes down to the soil
Video: The Surry.
David Merrill: Now he introduced a tractor in the scene.
Video: The portion of the portion of the portion of the portion of the portion of the portion of the wild:
Very of yes.
When Swettable and aside them and asive one can make their persons to interact -- Video: Ham!
DM: It creance.
Video: Huna!
DM: It's a very exciting story with open, and he decides.
Video: Zboard, the pish, the pyet!
DM: The last example I have time to show you today is a designing instrument and interpret music that we built and interpreted music that we built the role and the sound of sounds like the role and all the role of the sounds of sob.
Every four different variations of these different variations of you choose it.
And you can get the sound of a succession that you can get the same at the time you are.
You get the sound touch Sweet Sweet Sweet a Stweet of success.
There is effects that you can control the poor control, like reverberal and the filtration and the filter.
You attack it to a certain sounds and then including it to help it to help it to help it it.
It's going to go out and general effects like the trip, and the volume that are applied to the intrees of the sun to see it.
Video: TM: I will start with a riting in the second Swescscore them in a serious amount of time in a serious wave of a serious way.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: I hear it a little bit of perpetual.
Video: I will add the filter to all the way to control the movie, to control the way to control the effect of the light.
Video: You can get the intremendous inclining the inclining in a part or something.
Video: I'm going to go ahead for more expensive band for more expression.
Video: I can re-resection in the way they can do the same.
So you don't have to do the plan, they can improvise, prevailing or a short or a short song or a same.
Now, I can find out the end, I can get the whole bag, to use the Sweweb to the switch of the sea in the stange.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is my passion is the creation of our computers that are working better with the way it works and our body in our brain.
And today, we had time to show you a coordination of this new spatial of design, and some of the possibilities that we were trying to get from the lab.
The list that I wanted to retiny is like we're at this new generation of interview with this new general interview with the digital interview with the digital rules that will bring information to our world.
Thank you very much.
And these wisdom to talk to you all of you to talk to you.
They're writing.
He wrote books to my characters, but it's more than it is.
It's my mom loved and fascinating a list of a life.
And I don't have that to change that way.
But this is what weird, something like weird in my career and in the neighborhood and in my career who determined me to re-recycling relationship with work.
And the funny is that I wrote this recurge, this is that biography of the "Manan," that Roage," which is Iubeste," which is unlike a lot of my career in the world for a very reasoning in the world for a few reasoning a very important pelling of an international weapons.
The result is like anywhere in the people go now, people treat me now, people treat the time.
Serios -- the connoissed -- the convicted --
So for example, rejorry, and you say, "You don't have your teams -- you don't have any more passwords, you will not be able to be able to get the performance of performance it?
You don't know that you're going to write the whole life on your life that we will ever create a time a book that will ever be able to make the world that ever se?"
It's very linear the mysterious idea.
But it was also more than I remember if I didn't remember all 20 years, when I started to get people -- I started to get people -- I want to become a teenager, I want to become written by the same African reaction of the same African reaction of the same African reaction of the same African reaction of the same African reaction of a way of the one of the same African reaction on a kind of a way of the people --
And people were saying to me, "You don't have any more of success?"
Don't you do not make sure that the shape of recovering your own idea?
Don't you do it is that you will work in this field of life in this field, and nothing will be here and you have a fall over here and a fear of a fear of the flower of the filled with the mouths of the screen?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the answer -- the answer to all those questions is "Yeah."
Yes, it's the theme of all things.
And I always got me.
And you get the theme is the one of the things that people who are not going to get them.
As an example of the marine algorithm of these things that are crypes.
But when it's about the writing thing I was always thinking about the last time I was all the time I was in the last time is "What?
Is it something rational?
It's the logic to get it to be the work that they feel like that they were doing it in this Pame.
And what is it so specific initiatives that seems like us is really true in our health, in a way that you have a mental mental mental initiatives not doing it?
My attempt was a chemical engineer and I remember it in the 40 years of her 40 years of his engineering, it was asking it to be asking him if you don't have a chemist.
It didn't happen -- John, how does the chemical block in the chemical?
It just doesn't happen to something.
But as we are chemists, the chemists, as a group of reputation in the reputation of reputation of reputation to be alcools of maniaction of maniacative maniacate
We are written in this way, we have this reputation and not only written and artists, but it turns out that they have this kind of reputation to be very strongly unable to be very strongly unable to be very strong.
And everything we have to look at is to look at the numbers of morning of the 20th century, in the 20th century, and often in the 20th century, which have died by young people who died by young and often in the own own own own own own own man.
And even those who didn't have to be really honestly in the way it would be really destroyed by your own own own own brain.
Norman Mailer, even before I go to the last interview that "Every one of my cart" -- he used to me, "Every little little bit more than I did a little more more than a little more and more of my career in my care."
A great great great about the work of a life.
But we don't have the clients we hear anyone say that because we heard this because we heard these things like this, and somehow much and somewhat I have to absorbed and somewhat the idea is that the creativity, and the idea that the creativity, it will take a sense of being always leaving in a sense of being being always leaving in a sense of the wants.
And the question I want to adreseem to be all here today is you all of this is all of this ide?
You are comfortable with it -- because as as as as as it can be immediately with this idea, I don't care about this ipocket with this ipocket with this ipocket with this idea.
I think it's like that.
And I also think it's dangerous and I didn't want to see it in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage our artists to travel the artists.
And I know that I know that I was my situation -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to go to the neighborhooooown, especially because of the circumstances I find a circumstances in which I find out the professional in which I find out the case I find my professional --
For example, I'm pretty tanker, I just just got about 40 years.
I have got four years of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of four decades of the work of four decades of the work of the work of four decades.
And it's very likely to write the inception with this moment to be judged by the way that the work of the last few to my foot to my last career, right?
What would be saying to me is a help, because in a kind of reach out of the people here -- it's very likely to be the most successful of my own success to me.
Oh, God, what I woke up.
This is the kind of the way that could be able to look at the way to go to the narrative, and I don't want to go out that person.
I want to do it in the continues to do it.
And then the question is what is it going to be here?
And so I think a lot of meditation, as a quitative as I have to go now, to try to make me right now, is by creating a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a psychological construction protective protection, right?
I had a way, to find a way to find a distant way to step back to me, one that write, and my father who wrote to my graduate nature that will be right now before I was going to be right at what I wrote in what I wrote out.
And as I did go in the last year -- I started to look at this sense, and I tried to find out over the time, and I tried to see if they could have better ideas about how to be helped us to be held and healthy people create emotional risk to be helping people create emotional risk to be helping to be enhd.
This is the research went to Greece and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma researcher in the research in Greece and the research in Greece and the research in Greece.
So you have the sky is the certainly inchide.
But in the Gre-recycles and Roming and Roming the creativity, they were not in the human inside the humanito?
People thought that creativity, was a spirit was a spirit that they were helping people to go back and unintelligia, and unintelligent in and unintelligent and unintelligible and unintelligible and unintelligible people who were a spirit of creativity.
The byards were called these spirits of creativity.
Socratic was famous to that he was a department that he was a department in the desert of the wisdom in the department of the department of the department.
The Romans were the same pure -- but they were called the imateral spirit of general spirital.
What is great, because they were not truly because they were not a very good individual genius was a very destroyed individual genius.
They thought a genius was a kind of a genius was a kind of effective entity in the artist's wall of the artist, and the houses of the arrived, the by, the sweatable and obile the work of the work of the work of the work of work of work in the work of work and the workers of work of workers that work and the workers are worth of the workers of the work of the workforce of the worker waste workers of the wall the work of the workshop.
Absolutely -- this is the distant -- that's the distant that I talked -- that the kind of the kind of a psychological building of your works.
And the world is that the world works, right?
So the artist was protected by some of the things that we were too much narcisism, right?
If your work was stralitan was stralitan entire world could not get the world for her, the whole world of the world of the ball that helped the world that helped it.
If your work was criticism was not completely the lead to you, isn't it?
Everybody else like the gene of your gender gender was kind of ignorance.
So they watched people from the West creativity.
And then came to the Renthusian idea, and everything that is channel of the idea of the moon as the individual universe, the idea of the universe on the center of the universe and mysterial creatures that are receiving from the wisdom of the wish, and the mysterial creates in the disk of the waste of the wrist.
It was the human arm, and people started to create creative and people started to create creative that creation was all inside of the individual individual in the individual individual way.
And for the first time in history of people started talking to one or other artists, instead of genius as being genius in the way to get a genius.
And you have to married, I think it was a huge error.
It would be a simple person, a simple person, and it's actually the receptor is actually the receptor and the spring and the surface and the surface of the mysterious mysterious and the unfortunate of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile
It's like you have a quick a hitro to get the wire.
It just incovered and it in the way and it is it going to get all these these astethels on the performance of performance.
I think that the pressure of the artist's arrow us on the last 500 years.
And if it's true, and I think it's the question to ask is, what do we do?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we're going back to the older relationships between people and the mystery of the relationships.
It may not be it.
Maybe we can't even know 500 years of thinking about four years of thinking about a way of thinking about 18 minutes.
And you probably find out of the public questions that would raise the very good legitimate to the theory of the fact that people are actually going to get people arrid and everywhere.
I probably don't want to go on this idea.
But the question I want to ask it is -- why don't I do it -- why don't they it?
Why don't we think we don't think about this?
Because it has a long sense of as much more than I heard about how I have heard about the very innocent to the completely innocent process.
It has been to be able to make something -- basically to create something -- basically to create something -- and it doesn't always behavioral behavior.
And in fact, sometimes it can seem to be the right paranormal debris to the right way.
I had a reminder where I met in the American American American Ruth Stone, who was now about 90 years ago, and that was now about 90 years and who was the poetry to be when I was a child and he told me when the child was going to work on on the wall over the camp, and I just hearing a pop and he just heard a poet and he just heard a poet and he just heard a poet and he just heard of the camelder.
The story of the story was like a vast vast of air.
And it was the way it goes over the camps.
The idea is coming up because you get the ytail is the ytap under the fear.
In that moment it has a single thing that it has to do, and that is a single applied that you get the applied of the applicator.
And it goes to the home to the margin, and the whole idea was to get to a idea was to get a map of map and a piece of map and a creative credive.
Sometimes it was not enough enough enough to get it and alone and running and running and running and the poems and the poems and the poems and the poems and the poems her, and I read it in the room, and I read it on the room, I was going to get the poet it on the poet and the poet and the poet of the poet and the poet and the poet and the poet and the poet and the poet and the poet and the poet it was not going to go to a different way.
They were also the moments where I was not going to look at this time -- moments that story is almost a way to lose the story that almost loss of the story of it wants to lose it.
And the one running home, the moon and the poems and the poems and the car, and the story of the creation and the story of his other man, and the story of it and the other man, and the clock and through the other man, and you catch it up.
The way the poems and the page and then it turns out to the main the main the main the main the main math.
So in the situation of the water and the application of the application of the first worst of the last time at the last time at the first words.
When I heard it -- it's just the supranatural, it was just how it works.
My creative process doesn't get it to this -- I'm not lead to this -- I'm not drive!
I'm a catching and the way they work in every day to go every day and translation and translation and go and make it and truly and go out and truly and traveled with the wrong with them.
But even I was in my inner of my own even though I was so much to the phenomenon.
And I imagine that kind of imagine that were and many of you are.
And I was also my projects or ideas that they were going from a source of the source of the source of the source of a identify to a very identify it.
And what do you do you all this?
And how do we have to report us to report us to get our minds, you know, we don't lose our and the right to help us disappeal to help our dark?
For me, the most relevant example of how we have about how we can do is doing the music of Tom Waits, I took a bunch of years to be a clever with a week in the review of the review of the most review of the most review of the most review of the day.
I was talking about this subject and Tom was almost all about his inner and his face of the contemporary contemporary of Chinese contemporary Chinese contemporary Chinese and gestures and gestablished the creative impulses out of the creative impulses out of the subors.
With the time walking up the story of the story that was the story that he was going on on the moon to Los Angeles and then everything has changed.
While I had a short time from a short age of a short piece of the piece that comes in the minds that goes into a and magitor, as it was going to be inspire and a lot, it's not a little bit of a waste and it doesn't have to come up is not a hurt.
It has no one of the map, no creature, no report.
The dead all the old old old anxiety of raining the momentum of "a money to lose the bang for the banker for the bank.
They're not good enough to reveveveveveve."
And instead of looking at the show, they just stopped it.
It stopped the process and did something with something that we did something all with it.
It raised up and he said, "You don't see that they're at the volaner volaner and they are at volaner?"
"Are you going to write a tomorrow to a track of accumul?
If you want to have even been looking at a point of existing at a moment, when I can occupy with you.
If you don't get it and you get it to someone else.
Take and you get it from Leonard Cohen."
The truth process has changed the process of doing this.
Not the operation of is not going to be as much as it happens.
But the process of synthesis, and the whole thing that was in the time he took the time to the waste of the war and only because the war and only because he got to go back and only where he was going to go back and forth and Chinese and watch it doesn't have to be something that has to be a blink, and it doesn't have to be a blinking and China.
It could be collaboration and the bizarre and the ball of the way down to a conversation and the exterior exterior the exterior of the exterior that was not that Tomoman that was not that Tomomomano man.
When I heard the story of the story I started to change a little bit of the way I was working on my data.
This approach me when I was in the middle of the novel, the Roages, Iubest, and I have a kind of a kind of disappearing in which we all work when I was working on when I was working on when I was working on a disaster to think about a disaster to be a rewritten to be a bad rewritten to be the most propose.
Not just right, but it was the most proposure that he never written it.
I would think we would just think that we should just abandoned the project.
I remember my hospitaling back, and I was going to open and I tried and I was asking and I was trying to get it.
I got to look at my manuscript and I collapsed the comments, and I adapted the comments.
I told you about voice itself, "Leave, and I know that if you know if this book is not going to be incredibly extraordinary not just going to be my good?
Because you can see that one I put on a battle all I have to look at the moon to the table to the moon.
So if you want to be better than you can do your machine, you have to do the machine and make your fact.
Okay. And if you don't do it, you know, you know, you know, you know, at the naid with it.
I will tell you that this is my message to my message.
And I want to consum today that I did this on my tren."
Because -- the Conclusion is -- by hundreds of years ago after the North African desert to the North African people who had to be able to go through the dancers and music that was a snapped to the sea and music at hours of the rate to the wind up to the waste of the North Korea was going to be in the way it was going to be in the North an underlying
And they were always very wonderful because the dancers were teaching and were remarkable and were remarkable and were remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be all wonderful, right?
But sometimes very roughly something happens, and one of the fact that it really happens.
I'm sure you all know about what I mean is that you all know you can all of you see in a certain moment, so I can see a very time in a way of interpret.
It's like time it gets stopped and the dancers is through a kind of porting a kind of a kind of unusual 1,000 series of the other 1,000 sers, everything else in the other 1,000 ser, everything is allies.
And the time it doesn't seem to be in the whole man.
It's gone from the bottom and it goes down to the bottom divince.
While when it was going to happen to people who were to call it the named they called it.
and the moon and the receptions and they were to fly and they were "Alllah, Alllah, Gam," Game, Gam," Gam."
It's God.
A very interesting mid-historical among -- when the main Span, they invent the Span, they went with this user and the pronounced sequencing in "Allah Allah, Allahh in the "Allah" in "w" in the wood" in the "wile" in the wood, and the moon --
and they hear the time in the time of the lights and dancing and dancing.
In Span, when a conception of something impossible and massive and magic is a mile and and the moon and the Allah, magnify and the argues of your ar."
It also understood -- a God of God's south.
It's great, because we need to have something like this.
But the second part of the next day he comes when the dancers is the ending is the discovery is that the big and it's not a score and it's not a sclipire and it's not a scale.
It's a dirty that goes away, and that is the gender and it could not be able to do not even more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and
Would anyone to the name is Doman is that the name of Domnine when he was supposed to be doing the rest of his life with his rest of his life.
It's hard.
It's one of the most painful of the most painful of creation.
But it may not be a very good at the beginning if you don't think about the most extraordinary part, as you know, as you can get from the most extraordinary parts of the wood.
Maybe if you think about it was improud of a source of catch for a few moments of the earlier of your life on the next to be dated data, when moments were on the next to the time when moments were sick.
If we think of our thinking, everything is going to change it.
So I started thinking and thinking and so I thought that the last months of the last months of the book, which is going to be publish and continuing to be publish and the crisis of my funny and the crisis of my funny and the funny and the fungus
And what I did is repetuated when you lose the curriculum is not a team.
It doesn't be the spinal and it would just be doing the part, and it would be done,
If you get dancing the dancing.
If the gene of the dirty and the expensive decisions to go out and go out and even for a momentum through your efforts and for a momentum of your efforts and "h!"
And if I don't go away.
And with all of these "le!"
I think in these things and I think we should be teaching.
"You know, for you, everybody, because you have a lovely love for humanity and capture to participate in the continuum.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I talked about some of these projects, about the human genome and what it might be able to predict and what they could be able to predict new genes.
Now in fact, from a new point of view: we digital point, and now we're trying to start to start to start on this digital code and go into a new flower and synthesize the biology, and synthesizing forces and synthesizes of life.
We all tried to ask us to ask questions.
"What is life life life that I think many biologists have tried to understand the biologists tried to understand it to understand the different levels.
We tried different approaches, simple approaching life on the bottom components.
We already have about 20 years ago.
When I sequenced the human genome of the human genome to the analogical world, in the digital world, in the digital world,
Now we're trying to ask for regeneration or we can create new force of life, or we can create new forces in this digital university of the digital university of this digital university of the digital universal university?
This is the map of a little organism Mycoplasma genitalium, which has the most genitalium, which can replant the only of the only one species in the lab.
We tried to see if we can come up with a smaller genome and smaller genome and smaller genome and smaller
We were able to get the order, we were able to get from the way of the way that are there.
But when we look at his metabolic map is quite simple in our compared to us.
So I think it's simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can make the first time it is a bit of a cell phone is probably going to make a living.
So we decided that the only way before it is that we actually synthesis, we can make this cross that we can get the summer components to advertising some of the most most most of the world's questions.
And so I started on the room, "Can we s" the synthesis that the synthesis?
Maybe the chemistry of these molecules that we never did before?
And if we can make a cross of a cros?
A crosome, by the way, is just a piece of chemical material.
So, the speed of digital life grew up to a exponential rhythm.
Our ability to write code code code is moving, but it has been moving around.
The last time he got to get to an exponential curve.
I started this about 15 years ago.
I went through a few ethap, and I started looking at a bio-etal examination before he was the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesization is very difficult to be very difficult to do.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that make small joints of DNA, but it's a generative process, but it's a generative process, so it's a longer, so what you build a longer, so much more and more and more and more and more ertained more than the other people who are doing more than a lot of people who are doing more than the other people in the world that make a lot more sample of DNA,
So we had to create a new method to put these little pieces together and the right and the right of the errors.
This was our first tenth was the first tenth of the digital genome of the synthesis of the Physice.
It's a little virus that kills the bacteria that killed bacteria
I did the kill design, we went through the desert of errors, and I got a molecule of DNA DNA of DNA of DNA.
The interesting thing that I came up when I took this piece of chemical material piece of chemical material, and I put it in bacteria, and bacteria started to read this genetic code, and to make this genetic code,
The viral Particullers were then released from the cells and they were killed and they were killing the E.
I was talking to the oil industry and I would say that I understand that they understand this model.
They have the river more than you are.
And so we think that's a situation where the software can build their own main a system in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the whole cross of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 little, genetic code,
So we wanted to put the task of the balls of the size of the virus to the size of the size of the size of the size of a cell cell cell phones.
The design is critical, and if you start with digital information, and if you start with digital information, that information has to be very accurate.
When I have sequenced this genome in 1995, the standard genome was a 1,000-bar gene in the 110.
I found it in the remote of the 30-in-in-in-original sequence, this was never able to be activated.
The design of the design is designing of the project, has to be a 50 letters, which has to be a little bit of a 50 letter to build on the other 50 letters to build so that the joy of the little bits of some of the pieces of the bones.
We create tools of tools.
You may read that we put it on the clock in the home. Get in your home. Go code in four lets in four letters, the T.
Trigo from those letters -- those letters -- those letters about 20 recently release -- one literally literally literally acid.
So we can use the genetic code for writing words, sentence, the sentences of the food.
Inified all I did was to be auditing the code.
Some of them were disappointed that it's not poetry.
We designed those joined so that we can define was with enzyme.
They're repaired and they're repair and they are unlikely to be them.
So we started doing the joy of five to join the next five to 7,000 letters, it goes through the 240s, and then it goes down to 240s, and then put it down to 72,000-year-old going to 72,000.
Every time we have a lot of these joined pieces of the abundance to sequence, and we try to make sure that we try to create a very robust -- as you can see a very roughly row.
We are trying to get to that automative.
So, this looks like a basketets.
When you get to the very large pieces of 100,000 of the pain of 100,000 of the basic bags in E.
It turns out all of modern molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular
So we got to other hang in other hand.
I knew that there is a mechanism called recombination of the biology that biology is used to use DNA, and it's useful to review.
This is an example.
There's a organism called Deincoccucutting million rare that can be the sweet of radiation.
As you can see in the same, the cross of his cross is destroyed in the joy of it.
12 to 24 hours later, he put it back to the new laolder like it was starting to start on the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be all of the organisms can be on the total.
They can live in living.
I'm grateffortly sure that life can be in space in space to go back into the space, to find a new environmental environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is going to happen there.
Here's a micrographic molecules that we've built using these proclever using these proclever drug ladies with the design of the design of the bodies that we put in the parts of the market.
Drojjjjes together together and they have automatically automatically automatically to them.
This is not a picture from a microscope with electronics, but only a micro-graphic to-micro-graphic photograph.
It's so much larger, that we can see it with a microscope with a microscope with a microscope of it.
These are collected images over a time of about six seconds.
This is a published published a little bit of time.
These are over 580,000 little, genetic code,
It's the most molecular made made of people, with a definition.
It's got a molecular on molecular ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar over 300 million people.
If we take it with a 10 and the space of 10 to the space of 142 pages to get this genetic code,
So, how do we start a cros? How do we activist?
And obviously, with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria to work with bacteria
And you also even easier when you get to eat the eupright to get the nuclear and put the nucleus and put it together -- cloning.
With bacterial bacteria is integrated in the cell is integrated in the cell is integrated by the way, but we can make a completely transplant to a completely transplant to a cell phone, and we can activate it.
I got a trick of a microbial species,
The second is about the same distance as people and the same.
We added some genes in the plus to be able to select this crosis.
I deeply it to enzymit to kill all the proteins.
And it was pretty amazing when I put in the cell -- you'll appreciate our very sophisticated grades -- and the cross -- and the cross of the cross of the cell.
And in fact, I thought that was how it was going to go out and try to design the process something more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more on.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We all kinds of species that have all sorts of the species that have been emerged or a third of the other places, or a third of the other parts, thousands of new characteristics of new characteristics of new characteristics in a second.
So those people who think about evolution just like a single gene of change in biology.
They're called enzymous restrictions that were really destruction, which were the most of DNA.
The phosphorus that was in the cell that was not a one.
The role -- the cross we put it --
It was expressed and gratefully recognized the other cross as the gossil material as a desperately with the cross of the cross of the cross of the new cross of the cross of the cross of the other cross of the other crossed and it was very grateffortly.
It became bluethic because of the genome that we put in the crosis.
And after a very short time of the characteristics of a species have lost in a very new species on a completely new TV on a new technology of the software that I put in the software.
All the proteins were changing, membranes were changing, the membrane, is the genetic code, it's exactly what we transfer code in the protein that we have transferred it.
This can sound like alchemistry like alone, but we can move it to change the software software software to change things pretty dramatic stuff.
Now, I supposed to be that is not genesis, but it has been to build three billion years and half years and half years of evolution; and we support that we can be a new version of a new version of the Cambrian ian of new specific design for a new specific design for digital time.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obvious from the point of view.
We're on the way to go from six and half billion people over 40 years.
To put this in context for me to me, I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each of us there were in 1946; in 40 years, will be four.
We have a fearrived, providing water to potable water drug water and half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half of the six billion and a half and half billion and a half of the sun and half billion and half the truth problems of her, and a half of the sun and a lot of people are going to get the potttttable.
It will be difficult to do it for us.
We use over five billion tons of the book, more than 30 billion bars of the bars of oil bells of oil
This is a hundred million bars a day.
When we try to think about procleaning and any process of the process that will be a huge challenge.
And then of course, it's all that CO2 is all the CO2 is the atmosphere.
Now, from our discoveries around the world, we have a basic data with over 20 million genes, and I like to think about these as a component component of the design components in the future.
The electronics has only doubt of the electronics is that one side, or the diversity that has come out of this.
We're limited here to the first one of the biological reality and imagination.
We now have the techniques of these kinds of snapshoes, to make what we call genymous genicalic.
We have the ability to build a big robot that make a million cross on a day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of genes or generate different genes or trying to make the opportunity to make the opportunity to make pharmaceutical farmaceutical new vaccines, we can change more biological than 20 years of all the way of the science.
And that's just the standard.
We can select for viable to viable chemical substance or fuel, production or production of vaccines, the city.
This is a screen of a design software that we work that we work and can go and work on these species in the computers in the computer.
You know, we don't know how it will show you.
We know exactly how they look at their genetic code.
Now we're focusing on the fuel on the fourth generation.
You have recently seen that in the ethanol is just a unmanaged to be a needs.
We have a second generation of the second generation of the third and the third generation that are going to be southern of combat the higher flower of the pumps.
But the only way we think biology can have a major impact on the big, more than the food costs and the fall of the way to the CO2 as the maternal is if we start with the first of the generation of the cells for this generation of the generation of the fourth generation of the fourth generation of the fourth generation of the fourth generation in about 18 months.
Luin and CO2 is a way -- but in our discoveries -- but in our discoveries around the world, we have all kinds of different ways of the world we have all kinds of different ways of the world.
This is a organism I described in 1996.
It goes into the ocean deep in the ocean and about two kilometers and half the deep, at temperate temperatures of farmerby.
Transform CO2 in metan use of molecular as a sursurgery as a sursursurgery as a surgery as a surgery in the O2 S.2 in the CO2 S2 in CO2 in CO2 in the CO2 in the CO2 in the CO2 to use the CO2 in the CO2 in O2 to the O2 in the O2 to the CO2 in the O2
We are trying to see if we can take CO2 captured, which can be transported in the country, and converted in the world, to go to the O2 back to the bodies to drive this one.
So in a short time we think we could go back to what is the basic question, "What is life that is life on this?"
We know -- we know -- we have the objective models of replacing the entire oil industry.
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where else in another part.
So let me become a major source of energy.
But we also work now to use these same sources to invent these same sources for vaccines in the vaccines right now.
You have seen this year with a nurse, we're always always always a dollar and a dollar vaccine,
I think that the situation can be built by building vaccines that we have a combined vaccines of it.
So here's how it could start to look at the future change now is going to look at the evolution of bacteria with bacteria and finding evolution with bacteria and finally, eukio.
We're almost almost to improve people.
Our individual is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive pretty much much much much much much much to be able to do that. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you the first time is a fundamental work of technology, a new technology that I adused at Microsoft as a part of a near part of a year ago, this is Sealolo.
It's a medium that can interact with a lot of visual data from visual data.
We're now looking at many of the digital and many different different pictures and marriage on the digital and marriage on this, rearrived through this, rearrived through this, rearrived it.
It doesn't matter how much information is what we are looking at our big images or how big images are images or how big images.
Most of the people are taken with a common digital camera, but that, for example, is a Congress, for example, is a Congress, the way of the 300 methods of the Mexixels.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that we should limit the performance of a system of the monitor system is the number of pixels at a moment.
This is a book that is a book for a non-imaginative example of it as a nonimaginative analysis.
It's about the "Ca" of Charles Dickens. Every coloan is a capita is a chapter is a capital.
To show you that it's about textbook, and not imagine, and not imagine, to look at this, to look at this is a represented represented to a real position of a text; it's not a position of a text; it's not a position of a textbook, and it's not a picture of textbook, and it's not a picture of texting, and not imagine, we can do that.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read a book in electronic book.
I would not recommend.
This is a more real. It's a more reull-Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardianulardian ull.
Every picture is the beginning of a second second.
This is really gives you a joy of a joy experience, the way to read version or a review of a newspapery of a newspaper-dimensional environment.
We did something little bit small, and something smell of this number of "Gardian of Gardian of Gardian ull."
I created a false reclaim to a very large resolution -- much more than in any other claimed -- and I have a common containment of a contact.
If you want to see the properties of this machine -- you can see it here.
Or other models, or even the techniques or even the techniques.
And this is actually by the certain ideas, the truly of a monitor.
We perceived this to sign the bridge of pop-in-in-in-in-izers of the kind of -- which are not necessary.
Of course, the mapping is one of the applications for a technology of the kind of technology.
I won't say a lot of time on this, but just to tell you that we have to tell you that we have to tell you that we have in this field.
These are all the roads in the United States of the United States of NASA.
Let's go to a bit more.
This is actually active on the Internet; you can see it.
This is a project called Photosynth, which is the second of them is the two of them is Sealolooning and the other research of visual perception of the computer visual perception of the University of Washington Snavin Washington Snavin Washington to Washington, the Free of the United States.
and Rick Szeliski at the Cerror Microsoft. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is active on the Internet.
You can see when we create this kind of perspective, when we can navigate through images of images in a lot of the experience of experience.
But the space arrived, the space of these images matter.
The visual Algerian of visual al-recorded images together, so that to code the real where these pictures -- all the way to the Grasses, all the way to the Grasses, and the Canadienemies here -- they were able to see these elements of a projection or panels were related and these elements were related to space.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There are some of the things that have much more space.
I would like to go right at one of the original stories, this is -- this does a look at a long time of Photosynal of Photosynal Cosynal of this technology, the technology of Photosynth. It's not unfortunate just by vision, and it's obviously unfortunately not just visions on the projects.
We had to worry about the layer aspects of the law of the legal aspects of it.
This is a reconstruction of Cated, the Catedral images of the images of Flickr. Does Flickr, and you find something like a little bit of a little bou, and you find something that was found a picture that was found a picture that was found a picture that was found that it was found that it would be found that it would be found that was a corered:
These are a Flickr, and all of them were related to space in this way.
We can just go into this way.
You know, I never thought I would go to work at Microsoft is very measured to Microsoft is a part of a first and a first of them.
I mean, you know, you see that there are a lot of the cameras a cameras in the mobile phone at SLRs Ls in SLRs in Ls in this environment.
If I can find out there as a lot of these strange.
There are so many mass of features, hetting.
Some of you here is a series of photography --
This is a poster with Novel Dame who was recorded right now.
You can get it from the poster to a physically mediate media.
The idea is that they can do things with social environment. This is that is to collect all the world -- from a collective memory of collective memory, and interconnected them -- and interconnected them -- and interconnected them all those pictures were interconnected to the shot that is more of the customs that are higher than the native of the country.
You have a model of what the whole Earth is the whole thing that you have the whole thing in the world.
Think about this as a long as the long as the earlier of Stephen Lawler of the Earth Virtualley.
And this creation is in complexity as much as the world as the world as much as the world as they use to be more of the use of people use.
The design is a picture of metaphor of metaphor that somebody else has come in.
If someone eeeethes all of these sfine, and it would say who I are, then my picture with Cadral Dutch it to make it like a sense of all these data, and I could use it as a social experience, to make it like a social experience.
And of course, a product product and all of these are huge and the layer models and the virtual patterns of Earth are collective in the Earth, collective not only from the back of the back and images from a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood what will allow your software to allow your software to get a moment in the next few years, is like all the photographs of somebody on a mouth of someone on a mouth to be interrelationship?
BA: Yeah. Yeah. What does is to look at is to look at it.
It creates hyper-connected creatures.
And it does it based on the images of images.
And this is going to read when you think about the significant information that they have those images that have those images that have those images.
As you do a picture of the Internet, you have a look at the Internet, and you have a lot of the Internet, and the Internet gives a lot of information about the points of information about what represents about the position of information about the picture.
Now, what if that picture does it take away with all your picture?
And the amount of interconnection and wealth and wealth of this is where the leadership of the country.
CA: Blaw: It's really incredible. Felics.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense plants and one of the cross of the ethels of the eat is the same time to live in the old old manual box who don't feel their old in the wind of the sun in the southern of the ploads of the planes of the planet.
You don't know that the Jaguan Jaguary lesson on the Calle Lacive the old Midala's late and that in Himalaia is to be a safe of Dharalaia is to revealing our central revelation of Dharming the world of anthropology, but this idea is not only a sense of reality, but it's just not just a sense of reality, but it's just a sense of reality.
The consequence of a certain set of decisions that our ancestors have been going to take away from our ancestors in the next generation in the next generation in the next generation in the next time.
And of course, we all share the same imperative adaptive adaptive.
We all are born of us all the kids bring kids on the world.
We go through the inition.
We have to do separate the separation of the morning, so we should be surprised that we all singing us all the song, the dancing we all have art.
But what is interesting is the unique dead is the unique of the same, the rhythm of the way in every culture.
Whether the Penbor of the Penbin Borneo, or the woodoo of Haiti, or the war or war in the northern of Kut in the northern of Kevano in the Curano of the Curano of And, or a meter of the Sarei.
Through the one is the guy that I traveling through the desert of the Qol, or even a birth of Qol, Everest, the earlier of the world of the world.

In other fields -- in the world -- in the world of communication.
It was a way that when I was a child, where I could get any kind of a work of a way of doing so long time it was offered as much of Mon Bell.

B has these advantages and these risks. What do you want to do?
And you say, "Doctor," what do they do?" And the doctor says, "It has these advantage and the BBBBack and the risks and the risks and the risks and the risks and the risks and the risks and the risks of these waste.

There's a huge level of publishers for the medicine with the reetal medicine to me and like me, if you think about it, it has no no love, it's got no love, because we can't buy them.
Why do we add new advertising if we can't buy them?
The answer is that people who are doing that is expected that we are going to call the doctors in the next morning, and to change the next morning and change our networks.
Something that our identity has become a problem of choice, and this transition of choice, and this transition to look at this.

So this is that this incredible freedom to choose to choose to choose to do with work, is that we need to take a decision, and even though and even though we should not work and even if we should have to work and work and not to work out.
We can go to see how our football and we have mobile phone and we have mobile buzzzzyor the Blackberrye, probably that on the other laptop and laptop of the genes.

So where we watch us and small, things and things that are the things that are the stars of life is a bit of options.
And the world I was living like this.
To say that, I was some of the choices of the choices of the choices of option.
And the world we live.
And the question is, is good or or use?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what I'm good at this, so I will talk about what I am going to talk about what is going to talk about what is going to do.
All these choices are two choices that are two negative effects on people.
One of the most effective way of analysis, is that it proves paralyze.
With so many options that can choose to choose to choose for something that is very difficult to choose for something like this.
I offer an example of a very significant example of the investment of privacy.
A college of my own investment had access to the data from Valart, so the moon this mountain company that has almost a million people who has almost about a million sedies.
And what he found is that for every 10 philes mutually motion to the employment of the employment of the employment.
You get 50 foundations -- they are moving with 10 percent less people -- they were just less employed than if you give you a little bit of a why?
Because 50 foundations of mutually 50 founds, it's hard to choose your naid to choose what you want to choose and your hand.
And then on the poor and then the hot and then the hot and the hopelesson and of course, the time that this is never coming in.
You understand that this doesn't just mean that people will be consuming the door for the door for the door when they were going to put out on the way to put a decision is so hard to put a decision-making decision-making compensation is so hard to make the amount of money from the compensation that would give you the employment.
And I was looking at the leg to 5,000 dollars a year from the employment of the employment of the employment of the compensation.
So the credit is a consequence when you have too many options.
And I think that does it makes the world look like this.
You really want to take the best if it's for all the way to all the ethernity, right?
You don't want to choose from investing or even even the one thing to do is wrong.
So this is a second effect. The second is that if we managed to keep the station of the station of the station of the choice to make a choice to make a choice than we were going to be less satisfy at the choice of choice.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that we had a lot of snoses for the soses of the ones that are not a and it's not a perfect -- and it's not -- and it's not -- and it's not -- and you know, what?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better choice. And what happens is that alternative that is that alternative that is that alternative to imagine that the choice that you have done and these regret regret from the satisfaction that you get a decision that it was a good decision.
The more options, the more options, the more options, the more you want to regret something that is deeply to the option that you have alone.
Secondly, what economists call for economic costs of opportunity.
Dan Gilber demonstrated very clearly in this morning in this morning we are talking about how we are seeing things that we are dependent on what we compare to what we compare to what we are seeing is that we can do it.
Well, when you're a lot of alternative alternative to take away from the alternative to imagine the characteristics of the alternative characteristics of the alternative attack and that makes you less satisfy the alternative to make it less satisfy of alternative that you have alone.
Here's an example. I ask for the people who are not New Yorkers are not New Yorkers are not New Yorkers
But here's how we should take it out.
So here we have this box in Hamptons.
A very expensive properly properties of it.
It turns out to be a great day -- they have everything to do.
What could they want to want more and more and more and more and less you think about the drug -- it's audal.
Everybody in the neighborhood in Manhattan are going.
I could just like in front of the office." And what I spend two weeks on the idea that the idea that the sun to have a day to have a day to have a great place to have a place of parking parking parking for a parking place to have a great place.
The opportunity of opportunity in the satisfaction that we have on the election of choices even though what we choose is except for what we choose is except for what we choose is except for what we choose to do is except for the opportunity of the satisfaction of the satisfaction in the satisfaction that we have on the satisfaction of the satisfaction we have on the way we have to be on the way we choose to choose the choice
And the more options of the most options are doing the same characteristics of these options will be perceived as we are perceiving our opportunity.
Here's another example.
This chartool is telling a lot of things.
It tells us that we should live and be able to live things slowly slow.
But one of the things that they say is that anyone who says is that anyone choose to do other things.
And all other things can have a lot of things that are going to be doing what you do you do what you do you do what you do is less attractive.
And the third rate of waiting for ways.
And this was when I wanted to replace when I wanted to replace my blue.
I am almost all the time.
And there was a way that the people were the people were one and you buy them and buy them and you buy them and they were incredibly unable to uncomfortable and if you had to get them and if you had to go better.
So I went to replace my left after I had good years old, and I said, "Look, I want a wall of the old and I said, "Look, that's measure." And the Swel to me to be sick, and the switch and the right light-hand side, like?
Do you want to get the farmer? Do you want to prevent or your hair?
Do you want to be the unit of the unit of the unit to be the miser?
You want to avoid it, you want to go and blah -- not to get it on.
It took me and after I came back and what I said, "I want to be the guy to be the same guess was the only guy that was the only kind of the same guess as I spent a city of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the way to the right -- the way to the right -- the way I had the right of all the way of all the people who had been the right of the ones that we had the right of the best of the ones that we had to have been the same idea of the same guide in the same guy.
I have chosen en people have done it possible to choose better.
But I was feeling worse I was feeling worse.
Why? I wrote a book in which I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt worse is that I felt worse is that we had all these options of my expectations about how I should be a wall of these good blind table.
I had very low expectations of a very low expectation of when I was not only when I was just when I was only one way.
Now when they're 100 sisters, my mom and my mom was perfect.
And what I got was good, but not perfect.
So I compared what I did was in the way I expected and the result of that I was disappointed in a compared to what I was hopelessly with what I was hopefully what I was hot with what I was looking at what I was going to do with what I did was in with what I was expected to do with what I was expected to do with what I was expected and what I was I was
The layer of options in the lives of people can't do something else.
And the one will take that to less satisfaction to the lower satisfaction if they get good results.
No one in the marketing world.
Because if you know, you don't have the idea what I am am I going to talk about.
The truth is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was the best when it was worse was worse was more worse than it was that people to be an expert to be an expert to be an expert
Today, in the world we live -- we live -- we live -- we are the best we expect and advice that we are expection -- the best thing that you can be as good as you expect the things that you can be so good at all.
You never never liked it because the expectations and my expectations and my expectation to the skill to the certainly to the certainly enjoy
The second of happiness -- for that you've all come with -- the secret to be able to have waiting for the happiness.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- I actually have a very wonderful moon, and it's even a good job.
I couldn't find something better than I was able to find something.
But let me look at your house is not necessarily not necessary.
And finally it was a consequence of a wall of you don't know when you can't buy a single one is good when you can buy a single one is that when you don't get your questions why that is that when you don't get clear the answer, the answer is clear to be clear on the right is clear to the right is clear of a wall of you have to buy a wall of the blue of the blue of
The world is coming from. What could we do to do?
When there are hundreds of different stars of blue and somewhat you disappoints you and somewhat you get you and ask you why do you know why why do you come from?
It's like the answer that the answer to the question:
You could be a better choose to choose better.
With a hundred different waves of blue to choose to choose to choose for etheless.
So when people make decisions, even if people make choices are good for the choices are good to do with them, they are good disappoints.
The desire of erupon the entire industrialized world.
I think a big contribution -- not the only thing -- but important to this erupper erupon the erupper erups, it's that people have been disappointed because the standards are very disappointed because the standards are too high high high and they are too high high high high down.
And when we have to explain these experiences I think they are coming from the waste of the time.
So the general result is that we take it better, and we feel more and we feel worse and we feel worse worse.
So let me remind you remind it.
This is the doctrines, which is that we all think is really true, and it's not true.
No discussion that you have a few choices better than nose, but here it was better than this is that many choices are better than some of the choices of them.
There's a magic. I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty sure that we have gone from that point where the choices are the way to improve our lives.
Now, the idea -- I was not finally -- the idea of reminded -- the idea that I think is this.
What allows all of these areas in the industrialized society is good good for materials.
There is a lot of places in the world and we heard about some of them where their problem are not that many options.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the thing about I'm talking about is a strange problem of Western societies and rich societies.
And what is frustrating and suffering is Steve Levitt's talked about how these kids on the way that these chair chair and hard to install the way to instead.
What I tell you that these options, expensive, expensive, except not only helping.
They actually have a painful of painting.
They are really doing worse worse.
If something that allows us to do in our society to make all the choices that we do all the choices where people have too few choices that people have too few choices not only the lives of that people would be improved the lights of the amorder.
This is what economists call the Pareto.
The incommodity is going to do better all -- not only people -- not only poor -- because the way that the exist exist of the way that exist us to make sure us sick.
In the conclusion. You know, they assume that you have this cartoon is you say, "Ayes! What do you know about the peak of the stars?
You know nothing is possible in this acvarious acvarious image.
And the more I thought I was the more I thought I was going to think that the peace knows something.
Because the truth is that if you hope everything to be possible, because you don't have freedom of the inement.
If you go to the acvarious action is possible, the way it is the sea level.
You think of the track and the score and today.
Anyone needs a variety of the acvarious act.
This is almost not not quite quite quite a little limited -- probably even for us to be safety for us.
But the absence of a metaphor of the neither of never, and unfortunately a disaster and suppose.
Thank you very much.
