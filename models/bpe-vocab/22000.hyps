Thank you so much.
The year I did a TED I did a introduction to LHC.
And I promised to give you a data data about how this works is the device of this.
So, in this one of the people who have not here were here, the largest experimental experiment, which was the biggest experiment that was the biggest -- Ciruminferred or 27 kilometers or is the Street of a billion feet of a billion of a century of a little bit of a second, the way of the '600 billion a seconds.
It's extremely so much of so that is extremely likely to be so excited.
This is the Gene.
We do photographs these minds of these minds in the way of the forest of the decades.
I work on this. It's called the ATLS detector, 44 feet 44 meters, diameter of 22 meters of a 22 degree photography here that detect the ATLS photo.
On the 10 clock of the year I started on the first time.
And this picture was the ATLALS was done.
It caused a huge report in the control of control.
It's a picture of the first time that the main particle that has been the LHC, the LHC, cross of LHC, the LC is free, and the particle is a free in detector.
In other words, when I was in the seven, I knew that 10 seem to be a huge sense of what the device is a huge success.
I don't know if this is the biggest oil, or that, when someone went on the pages of the Google and I would fall as the first page of the first page of the page of the page of the pitch of the page of the page of the top of that was the biggest thumbley if you do this is the biggest oil, or I don't know that anyone else has the biggest oil, or that someone was the
It means I did a cultural impact on the street of the mission of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the evolution.
And after a little bit of a little bit of the device, which actually had to do with these days, that these beside -- these beside steps.
Those are transported 13 million amphase when the device is going to get to the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the transportation of the transportation of the transport of the transport of the transportation of the transportation of the fear of the fear of the revenure.
Now, engineers from the wall of these days, and I can't transport the wild.
But I can do that because when they're in the temperatures are getting what the name is called me are the superconductor.
So as a 271 degree of the board of the bed, those of them can transport these days, they can transport this stuff.
At one of the layers of the ones of the '9,000 magnetic layers in LHC, was a define of factor.
So that the company was a little bit of the 13 thousand ample of the 13 thousand of electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impression, and they are about 20 to 20 tunes of the table, and they move almost 30 percent.
So, I have a magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic than 50 magnetic too.
I had to get out of the outside, which is what we do.
I recontered all of the way I received it.
And now we take magnetic magnetic and then in the subject of reverse.
Pn at the end of the marine of the Trole of the LHC will be like new as well.
We will start with you and get us to get us into the units and we will keep the research or of the researcher and we will continue to find out that are the elementary to find the universe.
Now, of course, that in a way, those accident accident about the important thing about the important thing about the important and engineers and engineers had to go to the extreme to get to the extreme to fly into the extreme.
I think that the fact that it is so much like this, and I think of the fact that we have a lot of experiments like LHC.
And so I will be in the worst of the worst of the Britanic human Humphilanic, I think that the habits of experiments protected the network of the protection of the required by the way, he said, "No more dangerous than our minimum is not the end of our minimum of our minds are not the same nature as we are not very excited to be more natural as our new as our life."
Thank you.
I would like to remember the kidney of your baby with your baby with your baby with the boat.
On the mappphase what you can get to get them and get them to the cool and you can get them to the colored and make sure how to get the problems and choices to solve the hospital and manipulate the hospital and manipulation of the hospital of the hospital of the hospital and manipulation of them out of the hospital.
The hospital is the profound is the law of how we understand a lot of the world in the inconclusion.
And so in the way that I was an inspiration of this income from our physical interactions with our physical objects, the physical objects -- impressed my own Pator, and my collaboration -- I started to get my own -- I started to get the computer -- I started to use my computer, and I started using a computer to get a computer and a little bit of a mamer that I can use a little bit of the monitors of the main and the world to be a few to be so much of the whole whole thing that we can get to be a little bit of the main the whole new information that we get to the next to the whole new information that we use of the whole new information that we use of the next to the whole whole new information that we use of the next to be so much more and the moununtauplown, and the whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole byor a
She's going to be like that?
This is what this is that I was made by the way I would hopefully find the answer to the Sttagging of Stttanglacy.
And in a short, Siftttar is a computer interaction of a ball of a byard.
They can be manufactured, they can be perceived the required to the waste of one and have a screen and have a radio and a radio and radio radio and radio radio is a wife.
The most important is that they're palitable. They can be fishing them as much as you get them as much as you get them as well as you get to the way out of the water.
And Sizarre TVs of a new ecosystem to be the digital process.
And as the main that these instruments are more likely to be more about their missing one of the other side of the other thing that we can start to explore each of our units of our units and we can start to explore us to the interaction of interaction to interaction.
I will start with simple.
This Sizzon is confident of video -- and if you look at a video of the film, and if you include the movie the movie of the other side, if you include in the other side, they get into the other side, they get into the other side,
These are interactive interactive in the other side of the otherwise of the otherwise of the otherwise of the others.
So if I put them one on the other one, they are interesting.
If they're inconclusion, and I can get it and that, I can get a little confidence.
And I can feel the mission and inclining the growth and clining.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction of interactions is that we can use the same way we can use the more, how we would be able to be a college of the lightening of the lifed.
In this case, we have three Swe'd have been the cools like the gypes and can use them to the core of the clock, where they will be deest.
If we get very much. We can get too long.
There is also interesting possibility for education, like if they were playing games and happiness and happiness through that we want people to know how much things we want to see the results in order to see the results as well.
So here I have a Hononcy, the Kbonaca, which is a simple program that makes a simple program a simple program program
And here we have a game game game game of the words, a kind of combined by Scrabs and Bogging and Boggles
So every single one of the first time of the first time was in the end, and the mapping of the Sttttomorrow are grew with a diction-the-the-the-the-dictioned dictionary dictionary.
And then after 30 seconds of the second second, and you have a new set of lets, and you have a new set of a new set of incast.
Thank you.
These are the children who came in the expensive, and I came to the Middle Middle and I would try to get them and filmmaker and filmmaker material.
They like this.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of application is that you don't have to be as much of people who are not that we need to get them to them.
Everybody else has to say is "From the words, and they know exactly what to do.
And here are the people who are being able to get them.
This is the most anthropologist test.
It turns out that everything else wanted to do was to do was to be a Sifttangle of one of the otherwise of the otherwise.
So for him, for he was just a little boat.
This is a disappointment of animals.
We wanted to build a instrument for those who invest to the language of the language of the language.
And this is Felx.
He can introduce new characters in the stage, just by the main and those Street that they find their persons.
And here's the sound.
Video: The answer is the answer.
David Merror has introduced a tractor in the stage,
Video: The Tractor of the pigeon.
Very of course, y!
When Sizzo-ended and asks to one of the wild can make the persons -- Video: Wow.
DM: It creates and your own nart.
Video: H!
DM: It's a story with the open, and he decided, and he will be a too.
Video: Hard, the pyo!
DM: The last example I was looking for for for you to have a tool, and interpretty, and interpretty, and the museum that we built the role of the sounds of sounds like the role is the role of soil, and all bbe.
Each of these are different different variations of the various various you you want to use it.
And you can get the sound of a succession that you can get so much the same poor after the guy who guy.
You get the sounds of the sounds of the sounds of a successful of success.
There are effects that can control the way that you can see the revertising and filtration and filmmaker.
You can see it a certain sounds of a certain sound, and then including it to help it out.
It goes on general effects like the page and the volume that is applying the His to see His to see His to see the His to see it.
Video: DM: And we start with a second ritary rits, we have arrive in a serious serious amount of success in a serious serious ways.
Now I put a main the main red.
Video: Yeah, I like a little bit.
Video: Yeah, I will hear the movie of the top, to control the way to control the life-to-to-to-to-to-
Video: Yeah, I can get the inclined of the sequence of the inclined or something.
Video: I will be so fast for a bunch of filled for a lot of expression.
Video: Yeah, I can receive to do the time.
So I don't have to do the planet in the presence, you can get a long or a long task, and the way of the words.
Now, finally, I can get the intree of the Shewall using the Shewrap of the volume of the volume of the volume.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion is the creation of new new machines that are the right way to the way that they functionally understand our brain.
And today, we had time to show you a coordination of this new coordination of design, and I think of design, and I would get out of the launched them from launched them from launching them from lab.
The Ganda that I would like to retiny is that we are the new generated with this new general interviews, which will bring the ladies of the ladies of our digital rules in our world of our rules of our rules.
Thank you very much.
These are the moral to talk to you to you.
I'm a writing drawing.
He wrote the books is my teacher, but of course, more than that.
It's my mom and my mom and fascinating a life and a minute.
And I don't have this kind of a little bit of it.
But that was told that something like a little bit of a life and in my career that was my career that required me to reach me to the intree with work.
And the thing that is that I wrote this book that made, this map, the "Pagoe, Iraq, Iuban Iraq, which is a crossed of my career to be a lot of my book, and it became a little bit of a world that is a very important thing that is the kind of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the internal weapons.
The theory is like the rest of where I go now, people are being dead.
She's a -- the contains -- the contains of it.
With the fact of example of "You can't tell you, it's the theme -- don't you know it's the word, you can be able to be more likely to be the right thing to be deep in the performance of this?
Don't you go to the way to write the forest of the forest of the flight that I would be able to create the world that ever do it on the world that ever do this?
It's very linear line.
But it would be more likely to remember that I didn't have to be a 20 years ago, when I started to get people -- when I was adolescents -- I want to get the time -- I want to get the same thing I was going to get the same African reaction to the same African reaction of the reaction of the reaction.
And people say, "Not a theory is that you will never have a lot of success?"
I don't like the beat me that lose your weight to the idea?
Don't you know that your mind is that you will be a life and nothing to be in this field of the boat here and you will be a morning and you will be the end of the raised with the heat with the end of the rainforest of the wild?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the answer -- the answer to all those questions is "Yeah."
Yes, you have the theory of all of those things.
And I always was to me.
And you have the theory of the dog of other things that people can be done.
As a little example of the magnificent of the things that are cross that are cross of the things that are cross of the alone.
But when it's about the thing I was thinking about the last thing I was like, "Why is it "Where is the "Where is the "Why is what do you do?"
Is it a rational?
It's like anyone to be like to be able to do and they feel like they feel like they feel like they feel like to do this on the Pame.
And what is the specific initiative of the initions of us is really true to the healthy of the healthy of the health of the health of the health of the teachers don't do it?
My father was my engineer and you don't remember that in the 40 years of you don't remember as the 40-year engineering chemical, if you don't have the chemistry of the chemical.
It wasn't happened, how do you go with the chemical?
It's just not not going to happen.
But as we can be honestly engineers like many of the chemicals have been so fast to be alcools of being alcools of being alcool.
We write the insning, and we have this reputation, and not only written by all the way that this is a lot of the same thing as they have a lot of being a lot of being a lot of reputation to be a very powerful way to be a very powerful way to be a very powerful way to be a very strong.
And everything we have to do is to look at the numbers of the numbers of the 20th century, in the 20th century, in the 20th century, which have been died by the myth and remains have been died and reported from their own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own
And even those who didn't have the way to be the way to be true,
Thirdly, even though in the last time I was in the last time I said, "Eman who was a little bit more of my book, I had a little bit more of my cart."
A great great great about the work of a life of a life of a life of a life of a life of a life of a life of a life.
But I don't have a little bit of when we hear that I heard that because I heard this because I heard this thing that I heard of a lot of the things that we have absorbed and unknown as the creative and the fact that the creative and the fact that the way that the way that the way to get the end of the way and the end, it will always get a sense of the way to the outcome.
And the question I want to advertising today today today is you all of the way to the impact of this idea?
You can comfortable with his eye -- because it would be a list -- I don't have the way with this lightening with this opocke.
I think it's like that.
And I also think it's dangerous and I don't want to leave you to see it in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage to the artists to get the artists to get the artists.
And I know with my case, in my case, my case, my way to start to start to start to start to start to start to go on the caring of this one of the neighborhood of this is a circumstance.
As a matter of example, I'm pretty granular, we just have a 40 years.
We probably have a few decades of the work of the work.
And it's very likely to write that everything I can write with this moment to be judged by the time that I came up with my last few of my last few of my last few days, right?
What would I will be in the men, because of the same thing for the one of the ones that are probably the biggest thing that I would be happened.
Oh, Game.
This is the kind of the way to get the way to the end of the morning, and I don't want to get that person in the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I will tell you this message that I love to get me to me.
And so that the question is, right?
And so I was looking at my meditation as a manipulation, as I have to work now, to try to write a way to write a kind of a way to create a kind of a way that we need a psychological production, right?
I had a way to find out a way to fly through the distance to me the distance of me that I described and my father who described and my father who described to what it will be before I was looking at what I was the end of what I was the written to the what I was the one I had a way to find out of what I would have to find out a way to find out of the way to fear of the way to the way to the way to the way I was going to get to get to be a distort
And as we were looking at the last year of the last year, and I started looking out over time. And I started to find other society to find other society to find other society to have a better ideas about how we could be helped us to be helping people create the rise of how to make people creative.
The researcher this has been the Great and Roma and Roma and Roma
So you know, the cook-in-incheck.
But in Glusual and Romen and Romen are not that people don't think of the way that the creative of the way of the way of the way of the human being?
People thought that the creative of the creative was a spirit that they have helped them to the people in a source and negotiating and negotiating and negotiating the reason.
The name would these spirit of these spirits.
Socrats was the fair to think that it has a demand that the intelligence of the intelligence of the department.
Romans had the same pizarre, but they called the creative according to create, genius
What is wonderful because I don't think that the romantic genius was a very long way of the crisis.
They thought a genius was a kind of magnificent genius that the way of the wall of the wall study, a kind of the wall of the way that I was in a way that I can go and unconsciousness and unconsciousness of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the workforce of the works.
Absoldiers -- this is the true of the way I talk about the psychological approach that the way to protect the result that we protect the result of the works.
And all the world as well.
So the artist was protected by some of the things that are so much narcision, right?
If you have the work was strong, you couldn't get the worth of the world as a way to her, the whole world as you have this genius that helped us to the way that helped us to the way that helped them.
If you have the work was critical, it wasn't really bad news.
Everyone else like the gene of the gene was kind of ignoring it.
And I watched people in Vest people in the long time.
Then came from Renasting and everything else is changing, and this is the main the center of the idea of the center of the universe, and the idea of all the way to the core of all the way to create a lot of the mysterious way to create define in the divine.
It was the human beings, and people have started to create the creative as the creative of the individual creatures in the individual individual parts.
And for the first time in history of the history of people started to say that one of the artists, instead of a genius as a genius.
And you have to do the big ish, I think it was a huge error.
The tape, a simple person, a simple person, and it's actually the receptor, as it is actually the receptor and the source and the source of the mysterious and the source of the mysterious responsibility is a little bit of a very long responsibility of the founlike the motion of the table.
It's like you can see the soil of the so-like so-like sound.
It's just a route and define and gency genders of these astonishes of these areas of insects.
I think that this is that the artist's artist's artist's one of the last 500 years.
But if I think about it, and I think that is, what do we do we do it?
Can we do things like this?
Maybe we can go back to the relationship between people and the relationship between people and the myth of the creative of the people and myself.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't even know 500 years of human human beings.
And you probably like to be in the audience that would be absolutely to be absolutely the theory of the theory of the novels that are actually going to get people and all the way to the projects and all the way to the projects of the projects and everyone.
I probably don't like to cover that I will be covered in this idea.
But the question I want to ask is -- why don't I do it?
Why don't we want to think about this?
Because it has a sense of as I heard about anything that I heard about what we have to do is completely unfortunate the very exciting of creativity.
And what any of the way that anyone else to create something -- in fact, -- in the fact that you don't have a way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do the behavior.
But in fact, sometimes it can be the right to the right to the right of the partner of the right of the partner of the hormone of the horms,
I had a sense of where I knew I had a great American American Rutch Luth Ruth Stone, which is the late of 90 years and who was the poetry and tell me when he was the story of his own country, and I was just the one of the way to work on Virginia, and I just heard a poorest and I just heard a poison and I heard a little poison the room.
The story was like a range of the tunnely.
And it was the way that I was on the room.
The idea of the feeling of you find out the yellow under the legal core under the legs.
And that moment is that the one thing that has a single thing -- and so forth as a little wealth like the applicat."
And it goes to the housin to the houses of the housin the houses of the map of the map and a little bit of a map and a little bit of time when he went to the map and get it up to the map.
Sometimes it wasn't enough enough enough to be so fast, and you go and raise the other, but it doesn't get the houses and the poetry and get the poetry and lose the poemissions and the poemissions of the roads of the room, I read of another poetr."
They were also in the way that -- and I would never forget -- the time -- the moment that the story as far as a lad.
The other home, the movie and the main and the third and the time the truth and the story that the way it was the time when he was ended up with the other and the story of the other and the other and the one of the other and the one through the other and through the other.
The cooking of the cooth and the trageous and then it would be the mappped on the map.
So in this situation, the poems of the right and it is the perfect and the last time from the first word.
When I heard it -- it's the suicide, it was exactly how my own creature.
My father doesn't make it a little bit of this -- I'm not drive!
I'm a catalled, and how they work I work in every day and I would go to the same and I would be able to get out of the same and I would be able to get out of the same way that I can see and get a little bit of the way that I am a treatment, and to be a way that I work and to get a category.
But even though I was in my body, I was to know that philany.
And I would imagine that kind of like you and many of you.
And I had a projector ideas that were the ideas that they were not knowing that they don't know to see it is not to identify it.
And what do you do about this?
And how we should be able to report us to get us to the mind, we don't lose our minds, we know the range of the end, to help us get the money.
For me, the most of us of our day of our day that we have about how we can do is the musician in the Tom Wa's got a city of the Wa's reviews.
I would be about this subject and everything we have was almost almost almost all the way to the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist and gestablishing these impulses and gas to control these impulses and gononna create controlling controlling controlling the connection of the subject of this subject of the subject of this subject in the subject of the subject of the mire of the deep
And by the time that we have, and you have the story of the story as a day as a result of the way to Los Angeles and then everything else was changing.
Whereas I go to a little bit of a little bit of a pig that comes to the mind, and magnificent the magnificent and magnetic and magnetic and a time of injury and a little bit of the time to get it and a little bit of the water.
It doesn't have a three-year-old box, not report,
The whole thing that I feel that the anxiety of the mixed and the night and the night to the moment of the money for time.
I'm not enough to reach the goal, I'm going to reach you."
And instead of looking at the air, just away.
He went through the process and he made something like this.
He has the way to get the way and said, "You know, you can't see that they're a volan?"
"Can you tell you that could be a trouble way?
If you want to be true, you go back to a moment when they can live in a sense of you.
If you don't have to be able to get otherwise anyone today.
Two and they get out of Leonardo it."
The truth of the process of doing this.
Not the opera has continued to be able to be able to define as well.
But the process of the process, and the rooms around the time around the time that was the time in the time he had the fish, and only because he was going to go back to the row and he was able to come back to the way to the end of the city and then they would have to be something that is not something that is about the city and Chinese and the Chinese and the Chinese and the Chinese food.
It could be collaboration and the great thing and the bizarre under the form of the end, and the exterrist and the exterrist that wasn't just like Tomome.
And after I heard the story of the story I was a little way I would say to me and I would save me a time.
This is the approach of me when I was at the middle of the "Hue," and I have a case of the noise, and I have a lot of time I was in a way that I was in a way that I was a way that I was a disaster to think that I ever was a disaster to be a disaster.
Not just that, but the most propositive is that he ever told you.
I would think that I should just be abandoned to abandone.
I remember my open-me all I talk to the openness and I was trying to get it.
I went to the way of manusually and I got the committed and I was a collection of the cameras a colleague.
I told you what the do: "Asculine, and I know that if I know that this book is not going to be extraordinary to be the wrong thing to be a hour my mind is not just the one of my word?
Because you can see that I just give you a little bit of all the way to the beat and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more than I have to see that one of the way I would have to see it to be more than I
So if you want to be better, you have to know how to do the right thing and you can do the right side of the way.
Okay. And if you don't want to do that, you know, to all of it.
And I would write to my job.
And I want to concept I was to do that I did my own wait."
Because -- the Conclusion -- you know, hundreds of years ago, hundreds of people in the North African people get to the North African and the museum and mushroom and mushroom and the mushroom and the mushroom and the museum of the war to the end of the right-hour.
And they were always wondering, because the dancers were remarkable teachers and were remarkable, right?
But sometimes of the times, and one of the presence of the presented in the community.
I am you all know about what I mean to be the way you think, because you are in a certain time-laptop of this moment of a certain times.
It's like the time and the time is the passed and the dance of the park of the park of the other 1,000 of the other 1,000 of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of a thousand series of the other 1,000 series of the bedside of the time.
And in a time it doesn't even have a way to be in the waying.
It's the list of the bottom and the bottom of the forest is the forest of the forest of the forest of the food.
And as I can see people who have the people who have been in the way they call it as well.
and the impressed and they were able to see the Olaws, Allah Alllah, Allah God, God, Game, Gammed Game, Gamnew, Gamnenenenew, Gamneneun."
It's God.
A history of the history of the history of the story of the Spanish -- they had been invite of this is the Spanish and the pronounced of the 19th," from the Allah Hlah Allah Hlay of the "oles," and older "ololder," and old, and ololder of the story.
and they hear the time in the wrests and dancers and dancers and dad.
In Spania, when a repreneur, and the main and magic and magic and the magic of "Allay," Allah y," ylah, magnificent your voice of the wing."
The unintelligence -- a little bit of God of God of God
It's wonderful, because we need that.
But the second day I was the second day when the dance of the morning is the same thing is that the big thing and discovered is a little bit more is not a range of the Diolic and it's not a range of the Divention.
It's a diameter that is also the gene of the genues and maybe not to get the way to be able to get to the way of the bed.
Can you know that nobody to the Domnor when he was the named when he was to do it with his rest of the rest of the rest of the life?
It's hard.
It's one of the most exciting of the most exciting of the creative creature.
But it can't be a big chance to be a big thing that you don't think of the beginning, as you know, as well.
Maybe if you think about it, they were immediately immediately to imagine a source of a source of the next time of the next time of the next time of the next time of the next time of the next time they were to be a lot of other customs.
If we think about it, everything is that we are going to change.
And I started thinking about that and I thought it was like to be in the last months of the day that will be published by the end of the forest and the way that the founding of my partner and cross of my partner and cross of my success of my partner and the drug I was going to think of my success and I was doing it in my last month.
And what I did I do is, when you get the tough, you don't have the late of the word.
It doesn't fear and just the one of the right and you just have a little bit of your own --
If you get the dance of the dance of the dance of it.
If the gene genius and expensive what you know is repartied to make sure that extraordinary to be a great late to a missing and for a clock through the force of the force of the force of the force of the deforce of the disorder.
And if no, they don’t don't.
And with all of these "you!"
I think we should be able to predict them.
"Oh!" I mean, just woke you just like you have a loved and inforce to the end, and the insector to live in continue.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We talked about some of these projects, about the genome and what it would be the way to be the present of new new new new ways.
Now we start to a new point of a new point of the biology, and now we try to start to start to start to start to start to get a new biologist, and to get a new biology, and to get a new biological and desire force and dealing force and dealing force and dealing force of life.
We tried to do it all the way to give us a big question.
"What is life like?"
We tried different approaches, simple approaches to life on the data.
We have already about 20 years.
When I sequence of the genome of the human, this has left the analogy of biology in the digital biology in the digital world.
Now we try to ask the question: Can we regenerate new force, or we can create new forces in this digital universe of life, in this digital universe of the digital universe of the digital universe of the digital universe of life.
This is the map of a little organism of an organism that has the smallest genitalib, which is the most of the way that can replant to a single lab that can reply.
We tried to see if we can come up with a genome and smaller genes.
We have been able to get the surface of a hundreds of genes of a gene in the outside.
But when we look at the map of the main the main is pretty simple, it's pretty simple.
I will be a little bit of it.
But when we look at all the genes that we can get the first time to a time, it's a little bit of a cell time that is a cell cell phone.
So we decided that we had the way to be as the way we can do this cross--cross--the-and-so that we can see the most fundamental components to the most fundamental questions.
And so I started on the room, "Can we get a cross--cross--cross--cross--cross--cross-one-cross--cross--cross--cross--cross--to-to-way I started on the room.
Maybe the chemistry allows to be these molecules that we haven't done before?
And if we can activize a cross cross of this?
A crosis, by the way, is just a little bit of chemical.
So, our speed to the digital life has been the way to a ritary rits.
Our new ability to write code code code that very very beginning to be done.
The last time he was able to get to a curriculum.
I started this for 15 years.
I went through a few etheless, I started to get bio-and-a-bio-o-to-the-the-the-to-the-day experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult to see DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that make little DNA in the world 30 to 50 miles a long time of 50 miles a general, but it's a general process of a long time, so that you build a long time, so much more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more of the car acting of thousands of tomorrows.
So we had to create a new way to put these little bits and and right now is the right and the right of the right of the right of the people.
This was our first tenth of the digital information from the digital reference, to the Ph.D.
It's a virus that the little box that the gold that gold virus.
We made the piece of paper, I went through the right of the right of the right of the DNA of DNA by a molecular molecule.
The interesting thing I came when I took this piece of chemical material, and I put it in bacteria and I put it in bacteria started to read this genetic code of the virus came to the virus and to prove this gene code of the viruses.
The viral crypes were then released in the cells and they were going to come back and they were going to be able to be the cells of E.
I was going to be with the oil of the oil and I would say that they understand this model.
They have laughed more than you do.
And so we think that's a situation where the software can be built in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the entire cross of a bacteria
This is about 58,000 tails of a code of genetic code,
So we said, "We would say to the letters in the bottom of the size of the virus to the size of the size of the size of the size of the cells that are the cell components that are the cell cell phones.
The design is critical, and if you start with the information in the computer, that information has to be very exciting.
When I was the first sequence of this man in 1995, the standard was a 10,000 sea was a 10,000 walls of the forest.
We found out of the resident, 30 to the report of the original core of the original consequence, this would never be accurate.
The design is the design of the design of the forest of the size of the size of the size of the other dogs that we have to make 50 letters to build 50 letters to build a little bit more than we are able to create some of the other thing that we have to be compatible with each otherwise with each other with each otherwise with each other with each otherwise with each otherwise with each other with each other with each other with each
We are also using elements.
You can read that I read the air, and you can put it on the top. We have a genetic code, we have a genetic code in four letters in four letters of the letters, and T.
Tries from those letters -- those letters of the letters of a few choices -- a single literally literally literally every voice of the account of a claimed account of a accurate accurate accountless acire.
So we can use the genetic to write the words, propositions, the proposition.
The idea of all I have been to hear that was to hear the code.
Some of them were disappointed to that it's not the poetry to do.
We have been to be these kinds of so that we can be with them.
I'm sorry that I am in them.
So we started doing the gaps, starting with five to five to seven to seven to a little bit, and then we would get 24,000 lets the hits and then put it in these rooms, and then put it in these rooms in these laws, and then put it up to 700,000 miles of these rooms.
And every time we have these little bits of these pieces of the husband can do them to make them make a very routinely robust -- as you can see a very roughly -- as you can see a very roughly roughly red.
We try to get to that point of the TV.
So this is what a report of the basket.
When we get to the very big stages, over 100,000 wall over 100,000 wall of the wils in E.S.
It is all the biology of biology of biology biology of biology.
So we have to other hang to other hand.
I knew that there is a mechanism, the mechanism, which biology that biology is useful to be able to replicate the DNA that makes us happy.
This is a example.
There is a range of the Islinocockroaches that can be the radio of radio roughly radiation.
As you can see in the panel in the cross--cross-frozen is frogs.
Two to 24 hours later from the new lawyer in the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be seven.
I can live in the light.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the space of extreatment, to be able to move a new environment, to find a new environment.
In fact, NASA came out there.
This is a micro-degree molecule that we build these profound out using these proponds -- in fact, using the bodies of the design of the box that we put on the box that we put on the boat.
Drojjaws them together together.
This is not a little bit of a microscope with electrocode with electric hyper-micro-dial photograph.
It's so a little molecule that we can see with a microscope with a microscope of the optice.
These are images of about a thousand second.
This is a published published that I had a little time.
These are over 58,000 letters of the code of genetic code,
It's the biggest molecule that has ever been doing people, with a structure structure structure.
It has a map of over 300 million of the year.
If we get a 10 and a couple of 10 and no space and without a 142 pages to get this genetic code of the genetic code of this code code of genetic code,
So how do we start a cross--cross--cross-grain?
Evivil with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's a lot more complicated with bacteria with bacteria
Either and more likely when you get to the toily, you can just get the nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear power, and that's something that you all heard you heard -- and that's something that you heard --
With the raises of the raised is integrated in the cell is integrated in the cells that we can do a completely completely transplant to a very high cross of a cell cross of the cells, and we can activate it.
We have a crossed of the microbial in the microbial species of the microbial of the microbial
These are the second as they are about as people like people and a little bit of the people.
We added a few genes in the forest in the way to get this cross--cross--cross--cross--roughly the crossed of the crossed of a few gene gene of a few gene gene of a few gene gene of genes is in the founded of gene gene gene gene in the forest.
I have a demand I was in order to kill all the protein.
And it was pretty amazing, when I put in the cellular -- you will get very sophisticated -- and the cross of the cell -- and the cross of the cells end.
In fact, I thought this is how it is it as far as we were trying to design a little bit more than I was going to design the process.
This is a major mechanisms of evolution.
We find all kinds of species that have been able to be a second cross-second cross--second cross--second cross of the tree, thousands of new new new characteristics of new new characteristic new characteristics of new characteristic new characteristics of the species that have a second range of spectrum.
So those who are thinking about evolution just as a single gene of a long time in biology.
I'm called the restriction of restriction that actually had the DNA that is the DNA
The Cromosome that was in the cell that was not a one.
The -- the Hulf -- the cross that we put --
It was except and I was recognized and the other cross like the ancient material, and so I was just like the mountain the new cross of the new cross of the new cross of the moon.
It became blue of the genes that we put in the cross--crosis.
And after a very short time of time, all the characteristicated species have lost in a new species were lost in a new species of a new species that I was a new species that I put in the cells that I put in the cells that I put in the cells that we put in the cells that I put in the cell.
All the proteins have been changing, membranes were changing, is the gene of the gene of the code that we have the code of the gene of the gene of the gene of the protein that we have a fertilized.
This can sound like alchemistry, but we could also get the DNA -- we can change the DNA very dramatically change the things that we are very dramatic.
Now, I would have to be a -- but it doesn't make three billion years and half years and half years ago, and we would have a new evolution of the evolution of the way to create a new version of the website, in which is a new specific specific specific design of the digital mammal design.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obviously a lot of nearly nearly nearly nearly nearly nearly nearly
We're going to go from six billion people and half a billion people in 40 years.
And I would give this in context for me to the context I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each of us in 1946, in 40 years, will be four years old.
We have a lot of problems that are inappropriate water and drilling water and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half and a half and a half and a half of them.
It will be hard to do for us.
We use over five billion tapes of cars, more than 30 billion barriers of the box of the box of the box of the box of the box of the box of the box of the box of the boy of the boyers of the table.
This means a hundred million barriers per day.
When we try to think about procing biological or any of the process that will be a huge challenge of this, will be a huge challenge of a huge challenge of the challenge that will be a huge challenge of a huge challenge to think about the procleaning to think about procing and think about the proccley or to think of a proccclearly and anything that we will be a lot of the process of the process that will be a
And then, of course, is all that CO2 from this material, which is that it gets in the atmosphere.
Now, from our discoveries around our world, we have a basic data of 20 million genes, and I like to think about this as a component of design as a component of design as a design of the future.
The electronics has only a range of a hundred -- or so that this is the diversity that came out of this.
We're the limited here, in the first time, biological reality and our imagination.
We have a techniques of these things like this, we can do what we call it a genuine genuine genuine genue.
We have the ability to build a big robot that will make a million cross a million cross on the day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of genes of genes of genes of genes to make a cast, or product of the footypical and products new farms, we can change the last 20 years of all the last 20 years of all the last 20 years of all the way of the science.
And that's just the standard of standard.
We can sell for your vessels of substic chemicals or diseases or vaccines, which is producing vaccines, which is the production of vaccines, which is the use.
This is a capture of design of a design of design that we work in order to wait and work to work and work on these species in the computer.
You know, we don't know how to show it is.
We know exactly how they look at their genetic cocke.
Now we are now focusing on the fourth to the fourth to the fourth of the generation.
You see it from the mixture of the mixture is just a nearby is just a unknown experiment
We have a general commitment of the second and the third and third of the third and the third of the way that are nows, to be more valuable to be more valuable to be different than the occurring or different types of pold.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without making a major impact on the food and the fear of their own and the fear of the CO2 as we start with the cells to design and work is if we start to design the cells, and we think that we will have the first of the generation of the fourth of the next generation of the fourth of the generation of the four.
The solar and CO2 is a way -- but in our discoveries of our world, but in discoveries of other ways of the world have all kinds of the world.
This is a organism that I wrote in 1996.
It goes into the deep ocean, about two kilometers and half of the bottom-up and half of the football of the fires.
Transform CO2 in metan used molecular biology used molecular biology.
We try to see if we can take CO2 intuitive, which can be easily transported in the country, and to go into the commitment in the compounds, to make this produces of the produced this one.
So in a short time of time, we think we could be the basic questions about what is the life?"
We know -- you know, you know -- we have the objects of the chemical.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED, where other words, where else is the other part?
Go to become a energy source of energy.
But also, we are now to use these same sources to invest these vaccines right now.
You see this year. This year, we are always with a year and a dollar and a dollar in the minus when it comes to the right of the right now.
I think that the situation can be changing, and the combination of vaccines that before we were doing any of the way we have.
And this is how it could we get the future of change the evolution of the evolution of evolution, accelerating evolution with bacteria with bacteria and finally finding the bacteria and finding the wild.
We're going to be about humans.
Our new is just to make sure that we have a long way to survive to survive to survive to survive to survive to be very much.
What I want to show you a lot of it, it's a fundamental technology, a new technology that I had to Microsoft a new amount of a year. This is about a year. This is a year. This is the Sealovely a year. This is the Sealovely lo.
It's a medium that can interaction that can interact with a big amount of information.
We look at a lot of it, many of the digital and the digital and the digital and a little bit of a right now, by the way, by the way, rearized through this one, rearguing through this way, and we want.
Not the way that it is not the information that is these big colors are these big colors or how big they are the images of the big pictures are here.
Most of them are doing with a digital camera camera camera in the world, but this is a picture of the Bible is a portion of the Big Congress of the way of the 300 megap.
It's not important because the only thing that the only thing that we should be the number of the monkeys of the monkeys of your monitors in a long time of your month of your own time. It's also a very fly of a very fly of a very fly of a very fly of the only thing that we should be the only one of the one thing that we should be the only one of the size of the performance of the performance is the numbers of the performance of the performance of your own performance is and the
This is a book book book of a nonetheless,
It's about "Chair."
To show you that it's about text, and not a picture and we can't do it as something like this, to look at the right thing is a reference of a text; it's not a picture of a text; it's not a picture of a text.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read a book in the electronic book in the form of electric forcled.
I would not recome.
This is a worst of the Wardian of "Gardianule.
Each of a century of a second.
This is really going to be a piece of experiences of reading experiences of reading a version of a revil of a newest environment, which is inherently an average environment.
We did something smell with a little bit of this number of the "Gardianule."
We created a false remote to a very large -- much more than any other than any one in any units -- and I was released -- and I was a confident -- and I was able to get a confidence of a very high remain a very high school
If you can see the cartoonist this machine -- you can see them here.
Or other models, or even specifically specific species.
And this really is the way of the idea, the release of a monitor.
We hope that this is to be able to be the pop-based and other way of the way that -- which are not necessarily
Of course, the mappping is one of the applications of the kind of technology.
I will not be a long time on this, but just to tell you that we have to tell you that we have contributed to this field.
These are all the way in the United States of the United States of NASA.
Let's go to now is something else.
This is actually accurate the Intern; you can see the great.
This is a project called Posny, which is the second technology.
and Rick Szki Szki to Cerhaki at the beautiful school.
So this is active active on the Internet.
You can see that when we create this is that when we can do this kind of perspective. And we can have this kind of experience in many ways, we can have this kind of a lot of solving income.
But the space of these images of these images of these images that really really really is to true.
The other perception of visual perception of these images have recorded these images, so that to make the real place where these pounds of the God and the God and the God and the God -- have been done by the State -- they were made these elements of a projection of a new operational projection or the panoral or of these elements were the space of the space of space and the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the time.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other media.
There are some of the other space that have a lot of space.
I would like to go to one of the original core of Noah -- this is doing a big amount of time in the way I worked in the way I worked in the way I worked in the way I think that I have worked in the technology, the technology of this technology, and it's not necessarily a lot of the next new projector of the next next projector of the next next next day that I was to the next next to the website.
We had to have a way of the equal aspect of the wave of the ways."
This is a reconstruction of Craution of the Duel Human in the images of Flickr, and you find something that is the Flickr, and you find something with the guy in the trouble, from the trouble in the truth of these conporters of the code of these conportion of the path of this model of the pattern.
These are the Flickr, and all of the space of the space in this way.
We can just not be above in this way.
You know, I never thought I would have to work at Microsoft is very ethin the way I was really really the first and I have the first and the first one and the first one of the first here.
I don't see that I'm a lot of the roadness of the rooms of the TVs at the TVs at SLRs to SLLs in SLLLs in this environment.
If I can find out the green of these strange green.
There are so many mammmms, fish, I guide it.
Wherever it is a series of photography --
This is a poster with Human who was recorded by the right now.
You can get out of the poster of the physical media.
The idea is that I can do some of the social environment. This means to collect the world -- from all of the world -- from a collective memory -- and to make a member of what the Earth is connected to the Earth -- and to interact with those customs have been connected, and they have been connected to the rest of the day.
You have a model of what is the entire Earth is the entire Earth
Think about this as a long as you can get the way of Stephen Lawler Cawler CE.C.
And this is that creates as we use it to be more than the world as much of the benefits of the use of as users are used to use them.
The maps are all the way with meters that somebody else else to get it.
If someone would eat all these slowly fats and say who they would say that I would be the Nobel with the Nobel Day and I could improve all these dates, and I could use it as a way to get that space. And I could use it as a place that space to make that space through that space of this space of a whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole lot of this way of a life of experience.
And of course, a produced by the way, but all of these are the virtual and rich virtual models of the Earth's earliest and the Earth collective of the Earth and images of the village and images of the village of the village of the village of the city of the city of the color of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the world.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: What do you know is the right thing to do is that it allows to be as a result of the few years ago, is that all the photographs of someone else on the room?
BA: Yeah. What does is to be true.
It creates hyper-connected hyper-to-to-
And they do this based on the images of the image.
And this is becoming the time you think about the significant information that have the significant information that they have these images.
As you can do a look at the imagery of the Internet, and the text of the Internet is a lot of the Internet is a lot of information about what is the picture of information about what is the positive information about what is the positive information about what is the positive information is here.
Now, what would be if that picture is the connection to all the picture?
And so the amount of connection and the disease that is a huge amount of this is a huge role in this is where the resident.
CA: Blayer, is really incredible.
BAA: Thank you very much.

You don't know that the Jagus Jaguary Jaguary Lacuish, or the mysteries of the Laccount of the Himalal-like the Himalay, or that in Himalabum is to remember the center of the anthropology, and this is the core of the anthropology, and this is only one of the world that we live in a sense of the world that we live in a sense of the fact that we live in a system of the world -- but the fact that we live in the fact that we live in the world of the fact that we live in the alongress.
The consequence of a certain set of decision-making decisions that our ancestors have been to be successful and success, and with many generations in the next generation of a lot of generations in the next generation of generations in the next generation of a certain generations of a certain set of the way of a certain set of a certain set of a certain set of the way of the decisions in the next generation.
And of course, we all share the same of the same adaptive and imperative

We are in the initial ritual rate of inition.
We need to do the separation of the moral of morning, so we should have a surprising we should have a surprising we have to be able to do the art.
But what is interesting is the real thing is the death of the songs, the race of every cultural culture.
The fact is that it's the Penannel in Borneo, or the waste, or the woodo from Haitdozen from the north of the Kaisissel Cathean Hunder, the tribal of the Curanderan hour of Sahara.

Now, the mirror of the world is that they reform a revenues and cultural cultural and cultural cultural and the cultural growth and the way of the growth of life as a biological race of life, know as the biological life of life.
And you can think about this required to this reach of life as being the nosphere and you could definitely deeply to all the dream of the dream of the vision, intuitial of the human imagination of the human imagination of the conference of the conference of the consequence of the conference.
Etnosopinion is the main humanity.

And as the biosphere was the heroids, so and the nosphere -- and maybe at a long scale.
For example, no biopposite of the box that half of all the species, and more of all the species, because half of all the species of the expanded, because it's not true, and yet this is not true, and yet this is the most famous scenario -- the most optimal of the myth of the biological history.
And the biggest is the biggest thing is about designing is the way of the limits of the limits of the limits of the limits of the limest.
When you were born you with you, the ones in this room, there were 6,000 languages.
Now, a language is not only a voice or a voice or a freedom of rule.

And yet, that soargue is really unbelievable to be the Earth in the Earth for each two weeks, because every two weeks, because every two weeks, a old old old old old old old languages.
And I know that some of you would say, "Well, would be better, right?
It would not be the world a better place if I talk to a single languag?" And I said, "Grozavor that will be the iana. Or will be Cantones." Or to be Canonese.
Or to be Kogi."
And then you can discover the way that would be able to be able to talk to your own language.
So what I want to do today with you know, it's kind of a nosphere -- a little bit of the nosphere by trying to give you a sense of what they would be losing to try to lose a sense of what they are losing to be the fact that I want to do with you in the fact that I want to do today.

I want to start with what I call "doct."
Doctor of the inner of that?
The Doctor of all the Western society of all the Western industry.
And this doctrine doctor, so we are being a little bit of the way we are interested in the way of the bedles of the citizens to make a maximum of a free level of freedom of individual freedom of individual freedom of individual freedom of individual freedom of individual freedom of individual freedom of individual reeffort.
The reason for this is that freedom is so the freedom is that the wrong thing to be true, which is essentially the key to be frustrated to be many.
And because if people are free and every of us can account and make sure that their own and make sure that our grandmother and our grandchildren, and our own nobody has to decide to make decisions in our place in our place in our place in our place in our place in our place in our place of us can be free free and each of us can account each of us can actionary each of us to us and make sure that each of us
The maximity to maximize the freedom is the maximization.
The more people have choices, the more people have have more freedom and more freedom and more freedom of the most freedom of the way they were going to be more frequently with the way they do.
And so I think, is so well that it's so good in our system, that wouldn't be able to get out of the way to put it on the way to put it on the way to put it on the edge.
And it's deep deep-life life life in our lives.
I'll give you a few examples of what made to do for us to the last time in the last time in the last time.
This is a supermarket.
I want to tell you about two words about the bees for wild to wear it.
175 countries for the stem in my supermarket, and the little bit, and the 10 times the 10 times the 10 times of the measured, and the 12 hours, and 12 hours, and 12 hours, and 12 hours, which can buy your own injury that you can buy your own one of the 175 of the most of the 175 of the one of the 175 of the one of the 175 times that no longer is the required to the 175 times the next few of the 175 times the way of the 175 of the 175 times of the top of the 175 times the last 30-toil-to
So it's so much from the supermarket.
And then you go to the store of the electric components to get a system -- the disease -- the disease, CDytototototoo, the transform of the houses of the hour housin the hall.
And in this room of electronic components are a lot of the systems of system.
We can can get six million and half and half to half a different set of the components of the components that are in the office of a single star store.
You have to recognize that this means is a lot of opposite options.
In other ways, in other areas -- in the world of communication.
There was a little bit of that, when I was a kid, where you could get any of the cell phonrase in the way of the GBell.
The cell phone.
And I can be a consequence of this was that the cell is that the cell is that the cell is not the right thing to do.
And those days are a lot of water.
Now, we have a close diversity of the TV, especially in the world of the movie of the mobile phones.

And if you have never seen in the room you can still see in the state, because you can see it in the cure of it.
And the result is that the result in the stage, and to put this question.
And you know what is the answer to the question of the question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to buy a cell phone that you don't know it very much.
And in other areas of life that are much more important than buy than buy is so much more important than the opposite number of opposite number of opposite number of options.
The economy is -- in the United States is not the case you go to the doctor and this is telling you what to do.
Instead, you know, you go to the doctor and this is the range of the B.
It has these advanced these advanced risk.
TTwo has these advanced and these risks. What do you want to do?
And you say, "Docto," what do you do?" And the doctor has these advantaged and these risks and these risks and the rise of these trees and the rise of these and the risks.
What do you want to do we do?
And you say, "But if you were in my place in my place I do?" And the doctor, the word "But the result is -- I don't know the result is -- I say, "We know the patient to do something that makes a lot of a little bit more effectively more than a matter of fact, is a significant.
But what is actually a transition is a transition and decision-making responsibility to decide to someone who knows something -- in this case -- in the case -- in the case and it's almost almost almost almost and so it's almost almost as the best way to take a choice -- in the case of the patient -- in the case of the patient.
There are a huge level of addiction for the reeternal of reeting people like me and like you -- what if you think about it, it doesn't have a little bit, because if we don't have a lot, we can't buy them.
Why do we add new audience if we can't buy them it?
The answer is that the people who do this is that we do that we are going to be the next morning, and to make us change the next morning.
Something so important as our identity has become a problem of choice, and this transition of choice to look at the role of the role of the role of the role of the way to look at that.
And the new new way we don't have a identity but we have the possibility to a invention.
And we can reinvest to reinvest to us anyone else in the way we have a cook.
And that means that every day you see every day you have to know what you want to do you to be able to do it.
With all the way to fall of the way that there was a sense of the way that the prescription that the beginning, and then you have to get to the way of life as much as it gets to the children and then start to get children to the kids as fast.
The opposite was with a little bit of a little bit of the bed, and what you do after that.
In our day day we all do is very much about eating and so on.
I give you incredibly intelligent students and I give them a little bit more than I was doing it.
And that's not a little bit more than the tough, and not because it would be a little bit more than the made.
How are you going to be a lot of questions "should be able to do it or not?
I should be able to do it lat? You should have a children, or a carry carry on the book?" All that we have the questions that consume.
And they will answer the question, whether they do not that if this is not to do all the stand and do not a good notion of my bees that I will not have a good notion to the curve.
And that's also what we need to do. These are important questions that you have to answer it.
Mung -- we are the bless; as the Carl and Carl and Carl and the technology that allows us to work in every single minimum of every single place in every single place of the way of the West Rand: the Rand's Rand.
And then there is a colleague, which is a colleague, which is not going to be able to be the wireless of the income from.
I will not tell you about it, because I want to use it.
So this is that this incredible freedom to choose to choose to choice, is that we have to take a decision, and we should take a decision, and if we should be able to work and if we should have to work with.
We can go to see how our baby the boat and we have the motion and we have the mountain in the other and the Blackberryard and the laptops, you probably the genes.
And even though they're closed in every mind, in which we look at how many of us are moving a football of the football of us to this application?
I should be able to answer this email? You should write the theory of this let?" And even if the answer is that the answer is that the answer is that the answer to the blue of your bank you for the little bits will be very different from your teaming of how it would it be without being done.
So in the origin and little things and small, objects and the things that are the kind of life is a little bit of the opposite thing to opposite stuff.
And the world I lived here.
To say that, I had some choices to do it, but it wasn't a bad stuff.
And the world where we live here is that we live in it.
And the question is, is so good, right?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what it is we know about it, so I will talk about what is going to be right.
All these choices have two choices that two negative effects on people.
One of the way of parts, it's that produced as much as it can be a lot of reach.
And so many opposite of the options that can choose to get very hard for something that is very difficult for something that is really hard for something to be able to teach for something.
You can give you a very important example of the investment of the investment of the investment in the living in the living planet.
A collapse of my school has been able to get to the rest of the forest of the forest of the founding of the founding and 2,000 sees of the forest and 2,000 sees.
And what it turns out that for each 10 founding to the employees that are the race of the employees of the preserving two percent.
Two 50 founding -- they were written with 10 percent of the 10 percent of the people are getting a little bit of the beach.
Because with 50 founding the mountain of which is naid to choose to choose to choose to choose that you can see a lab and so a layer and so a lab and you can see a layer and you can see it.
And then on the poor and then I would fall and I would fall the way to the noise and of course, the time that this is not going to be a little bit more and more is not going to be a little bit more and more and more is never been able to do.
You know, you don't just mean that they don't only mean that they will be consumed to the door of the dog because they don't have enough money to put money to put the way out of a decision-making a decision-making making a decision-making making in the compending of the compending of the compending of compending that will reward the compensor of the compensea levels of compete compending that will reward the deep of the compending of the compendress of the foundation of the way to the way to the consumption of the consume
Neither and I would give you a little bit of a hundred dollars from the time in the employees that would have a long time to compete your compenses.
So the reason is a consequence when you have too many opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposition, so many of the opinion.
And I think that does that make people like this.
And you want to take the best way to all the way to all the way to all of the ethical, right?
You don't want to choose from investment or not even the one of the way to wear the wrong thing to say.
So this is a second is that we have to be able to keep the stable to keep the way to make a choice and make a little bit more satisfy to be less satisfy than we have the choice as we have been a little bit of the choice that we choose to choose the choice that we choice.
And there are a few reasons for that.
One of them is that we had a lot of snoss for the people that are going to choose if you go to the one and it's not a right -- but you know, the sounds of the wild for the wild to save it?
It's easy to imagine that you could be able to do a different choice that would be better. And what happens is that the alternative that is that the alternative you can imagine that you have to regret and these regret regret in the village that you have to have the choices that you can actually imagine that if this is a good decision.
The more opposite of the opposite of the opposite of something that is unlikely to be in the opposite that you have the opposite of the opposite that you have a way that you have a little bit of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of you have a lot of opposite opposition,
Second, what economists call it for the opportunity of opportunity.
Dan Gilber of a very clear in this morning about how we find things that we are looking at the way that we see the way we compare to what we compare to the way we compare them.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative to have a lot of alternative to think about the feeling of the characteristics of the trees that are the alternative and that makes you less than you get a little village that you have a little village that you have a little bit of alternative that you have a little bit of alternative that you have a lot of alternative to be a lot of alternative to have a lot of alternative to be a lot of alternative to be a little bit of alternative
Here's an example.
But here's how we should be able to raise it.
We have this from Hampions.
A very scubber of a very scub.
The superbonds. They have a wonderful day they have all right.
What could you want to want to do with a lot of saying, "It's a guarante."
Everyone in my book, my cartoon in Manhattan are leading to them.
I would like to get the office in front of the office of the weeks that two weeks of the idea that the way to have a little bit of the way to have a place that wonderful place to have a place that wonderful place that wonderful thing to have a place that wonderful place to have a place that wonderful place to be a to-time in front of the office in front of the office of the office to the office the office.
The way of the opportunity in the village that we have in the village that we have the choices that we know is the exception.
And as much as the opposite of the options of that are the kind of the opposite of these options are going to be able to be the opportunity to be dangerous for opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoonist tells a lot of things.
We should live in the wall, and we probably need to be able to get the things that we should do the right now.
But one of the things that tell us is that anyone else is that anyone else to do not do other things.
And all of the other things that can have a lot of lights and that will do something that you do a little bit more attempt.
Third of the threat of expectance.
And this was when I wanted to get my bluegia.
I can get about all the time.
And there was a little bit like that in the way that the one and you buy them and bought to be a lot of you would have been incredibly unknown as if you have, and if you have, and if you get a lot of time and I would fall the time and I would go to the way to get it started.
So I went to to my grandchildren after I was doing the old and I said, "Look, I want to say "Look, I want to be the bad, and the State is the measure." And the Sweden, and the State and the right thing to be a little bit of a light, right?
Do you want to be with the pyramid? Do you want to get your or or your do?
Can you be able to get the same thing.
You want to eventually -- you want to get the bonto the bband and -- not fine.
He painted his face after I said, "I want to say to me to be the guy who were the only guy who were the only one of the guy who was not a sense of the beat so I spent a city that I spent a city of the wall of the wall of the way -- the way of the worst -- the worst of the most of the one of the most people I had a little bit of the most of the most of the one of the most of the ones that were the most of the way I was the most of the ones I was the best of the ones that they were the best of the way I was the right --
We have a lot of these options have done to choose to choose better.
But I felt more likely I was I feel.
Why did I write a book in which I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt more like I felt that I was that we had all these options of these options about how I should be a bunch of the way that we should be a bunch of the beat have grown in the way they have grown up.
I had a very close expectance. We didn't have a really expectant to be a very hard.
Now when I'm 100 of the moneyewelcome to be perfect.
And what I would have to get a good thing, but it doesn't work.
So I compared what I was I got to get what I expect is that I was disappointed in the compared to what we have.
The opposite of options in the lives of people can't do something else.
And the way that will take a little bit of a little village even though they get good results.
Nobody from the marketing world doesn't know that.
Because if I would you know what, I will not have the idea.
The one is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was a better when it was worried is that when they were really unable to expert is really possible to experiment.
And over the course of the world that we live -- of course, the citizens of the countries that are the best of the best thing that you can be the best thing that you can be so good that you can be so good that you can be so good to be that the best way to be able to bee.
You never have a surprised because I was a surprising because I was in my way to determine in the way to the sky.
The happiness of happiness -- for that you all came with -- secret is to have the happiness is to get expectations of reduses.
I want to tell -- just a little bit of a little box -- I actually have a wonderful wife, and it's really good at the right right now.
I couldn't find something more like that. I couldn't even get a little bit better.
But let's look at the house in the household of a thing that is so far.
And finally, a consequence of a wall of the wall you can't get the good when you can see when you can buy a single one one is that when you can't get a lot of the way and the answer that and the answer is the correct, and the answer is the answer.
The people is going to come from. Who is I could be doing?
When they're hundreds of different style of different stills and you buy one that you can be a little bit of the things that you can ask yourself and ask the which, what does it mean?
It's as a clear that the answer to the question is, right?
You could be able to choose better.
A different hundred different ways. They don't have any way to choose to choose to the choice for the hour of the husband of the husband of the husband of a little bit of a hundred percent of the choice of different ways.
So when people get decisions, even if people use the results are good to do is good for them, they feel good about it, they are good at them, they are being beaten to them.
The fact of the werupon the world of the last generation of the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not the only thing to do is the important thing to do is that the depression of the depression that are people who have experiences that are very much more than the standard because the standard is very much more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more than it is so important.
And when you have to explain these experiences are being able to come from.
So the result is that the result is that we have a little bit more objective and we feel we feel more worry.
So let me remind you to remind you.
This is that the doctrina, that is that we all think is really true and it's not true.
Without the discussion that you can have a few choices is more than the one of the choices are better than you might be the way that you can be better.
There is a magical number of magic.
But I'm pretty sure that we have been able to do so much of that the way that the choice is the way of life.
Now, the idea -- almost I was finally finally -- the idea of what to think about is this.
What allows to do is that all these choices in society is the good materials.
There are a lot of places in the world and we heard a few of them are not that they have not that much of the problems are not that much of the opposite of the opposite of the opposition.
The problem is that they have too little to do.
So the thing about the issue of me is a strange issue of the West for the Wrich and rich lies.
And what is frustrated and is the suit is this: Steve Levitt: You know, the way to the children and women are doing it for the way to be helped us to the way of scale.
What I tell you that these opposition, you know, and complicated not only anyone else doesn't just help them.
They actually have a lot of painting.
They even do we feel more like we are worry.
If something that allows us to do in our society to make all the choices that we do all have to be the way that people have too much of the society that people have too much of the same life will be improved in the same life will be improved in the same way of our lives.
This is what economists call the Ptoto.
The citizens will make us be more and more of all -- not only people -- not only have people -- because of the way that we are enough.
In the conclusion. With that you can see this cartoons, and it's a sophisticated person to say "Ay! What do you know is the cook!
You know that anything else is possible in this action of the action of the city, a mixed migration of the world -- so I read it and I read it and I was the first time.
And I was like, I thought more about the way I was to think of the cooking.
Because the real thing is that if you hope that everything to be possible to be possible, you don't have freedom to be freedom of residents.
If you go to the acvarious acvarious that is possible, today today is possible.
You can make the death and scale.
Anybody needs a variety.
This is almost almost too limited -- even for a fish.
But the above of a metaphor is a reetter of neuver-in-red, disaster.
Thank you very much.
