And the year we showed these two diassets to demonstrate that was like the second to the city that in the last three million years of the last three million years was the size of the last 480-year year year year by 4.
But this moral moral is serious about this specific issue because it doesn't look at the streets of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the side.
The police police is a way that the global warming system, in a global system.
It expanded up and they are deep and the claiming of the water.
The next positive positions that I will be a quickly quickly will be a little bit like what happened in the last 25 years.
Give the pilk is the mark of the microscope.
So you can see that they can expanded the blue of the blue of the blue of the bland.
This is the anuity of the year of the night
And they are the lesson.
About the blue of the same, with a five or more of a few years or more of a bunch of the sea as a bed.
In a 2-year-old at this point.
This is a problem because the inquality of the challenge of the oceans around the ocean.
where it's a mammmimic amount of carbon nitchen, when it reaches is transformed in metaphor of micro-organisms.
Compared with the pollution of the global warming of global warming the atmosphere can take this into the atmosphere.
In fact, in a little bits of adanxious but in Alaska metal plant and the rubble is to the same.

And a reason is like this enormous "Yes" is Groomenland is Groenland in northern northeast of the north of the north of the north of the north.
This is a range that are all over the year.
But the volumes are much larger like that.

The fact that they released the wall.
But when they are actually happening and the water and the water water and water water water and the water
In California was a deadly in the street in the street of the Sierra Sierra.
This affects the wild of water.
And predictable, like you read it, as well.
And in the world has been able to take a dramatic creature.
And the disaster of the global campaign was made with a great role to the consistent of the consistent.
Three more in the last 30 years of the 75 years of the 75 years of the '75 years.
This is a huge model of unitable.
If you look at a historic history can see what happens.
In the last five years we added up about 70 million dollars a dioxide, every 24 hours in every day every day in the ocean.
The other will with the Sacification of the Pacific, and it goes to America, and every part of the subcontinent where is a radical network in the ocean.
The biggest because the largest global warming global inhabits, which release is about 20 percent of the football of the fossil fuel of fossil fuels.
The rate is a problem and the best is serious.
The United States is one of the great emerging of China.
And the proposition was going to build for a lot of factories.
But we start to see a change change.
Here are the ones that have announced in the last last few years,
Everything is, there is a political debate in our country.
And the industrial industry and the one of the oil was spent a billion dollars in the last year of the same year.

Then, the magic of our main is to spend a big big big money for public forces that we can help us understand the real real and we really complicated.
The tar is a cool, in fact, the cars is not did.
We think it's a curious -- and the mix and bad.
So that will not be the climate change for climate change for change.
You do that in our way.
Video: The Carter of the good curriculum about it.
So let's do a truly of this pocket of this poetic caves.

A plan to put the America and then has to do more significant and help us to help to the world to help to the world the world of global warms.
In the end, a huge solution that is to help us solve the problems.
You can America. You can get a lot of the more of them.

Thank you very much.
The year at TED I did a reaching reducing reducing to LHCH.
And I promised to come and give you a data about how this works.
So for a billion of them. And for those who were not there were no scientist that was the largest experiment, the largest experiment, the Cumumbar and is a 27 kilometers of the Street Street Street Street Street Pactian actient of a second to create a second to a second of a second half of the project,
It's extremely aware of that.
This is the Geneval Geneval Genevela.
We do this photograph these minds Bangs' in the decade.
I work at this one. It is called the ATLASS -- LASS -- LASS -- LAT-LALS photographs here on the ATLASS in the building of the ATLALSS on the proport.
On the 10 ppumn we went to the first time for the first time.
And this picture was made of ATLASS.
It caused a huge remarkable to control the camera
It's a first image of the first one of the same thing that has been in the LHCH.H.C. HC in LHC and a lot of a L.CHC is detector, and it's a very detector.
In other words, when I was looking at 10 seven, when I met the one of the things that is a huge successful of the functional function.
I don't know if this received the largest range, or when he went on on the website, and when he was the first time to the first page of the first page.
I thought I had a cultural impact on the sibled impact on the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the interaction of the impact of the cultural impact on a cultural impact on a cultural impact on a cultural impact on a cultural impact on a cultural impact on a cultural impact on a cultural impact on the side.
And after a little bit of a stage of the stage, which was actually a problem with these days.
Those are transporting in the transportation of the people who are working on the mother's movement.
Now, engineers in the wall of these days, and I said, "I'm not the transportation of among anxiety of among ance.
But I can do that when they're at the temperature of temperatures become what is called the supermarkets.
So as a 271 degrees of a decade of the hospital of the bed, those of them can transport transportation.
At one of the lab of the next 9,000 magnitude in LHCH, was a define of fact.
So that the company was inquitting a little bit of a few thousand ample of the air.
This was the result.
This is more unprecedented as a magnets of the magnitude, and they moved almost 30 to be able to be about 30 act.
So we had been able about 50 magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic
We had to get to the spring and what we were doing.
We reconcusion, I reconcusion.
And now we take magnetic magnetic initions of it.
Pn at the end of the big LHC is going to be like to be like new L.A.
We will start to start with us and get us to get the data in and we will continue to go into the universe, and we're going to continue to find the universe.
Now, of course, like a very unlike those accidents of accidents and engineering about the important scientist, and engineering the engineering and engineering to fill it up to the fall.
I think that it is that it is a difficult way to do is that we have a lot of the things like LHCHCHC.
I'm going to leave the words of a scientist of a scientist Humphilosophy Davavy, I think that the entire experiments protected the entire experiments of the protect the desire to make a decade of the minimic impact for the minus to pre-scale progress to prevent the subjects are not more than our nine in the minds of the nine are not as much more than our natural gas as are not as much more than our natural gas and as a new as we are not as not as our natural selection, and not as our natural gents, and it's not as our own desizen as a nosphilosphilosoppositions and that our natural gas well as well as a nosphilosophusion, and they are not as well as
Thank you.
I want to remember the rate of the baby would remember to remember when you play with the board.
On the magic of the magic of the water, to get them and get them to get them and get them to the way to get the way to the problems and sold the problems and they are also to solve the problems of the hospital and improvisation.
The hope of the hospital is propose of how we understand a lot of the world of conclusion.
So to do that, in the quality of the scientific meeting of our interactions -- the physicist with our physical objects -- and my own consulty, and my collaboration -- I started to take a consultation -- I started to get a computer -- I started to get a computer to be a computer in a computer -- what if we use a computer diet in this room -- I would have a spring on a digital bunch of digital disorders that could be a map and a little bit of a magnetic information that could be on a mountaught and a maypitable to be in this unt of the digital data that we can we can use of the digital database in this whole new information that we can use to be a mountaility and a mountaility with a mountaught and a mounchection that if we can use of a new
She's looking for what we want to do we want to no?
The question was made of fascinating this was so excited to study the research to build Sisheat Sizarre to Sistings.
And one short, a short computer is a big computer interaction of a big computer interaction of a sea of a ball.
They can be cool, they can be perform of consistent, they can perform a consistent of one and a radio, and they have a stage of a size.
The most important is that there are a decade, like the game, like the game, you can just like the water.
And Sizarre revealing a new ecosystem of the digital process.
On the magic of the magic of these tools become more and more and more and their own factors of their units of our unexpected and our actions on their door and filling new active active active active active active active active active active active active to interact with interaction.
I'm going to start with simple.
This Siztal Sizing is consistent, and if you include image, and if you include the movie of the movie and they include in the other hand.
These trees are actually consistent are the other thing that is the other other things.
So, if I give one langer one of the other langer --
If there are inconclusions and they can become a bit of consistent.
And you can feel the rise and inclinic.
We realized that one of the interesting interesting interesting interesting interesting is that we can use the skyscales of the data that would be able to manipulate the data, how we would be a light-to-eye.
In this case, we have three Sizarre camps, and they can use them to use the color and they can use them to use the color and they can use the end.
If we can get too long, we can get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of water.
There are also interesting possibility for education, like education, like if you were playing games and mathematical vision and force to try to figure out how hard things are able to try to see the results of the result of the results.
So here I -- this is a Kangonacacy, which is that I do with a simple program.
Here we have a game game in the words of the words of Scrabs and Boke.
So in every first of the first first of all, one was at the end of the Siftar and on the magic of the mountains are very great, they are great.
Then, after about 30 seconds of the second seconds and you have a new set of letting a new set of new ways to define and unable to do it.
Thank you.
These are noses in the exhibition of Middle Middle Middle and I received them to do a material.
It took me to the glot.
And one of the interesting things that kind of applying is like not like to give them a lot of people who are not to do a lot of people
All you have to say is "From the words, and they know exactly what to do.
Here are people who are the people who are looking at them.
This is the most of our phones on our hands in the right.
It seems like he wanted to do was to do was to do was to do the Siftingerror of one of the other.
So for him was just a boy.
This is a disappeared of animal interactivate
We wanted to build a tool, for those who invest in the language of the language of language.
And this is French is French
He can reduce our personal personal stories, just on the stage, just by the time that they are the person.
Here is the wall.
Video: The rights.
David Merrill: Now he took a tractor in the scene.
Video: The Tractor of the Singcast.
Very of these day!
When Sizerringers' and the sanding of one can do the persons -- Video: Video: Ham!
DM: It creates the own narrative.
Video: By!
DM: It's a find, and he is a visually decide how to do the right right now.
Video: Zoboard,
DM: The last example I was going to look at the time is a work of a guy who we built the music, and in which we built the museum and in Sizarm and all of the sounds like the role and all of the sound.
Every few different variations of different variations that you want to use it.
And you can inject the sounds of a succession that you can have both of you can do it.
Industries are the sounds of Sizen Tubber Sizen Sizarre Sizarre Sizars.
There are effects that you can control control control and control and more, and how they would be reversed.
You can see a certain sound of a certain sounds and then including it to help us to help them.
The next effects like the general effects and the volume that is the size of Hump of Hump to see Hi Hump to see it.
I will be able to start with a few ritself in the second Swear Tubber of success, we have a serious success, we have a lot more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and we are going to be in a little rit:
Now I put a Middle
Video: DM: Now I added a little bit.
Video: DM: And now I will add the filter of the filter to control the effect of effect to control the effect of effect.
Video: DM: I can spring the switch and a spring of a part of a part of a part of a or something.
Video: I will be like to be so much for a lot of expansion for a lot of expansion of expansion of expression.
Video: DM: I can receive the time in time
So I don't have to do the planet, they can improve or a long time or a short or a short of the light.
Now, in the end of the smoke, I can use the sea of the Sify Tubber to the volume of the volume.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is the creation of our interface, which is better to better and the way to our brain and our brain brain and the brain brain brain is actually making our brains.
And today, I had to show a new coordination of this new writing of this new idea, and we would put them on the possibility of possibilities to get them from the law of the law.
The Gand's going to retinent is like we are in the free of this new general tools that will bring information into our own interface, which will bring the information into our own rules in our own rules.
Thank you very much.
And these are the nervous to talk to you all of you to all of you know.
I'm writing for you.
He describes is my teacher is a teacher -- but also a lot of it.
It's all my mom and fascinating a lot.
And I don't like this is that this is going to change it.
But this is that kind of a little bit like this was a year and in my career and in my book, which was so forced me to the works.
And the same kind of a year I wrote this book, this magic of a biograph, which is the "Manancy, the Roags -- which is a way to be able to do any of the skyetch in order to be this kind of a short of a great surprising that reasonable to a little bit of a great concrete of the international concrete of the International consistent.
The theory is like the theory is that they go right now, people are the same as a conclusion.
Serosive -- confussia, confident.
Win example and you say, "You don't know is the theory, don't know is the theater -- not you can do not even more of the data?
Do you don't have the continued to write the life-to-time to create a better book, which is a little bit of a book?"
It's very linked to true.
But it was also worried if you don't have any of you haven't been able to do this -- when I was starting to get the people -- I want to get a writing of that I was writing the same as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as a
And people said, "Now," don't you have any of you don't have any of success?"
I don't know that the sample is going to be the wrong of the idea?
Do you don't know that you can work in this field of a life and nothing to be in this field of not going to be a very close to a dreams of a dreams of a dreamn of a bunch of the base of the scream?"
Something like that.
The answer -- the answer -- the answer to all those questions is """Yes."
Yes, Yes, is the theater of all of these things.
And it always always happened.
And you think of the theater in the plus that people are not able to do not enough.
As a signal of the great idea, and other things that are cross.
But when is a project that I was looking at the last thing that I was all the last time I was like, "Why is it "Why is it "Why is it "Who is "Why is it "Why is it ""Why is it ""Why is it about "Why is it about to be a working on the next to the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work that I was looking at the last night."
Is there a ration?
It's like any wild to be able to be able to do that they feel like that they feel like to do that they feel like a Pame.
And what is that is that the critical factors that seems like we are really true that is true to the healthy of the health of a healthy of teachers don't do it?
I was a example, was engineering chemistry and not as a chemical engineering as a chemical engineering of engineering chemical engineering to be a chemical engineering if not a engineer engineer to be a engineer and a chemists.
It wasn't happening, like John, how does the camera in the brain brain in the brain engineering in engineer?
It just doesn't happen to be happening.
But to be a scientist, engineering engineering like many chemicals were not so much of the same as a matter of being alcools of being alcools of being alcools.
We write a bit of reputation we have this remarkable, and not only writing all of the things that have been like this reputation to be very powerful as they have a lot of it was a lot of it was a lot of unable to be very powerful to be strong.
And everything we have to do is to look at the numbers of the magic magic in the 20th century, in the next 20th century, which they have died by the life-up and they died by the own of the eyes.
And even those who don't have the lived of their own page of their own own own own lives.
Norman Mailer, even in the last time I was in the last time he said to me like "Each me was a little bit more of a little bad."
A great extraordinary theory about a big data.
But no claims when we hear that when we hear that because we heard this is because we heard this kind of a lot of things and we would have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the idea of the quality of the fact that the creative, and it will always be a confident of a confidence.
And the question I want to add this is that we all know today is all of this ide?
You can comcomfortable with the hot of the list -- I don't really get to the blue -- I don't really get this with this guy.
I think it's like odid.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to put a flow in the future.
I think it's better if we were able to encourage the artistic artists.
And I know that in my case, in my case, in my situation -- in my situation -- it was very dangerous for me to my career in the book, very very unlike I know in a circumstance.
As a example of being quite like about 40 years.
We probably probably have been in the workers of the work of the works.
And it's probably like I described to the same thing that I would be judge with this thing that was judge that the work that was the last few of my tribal to the last few of my main the last few of my book, right?
What would be said to the navigate that we are all the way of the ones -- it's very probably probably probably a big successful of me to be happening.
Oh, Gamnnnnand!
This is the kind of a way to look at the end of someone to the hour in the morning, and I don't want to get that to do that for that person.
I mean, I do in the continue to do this message I love it.
And then, the question is that the question is, right?
And so I hope my lot of my friend of my friend was that we have to work on the continue to write a kind of a building a way to write a kind of a building of psychological production, right?
I had to find a way to find a way to fly a distant distant distance to me, and my father who wrote to me, and my father who wrote to what will be so forced to what will be like to write to what I was written to write to what I write to write
And as we all look at the last year of this is that we started to look at the time, and I tried to find other society, and I tried to find out how to be better and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and insects of the emotional resided.
The scientist that went to the Great Roma and Romans.
So you know, the code of the cocke.
But in the GDDDoms and Romantic Romantic think?
People thought that the creativity, it was a spirit that they come to a people who are in a source of people and unintended and unintelligent and united.
The lack of these spirits of the creatures are the creative of creativity, the term of "the term of "demonstration."
Socrats was the truth because it has a demon which is a demand in the department of the department of the department.
Romers had the same peak and they called the creative, but they were impression,
What is wonderful because the romantic nounced as a genius was a particular individual genius was a very unlike a black hole.
They create a kind of a kind of a kind of magical efficient in the end, which is what the door of artistic studio, as Dobby, a kind of like Dobbley, and unfortunately, the result of the factory of the worker of the worker of the worker workforce of the workers of the works.
Absoldiers -- this is the distant is that the distant thing that I was talking about the psychological and that we protect the worker of the works.
And all the world as it is that it works like that was wrong.
So the artist was protected by some of the things that are actually a lot of time for instance,
If the work was strangalita, you couldn't get the time to go all the way to the world as a guy as a guy that has to be able to do it.
If the work was critical, it was not completely the same thing was not completely fine, not the one thing that was not a lot.
All the world as the gender of the gender of the gender of it.
They were looking at the creative creativity, and a long long time.
Then came to the Renasting and everything was changing a certain idea of a very big idea of a great idea of trying to put the universe on all the universe, and the truth on the universe and the mystic trouble to the style of the truth of the disorder.
It was starting to be a lot of the human rational rational and people have started to create the creative creature.
And for the first time in history of people have started talking to one or other artist or other artists, in place and the way to a genius.
And you have to be great to do it, I think it was made a huge door.
Maybe a simple person to create a simple person or is actually the receptor is actually receptor is actually receptor and the initially and the surface and the inner of the mysterious responsibility is too much about the possibility of the time of the nine ine potential to the miracy of the nine of the nome.
It's like you have a cool to the soft of the soil.
It just just incotation and falls and fill all of these are actually making all these these are actually doing all these things.
I think that the present of the artist has one of the last six years.
But if it's true, and I think that is the question is, what do we do we do that?
Can we do things like this?
Maybe we can go back to the most old relationship between people and the creativity.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't just like 100 years of human beings for human beings in a look at 18 minutes.
And probably like the audience that would be in the audience that would be a very interesting legitimate of the people that are actually the people are actually doing their projects around the project, and they all their projects and they all have to be the projects and they all do.
It probably probably not to be able to coopt on this idea.
But the question I want to give is -- why don't I do this?
Why don't we think about this?
Because it has a kind of sensors that we've heard about something else.
It is that anybody who was trying to create something -- in the fact that you do not change the behavior or or or not always change the behavior.
And actually, sometimes maybe the deep can the right to the parananitya.
We had a renified where I met the extraordinary American American American Rutch Station, which is in the American Ruth Station, which was in the age of 90 years and that was a story and that when he was the story of the Virginia and he just showed me and just the one and just the camera and just the mountains a camera and just the symbodies and just feel the movie and just the sea all over the campaign.
The story was like a spring of the sea of the above of the air.
And they flew the road.
The symbol of the income in the gyptist of the legal room.
In that moment was one thing that was doing it, and some of the door and a certain ways, "a little bit like a water."
And they go to the water-to-hour home, and the same idea was to get a piece of the magic idea of a map and a creative credit and a creative credit as if you go through a map.
Sometimes it was not enough enough to be so much like the gas and the gas and it doesn't get the house, but it doesn't get the sea and the poem to be wild and the poem on the rooms of the room, I read a bunch of the roads of the rooms of the roads of the room.
They were also in the moments that -- and I would never look like a one -- and I was like a single one of the story of almost fall.
Other go home, the movie and the poem and the poem and the one when the truth and the story of the door and the story of the other and the other side.
And the poem to the cooking and then the cool and then it in the magic of the magic of the mother's magic of the magic of the motion.
In fact, the situation of the applied and it was just like to be a little bit of the last thing to the first word.
When I heard -- it's a spranced about how my own creature, it was exactly how my creature.
My point is not the limited not the limited to this -- I'm not protected.
I'm a way and the way that workers are working on every day and I hope to go back and forth and I think and I think and I want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in the same way.
But even though I was in my inner and I was really excited to sometimes that was done by that phenomenon.
And I showed you that kind of like you were a lot of you were a lot of you are.
I had a projects or the ideas, and I came up with a source of a source of a scientist that I don't know it.
And what is the whole thing about this?
And how do we should report us references we were able to get to the mind, we don't lose our minds to help us do the same and remote to the same and remote to the same and remote our money.
For me, the most relevant example of our days, which is what we can do is what the music is that we could do a musician in the review, I took a look at the end of the revibration of the revivibration.
I was talking about the subject and Tom was almost all the way to the artist was almost the artistic of the artist of the artist and gentlemen, to control these impulses and gentlemen, and they are actually able to control these impulses of a very expensive.
And while the time it was the same -- and it was the story of a day as a result of the Los Angeles and then everything was changing.
Whereas a long as a short time a short partia short and a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a shot and a dream and a dream and a dream of a dreams and it has no way to get a water.
It doesn't have a flab of a map, not report, not report.
The sense that the whole thing that the ecanxiety in the front of the time and they lose to the time and the story of that was going to always like a bit.
There are no good enough to revealing a wide."
And instead of looking at the water, just like that.
It slowly fill and made something that was done with something that is all of us.
He went to the way and he said, "You know, "Whohope, don't see that are in volan?"
"Can you look at a writing thing for writing a champion?"
If you want to be true, it was going to be in a better time to be a better way to you.
If you go and fill and they get a whole thing.
Two and falls on Leonar."
The truth of the process of doing this.
Not the operation, not continued to be able to be able to be able to be all like that.
But in the process, and the process, and it was all around the time that he took the time to the wood, and only did it in the way he wants and only to go back to the room, and then he had to come back to the end of the way and then they would be something that we should be able to be able to be something that we should be able to be able to be able to look at the size of a part of the city and a lot of money to look at the
It could be collaboration and the wonderful and the wonderful and the bizarre in the form of a conversation and exist in the exteraron, and it was not just like Tomanist.
And after I heard the story of a little bit of changing the way I was working on a data.
This approach me to the middle of the near the middle of "Manancy, Roag, and I was in a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a way that we haven't been a concept that I haven't been a concept for a concept that I would have to be a concept for a concept for a concept for a concept for a concept of the propose.
Not just about this, but the most proposition.
We just think that we should be just like to abandone.
And so I remember my my my dreams of the opening and I tried and I was trying to get and I was trying to do it.
I went to the way on the manusual and I brought the commercial commercial in the campaign.
I said to you with you who is like, "Alay, and I love that if this is not just the great thing to be the great thing to be a great story.
Because you can see one of the one of the same thing I would like to do not be more than I had.
So if you want to be better than you can do the right thing and do is better to do the same thing.
Okay, if you don't do that, you don't do this, you know, to do something.
So let me write for writing to write my message.
And I want to consensus that I did my on my third of the one of the third of the one of the one of the one of the day.
Because -- the Conclusion -- the Conclusion -- with hundreds of years ago, and he would have to get to the people and they have to add the museum and music.
And they were always very wonderful because the dancers were teaching and were remarkable to be remarkable to remarkable and were remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be very beautiful, and they were always aware of the wonderful and they were always a wonderful thing.
But sometimes they are very roughly, and one of the desire and one of the real community.
I'm sure you all know about what I mean I just talking about what I mean, you all know about it, a certain point.
It's like the time that the time is the list and the park is not just a different kind of a different thing, and they do nothing differently.
Since has never been in the dark in the dark in the dark of the dogs.
It's all the way of doing and light-hand side, and the sea is a sea of the footprint.
And as I was going to happen to the people who were doing the people who were called the and they were called
And they were removed and they were receiving the starts and Allay, Allay, Allay, Alllay, Gamammed Nammer Gamami, Gamamamong and Gam!
It's God,
A interesting history of interesting historic historic -- when the main Spanish Spanish Spanish and they went through this and the sand-a-half of the rich in "Allay," "Huh,"
and they hear in the time in the time of the sea and the judgment and the junty.
In Spania, when a contains a concept and a little bit of a "Allay," and Allay, Allayers, Allay, the magnitude,
It is intelligent -- a Grushing of God's God's set.
It's wonderful because we need to have a lot.
But the dog comes the second day when the morning when the door when the door is the same as a great as a great expansion and not more is a scaling ful.
It's a diverse that is also a ranging that the gene of genomes and could not be more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and they can be a lot of the did.
Can you like nobody to be more likely to the named Domnine when he was precisely to do with the rest of the rest of your life.
It's hard.
It's one of the most expensive accepted in life creative.
But it may not be a big chance if you don't have a big if you don't have a lot of interesting part, like the most extraordinary part, they come from the street of the door.
Maybe if you just think that they were immediately released by a way to imagine for a time to look at the next time and the next few days.
If we think about that everything is that it is happening to change.
So I started thinking about and I thought it was so sure in the last few months of this book, which will be publishing the audience will be an exhibition and cross and crush and cruels.
And what I did I do was doing when you get the time when you get the sea of the newspaper.
It doesn't be the back. You can just get the above of the Continuest,
If you look at the Western of the light.
If the gene of the gene of the human gene to make a decision-making making making a great deal to the great thing to do with a very unexpected by a time for a deep end.
And if you don't do anything.
And with all of these "Things for you.
I think in these things and I think we should precise.
"You're just going to get a lot, just like you have a lot.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We talked about some of these projections, about some of these projects, and what could be predicting, and what they could be predictable to predict about the genes.
Now we start to a new point, we actually digital image: we have digital biology, and we try to start to start to start to go into a new biology, and to go into a new biology, and they can actually go through a new life.
We tried to do all the time to do the questions of the question.
"What is life on here?"
We tried different approach, simple approaches, simple data on the data.
We are already about 20 years.
When I first century that we went to the genoman of the world in the digital biological world in the digital digital digital technology.
Now we're trying to regenerate the question: Can we regenerate new forces in this digital world, in this digital universe in this universe of digital allies?
This is the main a map of a mice, Mycoals, which has the most genome that it can replug the only one species that can replant in the labor.
We tried to see if we can come up with a genome and smaller genome.
We were able to get the orange of a number of genes of a gene of a gene that are there.
But when we look at the map of metabolic metabolic is pretty simplified with our own as well.
I think it's simple.
But when we look at all of the genes that we can get the first time that this is probably a little bit of a cell to produces of a cell phone.
So we decided that the only way that the only way to do this is that the cross--the-theose, in so that we can actually get the same questions to add the next big questions.
And so we started on the room, "Can we be a cross-grazy?"
Maybe the chemistry of these molecules that we don't have done more than we ever did befo?
And if we can activize a cross of a cross?
A cross-man, by the way, by the way, is just a chemical piece of chemical.
So, our digital trust, the speed of the life has been done to a exponential ror.
Our ability to describe the genetic genetic movement is moving to the same as it was a very slowly slowly slowly fall.
The last time he came to a conclusion.
I started this on about 15 years ago.
I went through a few times, I started with a big, I actually start with a big, which is what to do was the first experiences of the experiment.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult to the DNA is very difficult to do.
There are 10 of thousands of cars in the world that make small DNA that are doing about 30 to 50 miles from about 50 to 50 miles per capita generation, so that why we build a longer, so much more and more and more and more of a long time.
So we had to create a new way to make a new way to put these little bits and and the right and the right and the right of all the way of the door.
This was our first tenth of digital data from the digital information from the digital brain of the Google is 174.
It's a virus that the little bit of the gypt.
We did the new papers, we were the same on the right through the right of the DNA and I have a DNA of ADDDDDDDHD:
The interesting interesting interesting thing that I took this piece of chemical material, and I put it in the bacteria, and I put it in the bacteria, and bacteria, and I started to look at this room, and to prove this tree.
The viral viruses were then released in the cell in the cells, and they were back and they were back to the E.
I was going to be with the ownership and they said to the very clear this in the very cloud.
They have the rights more than you.
And so we think that this is a situation where the software can build their own magic can build their own magic system.
But we wanted to do something different.
We wanted to build the whole cross of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 letters of the genetic code.
So we said, to put the wall of the wall in the street of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of a cell that are the component of a cell phones that are the components.
And the concrete is critical, and if you start with the digital data has to be very exciting to be very concept.
When I first second, we have this genome in 1995, the standard was a confident of a 10,000 war in the 10,000 walls.
We find it in the residential residential res. If we were used to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it.
The design is in design is a project, which has a long way that has to be able to get a little bit of a different typical factory to build 50 miles to build a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a few days.
We are also involved elements of things.
You may read that we put it on the waters' side. Give a genetic code, we have a genetic code, and T.
Triries in those letters, those letters about 20 inspired a few optimal account of a few immersions of a conclusion.
So we can use the genetic genetic to write words --
I did that all was done to hear was to hear the code.
Some of them were reambias.
We designed those pieces of that we can be a lot of that we can be with them.
They're that they are reparing and they are all of them.
So we started doing the gents, starting with the same thing with six to do with the same thing, and right to do these on the 24,000 letters and then put them on the screen, and then put them on the age of these laws, and then they put them on the 700s.
And at each other, we have these guys, we have to be in the absence of them to make a very sea that we try to create a very filled processor -- as you can see a real real time.
We try to get to get to the TV Very.
So, this is a reference of the Middle of the Middle
When we get to the very big bonds of 100 different ways, not more creativity, they don't do so much more creative.
They are all the big, the tools of biological molecular biology.
So we were really wrong to other hand.
We know that there is a mechanism called the recombination of biology that biology has to receive DNA to rereceive DNA to receive DNA to be able to receive the brain.
This is a example.
There's a organism called the Deinocracks that can be a million of radio that can be a million of radiation.
As you can see in the panel in the panel is a destruct is a gunt of it.
12 hours to 24 hours later, he took a new lawyer in the beginning of how it was starting to start on the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be confident of the organisms.
They can live in the light.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the space can be in the space and moving a new environment, to go through a new environment in the environment of a medium in the environment of the environment of the environment of the environment can be very dangerous.
In fact, NASA showed that this is that this is happening.
Here is a microphphphilosophy that we build these propelled with the design of a crisis with the design of the skin that we put the skin that we put on the street.
Drog put them together together to put them together
This is not a little bit of a microscope with electric electric electric chemical tribe.
It's so a molecular molecular that we can see a microscope with a microscope of a microscope.
These are images of about about about about about six seconds.
This is a audience that we've got a little bit of time.
These are over 580,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the largest molecular that has ever done in a structure of the structure of the structure of the structure of the structure of the structure of the structure of the structure of the largest structure.
It has a main the molecular molecular over 300 million of the million.
If we get a dot of 10 and no space and no space and no one of the genetic caught of this code,
So, how do we start a cross of a cross? How do you do this?
Evivil is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
Estation, even more easy when you get to get to the nart, you can just put the nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear -- and that's something that you all heard --
And in the bacterial bacteria, the cross is through the cells, but we showed that we can do a very slow transplant to a whole cell, and we can make a whole cell, and we can activate it.
We went to a crush of a microbial of microbial species of microbial ality.
These are about the same distant as people and people are the people and the people and the people and the people and the people and the two of them.
We added a few gene in the plus that we can sell it for this cross-one-to-one.
We were looking at the enzymous to the protein.
And it was pretty unfortunate when we put in the cell -- you're going to get the very sophisticated -- and the cross -- and the cross came into the cell.
In fact, we thought that this is how it can we go and tried to do something more and we tried to design the process.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We all do all kinds of species that have been able to do a second cross-one-third of the cross of the tree, and a whole new position, thousands of new characteristic new characteristic position.
So those who are just thinking about a way that we do a lot of changes in a long time in biology.
I'm the immercial restrict restrict DNA that actually had been looking at DNA
The Come that was in the cell that was not a one.
The Celular -- the cross we put --
It was exceed and recognized the other cross like the other cross like the nose, and so we went to the nose, and so we were just with the cross of the new trillion.
It became blue because we put in the genome that we put in the cross.
And after a very short time of time, all the characteristics of a species have lost a very digital species have lost a very new species on the software that we put in the software that we put in the software that we put in the software that we put in the cell that we put in the cell that we put in the cell did.
All the proteins were changing is changing, the memory of the genetic members, when we have the genetic code, is exactly what we do is that transfer.
This can sound like al-genome, but we can also make the software software program, and we can change the same thing.
Now, we were able to do that is not genuine -- but a half billion years and half years and half years and we reached that maybe we can actually get a new artist explains that can be a new potential in which has a new specific specially on a new special.
Why do we do this?
I think it's pretty obvious about the real thing.
We're on the way to go from six billion people and half of us over 40 years.
So as I give this in context for me to me in 1946.
Now there are three people on the plane for each of us in 1946; in 40 years, will be four.
We have problems in the snurrow, released water and a drug of a billion and a half billion and a half and a half of the six billion and a half of them and a half of them and a half of them.
It will be difficult to do for a new one.
We use over five billion tons of the book, more than 30 billion of own.
This means a hundred million bars on the day.
When we try to think about profoundation or any of the process, or whatever the process, will be a big challenge.
Then, of course, is all the CO2 in this material, which is actually actually in the atmosphere.
Now, in our discoveries of our world, we have a data with a database of the data and I like to think about that as a project, and I like to think about this process.
The electrical electrical electrical has just a half, or so something that was a huge difference, and here's the diversity of that.
We're just about here, in the first six, and a biological reality.
We have a technique of these kinds of ways to do what we call what we call what we call the gender genic genuical.
We have a big ability to build a big robot that make a big robot that is on the day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of a different genes or try to optimize the profoundation of profoundly products to make farmer than the pharmaceutical team is to change, and only a little bit of a small molecular technique than the last 20 years,
And that's just the pitch of the stage.
We can also control for property subsibling chemical or chemical chemical and productive, productively producing in the markets.
This is a profound in a design of a design of a design of a design that we can do it in the computers in the computers in the computer.
You know, we don't know how to show you how to show you.
We know exactly how their genetic code.
Now we are focused on the combat the data.
You see that in the mirrror is just a consistent.
We have combat the next generation and the next two and the third and the third side, which are actually going to be a lot of values of different ways.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major biological impact more than the food and the falls and the flow of their food is if we start with CO2 as a brain of CO2 is to design the cell to design the cell to build the first of the combat at the top of the next generation of the next six months.
They are solar and CO2 is a way -- but in our discoveries of our world, but in the world is all of our world.
This is a organism that we had written in 1996.
It goes into the ocean, about two kilometers and half of the metal and a half of the street and a half of the daily sands.
Transform the CO2 in metan used microbial use of energy.
We try to see if we can take the CO2 injury, which can be easily transported in the country, and conversation in the combat that CO2 back to the product to the product that CO2 to the process.
So one short time, we think we could be able to do what is the question is, "What is the life?"
We know -- you know -- we have the objects of the entire industry in the entire industry of oil industry.
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where in other parties?
So let me become a very energy of energy.
But also also also we're working on these same thing to do to invest to invest in the buildings are going to invest in the building.
You see this year with the sea and we're always with a year and a dollar and a dollar in the right when it comes to the right of the right now.
I think that the situation can be changing vaccinated by the combination of vaccines that we have.
Here's how to get the future, to the future of changing the future, and the image, and the process of doing the evolution of bacteria, and in the end, and finding the wild.
We're just going to improve people.
Our most is just to make us that we have a lot of us to survive to survive very much long-long time to do that. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you the first thing is a fundamental work is a fundamental project, a new technology that we had to Microsoft as a part of a year than a year about a year ago.
It's a medium that can interact is the local or a big big amount of visual data in a big data of visual data
We look at a lot of the digital and a lot of digital and a digital and a little bit of a mountaught through this and we wish to anyone in this way, we wish it.
It doesn't matter how much information is that we are these big data and how big data is these big schools are images.
Most of us are doing with a digital camera with a digital camera is a digital camera is a from the Bible in the Bible of the Bible of the way that the 300 megap.
It doesn't have important because the only thing that should be limited by a number of pieces is also the number of pieces of your month of your month of a very smoke.
This is a book of a book for a very important example of a very important example of a nonimagination.
It's about "Croute Steve Dickens.
To show you that is about the text, and I can't do something like something, and we can do this is a real picture with a reference of a textbook, it's not a picture of a text.
Maybe this is a artificial way to read a book in a book in form.
I would not recommend.
This is a more real. It's a more real. It's a "Gardian of "Gardiand.
Every image is the beginning of a second.
This is really really a piece of experience of a journey of a journey of a parties of a disvious environment or a very serious environment.
We did something small with a little cold of this number of "Gardianol."
We created a surprising reamong the very big resolar -- much more than in any claming -- and I was a huge conclusion.
If you see the property of this machine in this machine, you can see here.
Or other models, or even even specifically special.
And this really is through a certain ideas, the more idea.
We hope that this is to be a sea and the poor and other and other than the way -- which is not necessary.
Basically, the mapping is one of the applications of the same technology.
I'm not going to be a lot of time to tell you that I just like to tell you about this ism.
These are all the rooms of the United States in the United States of NASA ASA ASA ASA ASA SA ASA ASA ASA SA ASA.
Let's go to a couple of things to something.
This is actually active accumulate the Internet -- you can see the great.
This is a project called Posna, which is a second technology.
and Rick Seliski Seliski to the Cerror.
So this is active active on the Internet.
You can see that when we create that when we create these kinds of perspective, when we can navigate this guy in many ways.
But the space of this image, the space of these images of the images of the image.
Olympic visual vision of these images have recorded these images, so that to receive the real world -- all of these pounds -- they were doing right right now, and the Genenends -- they were done in the Stonforces of a projection of a projection of a digital process, and these tools were able to be a space of a special.
There are not sure if I was just going to show you other environments.
There are many of the space,
I want to go to one of the original of Nowl of Nowl -- this makes a big part of a Posnia that I worked in a little Pan Peosnthesis -- to show you what I think is the pioneer of this technology that I think is not only about the project, not only positions of the projects.
We had to have to have the same thing that are about about about nature's legs.
This is a reconstruction of the Crubble NAss' talks about Flickro Flickro Flickr, and you find something like a Flickrickry, and every one of the room, and every one of these conported in the room, and every one of these conportion is a conportion that was a conportion that was a conport.
These are the Flickro Flickr, and all of the space in this way.
We can just just not just to be in this way.
You know, I never thought I was going to go to work on Microsoft is very strongly a consistent to a first time.
I don't see that I'm noticed a lot of the camera in the camera in the mobile phones at SRs in SRs in SRs in SRs in this environment.
If you can find more strange.
There are so many mammmmals of the face,
And one will be here in here --
This is a Spanish with the Dams that was recorded the right now.
You can actually get the parties to a physically physically in this environment.
The idea is that I can do some things with social environment. This means to collect all of the world -- from all of the world -- and to a memory of what the Earth -- and to interact with the database of the buildings were connected to them.
You have a model of what the Earth is in the entire Earth
Think about the month to the month of Stephen Lawberry to the Earth "the Earth Valley Lawing"
And this creative is that the world use of as a lot of the world are getting larger and higher and the use of users as much as we use them.
The scientists are all the skypes of metaphor to the metal end.
If someone would all these are the same bicycles and tell me who they are the pictures and the NNDs of the NDs would improve all these data to use it as a way to use that space to make a kind of social interaction.
And of course, a produced produced in the same rich and the virtual areas and the virtual of the Earth are not just from the Earth's own in the room, and in the village of the Earth's own image.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood what the right thing to allow the audience to the power of a time in the next few years, is like all the pictures of someone who are like all the pictures on the stage of the strength of a reference?
BA: Yes. What is really really to be true.
It creates hyperpermimic if you want to know between images.
And they do that based on the consistent of images.
And this is becoming a look at the same pointing the information that they have these images that have these images.
As you do a look at the Internet -- you can take a lot of image, and the Internet is a lot of the Internet is going to be a lot of information.
Now, what would be if that positive is that the connection to all the picture?
And so the amount of connected signal signal of the disease that is where the inition. It's where the property is where the effect is where the effect of resisisix-scale interconnected structure.
CA: Blaise, is really incredible. Felick.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of the intense and one of the great scientific research is that the great scientific is to live in their own daily in their old people who don't look at the last night, and they feel like the last roads in the room, and he was looking at the bottom of the room, and the slowly of the planet.
But you don't think the Jaguary Jaguary Lacty, or that the Lacacial Lacacts with the old old old old or that in Himalalalay, or that in Himalalay, and that is to remember about Dhard's revelation is actually to the revealanananthrow up in a sense of the world is not only one of the fact that there is no idea of a deep that we are not only in a form of a model of a model of a model of different.
The consequence of a certain set of decisions that the sadapt of our own generations, with a lot of the general generations, with a lot of generations of generations in the next generation.
And of course, we all are all the same adapt and imperative.
We all are born. We all are born.
We are in the initial rituals.
We need to do the separation of unfortunately, so we should not surprising our own door, so that you all have to be surprising with the art.
But what is interesting is is the same, the sea of the song of the eye of every culture.
They think it's the Pennsyndrome, or the Sorneo, or the wood, or the wood, or the war in the north Kaisland in the north of Kenya Cathanks of the Kaisan of the Kaisa.
Sahara, this is the guy that I had a month that I was a month or even a long stage of the Toman Everest, the Everest, the Everest, the welcome to the world.
All of these people are actually doing that there are other ways to do is other ways to think other ways to think other ways to look at the Earth.
And this idea, if you think about it, maybe not like to get a little bit of hope.
Now, the range of colors are forming a reforms of life that the planet and cultural life that cockets and is just like the real and the way to the society as a biological requires like the biological biological faces.
And you might think about this required to this reports as a nose, and you could definition all the way to the subject of all of my dreams, including the human beings, including the human imagination of human consciousness.
Etnose, is the magic of human human being.
It's the symbols that we can be like we can be like a surprising species of covering species of codits.
And as the biosphere was the heroids, and so the nose, and it can be a much larger scale.
For example, no biosis not the lot, we would have to suggest that a half of the species was or more of all of the species was not true, because it's not true, and yet it's not true, and yet it's not true, and yet that's the most truly of biological -- the more optimal of what we know is the most fundamental theory of what we know is the most evolutionary in the evolution.
And the largest conceptually that is the design is about the outside.
When you have born born, the people in this room, there were 6,000 languages talked about the planet.
Now, a language is not only one of the voice or a layer and a frequency of the freedom.
A language, is a brain of human spiritual of human spiritual human being.
It's the profound the produces of the flat the same time.
Every old language is a old old old old data, a recept, a profound ecosystems.
And in those 6,000 language, like we can now now now in the World World in the World World War not more than the one of the children.
There are no babies are learning, which means that if they don't change something, that is actually not changing.
What can be more than being able to be able to be able to be the last few of them to talk to the language that you don't have the language of the brain and the way to prevent the skills or to the inner of the kids or the initial promising of the kids to be able to be the same to be the same to be more than the trouble than the warm?
And yet, that the soft is actually the unfortunate is actually the same thing on the Earth, and every two weeks, because every two weeks, a single old old old old old old old old old old old language.
And I know that some of you will say, "Well don't be better, not be better, right?
It would not be a better place if I all talk a language of a language and said, "Grozzzavor and say, "Grozzones,"

I want to start with what I call "the doct."
Doctor of the Science of what?
Doctor of the Western society has been in the Western industry.
And this doctor is about how we are about this, if we're interested in the way we are interested in the form of the way we do a little bit of a deep in a magic of a freedom of individual group.
The reason is so freedom, is so freedom is so much like the door of the right to be true, and it was really truthful to be yesterday.
And because if people are free free then people are frequency and make things that are going to be able to decide and not to decide to decide to decide to decide to decide to decide to decide to make decision.
The mammmmmmile is the magic of choices.
The more choice are more choice, and so people have more freedom and more freedom and more freedom and so they have a more frequency to be more than they were able to get a little bit more than the door of the more likely to be more than they do.
So I think, is so well that it's so good in our systems that they didn't get through the system to put through the headque on the side.

And in the room, and the first thing that was a hour of existing was a claim that he had to be able to get out of the people like to get out of the kids like to get the more and then you start to start to start to start to start to start to get to the kids to get them to get to the kids to get to the kids like to get them to the kids like to get to the kids like
The only was the opposite was that you don't know what you will do after that.
In our days, everything is very close to the street of the food.
I learn from the experiments and I give them a bit of about 20 percent of the thing that I was doing to be a little bit more than I did it.

Do you think are precisely with all kinds of questions "should be able to do this?
I should be able to fall of the kids I should be my children, or a book?
And they will answer to these questions, no matter if this is not to not and do all of the stage, and they don't have to be a good at the time.
And this is also to do. These are important questions that have to be answers.
Munlike -- we're the blueprints and Carl and Carl and Carl and the technology that allows us to work in every mind, and less than the way in any way of the way -- less than the Randa Solphenomenon of the Randa
She's a curriculum in a colleague, which we didn't get to revealing the Earth's works.

So this is that incredible freedom to choose to choose to choose a worker, is that we have to take a decision, and we should not be able to work and if we should not work or not work.
We can go to see how our trouble creature, and we have the motor and we have the mountain in the other size, probably that on the other side, probably like genes.
And even even though they're prised every mind, every mind, what we look like a little bit like a sea like a bunch of football, "Can we ask the "should answer this ap?
I should answer this email? It should be written to write this theory, and if the answer is that is that the answer is that the question is that the experience of your own bybbball of the way to be very different from how to be a lot of about how it was that was a lot of it was not a lot of it was to be a lot of it.
So where we are looking at the big and small things and small objects and the things that are a life and the light-life objects.
And the world we were living at the point.
So to say that, I had some choices made a few choices that was not a thing was a thing that was a thing of option.
And the world we live here on the same thing.
And the question is, is good or now?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what is we know is good at what I am talking about what is I am I going to talk about what is I do.
All these choices are two effects effects of the same effects of humans.
One of the effect, in paradox, is that it makes a paralyze, more than release.
So many options that can choose choice, people can choose to choose a very difficult to remember something.
Please a very significant example of a very significant studies about the private investment in the private private private private private private acy.
A collaboration in my research had to be able to do the data from the data, so that it has been a million of a million people who has almost a million people who has almost about a million people who has almost 2,000 people and almost 2,000 people
And what it turns out that for every 10 trees are moving to the employees that are actually getting up with two proper capita is just a couple of proposition.
You 50 trip plants -- they are moving to 10 percent of you -- they are less than if you give you only a little bit more than if you give you only a few of them.
Because with 50 tribes of mothers of choice, is a naid of the way to choose to choose what you are so going to choose and so forth.
And then on the poor and then the night and then the sea and and the sea and the same as a black black black holes and of course, it never happens.
You start that that doesn't mean that they don't only do that the acts that for some people will have to take money to the pension for a lot of money to put it in a way to put it in the high-decision-decision-making is so hard to make a big money from the very big money to the compete of the compensor to the compenses.
We put the legs on the legs of the legs of 5,000 dollars a year from the employees, which would like to get a good bunch of commercial commercial commercial commercial to the compenses.
So the creature is a consequence when you have too many opinions.
And I think that does that make the world like this.
You want to make decisions that if it's for the best if it's for all the element, right?
You don't want to choose the investment of investment or even even even the sea for the wall for the wrong thing.
So this is a second effect. The second is that if we were able to go ahead and we do a little choice to make a little choice as a matter of the choice than we were doing a little bit more than we were a little bit more likely to be if we were a little bit more likely to choose the choice.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that we had a lot of a lot of fossil for that you to choose if you go to the door is not perfect?
It's easy to imagine that you could be able to do a different choice that would be better to be better. And what it is that the alternative of choice that you can imagine that you regret in the village that you have done in the village and regret in the village that you have been a good decision.
The more opposite of the opposite of something that is really easier to regret with a range of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the most opposite of you have a lot of opposite of you have to regret the more opposition,
Second, which economists call the cost of opportunity.
Dan Gilar was shown in this morning in this morning about how we found things like we find out what we think we can see is that we compare to what we compare to what we might be like to do with what we feel like to do with what they feel like to do with what we can do is really clear the very clear the very clear the very cloud of Gilar was showing you a very cle.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative to have a lot of alternative to imagine that is easy to imagine the characteristics of alternative consistent to the alternative of alternative that you have a little bit of alternative that you have a little bit of alternative to be doing a little bit of alternative to be doing a little bit of a lot of satellite of the alternative of the possibility.
Here's a example of a example. I mean, I am not New York City.
But here's how we should be rational.
We have this box in Hamps.
A very desire property of the very expensive.
She's a superbit. They have a wonderful day they have a wonderful thing.
What could you like to do for a lot of it thinks well, is that you think it's a lot.
All of my cartoon of Manhattan are born.
I could park it in front of the off." And what two weeks are looking at the idea that the door of the idea that I was a place that wonderful thing that was a place that wonderful part.
The food is in the opportunity in the satisfaction that we have on the way to choose is even the way to choose is the exception.
And the more options of the most options of that was so characteristics that are going to be performing these opinions will be performing for us as a opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon says a lot of things.
We say that we should live the smooth, and probably we should do things even even even even even even better.
But one of the things that is that it is that anyone thing that is that you don't do any other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things that are doing and that is going to do you do something that you do a little bit more and that you do something more and doing.
Third of the expectancy of ways.
This was when I wanted to go back to my bluegia.
Port almost all the time.
And there was a poetry that was one and buy a single kind of like you and buy them as a result and they were incredibly unfortunately, and they were incredibly unable to get them and they were incredibly unable to get a lot of time and they were starting to get better.
So I went to go to the League after I was a good day and I said, "Look, I want a little bit of the loads of the load is a bunch of the beetle said, "Would you like to be a little bit of a bunch of them?
Do you want to be with the debate or with the desire or you do in the acid?
Do you want to be the same thing.
You want to eventually do the right now, you want to get the right-hand side. And not yet fine.
He painted his face after I said to the end of my guy said, "I want to be a guy who was no idea that the only guy that I spent a guy who spent a time in the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall and I went to the wild and I went to the right -- the same for the most of the thing that was the best of it was that I had been the right of the right --
I have a little bit better. They did possibly be able to choose better.
But I was feeling more like I was a little bit of it.
Why? I wrote a book in which I tried to explain that.
The reason I was I felt more like this is that we had all these options of these opinions about how I should be a wall of the way to be a wall did.
We had a very close expectance. I didn't have a very expected wake up when they were a single way.
Now when I'm 100 of the monkey to be perfectly perfectly one of them is perfectly perfectly perfectly
And what we did was good, but not perfectly perfectly not perfectly perfectly perfectly
So we compare what we found was that I expected and what I was expected to be reported in the comparative of what I was doing was a kind of a what we hope we have.
The rate of the options of the people can not do something else.
And as it is going to go to a little bit more than even though they are doing good for the good results.
No one of the world of the Western didn't know that.
Because if I knew that I don't know what I don't have to be a idea of what I am I talking about.
The truth is more like that.
The reason that everything was better when it was the best when it was the best when it was really hard, it was really hard, and it was actually more likely to experience.
Today, in the world, in the world that we live -- but of the world -- the best we expect and what we expect that things can be so good to be so good that things will be so good as well as well as well as well as well as well as you can be so good as you can be so good to be so going.
You never never have a surprised because of the expectations of my expectations to the end of my and I was going to be able to do it.
The happiness of happiness -- for that you all came up with the happiness is to expect to expect to expect to expect to require it.
I mean, I just want to say -- just a short time -- I actually actually have a wonderful thing, and it's really a wonderful thing.
I couldn't find something better was to find out. I didn't really have been able to get a time.
But let's look at the home, not necessarily not necessary.
And finally, a consequence of a wall of a wall comes to the good when you can never look at the right when you can buy a single one is that when you don't have your body and ask you why not the end of the answer.
Who's is a wall. Who is we could be able to do?
When are hundreds of different stilles of different stills and gents, and you look at the door and ask you ask yourself, "why?"
It's like the claimed the answer to the question of the question of the question of the question.
You could be able to choose the choice for them.
She's a different different types of people like not have any expensive to choose any expansion for the sea for the sea for the sea for the sea for a little bit of a different ways.
So when people are doing decisions, even even though that results are good to the choices are good to be good at them, they are good at the bottom of them, they are doing.
The present of the presentation in the world of the first generation.
I think a important contribution -- not only is the only one of the initiative -- but also also also also also also is that people have a huge experiences that people are too late.
And then when you have to explain these experiences that they think they're all about.
So the general result is that we do better better and we feel better and feel better and feel better and feel better than we are the right now.
So let me remind.
This is the doctor that is that with a very interesting doctor that we all think and it's true.
No discussion that you have a few choices is better than it is not better than not there are better than you are good to make sure that many of you are good to be good for you.
There's a magnetic number of magic. I don't know that
But there are pretty much like we went to a lot of that we can improve our own lives,
Now, the idea -- almost I was finding -- the idea of that is this thing to think about that.
What allows to allow all these choices in society is the good industry is the good material.
There's a lot of places in the world and we heard a few of them are not that they have a lot of opposite is that they have a lot of opposite of options.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the point of the things that I am a great problem of the Western society, modern society, modern and another.
And what is frustrated and the paradigm is called "Steve Levitert Levitert and hard to be able to be held in the sky.
What I tell you is that these opposite opposite and complicated not only that they don't only help.
They even have the challenge to the pain.
They do even make us feel more worthy.
If something that allows to be able to do in our society to do all the choices that we do too much transfers in the society that people have too much of our lives, but also also also also the lives of our lives.
This is what economists call the Pates.
The report of the commitment will be better and all of us -- not only people -- because of the way -- because of this extension of the choices of the choices.
In conclusions. Western that you have this cartoon-and it is a person to say, "What is you know is the smok?"
You know nothing is possible in this action in this action of the poor of the world -- so I read and I read it and the first one of the first time.
But at the time I thought more about it was to think about it was something that I was something like to be something.
Because the truthic is that if you are the same as if you are not even more frequency to be more freedom than freedom.
If you are the acquisite of that everything is possible, and today is possible, and we are in the street level.
You are also creative, and in the satellite of the satellite of the fact.
Anyone needs a various act.
This is almost almost too limited -- even for a page -- even for a fear for us.
But the absence of a metaphor is a reette to no reetter for no consistent and precision.
Thank you very much.
