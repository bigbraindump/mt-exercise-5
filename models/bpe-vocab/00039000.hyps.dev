In the year I showed these two degrees to demonstrate as the entire polar polar that the majority of the last three million years of the last three million years was the size of 48 million years old.
But this mornity of this specific issue because it doesn't look at the grass.
The polar polar is, in a way, the heart of global climate system.
It's extending to extend the summer.
And the next slide that I'm going to show you what happened in the last 25 years.
The pemancy is the marcaught.
As you can see the blue of blue inke.
This is the annual for the year.
And it turns out the summer.
By named the guess of a five-year-old, you can see that it's almost almost as you can see that it's almost almost almost like a body.
In 25 years he came from this one, at this point.
This is a problem because the quotion of the skin around the oceans around the ocean.
where it is a massive amount of carbon carbon sweet that when they disgusting, it's transformed in the micro-organisms.
Compart with the pollution of global warming in the atmosphere of the atmosphere, if we move this extreme if we go on this particular point of the extreme.
Of course, in certain lacks in Alaska metaphors of metaphor.
The Katey Walter Katey Walter was on the University of Alaska little terescue with another lab at the past.
Wo! Al Gore: Of course, the question is OK if we're going to be.
And one reason is that enormous word "a" is Ground is the Groends in the cloud.
This is a race that everybody.
But the volumes are much larger.
This is Kangerusal Kangernel Groenland.
If you want to know how it creates the steps of the roots on the road.
These debate very quickly.
And at the other end of the planet, Antarctica, Antarctica on the planet.
The last few people are reported in the continent of the continent of the continent of the Antarctics of Antarctica, and the Western islands on the islands.
This is the equality of seven feet in the sea level like in Groenland.
In Himalaya, the third of the third of the third side, you see the new shape, you go through a few years ago that we were lucky.
40 percent of the population of the world, you get half of the water in these topirs.
Today, this guess is the source of the water.
And the way they grow.
But when they disappeared.
In California was a 40-percent spring spring in Sierra.
This affects the water.
And the predictions of them, as you read are serious.
By the entire global cloud credit to a dramatic credit of incentives of incentives of incenties.
And the disasters of the whole world grew up with an absolutely extraordinary rate,
four times more in the last 30 years in the last 30 years of those 75 years.
This is an absolutely unsustainable.
If you look in context you can see what happens.
In the last five years I added 70 million tons of carbon dioxide every 24 million tons every day.
Look at the end of the state of Pacification in America, walking up to the Western Indian where is a radical strength of the oceans.
The biggest because the only one of the global warming global global warms, which present about 20 percent of the fossil of fossil fuels.
The bottom is a problem and the chart is the most seriously.
The United States is one of the two big empowerment of China.
And the proposal was to build a lot of manufacture for goods.
But we're starting to see a change.
Here are the ones that have been assisted in the last few years of proposal.
Everybody, there is a police in our country.
And the carbon and industry and the oil has spent a hundred billions of billions of dollars in the last year.
They promoted what it is an hour.
And this image of a reminder of something.
In the practice of Cracial Tenness, a billboard billion.
You've probably seen the style.
This is, on all of the print, the second big dealing in America has changed.
One of the clames of the skills of Cracial industry, it was this.
Video: ♫ ♫ Frosy, it's a song with the goals, it's a happiness.
He's from abundance, here in America, and held economics.
Froy, with the career, becomes good, it becomes more curated.
It's accessible and adorable workers rescuing their jobs.
Al Gore: This is the key source of Virginia in Virginia.
The biggest one of the largest degree of Massey of Massey Coal.
Video: Don, Don Blankenship: Al Gore, Nania Pelosi, Harry Rei.
Al Gore: So the same as Alic Protect Climate has launched the second campaign.
This is one of them, one of them.
Video: Actor: The COALergy new climate changes like a very serious threshold.
That's what our main is to spend a great amount of money for the audience that can help us show us the truth to help us and the truth of good.
The truth is, in fact, the cars is not did.
We think that it is -- and it's cool.
So you're not going to get for climate change.
You can see that ourselves.
Video: Actortually, you heard a graduate about it.
So let's take a check of this task, for installation of installation.
Oh yeah! Masinaria is about noise.
But this is the sound of the coal.
And while the books are the goal is one of the global warming technologies of remarkable technology that you see here.
Look at this point, this is the technology of goodness of the goal.
Al Gore: In the alternative advantage with the economic challenge of the economic challenge with national security.
Video: Narrator: Narrators, economies, economic security crisis.
The approach that you get to all the dependence on the bottom of the carbon: cooking cooking cooke.
But now we have a new solution to the notion of the cloud.
You get America with 100 percent of the classroom, in 10 years ago, in 10 years ago.
A plan to put America's job, and you can do more signs, and to help us stop global warming.
In the end, a solution that is to help us solve our problems.
You get America. You get America.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: Narrator: It's about the re-energy.
One of the quest of the fastest way of the old combat of the old combat our plane that we killed our planet Barby, the Like Barbye here is a new energy of energy.
Barrived, we invested in order to create jobs.
Narrator: Come America. It's time for action.
Al Gore: There is an old reverse: If you want to go quickly, if you want to go fast, you go away.
If you want to reach it, you go on.
We need to get it fast.
Thank you very much.
The year at TED I did an introduction to LHC.
And I promised to come back and give you a data.
So here's my mom. And for those who hasn't here, LHC is not the largest scientific experiment that was asked by the 27 kilometers -- Cumfertilizers or is to recreate conditions of a billion times as a fraction of a billion times of a fraction of a second.
It's extremely expensive.
This is the Geneva.
We do the photographs of these minds of "Big Bangs" within the decades.
I work on this one.
On the 10-year-old, I went out for the first time.
And this image was done by ATLAS.
It causes a huge celebrity in the room.
This is an image of the first cycle of particle that looked at the LHC, crossing the LHC, crossing in the LHC deliberately in the detector.
In other words, when I saw that last 10 I knew that one of the seven, which is an enormous successes.
I don't know if it got the largest own, or that, when someone went to Google and see that the first page.
It means that we did a cultural impact on a scientific impact science.
And after about a week I had a problem with the device, which actually had to do with these songs.
Their transportation transport 13 thousands, when the device goes to the maximum.
Now, engineers are looking at these songs and say, "You cannot transport the flaws. I can't transport the a."
But I can do this because when they are expensive temperature.
So as a 271 degrees of the steps between the steps of the steps can transport these bodies.
At one of the layers of the LHC, was a LHC, it was a facility.
And so that the first, and those 13 thousands, and those 13 thousands.
That was the result.
This is more impression of these magnetic magnetic magnitude.
So I had about 50 magnetic magnitude.
We had to take the outside, which is what I do.
I represented it everybody, I repart.
And now we take the magnetic and then in subterance.
He was at the end of the marginal mark of the LHC will be as new as well.
We're going to start again, and we're going to get this data in a data, and we're going to continue to find out that are the tools of the universe.
Now, of course, those accidence accidence of the importance of the importance of science and engineering the extreme.
And I think that it is so hard to be so hard to find the fact that we have young people like LHC.
So I'm going to lose the words of a scientist of British Davy, Humphrey Davy, which, I think, when the experiments of the protection of the protection of the protection of human mind, he said, "Nothing for human minds of human minds are not the sense of our minds are finding human beings, that are not the human beings, that are not finding ourselves, and as we are not finding the world as we havene."
Thank you.
I want to start with the reminder of the childhood, when you play with the box.
And as you invent them to come up with them and take them and take them and get them and get them to look at how to figure out how to figure out how to figure out how to understand the spaces.
The hope is profoundly professor of how we understand a big part of the world.
So, in the quality of I.T-inspired by this kind of the physical interaction with our physical objects -- impressing my physical objects, and my colleague, my Jeevan Kaliens -- I was starting to traveling a computer, whose if we use a computer, what would be able to use a mouse with a mouth with a mouth with a mouthful of digital display with an ection that if we can be able to go and see if we can be able to watch and see if we can put it in a be.
What do you want it?
And the question of that was so fascinating as we hocked the answer to the research.
In the short, Siftable is an interaction of the size of a biscket.
They can be manufacturing, they can perceive them, they can perceive the mission of one another, and they have a screen and an radio wife.
The most important is that I'm palpits, so you can see the game, you can only get it to the game.
And Sifting the examples of a new ecosystem of manipulation of digital manipulation.
On the practice of what these instruments are getting more and more and more and more and more of our missions of each other, and we can begin to explore new things, we can begin to explore new styles.
I'm going to start with simple example.
This Sify is configuring images of video, and if you include it by a movie, if you include it in the other hand, if you include in the other hand.
These are the interactive interactive of each other.
So, if I put them one langer, they become interested.
If they are uncontained and this is going to be a little bit of confusion.
You can also feel the mission and inclining.
And we realized that one of the interesting implications of interaction is that we can use the shadows that you can use the data, like to manipulate a cold cold in a liquid liquid in a liquid liquids.
In this case, we have three Sypes that yesterday and they can use them to use it in the center in the center where they are going to mix.
If we go too much, we can get a little bit of back.
There are also interesting possibility for education, such as a visual game, mathematical game, mathematical and logical things that we want to give people the possibility of trying to see the outcomes.
So here I -- this is a Fibonaces that I do with a simple program.
So here we have a game game of the words, a kind of combination between Scrabs and Boggles.
Basically, every single one letter of you have a letter on every Sweet Sweet you try to formed, and formed, they are green with a dictionary.
Then, after about 30 seconds up about 30 seconds, and you have a new set of letters, and you have a new set of letter and new possibilities.
Thank you.
These are the kids who come to the children who came to the Middle Media, and I came up with them and filmed them a material.
They liked them to crazy.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of instructions.
All you have to say is "From the word," and they know exactly what to do.
Here are other people who are asking them.
This is the most taneously testing in our right.
It turns out that everything he wanted to do was to do with each other.
So for him.
This is an applied of animals.
We wanted to build an instrument for the people who invent language.
And this is Felix.
He can introduce new characters in the stage, only raise of those Scamps,
That's where the sun.
Video: The race.
David Merrill: Now he introduced a stage.
Video: Tractor.
Very good.
And when Sifests and selling each other, he can make their characters -- Video: Video: Ham!
DM: And by creating the narrative.
Video: OK.
DM: It's an open story, and he decided, and he decided.
Video: Helloa!
DM: And the last example that I have time to show you today is an instrument of created and interpretation that I built a recently where we built the role of sounds like being role and everybody.
Each of those four different variations that you want to use it.
And you can inject the sound of a succession that you can see when you get the kind of time.
The sophisticated sounds like a Sweet Street Sweet Stag.
There are some of the effects that you can probably reverse and the filter and the video.
You look at a certain point of sound, and then including it to help.
Take the effects of the general and the volume and the volume of the same.
Video: DM: We're going to start with a rhythm in the second Switzerland, I was arrived in a serious place.
Now, I put a basic line.
Video: DM: And I add the perpeace.
Video: DM: And I'm now going to add the filter to control.
Video: DM: You can get the whole sequence of inclined inclined in a part or another.
Video: I'm going to think about the bonding filter for more expression.
Video: DM: You can do the resequence.
So I don't have to do the plan, you can improvise, assuming or short from the word.
Now, the end, I can receive the entire century using sequencing me to use my volume, inclined me.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is the creation of new interfaces that we are better with our brain.
And today, I had time to show you a coordination of this new hope of design, and some of the possibility that we try to get from the lab.
The way I wanted to retina is like we are at the new generators with this new generation of interaction with the digital interactions that will bring information in our world.
Thank you very much.
These are the nerve to talk about.
I am writing.
He described the book is my teacher, but it is, of course, more than that.
It's all my love and fascinating and fascinating.
And I don't think that this is to change.
But, these are saying, something like strange in my life, and in my career and in my career who determined me to require my work with work.
And the strange thing is like I wrote this book, this self-biography, which is called Manancy, Rageste," which, categorizing for any of my books in the world for some of my books in the world for some reasons, and it became an important international.
The result is that anywhere I go now, people go now, people treat me as a confused to be confusion.
Serios -- convictes; it's convicted."
Could you like ingrights, and you say, "You don't be your mind -- you don't want to be your performance?
Don't you want you to write your life on your whole life of your life that will ever create the time that you ever go on the world on the world you ever have?"
It's very clear --
But it was even more likely to remember if I don't always remember 20 years ago, when I was trying to get people -- when I was a teenager -- I want to become write, I want to become written as a kind of Africa, I hit the kind of Africa.
And people would say, "You know, you don't have any more of successful?"
Don't you know that humility will kill you?
Don't you know that your entire life in this field of your life in this field, and nothing will be going to be in a dream of a dream of dreaming with the mouth of the flow?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the short -- the answer to all those questions is "Yeah."
Yes, you feel like all of those things.
And I always find.
And you get your mind in the full of other things that people don't have any other things that you can't reach them.
Like algorithms and other things that are crying.
But when you look at what I thought I was still interested in the last time I was like, "What?"
Is it a ration?
It's the logic to anyone in the work that I feel like that they feel like that they feel that they were destroyed.
And what is the specific initiative initiatives that seems like we truly our own mental mental mental illness in a way that other teachers don't do it?
My father was an engineer, for instance, and you don't remember as one of the 40-year-old chemistry to be asked, if you don't ask someone if you don't have a chemist.
It wasn't happened -- John, how does the block of the chemical?
It's just not happening.
But to be honest, engineering chemists, as a group of not too qualified in the century to be alcoholes.
We are written as a reputation, and not only writers and not only writes, but the artists, it seems like this reputation to be straightforward.
And everything we have to do is look at the number of dead, in the 20th century, in the 20th century, in the 20th century, which they died by young people and often died by young people and often died.
And even those who hasn't been suicide to be true.
Norman Mailer, even before I did, in the last interview, he said that "Every careful."
A great great great great great thing about your work on a living.
But not the cloud when you hear anybody knows that because I heard these things like these things and somehow to absorbed and somewhere in the collective, the idea that creativity and suffer and suffered as the creativity, it will always lead to the purpose.
And the question I want you to add all of you here today is you: Are you all impacts with this idea?
You are comfortable with it -- because as you can see as the eye -- I don't care about this hypothese.
I think it's stop.
And I also think it's dangerous, and I don't want to see it in the future.
I think it is better if we encourage to try.
And I know about that, in my case -- in my situation -- I would be very dangerous for me to begin to start my career, particularly about this hypothese, particularly as a circumstances I find a professional.
As for instance, I am pretty tank, I just just about 40 years.
I have probably four decades of the work for four decades.
And it's very likely that everything I would write with this moment to be judged by the time that the work that came after my successful of my last book, right?
What I would say to the mention of the men, because of all of us -- it's very like.
Oh, God, what shame.
This is the kind of gas that could do anybody to go to the gin to the next morning, and I don't want that person.
I want to make this message that message that I love.
And then the question, what?
And so it turns out, my friend of meditation, as manipulation I have to work now, to continue to try to create a kind of psychological construction, right?
I mean, I had to find a way to look at a safety of a safe, and my graduate from my graduate that will be in the room, which is going to be able to what write.
And as I got the last year in this sense, I started to look at this sense, and I tried to try to see other societies if you could have better ideas of how to be able ideas of how to be held new risk of creativity.
This research took me in Greece and Roma and Roma and Rome.
So you get the circle of the circle.
But, in fact, ancient Rome and the ancient Rome and the people who don't think that creativity in the humans, right?
People thought that creativity was a spirit was a spirit of the people in a source of people in a source and unintellectual reason.
They call these spirits of these spirits of creative creativity.
Socratic was famous because he believed as a demon which is that the intelligence of the wise.
Romans had the same peak, but they call that spirit creative, imaterials.
What is great, because the romantic genius didn't believe that a very special individual genius.
They thought a genius was like a kind of magical entity entity in the walls of artist's studio as Dobby, as Dobby, that Dobby, the spirit of artist's work, and the artist of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the workplaces.
Absolid sold -- this is the distance that is the distance that I talked -- that the psychological construction of your works.
And everybody's worked, right?
So the artist was protected protected by things like this, for example, too much narcision, right?
If your work was stralucracy, you cannot take the whole world for her, the world that you have this genius as you have.
If your work was critical, it was not completely the wind, isn't it?
Everybody's genius as the genius.
So they looked at people in the West creativity for a long period of time.
And then it came Renasting and everything that has changed, the idea of the great idea, the idea that the man on the center of the universe, and the mysteries and mysteries that receiving the mystery of the mysteries that receive from diving.
It was slowing human beings, and people started to believe that creativity as the credit creativity.
And for the first time in the history of people began to refer to each other between artists, instead of a genius.
And you have to marvely, I think it was a heritage.
You can see, a simple person, a simple person, and it is actually the receptor is actually the receiver and the spring of the mystery and source of the mystery is a little bit of four-foot psychological responsibility for the fragile.
It's as if you ask your wife.
It's just incovering and deforms of it, and generating all these kind of fisheries.
I think that pressure that our artist killed us one by the last 500 years.
And if it's true, I think that is, the question is, what do we do?
Can we do?
Maybe we can go back to the older of the relationship between people and the creativity.
It may not.
Maybe we can't just run 500 years of a human ancient thinking about 18 minutes.
And you probably find out there in the audience that would raise your legitimate questions on the field, in fact, the people present in the field and all their projects and all their projects and all the time.
You may not be able to cooperate on this idea.
But the question I want to ask is -- why not?
Why don't we think about this?
Because it makes the same sense of as much as we have heard about the explanation of explanation of creative process.
And it turns out that anybody has been trying to create something -- basically -- you know, you know, it's not the behavior.
And in fact, sometimes you can look at the right paranormal.
I had a way that I met where I met in the American American Ruth Station, which now has been over 90-year-old, which has been the bridge, and what he told me that when my childhot told me when my childhood is going to work on the room, and he just heard a bridge, and he just heard a bridge.
The story that was like a spot of the spring of the air.
And it turns out of the road.
The sense of income, because you see the fishing of the bottom of the leg.
At that point, it has one thing to do, and that's what it is, like, "Wauck."
And he walked up to the home, and the whole idea, and the whole idea was to get a piece of the map of the map of the map of the map and go through it and go through it and put it on the map.
Sometimes it was not enough enough to go and running and running and running and running and walking through the house, and the bridge, and the bridge, and she loss his roots the roots, and I quote it on the room, and I read "another poet."
They were also the moments that -- and this is not going to look at the story.
It runs home, and the map of the main and you go through it and it comes up with the creature, and the story that he would go with the other man and through the other hand.
By the bridge, and then he pulled it into the body and then in the map of what he would transcript.
And so in the situation, the poems of perfect and intact and undoubt from the last at the first word.
When I heard it -- this is the suprantum of my own creative process.
And my creative processes don't limit to that -- I'm not driving it.
I am a catch, and the way I work on the same day and you go to the same time and make me and trick.
But I still have, in my house, even I was attacked to sometimes that phenomenon.
And I imagine that kind of like you are a lot of you do.
And I had projects or ideas that they came from a source that I don't know.
And what do you do this?
And how are we supposed to report that we should not lose our minds that we don't lose the right thing to help us receive the sanity?
For me, the most relevant examples of our daughter that we can do is do the musician of Tom Waits, I took an interview.
I was talking about the subject of this subject was almost all the way to the modern artist's contemporary of modern Chinese contemporary, and to control these creative impulses these creative impulses.
With it walked away, and you immediate the story of one day as a way to Los Angeles and then everything has changed.
While I was driven from a short living in a short living living in the mind that comes in mind, as the magnificent and applied with the inspiration and the inspiration of the inspiration and it doesn't look at it, but it doesn't look at it, it's not going to hurt.
There is no doubt of map, no report.
And I can all feel that old old anxiety into "an anxiety and the song for my mom.
I'm not going to be good enough to reve."
And instead of the panick, just stop.
He stopped the whole process and she did something everything and everything else.
Did you look at the sky, and he said, "You don't see that they are from volan?"
"Would you be able to write a choice?
If you really want to be truly at the point of view, when you can do it.
If you don’t watch someone else.
Take to Leonard Cohen."
The whole creative process of creative process.
It's not the operation that continued to be as much as it happens.
But the process, and the whole processes around him, he took the time on the time he took the cloud, the genius, and it only because only reaches, and it turns out the way to go back and forth, and then he has to be something attached to where he came back and sharing and China.
It could be a unique collaboration and the bizarre in the form of a conversation between Tom and the external entity that wasn't like Tom.
When I heard the story I started to change a little way that I was working on.
This approach me when I was in the midst of Manana, Roages, II, Iubest," and I ended up in a way that you look at when I was working on something that I did not get a disaster to think about being a disaster to be a disaster.
Not just that, but the most proposing this letter again.
And I had to think that I should just abandoned the project.
And then I remembering the opening hospitals and I tried to try and I tried and I tried to me.
I took my head on my road, and I revealed the commentary of the cameras.
I said to the voice ite: "Tw," and I know that if you know if this book is not really extraordinary book is not just going to be really extraordinary now?
Because you can see that one I have one of those I've got to the battle and more than it is.
So if you want to be better, you have to make your apartment.
OK. And if you don't do this, you know, you all -- you know, the naid.
I'm going to tell you that this is my message.
And I want to convey today because I did my threshold.
Because -- the Conclusion is, by hundreds of years ago -- by North Africa, people get to the tall the way that the mountains and the mushroom and the sacred music, and the sacred musical music,
And they were always beautiful, because the dancing were teaching and remarkably, right?
But sometimes very roughly what happens, and one of the fact that it really happens.
I'm sure you all know about what I mean, because you all look at what you do.
It's like the time it stops and the dancing is just as a kind of ports, they don't do anything different than the other 1,000 degrees in the other 1,000-ser.
The whole time, it doesn't seem to be in the whole thing.
It's gone from the bottom of the bottom of the disorder.
Whereas if it happens, you know what it was called the numbers.
They were the hands and the roads and they called "Allah, Alllah, Alllah, Alllah God."
It's God.
A interesting among announcement -- when the main Spanel, they invent the South Spanish, and the pronounce in the Milky of Allah, Allah, Allah Oh ye."
And they hear the struggling with the bodies and dance.
In Spania, when a interpret had something impossible and magic and massive "Allah "Holololololold, your magnificent, you know, your brain."
The neither intelligence.
It's great, because we need that.
But the dog is the second day in the morning when the dancing is and discovered that it is, 11 o'clock in the morning and it's not a scale of the Divention.
It's a disorder, which is also the gender, and it may not be able to anymore.
Could it anymore, no longer the name of Dome, when he got to receive the rest of his life with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
It's one of the most painful of the creature.
But it may not be a bunch of big if you don't think about it if you don't think about the most extraordinary part, like the most extraordinary.
Maybe if you think about it was improud of a source for a few moments in your lifetime, if you think about your lives when the moments were going to be a database.
If we think about it, it all slow.
I began to think about the last few months of the last months of the last months that will be published in the book that will be published by aste, dangerous, dangerous and cross of my success.
And what I have to do is repetited when you lose the cloud.
It would not be the same. And you just go to your park your park, whatever it is.
If you look at the dancing.
If the gene come and the center of what you do is repartied decide to let the receiver the extraordinary of your efforts of your efforts of your efforts --
And if you don't.
And all of these "Oh!" for you.
I think in these things and I think we should teach them.
"Oh!" For you, you just because you have a love for humanity and the end of humanity and the end,
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I talked about some of these projects, about human genome and what it might be -- and what it might be a new gene.
Now in fact, in fact, from one new point: I digital biology, and now we try to start starting to start to start in this digital code and go into a new flowing biology and synthesizing forces and synthesizing forms of life.
We tried all the time to ask ourselves.
"What is life?" It's something I think that many biologists tried to understand the different level.
I tried different approaches, simplified life on the basic components.
We are already about 20 years.
When I sequenced the human genome of the human genome of the analogical world in the digital world in the digital world.
Now, we try to ask the question: Can we regenerated, or can we create new forms of life, in this digital university in this digital university in this digital university in this digital university in this digital universe?
This is the map of a small body, Mycoplasma genomitalium, which is the smallest genome that can replicate in the lab.
We tried to see if we can come up with a genome and smaller.
We managed to receive the ordering of a hundred genes of 500 that are there.
But when we look at his metabolic map of metabolic compared to our comparison.
I think it is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can see the first one time, it's a little bit of a living cell.
So I decided that the only way before it is that we actually synthesizing this cross so that we can reveal some of the most fundamental components of questions.
And so I started on the road, "Can the synthesis a crom?"
Maybe the chemistry allows of these molecules that we ever haven't done anymore.
And, yeah, yes, can we get a cros?
A chromosome, by the way, is just a piece of chemical material.
So, our speed of digital life grew up to a exponential rhythm.
Our ability to describe the genetic code, and it moves very slowly, but it grow.
The last time he went to a exponential.
I started this more than 15 years ago.
I went through a couple of steps, in fact, with a bio-ethical examination, before we do the first experiment.
But it turns out that DNA synthesizing DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make little DNA, long enough of DNA, but it's a 30-letter process, but it's a long-generative process, so why you built.
So we had to create a new way to put these little pieces together and the right way and the correct all the error.
This was our first tentative information, starting from digital information, the genome of the synthetic genome 174.
It's a little virus that killed bacteria.
I made this design design, we went through the core of errors, and I got a molecule DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA.
The interesting thing that came when I took this piece of chemical materials, and I put it in bacteria, and I put it in the bacteria, and bacteria started reading this genetic code, and to produce the virus.
The viral partics were then released from cells, and they have come back, and they were killing cells.
I was talking about the oil industry and the oil industry and they understand this model.
They were laughing more than you are.
And so we think this is a situation where the software can build their own map in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the entire cross of a bacteria.
This is about 580,000 letter code.
So I said to put the letter of the letter of the size of the virus to the size of the size of the roads that are the size of a life cells.
And the design is critical, and if you start with digital information, that information has to be very active information.
When I sequenced this genome in 1995, the precision of the precision of a 1,000.
I finally found that, in fact, 30 days, 30 errors. If we were used to be used to be used to be activated.
The design is in designing is the project, which has the long way to 50 letter each other with all the other pieces of these other lets to build these other letters so that we have to design a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of some television with each other.
We're designing tools.
You may have read that we put the waters" in the house. Give you a genetic code, we have a genetic code from four letters, and T.
Trived from those letters, those letters -- those letters about 20 recently acizes -- a single letter a single immediate acy.
So we can use the genetic code for writing words, sentences, sentence.
And the idea, everything I did was to hear the code.
Some of them were disappointed that there is no poetry.
I designed those pieces so that we can see the digest.
There are enzymes that they repair them.
So we started doing the end, beginning with five to seven to 7,000 lets them go to 7,000 lets them to do it by 24,000 letters, and then putting it up to 72,000.
At each other, we traveling these pieces of abundant to sequence them to sequence them to make a very robust of -- as you will see a very red process.
We're trying to reach that point of automatization.
So, this looks like a basket.
When you get to the very big pieces of about 100,000 different paths, you don't grow it in E.
It turns out all of the tools of modern molecular molecular biology.
So we got to other hanisms.
We knew that there is a mechanism called the recombination that biology using DNA using DNA, and it's using DNA, and that unique.
This is an example.
There's an organism called Deincockroaches that can take millions of route millions of radiation.
As you can see in the room, the cross of it is broken.
Two to 24 hours, he put it back in his hands as it was at the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms, those organisms.
They can live in living.
I am absolutely sure that life can be in the exhibitions, to move a new environmental environment.
In fact, NASA shot showed that this happens.
This is a micrograph of a molecule that we built using these processes -- in fact, using these processes with only using these drugs that we have only seen the pieces that we put in the bodies.
Dround it put it together automatically.
This is not an image from a microscope with electrons, but only a to-micrographical fire.
It's so a big molecule that we can see it with a microscope.
These are images collect over about six seconds of about six seconds.
This is an audience that I had a little bit of time.
This is about 580,000 little, genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule made by people, with a defined structure structure.
It has a molecular molecular molecular over 300 million.
If we printed it with a 10 and without the space of 142 pages to get this genetic code, this genetic code.
So, how do we start a cros? How do you get it?
And obviously, with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
And although you can also easily when you get to the euplot, you can only take the nuclear nuclear nucleus and that is something that you all heard -- cloning.
With chair, the cross is is integrated in the cell, but I showed you that we can make a completely transplant that we can make a completely transplant that we can activate it.
I took a crowd of microbial species.
These are about the same way as people and the same.
We put some genes in a few genes in order to select this cross for this crome.
I deeply with enzym to kill all the protein.
And it was pretty amazing when we put in the cell -- you will appreciate our very sophisticated -- and the crossed in the cell.
In fact, I thought this is as far as far as it can go, but we tried to design the processes of the processing process.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We see all sorts of species that have empowered a second cross or a threshold, or a third of the other hand, thousands of new characteristic, thousands of new characters in a second.
So those who think about evolution only as a single gene of change in the biology.
They're called enzymous restricted by restriction, which actually have DNA.
The noise that was in the cell that there was no one.
The cross -- the cross we put us --
It was extent and recognized the other cromoss as material, as the gift, and this is what we just did with the crossed the new cross of the cross of the crossed and the new cross of the crossed and the new cromoss of the other cromoss of the other cromoss of the other cromoss as well.
It became blue because of genders that we put in a cromoss.
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristics of a species, and it turned out in a completely new species, which we put in the software.
All the proteins were changed, the membranes were changed, when we look at the genetic code.
That may sound like alchemistry of genome, but we can move the DNA, to change the pretty dramatic.
Now, I supported that this is not genesis -- but half billion years and half years old, and I supported that you can be on the way to create a new version of a new version of a new version of massive new species.
Why do this?
I think it's kind of obviously, as you do.
We're on the way to go from six and half to six and a billion people over 40 years.
To put that in the context for me, I was born in 1946.
Now, there are three people on the planet for each of us there in 1946, in 40 years, will be four.
We have problems of fear, providers, providing potable water, drug water and a half billion and a half billion and half.
It will be difficult to do it for us.
We use more than five billion tons of book, more than 30 billion bars.
This is a hundred million bars a day.
When we're going to try to think about biological or any process that will replace to replace that, will be a huge challenge.
Then, of course, is all CO2 from this material, which goes into the atmosphere.
Now, from our discoveries around the world, we have a database, and I like to think about these as the components of the future.
The electronics has only doubt, or something like doubt, or something, and here's the diversity that came out of this.
We're limited here, first of all, biological reality and our imagination.
We now have the techniques of these ways of synthetic ways to do what we call genuical.
We have the ability to build a big robot that to make a million cross on a day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of these 20 million genes or try to optimize the opportunity to produce the opportunity to make the pharmaceutical products. We can change the pharmaceutical products, we can change a little more biology than the last 20 years.
And this is just standard.
We can select for living chemical substantial substances or fuel production, the citizenships, the citizens.
This is an area of the screen of a design software that we work in order to wait and work on these species in the computer.
You know, we don't know how it will show you.
We know exactly what the genetic code.
And now we focus on fuel to fourth generation.
You can see that in the middle of the ethanol is just an amazing experiment.
We have fuels of the generation of the second and the third generation that are going to claims that are going to fill the higher values like occurring or different button.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without a major impacts of the food and the fall of their disappearance is if we start with CO2 as a math math to design this go, and we think we're going to be able to design the fourth generation of fourth generation in about 18 months.
Twine and CO2 is a method -- but in our discoveries around the world, we have all sorts of other ways.
This is an organism that I described in 1996.
It goes into the deep, about two kilometers and half the deep, to half the deep temperate temperature.
Transform CO2 in metan using molecular hydrogen molecular as a source of energy.
We're trying to see if we can take CO2 captured, which can be easily transported in the country that CO2 and convert that CO2 back, to drive this process.
So in a short period of time we think we could demand what is the basic question, "What is life?"
And indeed, you know -- we have the patterns of replacing the entire oil industry.
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where another park in another part?
Take a major source of energy.
But we also work now to use these same same way to invent these same way to invent vaccines.
You have seen this year with a year ago, we are always a dollar and a dollar time when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think the situation can be changed.
This is how it could start to look at the future of changing the evolution of evolution, accelerating evolution with bacteria with bacteria with bacteria with bacteria and finally finally finally, infinite, and then finally finish.
We're almost to improve people.
Our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive to survive to survive. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
And what I want to show you the first time, it's a new technology, a new technology, a new technology that I added up to Microsoft like a year. This is a year.
It's an environment that can interact with a large amount of visual data.
We now look at many of them, many many different types of digital pictures and sweating it with almost perfectly believing to anyway.
It doesn't matter how much information, as much of information, how big images are the images or how big images.
Most of them are taken with a common digital camera digital camera -- for instance, is a Congress, for instance, is a 30-methods of 300 megap.
It's not important because the only thing that the only thing you should limit the performance of your monitoring system is the number of pixels. It's also a very flexible.
This is an entire book, an example.
It's about "Charles Dicken."
To demonstrate you that it's about text, and not a imagine, we can do that something, to show you that it's a real represent the real represent a text; it's not a picture.
Maybe this is an artificial way of reading an electronics.
I wouldn't be able to recommend.
This is a more real. This is a "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian.
Each image is the beginning of a sequence.
And this is really the enjoy of a pleasant experience of reading version or a review of a wall, which is inherent a multi-dimensional environment.
We did a little bit of a little bit of this number in "Gardian of "Gardie."
I created a false reclaim to a very larger -- much bigger than any claming -- and I got a conclusion.
If you want to see the properties of this machine, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the techniques.
And this really through ideas, we traveling the limits of a monitor.
We hope that this is to look at the bridges and other people like this -- which are not necessary.
Of course, the mapping is one of the applications of the kind of like this.
I won't tell you a lot of time on this, but only to tell you that we have to tell you that in this field.
These are all the roads in the United States of NASA.
Take it up to something else.
This is actually active on the Internet; you can check.
This is a project called Photosynth, which is the two different technologies. One of them is Sealoon the other side of the visual perception of the visual perception of the visual perception of the University of Washington.
and Rick Szeliski at Certian Microsoft. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is active on the Internet. It is because Sealot.
And you can see that when we create these kinds of perspective, when we can navigate through images we can have this kind of experience.
But the space of these images of these images matter.
Again, visual algorithms have recorded these images, so that they can receive the real space where these pictures -- all of these pictures -- all the way to the Lacks -- they were achieved. You know, these tools, and these elementary projects, and these tools, and these tools, and these tools were relationships, and these tools were relationships.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There are some people who have much more space ality.
I would like to go to one of the original strength of Noah -- this makes a big early prototype of Photosynth that I worked in to show you what I think is that the piece of technology, technology, the technology of this technology, the technology of this technology, the technology of the screening of this technology, that we put on the website.
We had to take care of the legal aspects of the legal aspects of it.
This is a reconstruction of Cateur Cated, the Dame of Flubs on Flickr. Does Flickr, and you find something like Flickr, and you find something that had been found in the room, and each of these contains a picture that was found that it was found that it would be found out of this model.
These are pictures on Flickr, and all of the space in this way.
We can just navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I would be able to work on Microsoft is very measured to be part of a first here.
I guess you see that I'm a lot of the cameras a lot of truck at SLRs at SL.R. professional SLs in this environment.
If you can see that weird.
There are so many of the features of fear, and so on.
Somebody here is a series of photography -- okay.
This is a poster with Nothing's right record.
You can get you from the poster to a physical environment of this environment.
The idea is that I can do things with social environmental environment. This is to collectively collective data from a collective memory -- from a collective memory -- and to interconnect, and interconnected them all those pictures have been interconnected to the whole bunch of parts.
You have a model of what comes out of the entire Earth.
Think of that as Stephen Lawler of Stephen Lawler "Virtualture."
And this is growing in complexity as the world as we use of benefits as benefits as users become more of the users as users.
And the pictures are the meeting with meters that somebody else has gone.
If anybody would all of these villages, and he would say who I are, then my photography with Catedral Dame would improve it with all of these data, and I could use it as a point in that space, and I could put it through that space, to achieve social experience.
And of course, a second product, but all of these are the enormous patterns and the virtues of the Earth, collecting not only from the Earth, collectively not only from the frogs on the ground and images of a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood correctly, what will allow your software to take a moment in the next few years, is that all the photographs of someone on a glob to be interrelation?
BAA: Yeah. Which does really do is to look at it.
It creates hyperconnectivity, if you want.
And it makes it based on the content of images.
And this becoming a quote when you think about the meaning information that they have these images.
As you are doing a picture of image, you look at the Internet, and you look at the Internet, and text a lot of information about what it looks like.
Now, what would it be the connection to all the picture?
And then the amount of significant interconnection and wealth of this is a huge amount of your country.
CA: Blaise, it's quite incredible. Felics.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intention of the journey and one of the new research of ethnographics is the chance of living in the old who don't look the last in the winds that I feel the past, they still feel the last of the raises of pleasure it in the streets of plants.
You don't know that the Jaguary of Jaguary Called, or that the Middle East, or that in the Himalay, or that in Himalay, or that in Himalaia is to Dharming our revelation of Dharm, and this is really the idea that there is no sense of the world that we live in a sense that there is no sense that there is no sense, but it's a sense of reality.
The consequence of a certain set of decision-makers that our ancestors of our ancestors and successfully, with a lot of generations.
And of course, we all shared the same imperative adapt.
All of us are born. We all bring children on the world.
We go through the initial rituals.
We need to do the separation of our dead, so you don't have to surprising us that we all single, dancing, dancing we all have art.
But what is interesting is the unique of the songs of the dancing every culture.
While this is the Penn Born from Borneo, or the Voodoo in Haiti, or war in Haiti, or the Kaut of Kaut in the northern Kenya, or a meeting of Curander.
By the way, this is the guy that I traveling through a long time, or even a long, or even a forest of the Qold, Everest, Everest, Everestoration of the world.
All of these people learn that there are other ways to think that there are other ways to think about other ways to think about other ways to the Earth.
And this idea, if you think about it, you can't kill your hope.
Now, the miridgs of the world with a spirit of spirital life and cultural recover the planet, and it is the same important for the biological health.
And you could think about this network as the network as being etheless and you could define define the sum of all dreams of the dreams, intuition of the intuition of the consistent of the conscience.
Etnosphere of humanity.
It's the sense of what we are and everything we can be as a surprising specific species,
And as the biosphere, the biosphere has been seosphere -- and maybe a much larger.
For example, no matter what it would not be nice to suggest that half of all the species of all the species, because of all the species, because it's not true, it's not true, and yet this -- the most -- most of the biological biological field of biological diversity of what we know the stage of what we know the stage of what we know the stage of cultural diversity.
And the biggest indicator of this is about the limb disappearance.
When you were born you, the people in this room, there were 6,000 languages.
Now, a language is not only a layer or a set of rules or a set of rules.
A language is a spot of the human spirit of human spirits.
It's the vehicle of which is the spring particles get into the material.
Every language is an old age of mindset of mind, an ecosystem based on an ecosystem, a spiritual possibilities.
And from those 6,000 languages, as we sit here in Monterey, a half of them are not the way of the children.
There are no longer learning, which means in fact, if you don't change something, that if you don't change something, they are all the languages.
What is the only one of the most of you have to be the last of your needle to talk about your language, you don't have the way to presence the wisdom of the mountains or to anticipate the mountains of children?
And yet, that sounds somewhere in the world is somewhere on Earth, about about every two weeks ago, because every two weeks ago, every two weeks ago, an old man's dead, an old language.
And I know that some of you will say, "Well, don't be better?
Wouldn't it be a better place if I all talk about a single language?" And I said, "Groz, this language, that's why it would be Cants.
or Kogi."
And then you will discover how you might not be able to talk about your own language.
So, what I want to do today with you is a kind of traveling -- a short journey to try to give you a sense of what it is going to lose a sense of what it is.
Now, there are many of us who seem to see that when I say "ways to different ways of flaws.
So let's take the example of this kid in the Barana in the Northern Amazon, the anacondes, who think that -- mymythological -- the mythological rights.
This is a bridge that by the blue is not distinguishing the sky is equivalent of the sky is equivalent of the forest.
I have a curious language and rule rules that called the linguistic exogames you have to travel with someone who talks about a different language.
And all of these are rooted in the past mythologically, it's a strange thing in these houses where they talk about six or seven languages because of interfaces, never hear a language.
They just listening and then they start to speak language.
Or, one of the most fascinating tribes that we ever lived with the Waorn of the Equadorum, a popor of the Equadorum in 1958.
In 1957, five missionarians tried to contact and they tried a critical mistakes.
They arrived from the air photographs of them and what he wanted to be a friendly frightening that these people in the junk hasn't seen in their lives.
They took those photographs on the sole, they tried to look at the front of the girl, they found anything, they found anything, they found something, they traveling the diolder, so they have these five missions.
But Wa's not killed with the lights.
They were killed between them.
Fifty percent of the mortality of their mortality.
I followed the genealotic boards back with eight generations, and we found two days, and when I pressed a little bit about them, they got a little bit about them, they reached that one of these guys died so old that we died up with an old knowledge, so I put it on the same way in the same time they had an amazing knowledge.
And their neighborhood can smell animals from 40 steps and tell you what specifically allows you to go to the water.
At the early '80s, I had a surprising mission when I was asked by my teacher at Harvard if I would be interested in Haiti in Haiti, I would be interested in Haiti, and the secrets that were based on the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes.
In order to understand what the sensation, I had to understand the sensation, I had to understand something about this remarkable, and Voodoo, and Voodoo is not a free.
The impression, it's a complex metaphor of the world.
It's interesting.
If I wondered what the great religions of the world, what do you say?
I think of Islamism, Budism, Iudiam, anything else.
It always remains a continent, the present of the sub-Saharan Africa. Well, of course there was no matter that they had a very simple distant and Voodoo is the distant distillance of these religious ideas on was expensive.
But what Voodoo is this relationship is this relationship between the life and the dead.
So the life gives you the spirit in the spirit.
The pirites can be invoted by the Ape, like the dancing of the dancing to replacing the soul, so that for that in the short moment that for that short moment.
That's what I say to Voodoo of Voodoo people, you go to Goodoo and talk about God.
We dancing in the temple, and we become God."
And because you are positive, are the dominated by spirit, how can you be prevent to be prevent with you?
So you see these demonstrations of these demonstrations of Voodoo Voodoo stock in the perfectly buried in the perfect demonstration of the minds of the minds of the minds of the minds that the body, when it's catalyet.
Now, from all of the bridge I met the most extraordinary of the Kogi in Sierra Nevada Santa Mark in Colombia.
Of course the old civilization of Tairona Tairona coaster of coastal Colombian of Colombian immediately cross of the Spanish in a massive massive massive massive massive massive maps.
In a blood continent, this bridge, this popor is not the unique of the Spanish.
And by the way, they are conclusion, but the previous price to be very extraordinary proud to be quite extraordinary.
The young people are brothers of their families at the age of 30-year-olds in the dark world in the dark cookies, for 18 years.
Two periods of nine years of nine years to send the nest nine months of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the natural thermothers.
And the whole bunch of them, they are introduced in their values of their societies that are supposed to be their relationships, and only their relationships, and they can tell the equilibrium -- or we could tell the balance.
At the end of this amazing conference, one day in one day and for the first time and for the first time in their lives at 18-year-olds at the age of the consciousness of the first lights of the first light, while the Sun starts to fish. And they start to scaling the landscape of the fishing of the fish. And what they teach them in a glass. And the price
And he says, "Is it really as I said.
It's really beautiful. It's like to protect here."
They call the older fish, and they tell us that we are more young people who are responsible for the world.
Now, this level of intuition becomes very important.
Sometimes we think of how we think about the box and the landscape, or the opposite Rouse. And the old wild of his noble nobility that is an idea in the simplicity or alternatives and tell us that these people are closer and tell that these people are close.
Well, the boxes are not the feeling of the nostalgia.
It's not for almost almost almost one in the streets of malaria in Asmen or in the wind windows of Tibet, but they created a traditional mystery of the Earth, which is the traditional of the Earth, which is based on the idea of being built on the idea of the idea that the Earth can only be in a way that the Earth can only be in the human consciousness of the human consciousness.
Now, what does this mean?
It means that a boy in And, who is raised to believe that that the Apu that the Apu who will be a different human beings, will be a different human beings and will have a different relationship with that resource than a different relationship with that resources in Montana grew to believe that a mountain.
That is the place of a spirit or a bunch of minds is irrelevant.
Interesting is the metaphor that defines between individuals and natural world.
I grew up in the Colombias to think that the forests of the forest.
That made me a different human beings than my friend, than my friend Kwagious, who think that those forests were the lock of the Ciocle and the Ciocle and the 19th and the 19th and the spirit that they have lived at the end of the world, spirit with the north of the worldwide of the world, spirit with the Hamata.
If you start to look at the idea that these culture could create different realities, you will begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries of their extraordinary discoveries. Let's take this pleasant example.
It's a picture of me in the Amazing Amazon, in the app.
This is ayahuasca, which many of you have, the most powerful psychopathletes, the most powerful psychopay.
Ayahuasing is not only for the pharmacological potential for the left, but for the printer. It's done in two different sources of it.
The first one is that he has a series in a series of sufficient disease, modern maybe, modern mainstreance.
It only consumes the time is it was more like the blue of the citizens of your own conscience, but the time the jewels of a ball of the coffees called Psychovies called Psynthetic Psychodis.
This plant contains very strong, very strong, very close to the brain in the brain in the brain, dime, 5-meypties, 5-meylthylame.
If you ever saw you ever have seen the Yanomami of the Yanomami living in their nose, that substance is made of different species, that substance is made out of different species, and the methods.
He travelfit through the nas it is actually as if you are exposed from a painting with paintings with paintings and attached in a big electricity. It doesn't create a distortion of reality.
In fact, I was talking to my teacher Richard Evan Shult Shult was the man who decline was psychopathetics in the 1930s.
I used to argue that you cannot classified these trypamine traveling because when you are under their effect, the moment that the effect of the trypts of the trypts of the trypth is that they can't be oral order, because they are called order, and they are called the human human human human assumptions called oxype.
They can only be taken ordering with other compounds with the MAO.
Now, the fascinating thing is that the meat that time in that time, the MA's inhibitors are the same kind of trypties that you need to trypt: How do you ask you the whole bunch of 80,000 species of dead, they found these two nelegated disorders that combined a version of deadly created a vertising version than the entire summer than the summer.
Well, we use that mistake, great woman's trying and heroes, which is unscared like no sense.
But the questions and they say, "Plants,"
Well, what does this mean?
This trib Cofan has 17 variety of ayahuasca, and I recognize all of the forest, and we see all as a species.
And then you ask them how they stable their taxonomy, and they said, "I think you know something about plants.
I mean, you don't know anything?" And I say, "No."
Well, we find out that every single one of the 17th of the 17th grade, and you go into a different note.
Now, that's not going to give you a Ph.D. but it's much more interesting than the number of states.
Now, the problem is that even the issue of us that sympaths, we see them as you can see them as a bizarre and rainforests of the history of the history of our history, which is our world as well.
The truth is that the 20th century, over 300 years, will not be held minds or technological innovations, but more like in which we have assisted or we encouraged or we encouraged the passion of biological diversity and cultural cultural diversity and cultural cultural issue is not changed.
All the cultures in all the time, they were employing in the new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology.
The Sioux did not slowed up to Sioux when they gave them to the arts and more than the American people who were Americans, when they reached at the cycle.
It's not changing the ethnoses of ethnose.
The crude of the dominance.
Where you look through the world, you discover that these are not filled culture.
These are people living their dynamic forms of identify that they are all over their own capability.
Whether it is deforesting with the judgment of Pensex -- a popor in South Asia, in Sarawak Asia, in Sarawak -- a popor and now a generation, and now with a generation, and now with a generation, where you can see the rights, where you can see the rights, where you can see the laugh, where you can see the river of the southern in Border, where you can see the red,
where the Japanese you get to the horizon to the orizon their forest.
Or in the case of Yanomames are the diseases that come from the exterior of the discoveries.
Or if you go to the Tibet, where I do a lot of research in the last time, you will see the face of the politics.
You know, the genocide -- the physics of a bridge of a popor is convicted university, but the destruction of a bridge, not only that it's not only not only the universal contains -- in many areas -- in many areas -- in a lot of development.
And you cannot understand the paint of Tibet, until you see it through the solar level.
I traveling 9.600 kilometers in Chengdu in the Western Chinese law with a little Tibet, and only when I reached in Lhad, and only when I got in Lhad in Lhad statistics.
6,000 sacred monuments transformed into the sprawl.
1.2 million people killed by the shape of the Cultural Revolution.
Take this young man was devoted to Panchen Lama.
That's what he signed in his immediately when the Chinese have learned Tibet.
The only girl with Panchen Lama in Nepal.
My mom was confidence for the crime.
He was stuck at the end of two years to the age of two years to step, because she could not sufficient him.
Her who made that encourage was arrived in an education.
And one day he traveling from a banderol, and for Mao, and for this craction was seven years old.
The Tibet, the Tibet, you can be impossible to be impossible for human human being.
And finally, in fact, it turns out to a choice.
Do we want to live in a monocross of the monocross of the world policy world policy world.
Margaret Mead, the great anthropologist, he told her before her the biggest was that the biggest one generated that as the next generation and amorphanthropy on the world not only to see the entire human imagination, but that we're going to see the whole range of though, but that we're going to go from one day and other possibilities.
And it's humiling us to remember that our species exists, of about 600,000 years.
The Neolitical Revolution -- which we gave us agricultural agricultural culture of his colleague was replaced by the way, we created a surplus has been replaced by a source of specialization -- he had only 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial industry as we only have 300 years.
Now, this is superficial history not suggesting that we would have all the answers that we're going to confront in the next million.
When this whole lot of culture of the world are questioning about the meaning humanity responds to 10,000 different voices.
And in that song we're going to rediscover new possibility to be what they call a completely consciousness, completely consciousness that all people and all of the other people who find a way of optimism.
This is a photograph that I did at the top of the Baffin the Middle Baffin the wind of Inuplot, and this man, Olayk, and this man told me the great story of his grandmother's goal.
The canadian government had not always been so much of the Inured, and in the 1950, to stable in the 1950, force we forced in the colons.
Her of this man refused to meet.
Familia, the measures for his life.
Now, you have to understand that the inputs of the refrigerats, they use their refrigerator.
Her Ghidden were made in the fishing of the fishing pigs.
So the grandmother's not been intimidated with the arco and the dream of the soul.
He just shared out the outside, he traveling his pants, his hands in his hand. And he just his hands started to travel in his hands started to travel from him.
He put the salive in the excredit of the excredit and when he finished the weight, he frozen a dog with him.
He had judged the dogs and improvised a dozen main and improvised the dog and improvised a dog and improvised a snake, and he flew a sample of the streets in the excreation in the excreation in the excreation in the excreation in the excredition.
And we're talking about to yourself from nothing. And that, in many ways, is a symbol of the people of Industrial and all of the world.
In the air 1999, 1999, the canadian ended back of a very large areas than California and Tasks together.
It's our new way. It's called Nunavor.
It's an independent territorium controlling all the mineral resources.
A amazing example of how a national state can look at the national strength of his people.
And finally, at the end, I think it's obviously, because at least we traveled in these remote places, I understood that they are not distress.
They are the patterns of people.
They represents of human images that come from the images that come out of the time, and for us all of our children, as the dreams of our children, they become part of the geography of our children.
So what we tried to do in National Geographic is, we think that politicians will never realize anything.
We think that the policy -- we think that policies are not aware that the story, but we think that the story can change the world, and so we are probably the most of us are probably the best we are like.
We have 35 million visited our web page every month.
156-year-old nations transmit of our television.
Our rules are reading for millions of people.
And what we're doing is a series of travels in where we're going to take our audience in cultural place, that they can't even be able to remains of what they seem to remain and hope, and we hope that they would acknowledge that would acknowledge the world to be in a way that we can find a way that we can find a way that we can find a way that we can find a way to live way to live in a world in a way that we can find a whole world.
where the wisdom of all poverty can contribute to our collectivity.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some of the things that I hope that I hope that they will resonate with other things that you have already heard of these connections.
I want to start with what I call the "Ph.D."
Doctrof?
The official of all the Western societies.
And this doctor's soap sounds like this: if we are interested in our citizens of our citizens of our citizens of our citizenships.
The reason for this is so freedom is that freedom is the good word, valuable to be humans, the essential to be manage to be human.
And because if people are frequency of individual and you can act with individual and make things that are going to be able to decide in our place.
The way to maximize the freedom of choices.
The more people have choices, the more people who have freedom of freedom and the more freedom of freedom of their own.
Then, I think, that it's so good at our systems that you wouldn't go through anybody in the headline.
And it's deeply to our lives.
I'm going to give you a few examples of what made for us for the last time.
This is a supermarket.
I just want to say two words about it.
175 villages for the supermarket, that if you don't cover and the 10 types of wasting and the 10 different types of wild watersame, and that you can buy your own songs that you can buy your own in a very large numbers for a very large number of people in a very large numbers of the 17-year-old.
So this is the supermarket.
And then you go to the strength of electronic components to make a stereo system, CD -- the housin CD player CD player.
And in this room of electronic component of electronic components of stereo.
We can configuring out of millions of systems that are stereo systems that are in the office.
You have to recognize that this means a lot of options.
In other domains -- in the world.
There was a hot -- when I was a child, where you could get any kind of your phone service as much as the time it was offered as Ma Bell.
Take the phone.
By the way, one of the consequences of this is that the phone never the street.
And those days are much old.
Now, we have a close diversity almost send diversity in the telephones, especially in the world of mobile phones.
These are the mobiles of the future.
My previous is the one in the middle -- with MP3 player in the nose of the nose from the nose of the southern ware.
And if you haven't seen it still in the store, you can stay in the store, because you can see it.
And the result is that it makes people in the store and put this question.
And you know what the answer to the question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to buy a phone that you don't know that you don't know.
And in other field of life that are much more important than bugs, there is this growth of the number of options.
The sanitary system -- in the United States is not the case you go to the doctor and you tell you what to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor and saying, you know, we have a variation of B.
It has these advantages and these risks.
B has these advantages and these risks. What do you want to do?
And you say, "Docture, what do you do?" And the doctor has these advantage and these advantages and the risks and the risk of these risks and the risks and the risks and the risks and the risks and the occurs.
What do you want to do?
And you say, "What if you do you do, you know, what do you do?" And the doctor says, "But I'm not the place your peace." And the result is -- I tell you what it makes a good thing.
But what this is actually a transition of responsibility and decisions and decisions from someone who knows something -- in this case -- someone who you don't know anything and it's almost certainly disease and it's almost not the best form to make decisions -- in this patient.
There is a huge level of adverties for the remote medications like me, and you think you know, if you think a little bit of you, if you think about a lot, because we can't buy it.
Why do we add the new audience if we can't buy it?
The answer is that those who are doing this waiting for us to call our doctors in the next morning and ask them to change our network.
Something that our identity has become a problem of choice, and this transition of choice, and this transition to look at this.
That's what we don't do a identity but we have the possibility but we have the possibility of it.
And that we can reinvent any of those often we have a chef.
And that means that every day when you go on the other day you have to decide what you want to be.
With the judgment and family, there was a way that there was a almost anyone who was almost anyone else was that you have to traveling you as you get to the children as long as you get to the children as much faster.
The only option was with somebody's somebody, not when you do that.
In our days, we everything is very much of our remotely.
I give them incredibly smart students, and they give them 20 percent less than I do.
And this is not because it would be a little bit less than the map.
What do you think I'm concerned with all sorts of questions "What should I guess you?" You should do it? Should I be doing this?
Should I be able to fall? I have to receive? You all of these are questions? All of these are questions that consumption.
And they will respond to these questions, whether it doesn't mean if this is not to do all of the things that I will not take a good note to my curses.
And that's what we need to do. These are really important questions that you have to answers.
Mount -- we are blessing, as Carl and Carl and Carl with technology that allows us to work in every mind, every time in any place on the planet -- less than Hotel Randphiles -- less than Hotel.
By the way, there is an area in a corner that I haven't revealing anybody.
I won't tell you about it because I want to use it.
So that means that this incredible freedom of choosing that we have to take a work, is that we have to take a decision, and again, if we should not be able to work and even if we should not work with.
We can go to see how our football of our football and in a pocket and Blackberry, and laptop, probably that on the other.
And even though all of the mind every minute we look at how we look at how the box is the kind of a football of the water? What should we respond to this water?
Should you respond to this email of the letter of the letter of this letter?" And even if the answer is, it's not that the sense of your song is going to be very different.
So everywhere where we look at small and small things that are and the things that get the style of life is a little bit of options.
And the world I was living like this.
To say that, I had some choices to do this, but it wasn't all the choices of option.
And the world where we live here.
And the question is, right?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what it is good at this, so I'm going to talk about what it is.
All of these choices are two negatives, two negative effects on people.
And one of the effectively paradoxically, is that produce paralyzed, rather than release.
With so many options that can choose, people who can choose to choose for something.
So you offer a very significant example of the investment of privacy.
A cold of my team had access to discuss the data from Vancient investments that have almost a million mutuals that has almost a million of employees and almost 2,000 sees and almost 2,000 sees.
And what they found is that for every 10 funds that the employees that offer the employees, the rate with two percent.
Two 50 percent of mutual footprint with 10 percent of the people you engage than if you give you a dinner. Why?
Because with 50 mutual footprints of people who want to choose the naid you to choose what you want to choose.
And then then on the floor and then the cloud and then the cloud, and of course, the claims and of course, it never come in.
You understand that this doesn't just mean that those people will consume that those people are going to focus in the pension because they don't have enough money to put it on a decision, which means that the strength is so hard to make sure that the strength of compensation that would give the employster.
We are starting to look at the bottom of 5,000 dollars a year from the employees of the employees that would pay the happiness.
So the consequence is a consequence when you have too many options.
And I think that it makes the world look like this.
So you really want to take a decision, if it's for everybody, right?
You don't want to choose to choose or even welcome or even wrong.
So this is an effect. The second is that if we managed to prevent the stage and make a choice and make a choice as a choice as we would be a little bit of choicing choices.
And there are some reasons for this.
One of them is that you have a bunch of soses for people who want to choose if you look at one and it's not perfectly -- and it's not -- you know, what?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that there was a different choice. And what happens is that the alternative that is that the alternative that you have done in your choice that you have done and these regreen regret and these regreted regret in the election that you even if this was a good decision.
The more option, the more option, the more you want to regret something that is disappointed with the option that you have.
Secondly, what economists call the opportunity for opportunity.
Dan Gilber demonstrated very clear in this morning talking about how we evaluate things that we compare the things that we compare to what you compare them.
Well, when they are a lot of alternative alternative that is easy to imagine the characteristic characteristics of the alternatives that you break the alternatives that you break your alternatives that you have a little bit of alternatives that you have a little bit of alternative that you have.
Here's an example. I ask for the people who are not New Yorkers.
But here's how I should support.
We have this box in Hamps.
A very expensive.
It's a superbit. They have great. They have everything to do.
What could you want? "Well what about the drug is thinking.
Everyone of my neighborhood in Manhattan are going.
And I could be part of the office in front of two weeks of the idea that the idea that the opportunity of the idea that we had a big place to have a place that wonderful park for the day to have a beautiful place.
The food strength of the satisfaction that we have a choice as we have a choice is exceptional.
And the more options of the option of these options of these opinions of these options are going to be perceived for us as an opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon tells a lot of things.
It tells us that we should be living in the lack and probably we should be doing the slow.
But one of the things that tell you is that any choice a choice a choice to make other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of the things that you do what you do you do what you do.
Third the third route of expectations.
That's what she loved when I wanted to replace my blue.
I go almost all the time.
And there was one of the people who were only one and you buy them and you buy them and you buy them and you buy them and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you take a lot of time and if you take a lot of time and selling them better.
So I went to to my hands after I had gotten a few years of the old and I said, "Look, I want a wall, I want a wall of the way that he said, "You want to be straight?" And you want to be straight?
Do you want you with farm? Do you want to prefer or smok? Do you want to teach this?
Do you want to be gone.
You want to avoid, you want them to rights, and not fine.
He painted my face and after I said, "I want to be able to say, "I want to be the kind of the guy who were no idea that I had any idea that I spent a lot of the wall of the wall of the walls of the room, and I went out of the road, and I went out of the road, with all of the way I had.
I have a lot of good. All of these options were able to choose better.
But I felt worse.
Why? I wrote a book that I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt more worse is that we had all these option options of my expectations of my expectations of my expectations.
I had very low expectations. We didn't have any expected expectancy when they were a single same.
Now when they are 100 sisters, his mother, one of them has to be perfect.
And what I got was good, but not perfect.
So I comparised what I expected with what I expected is that I was disappointed in compared to what I hope.
The option of options in the lives of people cannot do something else than to create the expectations that people have to be those options.
And the way that will take a little bit of satisfaction even if you get good results.
Nobody in the marketing world.
Because if you know, you don't have the idea of what I'm talking about.
The truth is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was all the better when it was that when everything was worse, it was actually possible that people to experience.
Today, in the world that we live -- we live -- new industrialized citizens and you look at the perfect thing -- the best thing you can tell you that things that you can be as good as you expect.
You will never be surprised because your expectations, and my expectations.
The happiness of the happiness -- the secret -- the secret of happiness is to have expectations.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- that I actually have a short soon, and it's really cool.
I couldn't be able to find something better. I wasn't able to find somewhere.
But you look at your house not necessarily not necessary.
And finally, a consequence of buying a wall of you don't know when you can't buy a single one one way you can't buy a single one one as you can't get your question, and you ask you why that is that the answer, the answer.
The world is going. Where can you be able to do?
When there are hundreds of different styles and a different styles and somehow you disappointed and you ask yourself why, what?
It's the same clear that the answer to the question.
You could have a better choice.
With a hundred different waves of the choice to choose no excuse for me.
So when people take decisions, even though the results of the choice are good for them, they are good disappoints of them, they are going.
Depression, the industrialized world.
I think an important contribution -- not the only thing -- but important to this erupper depression, is that people have experiences that are disappointing because the standards that the standards that are very high level.
And when you have to explain these experiences, I think they are coming out of it.
So the general is that the result we get it better, and we feel better.
So let me remind you.
This is the doctrines, which we all think is truly and it is completely true. It's not true.
Without the discussion that you have a few choice is better than one of those choices are better than the choices that many choices are better.
There's a magic. I don't know what it is.
But I am pretty sure that we took a lot of this point where the choice us to improve our lifestyle.
Now, the idea -- I almost finally finished -- the idea that you think is this.
And what it allows all of these choices in industrialized societies is the well-being.
There are a lot of places in the world, and we heard about some of them where the problem their issues.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the thing about talking about is a strange problem of Western societies, modern societies.
And what is frustrating is this: Steve Levitt talks about how these chairs is about how these sees are money and hard to instead.
What I tell you is that these options, expensive, expensive not only help.
They actually have a pain.
They really make us feel worse.
If something that allows that allows us in our societies that we do all the choice in the society that people have too few options that people have too few options that would be improved, but our lights and our lives would be improved.
This is what economists call the Pareto.
The revenue of income is going to be better -- not just the people that -- because of the way of the choices of choices.
In conclusion. You assume that you look at this cartoon, and it's a sophisticated person you know the fish?
You know that there is no way in this accumulation of the world -- so I read it in the world -- so I read it and I read it and my first time.
First, the more I thought about it as I got to think that the fish you know something.
Because the truth is that if you hope everything to be possible for everything to be possible, you don't have free.
If you hope that everything is possible, so that everything is possible.
You believe and you think about satisfaction.
Anybody needs an acvariety.
This is almost certainly very limited -- probably even for a fish for us.
But the absence of a metaphor of metaphor for unfortunately, disaster.
Thank you very much.
