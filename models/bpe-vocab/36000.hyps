The last year, we showed these two diametered to demonstrate that polar polar in the polar polar that the main of the last three million years was the size of the big size of 48 years ago.
But this mornity is serious serious because it doesn't look the size of the sea.
The polar polar is in a way, the heart of the global system that is the global climate system.

Lister at TED I did a introduction to a LHC.
And I promised you to give you a data about how this works.
So here is the movie for those who have no scientific experiment that was the largest scientific experiments that was asked to stop -- Cumphonics -- Cumphiloscope, or it's about 27 kilometers at less than a fraction of a framework -- the panel from a billion times to creative to the universe -- the panel in the way to create a second.
It's extremely quick of both sides.
This is the device under the Geneva.
We make the photographs of these minds in the decades.
I work on this. It's called the ATLASS -- Lunger -- Lunged 4,000 feet photographs of 22 meters here of ATLS imagery here of ATLSS in the construction of ATLASS in the construction of the ATLASS TLASS --
On the 10 seven, I went to the next year, I started the first data.
And this image was done by ATLASS.
He caused a great celebration in the room.
It's a picture of the first piece of particle that has been cratched over the third of the LHC, cross system is a part of LHC deliberately in the detector.
In other words, when I saw that last 10 years I did that the device has a big success.
I don't know if this was the largest own, or when someone went on on Google and this page, and I saw that the first page.
It means that I did a cultural impact on the side of the intelligence impact on the science of the intelligence.
After about a week later, I had a problem with the device, which actually had to do with these days, these days.
Those are transportation of 13 of the ampers that are working on the power of maximum to the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of a couple of thousands of footprint of the shark of the fun of the ampers of the amperforming of the power of the power of the power of the moon.
Now, engineers in the room, and we said, "They can't transport the ampers. They are fixed fighting the foot."
But I can do this because when they're at temperatures become called the superconductive son.
So as a 271 degree of so-called the hospital between stars, those bees can transport these things like board.
At one of the layers of the ones in LHC, was a defer of facility.
So that company was enquid out the dog of the 13,000 ampers of the 13 of the resistant resistance of electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressible to those magnetic trees over 20 tons of ton, and they moved almost 30 cents.
So I got about 50 magnetic magnetic magnetic
I had to get out of the end, which I did.
I reconconvicted all of it, I was repairs.
And now we take magnetic magics, and then we go in the subteran.
The end of the end of the March of the LHC will be like new LHC will be like new strength.
We're going to start from again, and we get this data in the hitting or ithin the united and continuing research to find out the emotional elements of the universe.
Now, of course, in a sense, those accidents of people who are talking about the importance of science and engineering from extreme to extreme to break out of the extreme to break out of the way.
I think that it is that it is so difficulty as we have young inals, that this is the important thing to do as the important thing of experiments like LHC.
I'm going to leave the words of a scientist of a scientist of a scientist, which, I think that my app -- when the app the units protected experiments protecting the decrease in the protection of our minds are not more dangerous progress for us to presence our birthday for us to prepared us to presence our stations are not finding our lives, as well.
Thank you.
I would start with the rate of your child, when you were going to play with boxes.
And on the magic of the people who are going to get them and raise them and get them out of the cycle and sold them in the way you learn how to understand the hospital and manipulate relationships.
The hospital of the hospital is profoundly part of the world of how we understand a big part of the world in the inconjection of the world is profoundly part of the spatial world is profoundly profoundly profoundly profoundly the voice is profoundly profoundly profoundly part of how we understand a big world of how we understand a big world of how we understand a lot of the world in the inconclusions.
So, in the way that the IT re-inspired by this unit of our interactions with our physical objects, and my physical account of my physical consultant and my color -- I had my color -- I got my color -- I got a computer, and I started using a computer, in this unique -- would be when we use a computer deeper to an ection of a mouse to an ecection of a dance that would be both of the treats of the treatment and we can get all the way to get to the mountaining of the mountainly with a computer to the data with a bads of the digital display with a digital dymate and to the digital dance to the digital dding with a digital dance of my own own digital consulting-remoties of the moties of the digital consulty, and to be both
An how do we want it?
The question was that the fascinating was that we were able to research on Siftar design Siftables.
In short, Siftable is a computer interactive of a biscal bism.
They can be texted by the way, they can perceive the reef, they can perceive the many, and they have a screen and a radio and an radio wireless radio wireless and a radio wireless of the reference.
The most important is that there are palpable, so like the game, you can just get them out of their games, you can just get them out of them.
And Sif, the cameras an example.
The magic of what these instruments are becoming more palatches of their mission of each other, and the containment of us and conties of our nutrients and funny to explain to interact with new ways to interact with new ways to interact with interaction.
I'm going to start with simple.
This is a sweat-configuring image, and if you include it by a step, if he include his film car, if he include it in the other part, it is driving back in the other part, it is the end.
These are the interactive interactive are constantly the other ones that are the other size.
So if I put them one langer other, they become interesting.
If they're unconcepted by it, and this is a little bit of confusion.
and I can also feel the mission and the inclinic.
We realized that one of us in the interesting implications of interacting is that we can use the gestablished the data, how we would have a college of how we would have a college of a liquid liquid of a liquid liquids.
In this case, we have three Siftalleters like the sample and can use them to use the color in the center of the center, where they are going to mixed the center, where they are going to be amponthers are going to be amps.
If we can get very much, we can get the tuned of the end.
And also there are interesting possibility for education, like the language of viewers and logical sense, mathematical and logical people to try to do people to try to get the possibility to see the results immediately the results immediately immediately the results immediate immediate in the way to education.
So here I have -- this is a Fibonacious tribes that they do with a simple program for equation.
Here we have a game game game of the words of the words of Scrabble and Boggles.
Basically, every single one of the first one of the first one of Siftable, and on the magic of the moon the mother, they're really great, they're green with a dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds of the letters are reseeds, and you have a new set of letting new set of letting out of the end.
Thank you.
This is the kids are boring in the exhibition at the Media Laborator and got to go to the movie and filmmaker and filmmaker.
They liked them to crawy.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of application is that you don't need to give them many instructions.
All you need to say is "F" is "F" and they know exactly what to do.
Here are other people who are trying to get them to get them out.
This is the most tanker testing in our right right in the right right in the right right here.
It seems like everything that he wanted to do was to do was to make the ponents of one over the other side of the other.
So for him was just the boat.
This is a animal applicator.
We wanted to build a tool-for the people who invent language.
And this is Felix.
He can introduce new characters in the stage of those Siftar store on the maps of the characters that they are the characters of the cards.
This is where the soarrivered.
Video: The race.
David Merrill: I put a stage in the scene.
Video: The portion of the portraiter.
Very of course, yeah.
Mismal when Siftable and switching one of the other is that he can do personal personal -- Video: Ham!
DM: It creands their own narrative
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a open-up story with the open-source, and he's going to be deeply sands.
Video: Hello.
DM: The last example I have time to show you today is a device is a device and interpretation and interpretation that we built on the Swemile like Switwitzerlands like bad.
Every one of these four different variations that you want to use it.
And you can inject the sound of a succession that you have.
You are the sounds of the sounds of the so-called a Star camera.
There's the effects that you can control control and the filter of the movie, and the filter and the filter of the filter of the filter of the filter of the effects you can see the filter that you can see the filter that you can see the actual effects that you can see the filter you can control the car.
You can see it in a certain sound and then including it to help him him him him to help it.
It looks like general effects like the foot and the volume of the third of the intrees of His to see His to see it.
Video: Many of the beginning: I will start with a successful ratio to success, we were arrived in a serious spinal expensive.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: DM: Now I add a few dangerous.
Video: YM: And I'm now going to add the top, to control the whole light.
Video: DM: I can be the third of the inclining century or another.
Video: I'm going to say that the bags of the bill of expressive.
Video: MM: I can resisting while the amount of time.
So you don't have to do the plan, they can improvise, or shorter of liquid or sading the songs in in the worth of the worth of the worth of the earlier in the previous world.
Now, the end, I can get the whole sequence of the Sive of the Sif, the Sif, the clinical trials in the stangle.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is the human creation is the human interfacing that is better with how they work is working better with how to work and our body.
And today, I had time to show you a coordination of this new spatial shows that we were trying to get out of the possibilities that we were trying to get from the lab.
The Ganda that wants to give it is that we're at the new general instruments of interacting with interaction with interaction with the digital interaction with the rest of our rules of our rules of our rules.
Thank you very much.
These wisdom with nervous nervous nervous to you all of you know.
I'm a writing thing.
He says books to my professional is more than that.
It's my mother, my mother, the love of a life.
And I'm not that kind of like this will be change.
But this is a saying, something like a strange in life and in my career and in the caria, which he determined me to remove me to the whole thing with work.
And the strange thing is that I wrote this book, this is the title called Man: "Mananca, Roage," -- Iubeste," which is unlike my career in the world for a terrible books in the world for a little bit of a sample that incheck in the world for a little sense, and it became this very important seller seller seller seller of the book called "Helse's "megathord," which is called "Sankencleanesive "ubestyphic Man
The result is that anywhere in the way now, people treat me now, people treat me.
Serosia, the convicamed --
In fact, for example, are the ingright-hand and you tell the theme -- you don't have the theme as you can't be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the performance of that?
You don't know that you're going to keep the whole life of your life that the country has to create a book that will ever be on the world that you ever get out of the world that ever ever get out of the world that ever ever ever get here?"
It's very linked to it.
But it was also more likely to remember that time that 20 years ago, when I started to marriage people -- when I was a teenager -- I want to become writing -- I want to become writing the kind of writing the guy on the same way that kind of a kind of Africa.
And people were saying "You don't have any of you haven't got any of success?"
Do you don't know that humility will be held to reach your own idea?
It's not the frame that your entire field of your life in this field and nothing will be going to be a grade of the boy on a gray of the flamh of the flam-foot-ball of the joy of the screen of the screen of the screen?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the short -- the answer to all those questions is """""""Could you be "Yes."
Yes, it's the theme of all of those things.
And it always was hitting.
And it's a result in the plus of many other things that are not able to do with them.
As a result of the big algorithms that are cross that are cross that are crying.
But when it's about the work that I was still thinking about the last time I was like, "Why?"
Is it a rational?
It's the logic to anyone to the work that they feel like they were destroying on this Pame.
And what is that specific initiatives that seems like us is really true to come to your own healthcare in a way that other teachers don't do it?
My father was my father was not a chemist engineer and you don't remember in the 40 years of the engineering 40 years of the engineering is to be a chemical engineer to be a chemist.
It wasn't happened -- John, how does the block the chemicicicics?
It just doesn't happen to be happening.
But to be honest, chemists, as a group as a group of not very few seconds to be alcoholes to be alcools of maniactics.
We have this written writers -- we have this reputation, and not only writing the kind of arrow all the way of all the way to be powerful for the real reputation to be very strong.
And everything we have to do is to look at the numbers of death in the 20th century, only recorded in the 20th century, in the 20th century, which have died by young people who died by young people and often died by the way.
And even those who didn't know about their own sees are actually not really good about your own talented.
Norman Mailer, even before the last time to die in the last one of the last few of my cards me on my cartags killed me me more than I was a little more you."
A great great great great about your work.
But we don't have any clients when we hear someone said that because we heard this because I've heard these things like things that we were absorbed and something, at the collective and the suective sense of the collective and suffering and suffering and suffering and suffering and that artis going to go to the pursuit will always take the infinfinite for the suffering.
And the question I want to advertising all of this here is you all the ideas of that?
You are comfortable with it -- because as as the list -- I don't see me -- I don't think about this ipotes.
I think it's a lot.
And I also think it's dangerous and I don't want to see it in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage the big artistic to live the big artistic to live in.
And I know about my case, in my case, in my case, it would be very dangerous for me for me to go to the caring of this meat this meat this dinner, especially because I find the professional about the time I find out the professional moment.
As a result of the way of example, I just have 4-year-old was about 40 years.
I would probably be four decades of the work of work in the workforce.
And it's very likely to be that I write with this moment to be judged by the work that the work that was the work of my last year's success of my career, right?
What it would be to say to the men, because of the ones here are already the most likely to be the largest successful of my mind is really likely to be happened.
Oh, God, what shame.
This is the kind of a mouse that could make someone look at the gin to the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
The phery is that I love this message that I love it.
And then, then, the question is, what?
And so I was hopeless, after many of the meditation, as I need to work now, to be by making a kind of properly creative construction, right?
I mean, I need to find a way to get a distant a distant distant to the reference, and my father who was now the nature of the graduate of the law that will be now before I write what I write about what I write in the way to the point of the way that he written the way to what I write out of the way to the way to be a way to step up a distant to the revanna to be a distant to the requirement of the way that he was going to be in me, and the the.
And as I did work in the last year in this sense, I started to look around the time, and I tried to find other society to see if they could have better ideas to see how it could have better ideas about how to help people are creativity.
This is the research has been the Greece, and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and the research of it.
So you have the sky is the sky is the sky.
But in the Grection of the ancient Rome, and it was that people don't believe that creativity in the human inside the human being?
People thought that creativity was a spirit was a spirit of people who are helping people in a source and unintelligence and unintelligent in and unintelligent reasons.
The solution to these spirits, they are helping to the famous creativity.
Socratic was famous for that he was a demon that he has a department in the department.
The human human beings, but they were called the same, imateral spirit of creative --
What is great because the romantic romantic noy; they were a very exciting individual individual in the room.
They were creating the way that a genius was a kind of magical entity in the walls of the wall of the wall of the art of artist's widely like Dobby, the sample that the paper and the inispire of the work in the job, the model of work in the job, the workforce of the work of work in the workplace that they were working on the workers of the workers of the wall-to-the-the-day of the workers of the western of the work
Absolutely -- this is really the distant -- this is the distant that I was talking about the result that is to protect you from your work to protect your results.
And all the world is that that that that has functionally gotten it?
So the artist was protected by some things, like the things that are too much narcis, right?
If your work was stralucita, you couldn't get the world for her, the whole world for her, all the world as you had this genius that has helped us to the tricky that held it.
If your work was critical, it wasn't completely income, isn't it?
Everybody stuck has been a little bit ignoring.
And they looked at people in Valley for a long time.
And then came up with the Rastery and everything has changed, the idea of the main was to put the man in the center of the universe on the center of all the mystery of the universe on all the mysteries that get to the mysteries that get ordying.
It was the little bit of rational, and people started to create the creative that creativity was all of the inside of the individual individuals.
And for the first time in history in the history of people started talking to one or another one genius in order to get a genius.
And you have to married, I think it was a huge error of error of the error of the same.
It would be a simple person, a simple person, or it's actually the receptor is actually the receptor and the theory and the synthetic source of the mysterious and the south, creative sky, creative unexpected is a little bit of a human beings.
It's like you would ask you to get the so-called soarrivered.
It just incovering and reforms of equivalent and generror of all these astewelds on the performance.
I think that this is that the press of the artist in the last 500 years.
And, if it's true, and I think is the question is, what do we do?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we go back to the higher senses of the relationship between people and the creative myself.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't just sterile 500 years of the human gas a human race of a range talk.
And probably they are in the public that would raise the question of the question that would be known as a theme, the novel on the the, which are actually carried people around the projects over and over the projects and all of them.
I probably won't be able to cooptes.
But the question I want to ask is -- why not?
Why don't we think about that?
Because it has a lot of sense that anything else I've heard about the explaining the dance of the creative processing.
Project anyone who was trying to create something -- basically all of the here -- you know, the whole behavior is not always behavioral ratial.
And, in fact, sometimes it can seem to be the paranormal to the right paranzy.
I had a little bit of a death where I knew her great American American Lone, the American Ruth Stone, has now been the bridge in the past 90 years and that was the bridge that was when she was a child and she told me that when she was a little bit of the wild of the wild and he just heard a poetry and it to hear it out of her housing out of the shop to her out the shop out of the shoes.
The story was like a vast vast of the sample of the air.
And it was the roads of over the roads.
The idea is coming from, because you have gallallallement.
At that time, it takes one thing to do, and that is, "Wait is that it applataaa."
And it goes to the home to the home to the whole houses of the whole idea was to get to a piece of map and a piece of map and a lot of time for that she was doubt for the third of the third and then you get it through it and then he would go to the map.
Sometimes it was not enough enough enough to get the running and running and running and running out in the house, and the person would have a royboy and the poems would lose the rostation of the rooms, and I read it in the room, I read it "another poe"
There was a moments where -- and this time -- and the point -- moments in which this story as almost loss.
The running home, the home of the main and the card and the person was the way that the time it was the way to take on the other way to the other person with the other man's shoulder, and the cause of the other man's shoulder.
The main the cover and the table, and then the tragedy that they will transform on the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of the magic of the main car.
In fact, in the case, the bridge of perfect and intact and intact and unless and it's about the last at the last at the last time at the first words.
When I was hearing it -- it's just the same, it was just how my own creative process.
My creative processes doesn't get limit to this -- I'm not driving up to this -- I'm not driving yeah.
I'm a way that they work in the way they work in every day and translation every day and translate me and get out of the wrong and get out of wrong with the wrong with the wrong with the wrong with the wrong
But even I was like, in the housning, even I was touching that phenomenon.
And I would imagine that the same was also many of you are also many of you are.
And I was also the ideas that were going to be a source that I don't know about it.
And what do you do you all this?
And how do we should report us to report that we don't lose your mind, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, to help us reach the blood fast to the blood to help us to report our life?
For me, the most relevant in the day we have about how it can do is make music is that can do is the musician-made interviewed interviews, we took a revivia with revistation.
I was talking about this subject and Tom was almost all about his life in his own contemporary artist of the contemporary artistic artist and to control these incontrollers and gentlemen.
With the time it was walking around the story as a day as a result in a day to Los Angeles and then everything has changed.
When I was driving from a short fragment in a short piece of piece of piece of piece of piece of piece of paper, as it happens, as it happens, and it's not about inspiring and a little bit of inspiring and a little bit of the her, it's not about her, but it doesn't have to how to her, it's not to her.
It doesn't have no food food food -- it doesn't have any creature, no reportoph.
The experience of that the toy that the old old old in "An inside "I'll lose the song for me to the bank of the bank for me for the banks for always before.
I'm not enough enough to recover, a wider to remain it.
And instead of one of the panick, just stop.
He stopped the whole thing that he was doing is something completely completely useless.
He raised the skin and said, "You don't see that they're at volan?"
"Are you that might be like to write a canopy to the work?
If you really want to be able to be in a moment in a moment of moments, when they can live me.
If you don't have any of the people who are today.
Go and you get it to Leonard Cohen."
The trust process of doing this.
Not the operating surgery has been working on as well as the income anyway.
But the process of it, and the whole process; he was in his time he took the door, the moment he took the dog that he took the mouth of his mouth and he gave her the way to the way it was back to where he was back to the way that he didn't have to go back and China.
It could be the unique collaboration and the sample under a form of a conversation between Tom and the exterior exterior of the exterior that was not too much like Tome.
And after I heard the story of the story I was going to change a little bit of the way I was saved a data.
This approach me when I was at the middle of "Man: Huela, Roages, Iubest," and I have a load in a kind of dynamics where we were looking at the time I was working on when I work on the way we were working and you might be a displayed to think of the most proposing that it will be a bad thing to be a great propose.
Not just that, but the most proposing this book was ever written up.
I was going to think about it would just like to be abandoned the project.
And so I remember Tom Tom and I was trying to get and I tried and I was trying to do.
I raise my way out of manuscris and I added my comments and I add a college of the camera.
I said to vote with voice -- and you know that if this was not just the book is not just going to be amazing, right?
Because you can see that I'm one of the base of all all of the way to the base -- and more than they are.
So if you want to be better than it to be able to do the job, and you need to do the third part of your job.
Okay. And if you don't do that, you know, you know, you all of them.
Let me tell you that this is my message because this is my message to my message.
And I want to consign for that I did this side side of my job."
Because -- the Conclusion is -- by hundreds of years ago, in the deserts of North African people would have to add the wild mushroom and the sacred music, and the sacred music, and the sacred music, and the sacrifice that they were in the race of hours of route hours of rough.
And they were always good for dance, because dancers were teaching and they were remarkable to be remarkable, right?
But sometimes very roughly some of the things happen, and one of the fact that the point of the common.
I'm convinced you you all know about what I'm talking about, because all of you see in a certain moment, like this is a certain moment of interpretation.
It's like the time it gets up and the dancers is by the wings, often don't do anything differently than the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series are all alazzing.
And in a long time it seems to be in the entire field of being in the entire gylast.
It's lightly lived from the bottom of the bottom of the founder of the fire of the founder of the fire of the same.
When it was when they were trying to get people who were called the name.
They were the both the both they were and they were "Allah, Allah, Alllah, Alllah, Gamh, Gamh, Gamh, Game, Gamne."
It's God.
A deception -- when the great history -- when the mothers have been taught with them this useful Spayment was made up with them in the Mid-century was transformed over the century was to "Allah," "wil,"
and they hear the time of fighting and dancing dancers and dancing the slow.
In Span, when a conception of something impossible and magic and magic and magic -- the Allah, mother, Allah, magical, the car."
She's a wider -- a God of God --
It's great because we need to need that.
But the side side of the morning comes up when the dancer's dance is also the discovery is that it's a big time and it's not a scale.
It's a dirty that ends is and that switch and it might not be more innocent to the time they can also be inaltered in the same way.
Would it be no longer the name of Dome, when he was he was requires that you should be able to do with the rest of his life with his rest of his life.
It's hard.
It's one of the most painful of the most painful of the creative that creative.
But it may not be a very big bone of the big if you don't think about the most extraordinary part, as you know, the most extraordinary part,
Maybe if you think about you were imprised by a source of a few moments of moments of your life on your life is being data from your life to be more more than somebody else ever ever ever ever before.
If we think about that, everything is beginning to change.
I started thinking about my dance and I thought about the last few months of the last few months of the book that will be published by this book, dangerous and cross of my success.
And what I did is I do with when you get the curriculum is not a the-the-the-the-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-dozen doing.
It doesn't be a spread and just the way to get the job of the Contintina Contintintinier to your party,
If you are dancing your dance.
If the genius are and central excenter that you can get to the whole thing to get to the extraordinarily inject of your effort through your efforts -- then the "le!"
And if no, they don't dance anyway.
And all of that said, "Why!" for you.
I think in these things and I think we should have them teach them them.
"Fy!" for you, you just because you have a lovely loves for humans, and the incentive to participate in the continuous and the end.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We talked about some of these projects, about some of these projects, and what it might be able to predict how we might have to discover new set of new genes.
Now we start again. In fact, from a new point of viewer: we are now doing it from this code code, and we're now trying to start to get into a new flowing biology, patterning forces and synthesizing forced forces of life.
We all tried to ask the big questions about the important questions of us to ask questions.
"What is life?" It's something that I think many biologists have tried to understand about variety levels.
We tried different approaches, simple approaches to the based on life components.
We are already forced about 20 years.
When I sequenced the human genome, he went from the analogical world of biology in the digital world in the digital world, in the digital world.
Now we're trying to ask the question, can we regenerate new forces of life, in this digital universe?
This is the map of a small organ, Mycoplasma genome, which is the smallest genome, which can replica the only has to replue in the lab.
We tried to see if we could come up with a genome and smaller genome.
We were able to get to the orange of a hundred genes in the judge of 500 that are there.
But when we look at his metabolic map is pretty simple, it's pretty simple, it's pretty simple.
Because it's just a little bit of me.
But when we look at all the genes we can get the first moment is a little bit likely to produce a life.
So we decided that the only way that the only way that we actually synthesomerrow the components of the components to reach the components to reach the other ones to reach questions.
And so I started the way I started "Can we stand synome?"
Maybe the chemistry allows these synthesize these molecules that ever haven't done it ever ever ever made it anymore?
And if we can get a cross of a cross?
A crosome, by the way, is just a piece of chemical.
So our speed speed of life has been growing up to an exponentially.
Our ability to write code code code, but it has been moving through the beginning, but it has grown up.
The last time he got to an exponentially.
I started this on a little bit more than 15 years ago.
I went through a few ethap, and it was actually with a bio-etic examination in the first experiments of the first experiments of the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesizing DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make small DNA, long since 30 to 50 lets in 50 lets in 50 lets in a degenerative process, so what you build a longer, so much error more error more error mothers in more error more error more errors than the window.
So we had to create a new way to put these little dots together and correct all these little errors.
This was our first tentative information from the digital information to the digital information of the synthesis of Phi X 174.
It's a little virus that killer humans are killing bacteria
We made the gents, we went through the right of the right of errors, and we got a molecule only about 5,000 letters of DNA in a letter of the DNA
The interesting thing was when I took this piece of chemical material, and we put it in bacteria and we put it in bacteria started to read this code, and it was starting to read this code code, and to produce the virus and produce the virus and produced the virus.
The virules were then released from cells and they return out of the cells and they have killed the cells of the E.
I was talking about the oil industry and they were saying that they understand very clear this model.
They have laughter more than you are.
And we think that's a situation where the software can build their own mad's own mad's in a system in a system in a system of biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the whole cross of a bacteria of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 liters of genetic code.
So we said to put the table of the size of the size of the viruses to could to the size of the size of the side of the houses of a life cells.
The design is critical to be critically critically to the digital information in computer, that information has to be very exciting.
When I sequenced this genome in 1995, the assume was a precision of the preseries of a decade of basic payments of base.
I found that, in the revenue of revengery, 30 errors. If we were used to be activated.
The design is from design is to join the design of the long time, that has to be a little bit of a lot of the other joy of 50 lets to build 50 lets to build some of the very small units to build some of the very small units to be compatible to each other.
We create unique elements.
You may have read that we put "gentlemen." Give your homework in this genic code, you have a genetic code, the C, and T.
Triving the letter of those letters -- those little bit of a no-in-remote team.
So we can use the genetic code for writing words, sentences, the cash of the beets.
Imagine that I did was to hear the coding.
Some of them were disappointed that it's not poetry is not poetry and besides of them.
We designed those very few little joined that we can have been with enzymes.
They're who are repair that they are and they why.
So we started doing the joy of the lights, starting to 7,000 to seven to 7,000 lets them do some of them 24,000 letters in these little bit, and then put it in the way to 7,000.
Every single bone of the base of these very plant to the abundance to sequence, we try to make a very robust process, as you will see a very robust -- as you can see in a minute.
We try to get to get to that point point out the automative.
So this shows like a basketball of the baskets.
When we get to the very large pieces of 100,000 payments of basic payments of the basic payments.
They are all the tools of the tools of the modern molecular molecular molecular biology.
So we were going to get to other hand.
I knew that there is a mechanism called recombination of biology that biology that biology is using DNA, and that's unique.
This is an example.
There's a organism called Deincoccucutal radio requirement millions of radiation.
As you can see in the shot shot of the cross is destroyed.
12 hours to 24 hours later, he put it again. He put it in his new way that was starting to start with.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be often all of the same way that the whole organisms are all of them.
I can live in the life.
I'm sure that life can be able to be in the extreatment of extreatment, to get a new environment.
In fact, NASA has shown that this is going to happen there.
Here is a micrographical micrographical that we built using these procks -- actually using these procleaning drugs that using only the heat of the piece of pieces that we put on the piece of pieces that we put on the skin.
Drojjjjells together together
This is not a picture from a microscope with electronics, but only one to-micrographics.
It's the big molecule that we can see it with a microscope with a microscope.
These are images of collected over a decade of about six seconds.
This is a published audience that I've had a little time.
These are over 580,000 liters of genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever ever ever ever ever done by human.
It has a molecular molecular molecular ar ar molecular ar ar moth.
If we can put it with a dog of 10 without the space to get this code 42 pages to get this genetic code.
So how do we start a cross of a cross? What about is it that in?
Finally, with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated with bacteria to work with bacteria to work with bacteria
Estate, even more easy when you get to eucracy, you can just take the nuclear and put the nuclear nuclear nuclear r -- and that's something you heard -- cloning.
With the chair, the chair, the chromosome, but we showed it by curious way, we can make a completely a completely crosome, at a completely crosome, and we can activate it.
We put a chance of a roof.
These are the same way as people and the same.
We added a few genes in the plus to get to this cross for this cross for this cross for this cross of the crossed for this crossed a few genes in this crossed a few genes in the end.
We were dealing with enzed all the proteins.
And it was pretty amazing, when we put in the cells, you will appreciate our graphs very sophisticated grafices -- and the cross has been in the cell.
In fact, I thought this is how far it can go, but we tried to design process, something further.
This is a major mechanism mechanics of evolution.
We are all sorts of species that have been embedded a second cross or a third of the day, or a third of the other party, in another one second.
So those who are thinking about evolution just as a single gene of changing the biology.
They are called restriction, which actually had been restriction, which actually had been destricted by the DNA
The Cromosome, which was in the cell.
The way -- the chromosome, which we put it --
It was expressed and graduated and grateful the other cross as the ancestor in the desperately with the cross of the new cross of the new cross of the new cross of the new cross-on.
It became blue in because of the genes that we put in the cross that we put in the cross of the genome.
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristics of a very short spectrum of a new basic spectrum on the software, and it was in the cell.
All proteins, they were changing, these membranes -- when we put the genetic code, it's exactly what we transferred the genetic code, is exactly what we transferred the proteins.
This can sound like alchemistry as alic, but we can move the software of the A-changing things pretty dramatic.
Now, I support that this is not genesis, but it has been genesis, and half years and half of evolution, and we suspected that we can be a new version of the wall of the newspaper of the Cambor in which has place a new species.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty obvious about it for needs.
We're on the way to go from six and a half to nine billion people over 40 years.
To put this in context for me to me, I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each of us that there were in 1946; in 40 years, will be four.
We have a bad problems of bears, providing water to drinking water, drug-fighting and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half of the six and a half and a half of the roads,
It's going to be difficult to do it.
We use over five billion tons of books, more than 30 billion oil bars.
This means a hundred million barriers a day.
When we try to think about proposes or anything that has to replace that, to replace that, it will be a huge challenge.
And then of course, is that CO2 is all the way that CO2 is the atmospheric to the atmospheric
Now, from our discoveries around the world, we have a basic data with over 20 million genes, and I like to think about these components in the future.
The surrounding the electronics has only a doubt, or so, and here's the diversity that came out of it.
We're the first one of the first one, a biological reality and the imagination and the imagination.
We now have the techniques, because of these ways of synthesia, to make what we call the genymic.
We have the ability to build a big robot that make a million chromosomes a day.
When you think about this 20 million genes of these 20 million genes or different genes or try to make the occurred to produce procleans, vaccines, or producing products, only with a small team, only can change with a small team than the last 20 years of all science.
And this is just the standard.
We can select for viable viable chemical or chemicals or fuels or fuels, the citizens, the citizens.
This is a piece of screen of a design software that we work in order to be able to wait for these species in the computer.
You know, we don't know how it will show you.
We know exactly how they do do the genetic code,
Now we are now focusing on combat fourth generation.
You see that in the etan-based experiments is just a big experiment is just a big experiment that was a big experiment
We have a generation fuels of the third and the third of the third and the third of the way that are so-called fresh ahards, to combat or different shapes like occurred or different buttons or different buttons of the slopes.
But the only way we think that biology can have a big impact without any costing impact more food costs and the flight of their own disappearing to their limited exist to the CO2 is whether it's the first goal for the purpose, and we think we're going to have the first goal cellular generation of the fourth in about 18 months.
Last and CO2 is a way -- but in the discovery -- but in the discovery of our world, we have all sorts of other ways of us have all sorts of ways of the world we have all sorts of ways of the world we have all sorts of ways of the CO2 is a way and CO2 is a way of the world is a way of our world, but in the discoveries of our world, but in the world is a way of our world.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It goes into the deep deep, about two miles and a half of the deep, at temperatures of the windows.
The CO2 in metan use of CO2 in metan energy as a source of energy as a source of energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 captured, which can be transported in the country, and convert in the country to the fuel in the fuels to get this way.
So in a short period of time, we think we could die of what is the basic question "What is life asking "What is life is life asking is life asking y?"
We know -- we know -- we have the whole model of oil model of the whole industry industry.
Yeah. If you don't do that at TED, where another part, where another part, where another part, where else is that?
Let me get a major source of energy.
But we also work to use these same source is to invent these same sources as vaccines immediately in vaccines immediately immediately
You saw this year with this year, we are always a dollar in the minus when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think that situation can be shifted by building vaccines that before before you get vaccinated.
And here's how it could start to look at the future of changing the future of evolution now is the evolution of bacteria with bacteria -- the theory of the bacteria -- finally, the income -- finally, eukios.
We're almost to improve people.
Our own is to make sure that we have a chance that we have a long time to be able to do that. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you first of all, is a fundamental work of technology that I had to Microsoft to Microsoft as a part of a part of a big deal for a year. This is a year. This is a year.
It's a medium that can interact is local will be a big amount of data from a big data of data.
We now look at many of us, gigabaid to the digital and marriage in the continuous circumstances of it, spreading it through this, rearrived by this,
It doesn't matter how much information is we look at how big the information is these college or how big the images.
Most are the pictures of the normal camera is a normal digital camera, for example, is a scanner, from the Bible Center of 300 meals from the World 300 meals of the 300 megaps.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that we need to limit the performance of a monitory system is the number of pixels to your monitor architecture very data. It's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a little book book that is once a non-imaginative example of a non-imaginative book.
It's about "Catheist" -- Charles Dickens.
To demonstrate you that is about text, and not imagine, and not imagine, we can do that, to show that it's a real representation of a text; it's not a position.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read a book in electronics.
I would not recommend.
This is a more real. It's a "Gardian "Gardianulous case
Every image is the beginning of a second.
This is really gives you a joy experience of a payment of a payway to a revia or a newspaper or a multi-dimensional environment.
We did something small and we did something little collision with this number of "Gardianul."
We created a false reclaim to a very high resolution -- much more than in any claming -- and we have a common containment of a containment.
If you want to see the properties of this car, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the techniques.
And this really clearly by ideas, the limits of a monitory of a monitor.
We hope that this is to be sick and other people and other people are not necessarily necessarily necessarily required.
Of course, the mapping is one of the applications for a technology of the kind of thing.
I will not much time on this, but just to tell you that we have contributed to this field.
These are all the way in the United States, the south of NASA.
Let's go to a little bit else:
This is actually on the Internet; you can see verif.
This is a project called Photosyn-the-the-day technology. One of them is Sealoads and the other research of the visual perception of the visual perception of the computer perception of the universe in Washington is done by Steve See Savadd Savin Washington, reed by Steve See See Savz University.
and Rick Szeliski at Cerror Microsoft. A beautiful college
So this is active on the Internet.
You can see that when we create this kind of perspective, when we can navigate through images of experience, we can have this kind of experience in many resolution.
But the space arrial arresting of these images really true.
The algorithms of visual experience, and they recorded these images together, so that to code -- all of these pictures -- all the pictures of Grass' Laises in the Grass' Stage -- they were done these elements here -- they were done these elements here or panorgan projection of a creative projections of a bon-shelter projection of these tools were relational.
I'm not sure if I got time to show you other environments.
There are some of the more space ality.
I would like to go to one of the original goals of Noah -- that does part of a long prototype of the Photosynthetic prototype -- to show you what I think is the pigs of this technology, just to show you what I think is that the bonds of this technology, just by vision. It's not just vising the projections that I put on the website.
We had to care about the legal aspects of the legal aspects of failure.
This is a reconstruction of Cateur Damamami in images of the images of Flickrickr. Does Nothing Dames Flickr, and you find something in the trouble with these guys in the trouble with these conportraitors are found a picture that was found a picture that he was found that he was found that the coreresponse to this model of the model that was found that he would be found out of this model
These are the pictures on Flickr, and all of the space in this way.
We can just navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I would get to work at Microsoft is very good to work here.
I don't see that they're a lot of the cameras a cameras a camera from the mobile phones, in SLRs to SLRs in this environment.
If you can find out there are no weird dysis.
There are so many mammmms, sized by feeds.
One is going to be a series of photography --
This is a poster of Nothing was recorded by Damame.
You can get out of the poster to a physical medium of this environment.
The point is that they can do some things with social environment. This means to collect all the world -- from all from a collective memory about what the Earth looks like. They have been interconnected to the Earth -- and to interconnected all those very few parts of them were interconnected to the whole bunch of parts.
You have a model of what comes out of the entire Earth.
Think of this as long as the earlier of Stephen Lawler "Earth."
And this is the way it uses the world as the world as well. And the people who are getting more of the use of benefits as users as well.
Project are the pictures of metaphors that somebody else has enjoyed it.
If someone eeeeeeeeached and he would say who I are, then my picture with Catedral Damg would improve all of these data, and I could use it as a point of navigate to the navigate it to make it like this space, to realize that space that space to achieve this space of a combination.
And of course, a collective product of one of these are the huge patterns of every single life of every single interesting patterns of the Earth, collective wake around the Earth, and images of the village and images of satellite fishery but in a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I have the wall? What will allow your software to do is that in the next few years, is that all the pictures few years ago, is that all the pictures of someone on the mouth to be interrelation?
BA: Yeah. Which does it really make is to be able to purpose.
They create hyper-connected hyper-connected --
And it is what they do is based on the imagery.
And this is becoming a quick qualitation that information is that they have those images that have those images.
As you do a little bit of imaging image, you put some words on the Internet, and the text on the Internet gives a lot of information about what the pictures are the position.
Now, what if that would be the connection to all the pictures of all the pictures of your posities?
And then the amount of signal interconnection and wealth of this is a huge classical effect of the country.
CA: Blaise, is incredible. Felics.
BAM: Thank you very much.
One of the intense plants of the intense of the dance of the dnography of the ethanks of people who don't look at the old boards, who don't look at the old boats in the wind stages of the rainforests of pload it in the leads to the lead it in the leads to the boundaries of plants.
You don't know that the Jaguary Jaguary lady in the Law of the Law of the old man of the people who are still resonate or that in Himalaia is to remember the revelation of Dharming us continue to remember the center of Dharming revelation is not a model of anthropology, and this idea that we are not just a model of sense of reality.
The consequence of a certain set of decision-makers that were trying to make them for their ancestors and successful many generations in the next few generations in the next few years.
And of course, we all shared the same imperative adaptive imperative adaptive.
We are all born of us are all of us to bring kids on the world.
We are in the initial ritual ritual rituals.
We need to do separate separate from the dead, so we don't have to surprising us all the son, with the mushroom we all have arrived.
But what's interesting is the unique of songs of songs every culture.
Whether is that the Penania in Boro, or the wild of Voodoo in Haiti, or war in the northern Kaut in the northern Kaut in the northern of Kaut in the middle of Saharan advand.
By the way, this is the path that I travels now a month, or even a long stage of iaces from Qoleen pants, Everest, the west.
All of these people learn that there are other ways to think about other ways to think about other ways to think about other ways to think about the orientation of the Earth.
And this idea, if you think about it, it can't be a hope.
Now, the miridges of the world are working together a spiral life and cultural life that cover the planet and cultural health for the planet, and it's as important for life, life, knocking the biological network as the biosphorus of life, life, life, knocking the biosphorus.
And you might think about this network of life as being eaten and you could define the eper, and you might defined the suit of all dreams, the intuitions of the intuitiative of the minds' imagination human consciousness.
Etnosphere is the main human beings.
It's the symbols of what we can be like a very surprising species of iscode for a cross of the cross of the cross of the cross of the coditself.
And as the biosphere was the heroes, so the eernosphere -- and maybe a much larger scale.
For example, no way to suggest that the big, rather than than a half or more of all the species was or more of all of the expanding of the expand, because it just doesn't really matter is not true, and yet, and yeah the scenario-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-term term of what we know was the most optimistic environment.
And the largest indicator of this is the limb wild.
When you were born you, the ones in this room, there were 6,000 language are talking about 6,000 languages of them.
Now, a language is not only a vocabulary of the layer or a set of rules.
A language is a language is a scale.
It's the vehicle that the soul of the neighborhood is going to get into the material.
Every language is a language is a mind, a reception, a reception, an ecosystem to be a spiritual possibilities.
And from those 6,000 languages, as we are here in Monterey, a half of them are not released in the earliest children.
They don't have any babies are learning to do something that means that they're not changing something, that they're already moarses.
What can be more than the only thing that is the last few of the last few of the last one in your own language, to be the last language to presence the wisdom of the ancestors or to the death of the children or the children or the children or the children of the children?
And yet, that sounds like the so-called the no-like so-called the Spanish in every two weeks ago, because every two weeks ago, a mother, a wild of the last few weeks are the last night.
And I know that some of you will say, "Well, would it be better?
It would not be a better place if I all talk to you a single language that I would be Canosav, that is to be Canoneezoa. Or to be Canoneeeating.
Or will be Kogi."
And then you will find out how it would be not to talk to your own language.
So what I want to do today is a kind of dynamics -- a short journey of traveling through the dnosphorus to try to get a sense of losing you to try to get to the fact that they are losing you to do with you.

Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some things from from from a book to other things that they would give you some other things you heard of me to do with other things that I would have to do with some of the bond, where you have some of the best.
I want to start with what I call "the doctor.
Doctrofing what?
The Doctrofing all of the Western society of the Western societies.
And this doctrof. And this is a little bit like this is a good state of the good state of the good citizens of the citizens of the country is to do is to maximize the level of the individual level.
The reason for this is that freedom is that freedom is going, the value of goods, the critical to be human.
And because if people are free when each of us are going to act things that are going to make things that are going to be our good at the goal in our own places.
The maximize the freedom is the massive choices.
The more choice are more choices, the more people have more freedom of freedom of freedom of the more freedom of the more freedom of the way they were traveled by the more you travel.
This, I think, it's so good as it is that we don't take anybody through the system that would be done by the headaches to put it on the headaches to put it on the headaches to put it on the door.
And it's deeply to our lives.
I'm going to give you some examples of what made for us for the last progress in the last time.
This is a supermarket.
I just want to say two words about it.
175 sets of selling in my supermarket, and that doesn't hate the 10 different types of wasting and the 10 different types of the base of the bones that you can buy your own bones that you can buy your own bees that you can buy your own inner in a very big number of people who are no matter in the case that no matter in the 175 they don't have any store the 175 that store no matter that store the store
So it's the supermarket.
And then you go to the electrical store stereotype stereo -- the stereo system -- the mobile CD player, the mobile phone, amplify moves off.
And in this rooms are a stereotype of the system systems are stereo.
We can confessed by a different stereo systems that are in the components that are in the office of a single store.
You have to recognize that this means a lot of options.
In other domains -- in the world of communications --
It was a way, when I was a kid, where you could get any kind of work that you could get any kind of widely the phone service was offered by Ma Bell.
The next one.
By the way, one of the consequences of this was not the right phone.
And those days are a lot of apuse.
Now, we have a close diversity in the mobile phone diversity in the world of mobile phones.
These are the mobile future.
My favorite charity is in the middle -- MP3 player, the bones in the nas and the guy in the nas and the tunnas for making me credit cream I going to make me creative.
And if you were not seen in the store you haven't seen it because in the store it because in the curious wait.
And the result is that the result is that the question, and put this question.
And you know what the answer is the question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to buy a phone that you don't know too much.
And in other domains of life that are much more important than bugs, there are this growth of option that the number of options of option.
The health system -- in the United States is not the case you get to the doctor and that tells you what to do.
Instead of leading you to the doctor and say, we have a variant's varianta and the variant's various B.
It has these rise advantage and these risks and these risks.
BBe has these rise and these risks and these risks. What do you want to do?
And you say, "Doctors, what do you do?" And the doctor says, "He has these advantage" risks and the risks and the risks and the risks and the risks and risks of these risks and risks to the risks and rise to the rise of it.
What do you want to do?
And you tell you "But if you were in my place, you know, you were doing it, you know, the doctor says, "But I'm not in your place is -- I say the patient's good." And the result of the patient's patient." And the result of what a thing is doing to a thing.
But what's actually is a transition of responsibility and decisions of the choice of someone who knows something -- in this case, at someone who knows anything -- at someone who don't know is almost not in the best form of disease -- this patient and it's not in the patient.
There's a huge levels of public medications for the reette medications like me and as I think of you, if you think a little bit of a lot, it has no love, because we can't buy them.
Why do we get to the narrative that if we don't do it it?
The answer is that the ones that are doing this is that we are expecting our doctors in the next morning, and to change our remote reets.
Something that our identity has become a problem of choice, and this transition problem has to look at this role has to look at that.
that we don't change a little bit of a identity but we have the possibility to invite it.
And we can reinvent any of us we have a chef.
And that means that every day you are you going to be able to decide what kind of person you want to be able to do with you.
With all the respect for the marriage and family, there was a lot of failure that the media was that the media was that he had to get out of the way you get to the children as long as you get to the children as much faster.
The only option was a dinner of which, you don't know what you will do after it.
In our days, we are all about removes.
I mean, you know, incredibly smart students, and they give them 20 percent less than I do.
And this is not because it would be less than the same, and not because it would be less made.
What do you think they're concerned with all sorts of questions "should I get out of the questions that would we do it? Should I do it? Is it go?
I should be able to get later and have to be kids, or a card?" All of these are questions that consumes you get the questions that consume you?
And they will respond to these questions, whether that means not that to do all of the toys that are not a good note to take a good note to the race.
And this also has to do it. These are important questions that you need to answer them.
The work -- we're being, as the window, and the Carl and Carl with technology that allows us to work every minal mind every minute in every single minute in every single single day -- less than Hotell T.
By the way, there's a corner in a corner, which I don't reveal the wireless of the wireless of the wireless of the wireless of the so-called the wife.
I'm not going to tell you about it because I want to use it.
So that means that this incredible freedom to choose that we have to take a choice, is that we need to take a decision, and again, again, and again, if we should be or or not to work and if we should be able to work with.
We can go to see how our football of our football and have the mobile phone, and the Gyryo in the other and laptops, probably that on the other laptop and laptops, probably that on the other ones.
And even if all of the mind every minute that we look at how the few of us are moving a football of a football of the water -- "Is this water?
Should I be answered to this email of the orring of this letter?" And even if the answer is "no," is it sure that your experience of the byball of your little bbadly will be very differently than what it would be not very different than how it would be not really differently than it would be been not very differently than it would be been not very different than they were going to be very different from the toda
So anywhere in our world, and small things and small things that are also the things that are a lifestyle of choice is a little bit of options.
And the world I was living like this.
To say that -- I had some choices that we had some choices of option.
And the world we live now looks like this.
And the question is, is it good or use?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what is good at this, so I will talk about what I'm going to talk about what is bad news.
All these choices are two types of choices on people's people.
One of the effects of paralyze, is that proves paralyzing.
So many choices that can choose to choose to choose to choose for something.
You give you a very significant example of a very significant investment in the private plans of the penses of the private plans of the penss.
A college of the investment of investment has been access to Valley data from the hunger company that has almost a million engagement in a million of employees and almost 2,000 sees and almost 2,000 sedies.
And what he found is that for every 10 funding to each 10 foundations that are the employees of the participants of two percentage percent.
You have 50 mutations of mutation -- they are sent with 10 percent of people who are employed than if you were providing dines. Why?
Because with 50 mutations of mutation between that to choose between that way to choose you to choose what you want to choose what you want to choose to choose and the hands.
And then on the poor and then the same, and then the same, and of course, all the way on the sun and of course, it never failed.
You know, the fact that this doesn't only mean that those people will consume the food for dogs after a few people are going to get to the money to put money on the way to put a decision-making decision-making decision-making decision-making is so hard to make sure that unless than the money in compensation that would provide the employees that would provide the employees that would provide the employees that would provide the employees of food that they would provide for a few few money from the forest of the people who would be able to the money to the money to
We were looking at the leg to the leg from the employees from the employees of the employment of the employees of compensation of compensation to compensation forests.
So the way of mention is a consequence when you have too much choice.
And I think that this is what this is doing like this.
You want to make a better decision, if it's for all the ethernity, right?
You don't want to choose the forest of the wrong investment or even wrong.
So this is a second effect. The second is that if we were able to get the strengths of the requires of the choice as we were going to be a little bit more satisfied choice than we were going to be if we had a few choices that we choose to choose the choice.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that we had a lot of snoses for a lot of people who are not -- and it's not -- and it's not -- and you know, is not -- and you know, what?
It's easy to imagine that you have a different choice that you could have been a better choice. And what happens is that the alternative will be that the alternative will regret you in the choice you have to imagine that you have done it in the satisfaction that you get out of the election that you get out of the election that you get a choice.
The more option you have to have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of degregate about the option you have althio.
Second, which economists call the opportunity for opportunity.
Dan Gilber has shown that in this morning in this morning, we are learning about what we depend on what we compare to what we compare we compare to what we compare them.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative alternative to take on the alternative to imagine the characteristics of the alternative characteristics of alternative alternative to the alternative to make you less satisfied by alternative that you have a little bit more satisfied by alternative that you have alone.
Here's an example. I am a scaffolding of the people who are not New Yorkers.
But here's how we should be able to put up.
So here we have this bound in Hamptons.
A very expensive properties.
It goes the superbit. They have a beautiful bit. They have all the way to them.
What could they want to be more useful for the drug -- it's augued.
Everyone in my neighborhood in Manhattan is leading to the box.
I could be like in front of two weeks and spend two weeks of the idea that the idea that the sample is that the day to have a place to have a place to have a place to have a place to have a place to be a place for a place to be a place to be a place to go."
The food stages of the satisfaction that we have to have a choice that we are on choice is even exceptional.
And the more option of the most options are the amount of choices of these options are going to be perceived as we are perceiving for us as being perceived for us as a as opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon tells a lot of things.
It tells us we should live live on the mission and probably we should do things slow.
But one of the things that tells is that anybody tells a choice a choice to do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things that are going to do what you do you do what you do you do what you do you do the right thing to do you do what you do.
Third of the expectation of waves.
This lovely when I wanted to replace my bluegies.
I think that the little bit of all the time.
And there was a way that the bones were the ones that were one as a drink of the way you would like the drink of the drink of the drink of unk and if you were wearing them to get them to the south-bunch of time and they were starting to were.
So I took me to replace my kids after I had been sample and I said, "Look at the old and I said, "Look, I want a blank walls of my flight of my bads, the wind of my beets, snaps, lies, slow life?
Do you want to be nasts or with farmers or smok?
Do you want to be the doing?
You want to avoid it for the blaaa" -- not the end.
He painted me and he painted my face after I said, "I want to be the guy in the people who were the only one guy who were not a sense of the kind of bads so I spent a blue of all the payments of the blue of the walls of the walls -- with the best of the best of the ones that we haved.
I have really good good all these options have done better for us to choose better.
But I was worse feeling worse.
Why? I wrote a book in which I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt worse that I felt worse is that we had all these options of my expectations about how I should be a wall of these good blank payments have grown up.
I had very sample waves. They didn't have any expectation of the same wavelengths when they were just a single way.
Now when they're 100 times, my mother, my mother, one of them has to be perfect.
And what I got was good, but not perfect.
So I was compared to what I was expected with what I was expected in the comparative that I was deadly removed with what I hope.
The way of choice are in the lives of people can't do something else. The expectations that people have to be those options.
And the way that it will take a little satisfaction that even if you get good results.
No one in the marketing world doesn't know that.
Because if you know that, if you don't know what I don't have an idea about what I am talking about.
The truth is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was all the better when it was that when it was really bad that people were able to experimenter in the way that people to experience the surprising of the surprising thing to do.
Today, in the world, in the world we live -- we are industrialized and we look at the perfect ection -- the best thing you can tell you that things are so good things that you can be so good as you can tell you how things are going to be so much like that you can be so good to be so good.
You never have a surprised because your expectations and my expectations are being made by the sky.
The secret of happiness -- for this is all of the happiness is to have expectations to have expectations to have expectations to have expectations of the redush of the happiness of the happiness --
I want to say -- just a short moment -- that I actually have a big so-called the beautiful so-called the beautiful goal.
I couldn't find something better than that. I didn't stand did not get one.
But let's look at your home is not necessarily a bad thing to do.
And finally, a consequence of a bubble of a wall of you don't know when you can buy a single one as you can't buy tumor is that when you don't get your tumor is that the answer is that they don't clear the answer is clear claimed to be clear the answer is clear the answer is claimed to the answer is that it's not a clear of the blap of a wall of
The world is come from. What was I could be able to do?
When are there hundreds of different styles of disappearing to one that you disappointed and you ask the questions of what?
It's the same clear that the answer to the question is, you know,
You could have better choose to choose better.
A hundred different ways of giving them to choose to choose to choose no scale.
So when people are making decisions, even if people are good news are the results of them, they are good disappointed by them, they are remote to them.
Depression of erupon the erupon the last generation.
I think a big contribution -- not the only thing -- but the important thing to do is that people are also the depression of synuses, is that people are disappointed in their own experiences are very high levels are too high in their own lives.
And when you have to explain these experiences are coming from.
So the general result is that the result of the right thing to do is worse worse.
So let me remind you of it.
This is the doctricky that you all think about it, and it's really true and it's really true.
Without there to be a few choices is better than nice, but here it doesn't matter how many choices are better than a few choices are better than a few choice.
There's a magical number of magic. I don't know what they are.
But I'm pretty sure that we went through that point in the point that the way that the choice is life.
Now, the idea -- I was born -- the idea that I was going to think about is this.
What it allows all of these choices in the industrialized society is the good enemy.
There's a lot of places in the world, and I heard of some of them is not that much choices are not too option.
The problem is that they have too few of them.
So the thing about I'm talking about is a strange problem of Western society and rich society.
And what is frustrating is this: Steve Levitt talks about how these chair chair of the chair and hard to installed children are smoking.
What I'm saying is that these choices, expensive, expensive, and complicated not only helpful.
They actually make paintings.
They actually have us to feel worse.
If something that allows to do in our society to make all the choice that we do all would be transferred in the society in which people have too few choices not only have improved the among people who have been improvement but our lives.
This is what economists are called the Pareto.
The revenue of income is going to be better than people -- not only for poor -- because of the way that exist exist in the way that exist us to make sure us sick.
In conclusion. Did you think about this cartoons, and it's a sophisticated person your fish son?
You know that nothing is possible in this account of the world -- a poor on the world -- so I have to read it and I read it and I read it and I read it and I read it and I read it and I read it out.
But the more I thought I was the more to think about it as I got to think about it as well.
Because the real thing is that if you are the way to be possible for everything to be possible freedom of the wild.
If you hope the smallpox that everything is possible, that everything is possible, the sea level.
You are creating the way and the staff-to-day nurture.
Anyone is that you need a small-term.
This is almost too limited -- probably even for a fish -- probably for a fish for us.
But the absence of a metaphor for the neither is a repleasure and proud to be a lot.
Thank you very much.
