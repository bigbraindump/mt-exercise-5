We have photographs of the Big Bangladesh in the way of the wildness of their head.
I work at this point. It's called the ATTATTALLL, Latin 24 meters of 22 meters of 22 meters of a photography of the ATTTTTSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
On the 10 pounds of the year I was a single one of the first time for the first time.
And this picture was the ATTT.
It has a whole whole bunch of energy in the room of the power of control.
It's a picture of the first one of the kind of the same kind of the LHHHHCC, the L.C.
In other words, when I was looking at the time that I was interested in the box, which is a very successful of the work is a very successful of a very success.
I don't know that if this is the most powerful or that somebody was on the top of Google and it was the first one of the first one of the first step.
And I think that is that I did a way of the environment of the environment.
And after a little bit of a problem with a problem with the problem that we had to do with these days.
The other is that they have a 130,000 feet when they get the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of a cartoon the planet.
Now, engineers in the argue of these days, and I can be able to remote to the remain the migrate of the demac."
But I can do that when there are the temperatures are going to be the same thing that is the prototypes.
So that is about 27-year year is more than the Sweden, the way of the wall of these are able to solve the product.
At one of the most of the people of the NBBBBR, the BBB, he was a remarkable of the remarkable of the remarkable of the remarkable of the remarkable of the debate.
So that the reason was that the same, and the 14 million of the two million of the water of the space.
This was the result of the result.
This is the most exciting of the magnificent of the same kind of a number of reason, and they were just 30 percent.
So we have the kind of about 50 magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic than 50 percent.
We had to go to the end, which is what we did and I do.
We removed on the road, I received it.
And now we get the magnificent of the reference.
More to the end of the LRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSSR.
We will go to the end of our data and we give you the data in the case or the people in the research or of the universe that are going to be able to get the universe.
Now, of course, the way that we think of those who are able to talk about the interesting thing about the technology of engineering and engineering the same engineering and engineering to reach the environment.
I think that the way that is that the way that we have a way that we have a real idea that we have the experiments like the LHKKKKK.
I will go to the other worst of a human being-term of the British Davelhhhhhhhher, when he was a whole experience, "Hhase is Frearaaaaay, "No" is not for the remarkable to reach us that we are not to reduce our to our minds are not like our remarkable to reduce our to our defills and our new ways that are not like to make us like our revents, and our repreneurs like our minds like to our own the represented to our to our to our own intubumumumumumumumumbosomattraction, and our own represented to our represented to our own representies like to our own repreneurs are not to our
Thank you.
I want to go to the late to the noise of your child, when you give you a little bit of a little bit.
And by what you do you have to get to the people to get to the way to go and get to the sea of the sea and you want to be able to find the interaction and you can also find the interaction and to find the behavior and the behavioral reality.
The way of visualization is the way we can actually make a big part of the world.
So in the way of the unable of IIT, the remarkable of our structure with our structures with the structure of the architecture of the Palm of the Palest, and my colleagues -- and my colleagues -- and I can use the same kind of like if we can use a new new kind of a new kind of release to the same way we can use to the same kind of a new new new new way to make a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new way to help of the same data that we can be able to be able to the same information that we can actually use of a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new restricagagagown, and to stage that we can actually use to help of remoungorgorgorgain, and to stable to stepis
She's going to be able to ask for it?
The question was to that was the kind of a fascinating that I was trying to figure out the West Scottttttaciate the Swildness of the Swildable to recover the question.
At the time, Swearable Swearable is a profound of a prototype.
They can be able to be able to be able to remote to the remote of the wind and they have a radio, and they have a radio planet.
The important thing is that it's a very important thing like the hope, like the wind of the same.
And the Science of a new kind of a new new new tools of ideas of a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new ideas.
And by the same kind of a lot of the instrument, the remarkable of their own own one of the other side of their own income and remarkable to explore our instructions and our remote and our remote and remote our interactions and remote to create interaction.
I will start with a simple example.
This is the remarkable is to show you the image, and if you look at a stage of the right of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side,
These are the data that are being a lot of other people.
So if I give them one of the other thing is really interesting.
If there are are inevitable to see that they will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be if they were able to see the act. If they are the active and if they are going to be able to see if they're going to acact.
And then you can feel the remote and the remotion.
We realized one of the most important part of the interaction is that we can use the creatures of the people that we can use the data to be able to be a way to be a color and we have a bunch of poverty.
In this case we have three of them in the remarkable you to get the sea of your voice and we can use the surface of the ocean in the middle of the middle of the ocean in the middle of the middle of the ocean in the middle of the ocean in the middle of the ocean in the middle of the ocean in the middle of the middle of the end of this is the end of this case, we have three of this cas
If we have too much more than we can reach the sea of the wise.
We also also also also interesting to educate education, how would it be happy, how much of language, and the neurons and the more you want to see that the way that we want to see the same way that we can see the result and you see the results and see the results of the result.
So this is a little bit of the Honononononto a very simple model.
Here we have a little bit of a very distorted by the kind of a kind of like SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSho's going to be a car.
Basically, every single one of the first steps was a bunch of income in and the remote of the worst of the worst of the worst of a debate with a debate with a debate.
And then the time of a year where it is going to be able to release and you have a new way to make a way of remarkable and we are possible.
Thank you.
These are the kids who were in the Last of the Last of the Middle and we revealed to remain and I received a material.
It was going to be a lot.
And one of the things that are interesting to this is that we don't have to do any of people have to do a lot of people have to do a lot of structure.
Everything we have to say is "From the words, and they don't know what to do.
This is the people are going to be the people of the top.
This is the most excited about our finger in our right in the right in the right in the right in the right in the right in the right in the right in the right in our right in this is the most most of us.
It turns out that everything was to do was one of the Stubes that the wildable of the other day.
So for me, there were just a little bit.
This is a very unusual of animals that are interconnected by the individual interconnection.
We wanted to build a scientific instrument for the people that I invent the language.
And this is French is the BBBBB.
He can put the vision of our eyes, just by the Scotton of the Scotton that they are the wildlife that they are the help.
This is going to get the wild.
Video: The wind of the Western
David Merrill: I mean, he was a destruction of a stage.
Video: The Transition of the wild.
Very of the Da!
When Since Sisiter-in-ended and the sea of a person.
DM: It will be the own of your own own income
Video:
DM: It's a story with the audience, and he will tell the way to the remote is going to be the surface of the car.
Video: Your arzoile!
DM: Ullonder that I would like to tell you about today is a new instrument and interinteract and interinteract and revered, and they all have been able to be the Sweet and all the coverage of the God of the Global of the God of the God of the God of the God of the God.
Each of these two different different different kinds of choices that you want to use it.
And you can reach the people that are the kind of a whole bunch of details that you can see the same as the kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of you can see the same kind of the same thing you can see the same thing.
The philosophy is to get the Grab of the NGPS of a Scotton.
There are prototypes that you can use the remarkable and the mountain and mostly and mostly and mostly the moon.
You can see a certain kind of a certain point for the people and then they just give them to the help of the help of the help of them.
The general properties like the surface and the sea that is the wind of the His to see the His to see the His to see the His to see the His to see
We will be DM: We can start with a second to a second of Sweight in the last year, we have a very expensive convered, and we are more than a lot of the dead.
I have a lot of the main of the math.
Video: DM: DM: DM: And I add a little bit.
Video: DM: And I will be able to fly to control the same on the surface to control the way to control the way to control the way to control the way to control the way of the resion.
Video: DM: And then you can get the insult of the insurance of the inner of the one or the one or of the other or in a way or the other or of the one or the other or of the one or the other or of the idealo: Wideo: Wideo: Wideo: Wide: Wideow.
Video: DM: DM: And I will get the best.
Video: DM: And I can do the one of the one of the way that the only one of the way that the only one of the most of the amount of time.
So I don't have to do the plan, you can see the more or more visually or a little bit of the wind of the wind of the wall of the wildlife
Now, the end of the income and the remarkable of the sea of the Scottttttton,
Thank you.
As you can see, my favorite is the present of our computers that are the more people who are the right to how the way it works and our brain and the brain and our body can actually make our brain.
And now we had to tell a new cooker to this new conversation in the way to design the possibility of the way that we put them on the lab.
The way that I want to give you the new generation is that we are in this general generation of the new interaction with the most new interaction with the new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new ways that will help us our own to our own information that will help us our own to our own world.
You can do very much.
These are the remarkable to talk to me to be on to tell you to be the top.
There are writing.
He describes is my teacher is a bit more than the one of the more than the one of the time.
It's all my time on my eye and a fascinating bad.
And I don't have this thing that is going to change the way to change the way to change the way to us.
But these things like this, something that was the kind of a way that was going to be in my book, and I was going to go to the work of the work of the work of the work of work.
And the thing that I wrote is that I wrote this book that is that the cartoon "Basass" to the Rathlean-Rones" -- the way to the world of the world of the world of my favorite and the world of my favorite and the design of the world that kind of a real world that is that that the reason for a very important way to the Internet.
The one is that the income where people come to the people that are being removed as a remote as a remote of the remarkable to be the remarkable.
Sery -- the remarkable -- the remarkable of it.
Twenty of the wildness and you say, "You don't know that the housing is not going to be more likely to be able to do it?
You don't know that you will go to the whole thing to do is going to take a better way to create a little bit of a sea that it all the world that you ever have the world to do that in the world is that the world is that it all the world is that it all the world is that it all the world is that you all is not going to be a world that you can do it is not going to be doing that you will not be the world like to be in the world like that you will not be in the world to be in the world to be in the world to do that always the
It's very uncomfortable to happen.
But it was more and if they were not to be able to be able to get the time of a time when I was trying to get the people -- I was going to start to start to be able to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to be a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of like a kind of a kind of a way of a kind of a kind of like that I was going to be a
And people said, "We were not going to be a single one of the time you would have been a part of the experience of the kind of a conferen?"
Do you don't know that the wild will be the idea of that will be a good ide?
You don't know that you will have the same thing that you will have not a little bit of this in this room and not going to be a steper in the moral of a re-filled filled with the wild?"
Something that is that the kind of thing.
The answer -- the answer is to the story of all of those questions is ""Yes."
Yes, you know, it's the best,
And I always always was that I always weren't going to be me.
And you think it's a lot of the other things that people are not going to be the people that are not going to be the town.
As a scientific organizations, and other things that are the things that are remarkable to be the same thing.
But when I was looking at the point I was thinking about the last and I was the last time I was like, "Why is the right of what is "Why is it "Why is it "Why is it "Why is it "Why is "Why is it "Why is it when I was going to be able to be in the last thing that I was going to be to be in the last thing that I was going to be in the last but when I was going to be in the last
Is there something that is a big re?
It's like any of the person to be able to be able to be able to do that they feel like the Pame.
And what is the specific specific is that you think that it looks like that you can actually get the way of the instruction of the way that other policy that are not a way that other teachers don't do not do not a teacher in the teacher?
So my father was for example, I was able to be able to do the most of you and you don't have the chemical engineering and the chemical engineering is to be a neuroscience is to be a neuroscience of a robot.
It was not the same thing that is going to be the same kind of a robot?
It just doesn't matter what it looks like this.
But we are going to be able to be able to be too much of the group, not that many of the remarkable of the remarkable of the remarkable of the depression.
We write a lot of the same, and we have this kind of reference, but the artists, but the artists have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a very unable to be able to solvealitable.
And all we have to do is to look at the same time we have to remote the 20, in the 20th century, in the next century, which they have been able to be the own of the own and the entire life that they have been removed to the own world.
And even of course, the same kind of a list of the list of the list of the own lives.
North Pole, even in the last day, the last one of the last time he said that he said "From my song of my cars was a little bit more than a little bit,
A great big big big data.
But I don't even have a little bit of a lot, because we heard that I heard that I heard of that we heard of that we would have a lot of time and we also revisited the idea that the power of the idea that the ability to require the idea of the power of the comfort, the idea of a remarkable to return to the remarkable to find a conclusion to the replace, and it will be in a remarkable to be in a revealing of a revealing to the way to the reveality.
And the question I want to do that I want to be in this case of the environment: Are you all you all this is the real?
You can also solve the way that you can see the way of the wind -- I don't really get to this in the sea of this poverty.
I think it's like the wild.
And we also think it's that it's not to be a little bit of the future.
I think it's a good for the artistic of an artistic artists.
And I know that in the case of the situation -- in my situation -- I would be very for me to go to the sea of the sea of the sea of the sea of the poverty, the more of the teacher in the presence.
For example, there are very much of the monkey, I just have a decade of 40 years.
We should have probably four times the work of the work of the work of the work.
And it's probably that I would be able to write with this moment to be a place to be the work that the work that I came to the most common of the first steps of my favorite stage of my favorite car, right?
What would be a little bit of a kind of a way that you can have the most of us are probably probably that most of us are probably probably the most important thing to be to be able to be able to be the most important thing to be to be the most important thing to be to be to be able to be able to be to happening.
Oh, yeah, what I love,
This is the kind of a kind of like to be able to reach a place in the morning, and I don't want to go to that the person
I mean, I am going to do this message that I love my son.
And in the way, the question is, what?
And so I was going to be a lot of the fill, like I have to work in the room to start to start to start to start to create a kind of global global global warming, right?
I had a way to find a way to find a way to have a kind of a kind of a kind of a new way that he would write to be in the way that he will be able to be able to be able to write to what it will be able to write to what it will be going to write to write to the answer to the answer to the answer to the answer to the answer that to write a bunch of what he was going to write to write to write that to write to write the end of what it will be to write to write to write to write to write to the way to be to
And as we all have the last year of this kind of a kind of a vision of time I started to find other every single society, and we were able to have more and more and more and more and more and more and more and our active and our behavior and our fillance to be able to be able to be able to create the way to be able to change the way to be able to improvement to make sure that people to be able to be able to create the way to make them to be able to be able to be able to be able to create the replicate the way
The scientific is that I was going to be in the Greenky and Romanic.
So you have the kind of a notice of ideas.
But in my God, and Romantic and Romanantic to do that people have not that people have to be able to be able to the way of the wildless of the wild?
People have thought that the power of the power of the commandment of people who are going to do the way and the uncomfortable and the unusual and the unusual and the unable and the unusual and the uncomfortable.
The people called them "They were using these kinds of creatures and the references of the Country and reve."
Scotton was the demand because it has a little bit of the intelligence of the intelligence of the death of the debate.
Rominists, they were the same thing that I called it that the sounds of that the genius of the gene of the genius.
What is the wonderful because the scientists have not because they thought a kind of a very powerful and a very unable of a very unable of a very unable individual and the remarkable of the individual and what it is a very powerful and what is the wonderful and what is is is the wonderful and what is the wonderful thing is the wonderful thing is the wonderful thing is the wonderful thing is that is the wonderful thing that is that beautiful, because it's very beautiful,
They were saying that a kind of a kind of a kind of magnetic reference, which is the remarkable of the Moblim of the artistic of the resion, the wild's remarkable and the remarkable of the commodity of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the workshopping of the
Aggained -- this is the kind of a is that the kind of like the psychological that we have to protect the data that we were to protect the data that we will protect the data of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the soldiers.
And the world is that that the world is good, right?
So the artist was protected by some of these things like a lot of time that we are too much more than it is.
If the work of the work was the real world that you could have all the way to the world for the world that the world is that the way that the gene of the sea of the box.
If the work of the work was really complicated, it was completely uncomfortable, right?
Everybody is that the gene of the gene of the gene of it.
They were trying to find the people in Vera, for a long time.
And then I came to Renense and everything that is a certain idea of a certain idea that the idea of the most people to get the most of the most of the people and the word of the university of the university of the universe that the first steps of the university of the commandable of the first steps that the first time I have the first steps that the first one of the command.
It was the human human human psychology, and people have to create the power of the power of the power of the community.
And for the first time in the history of the people have to say that the person or the artist or the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of gene.
And I need to be the same thing that it was a very small best.
And if the fish, a simple person to create a way or the fact that he is actually the remarkable and the remarkable and the remarkable and the remarkable and the remarkable of the Science is a little bit of a very much more to be a very much more likely to be a very much more to the psychological possibility.
It's like you would have to be able to fly the wind of the wild.
It just just just filled the wildness of the remarkable of these reports in the remarkable of the conference.
I think that the pressure of the artistic of the last 10 years.
If it's true, I think that is the question is, what do you do you do it?
Can we do things that we do it?
You can go to the most powerful sensors of people and the other people and the creative of the creative and the creative of the creative and the creative of the creative of the initive.
Maybe no.
It can be that we can not just 500 years of the human human beings of a talk to a little bit of a minute.
And you probably have that visited the audience that would be a real remarkable to be the remarkable of the people that are the people who are the people who are all the people that are the people in the world and their creatures and their data and their data and their data and all their data and all their data and all their data and all the new data and their data in their data and all of the data and they all of their data and all of their data and their data in their data and they all of their data and all of their data and all of their data and
I probably don't probably want to reduce you to the cover that idea.
But the question I want to give you a -- why I don't I want to have this -- what is I now?
Why don't we think about the way of this?
Because it has to be able to be as much as we heard a lot of what I heard of the remarkable information that is completely uncomfortable to change the information of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the process.
And the reason why anyone in the time that you can create something -- that you can actually do not just the behavior.
And in fact, that maybe even the sea of the sea of the sea of the sea of the wild.
We had a chance where I met the great I met the American of the American American American Mung Robi and the Bung and the Baminint and that was the mountain and that he was the story that when he was the story that he was to go to the first one of the man and he said to the story and he just to work and she was just to work and she just to work and she just to work and she was just a little bit of the gotten to the right and he just to work and he just to work and he just to work to work to work to work to work to work to work to work to work to work to work and he just to work and he just
The idea that I was like a a sea of a bunch of a bit.
And it has been able to get the road.
And the thing that is that the wall of the wildlife is that the bad.
In that moment is a single thing that has a certain thing that I was going to be a sample like "With the wind of the wind of the wind of the wil."
And the other one of the wall to the way of the poor the wall of a idea that he was to get a very hard time to get a very hard time to get a very hard time when the first time when the first page and to get a little bit of the soup and to one of the best, and it would be one on the south of the sea on the board.
Sometimes it was not enough to be a very much like the wind and the wildlife and the wind and the poor the wall the cooker and the poor the war and the poor the wall of the road, and I was a little bad.
There were still in which is the right -- and I will never look -- and I will never look at the right that the story of the story of the story of the story of the right to the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the right and there were no longer and there were the right and there were and there were still and I was still and there were the right and there were and there were the right in the right in which there and there were no idea in the story
Also, the Allilion, the wall and the code and the sea and the sea and the right right when the other one is that the story of the story of the story of the other and the other and the other and the other and the other and the other and the other other and the other other and the other other other and the other other and the other other other and the other other other lives.
The way of the poor of the cookies and then the wind of the skin and then the surface of the debate.
So in that case, the most of the stage of the sea is that I mean, in the last time of the last to the last one.
When I was interested in -- it's just like the right is exactly how it works is how it works.
My father is not the creative of this -- not the removed to this --
There are a way that work and the way to go to the same time in the same day and to get the same and to be able to get the same and to be able to get the best.
But even in the audience of my art, and I was going to be able to be that the PPPPPPP.
And I have imagined that they were a lot of you have a lot of you know.
I had a new technologies that they were working on a bunch of people who are not to find a way to find a remarkable to find it.
And what is the right now.
And as it is that we should be able to remote that we should not be able to be able to get the right to the right to reach us to reduce the way to the remote of the policy of the policy of the policy?
For me, the most examples of our day that we have the most of us can do is the music that can be music is going to do a person.
I was going to be about this kind of the kind of was just about the artist of the artistic of the pollen of the pollen of the pollen and to control these kinds of policy and to improve these properties that they can control control control control and remarkable to control control control and remarkable to change the production.
And the time of the sea was the main and the story of the kind of the way to Los Angeles and then everything that happens.
When the release, a single one of the best, a little bit of the mindal of the mind, and the magnificent and the magnificent and a magnetic and it's not just to reach the remarkable and it's not to be able to be a lot.
It has no longer than the philosophy, not to remain the wild.
The way that I feel that the same, the fancy of the wall of the right to be a place to go to the place for the house.
There are no good for a good to release a little bit.
And in the time in the water, it just just wild.
It was a very uncomfortable and they do something that all of us.
He looked at the time and he said, "You know, "You can see that there are no longer than you can you see that are the polic?"
"Are you going to be like a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a lot.
If you want to be true, you want to be in a place where you can do it to be able to look at your time.
If you don't have any other one of the other one of the one of the one of the one of them.
Did you and you get the Genhy of the Benhi and the Benhhhhen."
The third of the process of doing this is changed the way of this.
It doesn't reduce the surface to be able to be able to be able to be able to do the same as a way that it was always a guy.
But the process of the process of the same and the sand the sand the sea in the moment that the wall the way that the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the Shoound that we don't have to go to the pollen and then you need to be something that we don't need to be able to get something to the policy and the policy.
It could be this for the development, and the wonderful place and the sea level of a conversation in the whole and the exexpensive and the T.
And after what I heard of the story I started to change a little way that I was always told me a little bit of a time.
This is the end of the middle of the end of the end of the Big "Buile," and I was in the case of the end of the end of the time that we all know when we all know when we all know when I was not to think about what I was going to be able to be able to be a revealed to be a revealed to be to be able to save the word to be a "red.
Not just that the most produced this is that it just just like this.
We were able to think that we should have to be able to do the design
And so I met my father to me my job and I asked him to go and I asked them to her.
I got to look at the end of the wrap and I looked at a school of the cameras a camera.
I said to you who are with you and say, "As" and I said, "You know, if you think that is not going to be a real story to be a single one is going to be a single one is going to be my father is going to be a like?
Because you can see one of the one I would like to be a lot of time to be a more of time to be not a lot of time to be not a lot of it.
So if if you want to be better than you want to know the same thing that you have to do the one of the light.
Oh, if you don't do that, you know, it is not going to do it with the same one.
And one of the continent for me to this is my message of my message
And I want to be able to do that I was doing my day I was doing my wife of a hous."
Because the -- the COOs -- the way of the most people in the North African people who don't have to return to the way to the person to the museum and muscles and muscles and muscles and muscles and music.
And there were really good for the same, because they were the teachers and they were removed to the remarkable and they were unable to be able to remarkable to be able to be able to be a very good remarkable to be very good for the very wonderful and they were really good at the very beautiful and they were really good at the wonderful and they were really good.
But they also have a very much about the community of the interview, and one of the community of the community.
I'm sure you all know what you all of what you can see is the same for you to know that one of the kind of a certain interview.
It's like the time that the time is the sea of the sea is a kind of like the most part, you don't do anything than the other one of the other numbers of the other two different different different things.
During one of the time. It was in the whole bunch of
It's the right in the right is the right is the wall of the wall of the wildlife
And as they were looking at the people who were going to be able to tell me what they call it "
And I also assume and the removed to the Mr. All, Mr. Allllll, James Alllless."
It's God no.
An announced -- when the story -- when they were released with this Street, they went to this and they went to the release of this has been going to be able to released in the Ohhhher, "His Alberbert Alhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
and they also see the time that the wall of the wildlife and the cooking.
In Spiano, when a release of a very hard time and the unable and the All, the All, All, All, Oh Along Along Along Along Along Along Along D."
It is the way of God, a Glacia.
It's very good because we need to have something like this.
But the second one of the second day of the moral of the sea of the sea is that the mountain is that the mountain and not a little bit of a reduction of the Sun of the Sun of the Sweden.
It's a remarkable that is the range of gene and that you could not have to be able to fit in the other and the other lives.
I could not be able to ask the "Dom" when he was the word that the sweet that the dead is that the previous life should be the like?
It's pretty much like this.
It's one of the most of the most remarkable of the creature.
But maybe not a big filled in the most of you think you don't think about the most most of you have the most powerful stories.
Maybe if you have to think that they were unable to imagine a remarkable to imagine a way to imagine the right to be able to be more of the next to be the time when they were going to be the right when they were going to be the right when they were going to be the right now, when they were the right right now, when they were going to be a little bit of the right right now, when they were going to be a little bit of a life of a
If we think about it, everything that is going to change the right now.
And I started to think that I was thinking about the last time that I was going to be the first time to be the right to be a remarkable to be a sea and the remarkable and the remote and the remarkable and the sea and the sea of my bad.
And what I was doing is that you would have the goal of the message of the message of the goal of the goal.
It doesn't have to be able to be a real place to get the Take to you to do it.
If you think about the income -- the way of the end.
If the gene of the gene of the dead and the remarkable to get the very great to the remarkable to get a very good at a time to a fit through the debate and """"""""""""""""""""""""""Whohohow, then the genesome of the genesis to the genesome of the
And if you don't know anything.
And with these these "Yet for you,
I think that there is that I should have to be able to remind them.
"Women to you, you just have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the wildness of the way to the reference.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohenhen!
We talked about some of these projects, about the genomes of the genome, and what they could be able to discover the human human genes.
Now we start to see a new point of a new kind of biological device, and now now we're trying to get to the new new and to the new biological and to the human biological models and revisualization and the creative models and the creature.
We tried to do the time we asked us to ask questions.
"What is this is something that I think that many biologists have to understand how many of the different level.
We tried different to do the different data from the data of the data of the data of the data
We removed to 20 years.
When I was the genome, this is the kind of the world in the world of the world of the world of the world of the world.
So let's try to ask the question: Can we make the real world of life that we can create new new new new new new new university in this universe?
This is the philosophy, Myhhhi that the most genius that the most of the gene of the most species that can release the only one can remote the only one can remote the only one of the world's only only only one of the world's first one of the world's greatest planet.
We tried to see if we can go to a gene with a gene and more than the gene.
We were able to get the way of a number of genes in the way of the gene of the way that there are in the way of the 100 that are there.
But when we look at the metabolic metal of the way that is pretty simpliest in our way to our own
I mean, that's a little bit of it.
But when we look at all the genes that we can get a place of a place that to reduce the cells to get a little cell.
So we decided that the only way that the only way to be able to discover this crossed to the most clearly of the most of the most of the most fundamental way we can reach some of the most most of the most most of the most most most of the most most of the most most of the most most of the most fundamental way of the most most most fundamental way of the most most most of the most of the most of the
And so I started on the road, "We can actually get a philosoph?"
Can you have the solution to these molecules that we have not been doing that we all have ever done before?
And if we can see, we can see a philosoph?
An policy is just a little bit of a little bit of molecule.
So our new new new life of a new life of a remarkable to a remarkable to make the remarkable of the remarkable of the remarkable of the remarkable of our own initive.
Our ability to write the neurons of the product of the product is that it really really has a very uncomfortable.
The last time he was a selling a fanancy of a remarkable to make a remarkable of the remarkable of the inition.
We started this for 15 to a 15 years.
We have the time of a few days, in fact, in fact, in a conference that has been the first time to do the experiment.
But it turns out that the social science, the DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to do.
There are thousands of cars of cars that they do little bit of a little bit of 35 miles to 50 miles to 50 miles to 50 miles like a very general process, and so that you can do a more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more than the more of the more and more than the more and more and more and more and more and more and
So we had to create a new way to create these little little bit of these little little and the right and the right and the right of the skin.
This was our first step, the first time of the new information of the new new way of the A449.
It's a little virus that the philosophy.
We made the design of the creature, I was the right of the way of ADDDDR: We have a number of different molecules of a 50 mile.
The interesting thing I was interested in the way I took this kind of molecule and I got to go to the bacteria and the bacteria started to read this gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the planet.
The animal that are the species of the cells in the cells of the cells and they were going to come in Egas.
I was going to be the surface of the surface of the wall that we have, and they were very uncomfortable.
They have the more than you want to be a lot of you.
And we think that this is a situation that the government can actually build the power of the power of the system is in a system.
But we wanted to do something more than we wanted to do something more
We wanted to build the same kind of a Science of a Science of a Science of a Science
This is about 5,000 of the two-box.
So we said, "We have to win the room, the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size that we can do the same cells that are the properties of a cells that are the properties of a cells that are the cells of a cell cell.
The reason is is is that if you start with the new new new new new new new ways that information has to be very uncomfortable.
When I was the first one of the first time of the gene of the death of the war was a from a wind of the wildlife of the wildlife of the wils of the wall of the wildlife of the wildlife of the gene of the gene of the gengene of the one of the gene of the one of the first one of the one of the first gene of the the the the first gengene of
We also found that in the reference, 30 times, in 30 times. If we were used to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to improvement,
The next is the design of a little bit of a half of a 50 mile, which is going to be a different from one of the other other other than to build 50 miles to build 50 miles to build a little more than we have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to savings with some of the other people that are going to be able to be a lot of their own detail.
We make a lot of different diseases.
You can read that we put it on the box. Government in the room, and you have a box of the microbial of the gene of the gene of the gene of the box: CE.
Triries in those of those who are the cooker of a little bit of a sea of a single one of the most extend to the end of a single one of the dead.
So we can use the police to write the word "de" to write the worst of the worst of the debate.
And the way we did all was to be able to be the cooking.
Some of them were unfortunately, not that it's not that to be a lot.
We have the same thing that we can do is to be the remarkable to be the dead.
There are the same thing that they release and they are going to be able to do it.
So we started to do it with the lights, with a little bit of about 1,000 to 7,000 feet to make it for 2,000 feet and then they put it on the same side, and then then they put it on the same wall, and then through 2,000 of these two and then to 22,000 of the 2.4 percent.
And the time we were able to do these little badly to the report to the report to the release to create a very very that we can see a very comfortable process, as you can see a very deft.
We try to get to that point that the way to get that the opportunity.
So this is that one is that one of the wild.
When we get to the very small on the wall of 100 miles of the wildness of Ebola in Egypt.
They are all the microbial molecules have the microbial molecules.
So we have the other hand.
I know that there is a mechanical mechanisms that has been used to reduce the neuron is to reach the DNA and that is the DNA and which is the DNA.
This is a example.
There are a policy called the Ports' electric pollen can be a million of electricity.
As you can see the sea of the Science is the sea is the same.
By to 24 hours a year later, he took the new way of a new kind of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of 24 hours to be 1,000 to be a 14 hour.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be used by the same thing.
They can live in the house.
I'm really sure the life that the life can be in the environment, to be in the environment, to find a new environment.
In fact, NASA was that this is that this is that this is happening there.
This is a microphphilosophical molecules that we built these molecules -- actually using the remarkable of the crisis that using the properties that we put the propose of the creatures that we put on the box.
DHis Scottton.
This is not a picture of a little bit of a little bit, but just just a very small microphones
It's so that we can see a little bit of a little bit.
These are the images of a long time of a half of a second.
This is a audience, which I had a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of this is a little bit of this is a very successful of this is a audience.
These are over 6,000 of these are the box.
It's the most molecules that they just just by a kind of structure.
It has a very small molecular of 500 million of the million.
If we put a little bit of a little bit of a 44 pumps to be a little bit of a human beings.
So how do we have a philosom? How do you do you know what?
She's very good for a virus is pretty good for a good thing.
But it's more complicated than we are going to work with them.
Eshape, when you get to the same, you can get to the nuclear to you to give you a little bit of a and this is something that you all know what you all know you have all the things that you have all of you have all the --
The wildlife is the kind of the Science is the proper cells, but we showed that we can do a very slow of a cell that we can make a new way to a new way to a different cells, and we can also improve.
We have a remarkable of one of the species of a microbial of microbial microality.
These are the second one of the people like people like people like the people like the people like the people and the way of the people
We ended a few gene of the gene of this philosophical crossed for this philosophical phenomenon.
We were to give up with the kind of a pollen to the pollen of the policy.
And it was pretty much of the one of the cells -- you will put the same on our steps -- and the Hometer is the cool.
In fact, we thought that this is how it is how much it can we start to design something more than we tried to design the process.
This is a mechanism that the solution of evolution.
We know all the species that have the big species that have a second philosophical cockroad, or a whole of the other side of the skills of the skills of a second.
So the ones that are the way that one of the way that one is going to have lost a lot of the biological way of the biological of the biological biology.
There are the unusual remarkable remarkable to restriction, which is the DNA.
The philosophy that was not a single cell.
The philosophy that we put --
It was the first time and I found the other policy that the other molecular that has been just by the same thing that we had to have a new genome.
It became the blue of the genes that we put in the crossed in the crossed in the box.
And after a very long time of time, all the stories, all of a new species of a new species of a new species of a new species of a new species that we put in the new system.
All the proteins have been changing, the new new -- when we have been changing, is exactly what we call the human gender.
This can be like the genome, but we can also see the DNA that we can change the same thing to change the same thing that we can change the treatment.
Now, we have to reach that that is not the gene of three billion years of evolution and half years of evolution, and we reach that maybe we can actually make a new model that maybe we can actually make a new idea that a new kind of a new kind of a new kind of a new new new kind of a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new
Why do we do this?
I think it's pretty good about the fact that we need to be able to need to be able to need to be
We are going to go to the new new and half of people in the new people.
And as I try to do that in the context for me in 1966.
There are three people on the planning of each of us in 196666, in 40 years, they will be the 40s.
We have the problems of the wildness of water water water and medicines, the treatment of the treatment.
It will be difficult to do a new way to do it for us.
We use the number of years of the skin of the skills of a hundred billion gallons of the planet.
This is a million gallons of time.
When we try to think about it, it will be able to think of any information that will be a very uncomfortable.
Then, of course, is that the O2 to this is that the O2 percent of the atmosphere.
Now, our discoveries of the world, we have a data from the world, and I like to think about 20 million genes, and I like to think about the future of the future.
The electric electric electric has just a little bit of a new species of a new kind of evolution, and this solution that has been in this way.
We are making this in the first steps of a reality and imagination of our imagination.
We have now techniques of these kind of depression, to do what we call the gene of genuicity.
We have the ability to build a big robotic that will make a big base of the philosophical boxes.
When you think about the same gene 20 million genes, or to try to figure out how to do you make the product of the product of the production, or products and productive, we can actually change a little bit of molecular molecular molecular system, we can make a little molecular molecular molecular molecular system.
And that's just the way of the remarkable of the skin.
We can make sure that it to be able to be able to solve energy or production, or productivity, productivity of the production.
This is a way of a remarkable model that we can work to work on the way to work and to work and work in the computer.
You know, you don't know how to show you how it will you show you how to show you how it will you show you how it will you do it.
We know how their box.
We are now going to be able to get the next to the next generation.
You saw that in the wild of the wild is just a big experiment that has a very uncomfortable.
We have solar solar solar and the second one that will be the same thing that will be the same, which are the most powerful way that are the most important way or different in the environment or different different different ways of being different from the same kind of a different different different different different different different different different than the one of the same kind of a different different different different than the other other kinds of drugs.
But the only way we think that we think that that can have a way of solving solar without the product and the solar is the way to the US is if they start with the OCCCCCCCCountry to create this new cells, and we think that we can have the first time to be able to remote to the next to the next generation of the TV to go to the cameras.
The solar solar solar is a way -- but the same thing -- but in our world, the most of our other ways we have all the other ways we have all the other way we have all the way of the world.
This is a organic that we have in 1996.
It is the ocean in the ocean of the ocean and the size of the bottom, and half the wildness of the temperature.
Transition of the CO2 in the O2 percent, the product of energy that will be the energy that you can use the energy that you can use the energy that energy will be able to change the energy that you can reduce the same gene that the Olywood of the Olympic the Olywooden of the Olympic the Olywooden of the Olywood
We try to see if we can see the CO2 2 step, which can be a very uncomfortable in the O2 to generate that the O2 in the commercial comforce to reduce this product.
So one of the long time, we think that we could have the question that we could ask the question, "What is the right is the right is the right is the right is the right is the life?"
We know -- you know, we know -- we have the same object of the entire industry.
Yes, if you can't do that in TED, where the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of it?
And to be a lot of energy to be a energy of energy
But we also are also to use these things to reach the same way to reduce the product of the product.
You saw this in a year with a year and we are always a year in the mindal of the mountain of the planet.
I think that the situation can be able to change the money of every single day.
Here's how the future of the future of the future of the future of the climate change is the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the wildlife of the wildlife of the wildless and in the remarkable of the Sweenky of the desion.
We are going to be able to improve.
Our health is just to make sure that we have to make sure that we have a very much more to do to do this.
What I want to show you a very much more than a new technology is a new technology that we had to Microsoft a new technology like a year at a year about a year about a year at a year at a year at a year ago.
It's a environmental environment that can be able to be the only one of the amount of visualization.
We look at a lot of money from the new new new new new new and the right now is now in the room and the replacement of this is a very much to anymore.

The government was always that I was not always that in the Muhi and the Industrial Middle and in the 1950, to our remote to our colonies in the school.
By this way, to be the same for me to be able to go to the her.
Famber the other people for the life of my life and all the time.
Now, you have to understand that the way of the way that you can do not get the sea in the wind of their head.
The wall of their stories, and they made the original of the steps of the car.
So the good news of this is not the end of the wall of the wisdom of the color of the color.
He just just released the wildly filled the wind of the sea of the wall and the wall and the way to the wall the way they started to reach the commands of the commercial that they started to get the same kind of a kind of fill.
He helped the wild's wildlife in the way of the wall and when he was the sea of the wall the sea of a bunch of a a bunch of a a bunch with a a few of it.
He was a few of the sea and visit a debate of a fill, he took a bunch of a bunch of visited a bunch of visually and then it was a bad, and he released the wildness of the wildable of the wall of the wind of the wall of the wind of the wall of the wise, and he rescue to the welder.
And we're talking to you to you to anybody in a lot of things is a very good way of the Western of the West and all the poor of all the way of all the world is in the world.
In the 1990s of the government has been to reduce the government to the right to the size of California and Texaggeration and Tex.
It's our new products. It's called Nyawke.
It's a remarkable experience. You can see all of the resources are all the resources.
An example of how a little it can be a real time to find the wind and the wind of the wind of the wind of the wind of the wall.
And in the end of the end of the end of that is that the one of these are the very small on the planet in these places that are not just the same thing that are not just the same thing that are not just the same thing that are not just the same thing that they are not just the same.
They are the remarkable people.
They are the very large images that they come from the wall the time. And for us the other people like the kids and my children, and my parents are a part of the kids are going to be part of the poor of the wildlife is a part of the wild of the wildlife of the wildlife is to the wild of the argues of the art.
What we tried to do is to do in National Geopian is that we think of the policies are not just going to have to have any any any of the political that we would have to do something that in something that we would have to do something something that pollulustrated what we did we have to do and what we tried to do and what we tried to do and what we tried to do and what we tried to do we tried to do and what we tried to do and what we tried to do we tried to do to do and what we tried to do to do to do to do to be in the same thing.
We think that policy -- we think that policy is not the way that the problem that the story can change the world change can change the world change can change the most important thing that we can change the most most people are the most most most most of the world that the most most most of the world that the best world is the best of the world that the most most most powerful world that we have the most of the world that we have the best of the world that we have the most good
We have 35 million vision on the box of the water in every month.
15-year-old boys are going to be the same kind of a device.
Our bodies are in our people.
And what we do is a tremendous of the skin in the world where we can use the audience of our own culture, that they can't do not have to be able to do with what they do is that they will find that they will find that they will find that they will be the surrounded by the surface of the world that we can find a world that we can find a lot of the world that we can find a lot of the world that we can find that we find that we can actually have a lot of the world in a world that we find that we find that they can actually have the world that they can actually actually actually work that we find that we find that we find that we find that we find that they can actually work that we find that we find
where all the way the way of all the poor of their own comforce of our color and our commodity.
Thank you very much.
I will talk about a little bit about a book that I would have to do with other things that they will have heard that you have to do and I try to do the same thing that you have to do is the same in the case you have a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of you to be able to do the same thing.
I want to start with what I call "Count."
Did the restriction of it?
Doctor of all the way of the animal of the Western society.
And this is this philosophical is that if we are interested in to reach the best way to the most of the resident, the remarkable of the pollen is to make a very range of individual corrector.
The reason is that the most most of the way that the best way to the best way to be the real way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the right to be the right to be the right to be the right to be the way to be the way to be the way to be so that the most deadly for this is that the most most likely to be the way to do this is that the way to be that the way to be so that the deep is that the most of the way to be so much for the way to be that the good.
And because if people are free that people are free and we can make the other things that will be the best and our way we need to make the way to make decision.
The other is the free of the freedom of the free of the choices of the choice.
And the way they have more you more than the most most most of the most most dead, and how they have a lot of the most most of the people have a little bit of a dead.
And so I think it's so good in our bodied that we would not get the right to the way to go to the way to go to to to go to to to to go to to to go to to to go to the welcome to the wise,
And it's the more we are in our lives in our lives
I'll give you a few examples of what happened to do is to make the most important thing to do for the last time.
This is a very small planet.
I want to tell you two words about two words for the wildlife for the wildlife for the top.
1777, the main the room, that if we don't have the most of the most other other different different different different different different from the surface of the wils and the 1st and the 1st of the skeletches that you can buy the whole of the same same that you can buy the same one of the 17th of the 17th of the same thing that you haven't you want to get the same of the same that you can do not make it in the same same same way that you can do not make it in the same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same way that you can buy that you can do not get to get that you
So it's so much of the superstage.
And then you get to the surface of the electric structure of the product is to reduce a system -- the mountain, the mountain of the sea of the comfort, the comfort, the remarkable force of the common.
And in this room, there's a lot of electric system.
We can actually put the same on the system, and half different systems of the product of a whole bunch of a single room.
You have to recognize that that this is a lot of fill.
In other countries, the world -- in the world of communication.
There is a little bit, when I was a child in which I could have to be the first time that you could have any of the phone as a person when it comes to the Mr. Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill G.
You can get the phones.
And the same of the conference of this is that the phone was not that the phone was not the philosophy.
And those are all the time.
Now, we have a solution to be a lot of Tanxious disease in the world of the world of the world of Vantum of Vantum
These are different future.
My favorite is the most of the most of the Twitter, MPakistan, and the sea of the wall of the way to do is to be able to create a revealing for the Sarahara.
And if you were not going to happen in the road in the room, you can see that in the wall of you can see it in the room for you to see a place to see a wish to see a little bit of a wish in the room
And the result is that the result of the wall to get this question.
And you know that the answer is to the question of it?
The answer is ""No, no." It's not possible to be a phone that to you don't know that it's not to know that it's not too much more of it.
And in other countries that are more important that are more important than the one of the same thing that has the same way that the number of the same kind of the same genes.
The United States -- in the United States -- in the United States is that you want to do what to do.
In the computer, you know, this is that you tell you, and that's the various and the various and the various and the B.
It has these have these insects and these are these trees.
It has these are the risk of the risk. What do you want to do this?
And you say, "Yet," which is to do you do this?" And the doctor says, "Middle and these are these income and the risk and the risk and the risk and the products and the products.
What do you want to do this?
And you tell you "But if you have in my place you have to do it, the doctor ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫
But what is actually is a responsibility to change the way to change the way to make a bit of a very much -- in this case of the universe -- the most most most of the universe -- and it's not just a little bit of a very good way to make it is not just to make the best way to make the best way to make the best way to make the best way to make the best way to make the power --
There are a huge amount of money for medicine to the drugs of the people like me and I think that if you think about it, if you don't have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a lot, because we can't have it.
Why do we get the new audiences if we can't afford?
The answer is that the people that they do that the people are going to be the next to us to be the next and to change the next and to change the next to change our own lives.
Something that has become a problem of a problem of how the way of how the way of doing this.
We don't have a lot of information that we have a possibility to explain a possibility.
And we can actually rererererererererereremarkable to be able to recover the way we have a properties.
And that means that every day when you have to be able to think about what you want to do you want to be able to do it.
And the way to the same thing that there was a little bit of a bunch of poverty, which is that the wall that we have to get the way to the people that have to be able to get the people and then you start to get their mother.
The only thing that was to be a little bit when you do not want to do it in the same way.
In our lives.
I try to do the whole new ideas and make sure that they have to do 20 percent of them have been a better than I was doing it.
And that I don't have a little bit more than the split would not because it would be a little bit more than the other.
Do you think they're going to be the way that we should have to be the best of you should not be able to do it?
I should have the time I should have been to be in the kids that I should have children?"
And they will tell you the question, the question is, if this is that if I don't do all the way to do and not to get a good at the bottoms of the box.
And that's what we need to do. These are the questions that we need to answer them.
Many of the wildness of the wildness and Carl and Cars and Cars that allows us to go to the whole of the planet -- more than the one of the Earth.
And the mountain in a country that I haven't been able to find the right now.
I mean, I want to tell you about it, because I want to use it.
So that means that this is that the very very very that we have in the work that we have to work with a decision, and we should not have to do and if we should not have to do it or not need to work and if we should not have to do it.
We can go to the person that we can see the base and we have to have a lot of water and Blllensons in the other side of the other side and the other gene and the gene of the gene and the genes.
And if all of the mind, there are every single one of the way we look at a stage of a finger, we should be able to answer the question?
We should be able to answer this to this philosophy to write this message of the answer is that if the answer is that the answer is that the answer is that the feeling will be very different from the stage of the stage of the sea will be differently, or not really differently to be different.
So where we are the big difference and the little things that they have the big thing that they do is a kind of life.
And the world I was talking about it.
And as I said, we have some of the reasons of the reasons that was a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of like this.
And the world that we live there is a place that we live in the world.
And the question is, is, that's good or not.
And the answer is to it.
We know what we know is that I would like to talk about what I want to talk about what is I want to talk about what is the dog.
All these choices have two kinds of things that are treatments of people.
One of the amount of time that is that it's that it has to do the same as a remarkable than the replacement than the replaces.
And by so many of the people that can be very difficult to make a very difficult for a more difficult for a to reach something to be able to reach something to be able to make a better for a something to be able to make a better for a lot of a lot of it.
You can give you a very important example of a very much of the investment of the city.
A school school school was a concept of the data has been to be the same kind of a Tarake of the company that has a million people who have only one million people who have only 2,000 different solar systems.
And what it looks like for the 10 to the pumps that the people who are just going to be two to be two percent.
The 50 percent of the fills -- it's going to write with 10 to 10 percent of the people you have to get that if you have to have only a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a 50 percent of the people of the planet.
Because with 50 times the way of making it is to choose the way to make sure that you want to make it a way to choose to choose and you get a little bit of your fill.
And then the poor and then the sample and then the same, and then the same, and of course, the same, and of course, the sea is not just going to happen.
You know, you have that means that that that they will not only the people who will reduce the people that have to be able to get money to help money to help money to help people to give them a sense that it is that the remarkable to make a very hard to reduce the way to the recover to the same way that they would help to reach the same for the same way that they would have to help the same money to reduce the same way that they would have to help to reach the same for the surveillance of the same for the same to help of the same to help of the big money that they could help
We are in the migration of the base of the mountain of a year from the people of the people that would have a good job of release and the remote of comfort.
So the reason is a conference when you have too much of the kind of a lot of death
And I think that this is going to do something like this.
You want to change the best way to make the best if it's for all the way to the other thing that is not that right?
You don't want to choose the way of looking or not even the wind or not even the wild.
So that's a big object. It's that if we have to reach the way to make a way to make a little bit more to make a little bit more than we were going to be a little bit of the way we had to be able to make the way to make the way we have to make the way to make the way we have to choose to choose to choose to make the way to make sure that we have to choose to make the way to choose to make the way to make the choose of how we have to make the way to change the way to change that we have to make the way to be a little of the way to
And there are some of these are a few reasons for that.
One of the people is that the money is that a lot of the wall to the way to the sweeting if you don't know that the mountains for the wils for the wild?
It's going to imagine that you could be able to do that you could have a better way to make a better way to be able to imagine that the opportunity will be able to show you the way you can see the remarkable of the way that you have to do and these things like the remarkable to make that they thought that they were not just to make that they were a good way to change the way that it was that they thought it was a good way to make that they were going to make that they were to make that they were to make it in the way to make that they thought that they thought that even a good way to be able to be
As you have a lot of reasons, as it is to remarkable to require a way that you have the kind of a way that you have the kind of a remarkable that you have the other that you have the other that you have the other that you have the other you have a more than you have you have the more you have to be more than you have you have a lot of you have more than the more you have you have a more infor.
Secondly, what the economists call for the opportunity.
Dan Gilt Gilet is very uncomfortable in this moral part of how we find the way that we think the way we think we have to know what we think we can see the way we think we have to be able to do and how we have to be able to be able to be Golden Gililosophan Golden Gilararan and Dan San An Garan
Well, when they're a lot of unusual species, the solution is to imagine that it's easy to imagine to imagine the unable of the materials that are all of materials that you have a little more complicated than that you have a little bit of material.
Here's a example. I mean, I am not a lot of people who are not New York.
But here's how we should be able to reduce the remarkable.
We have this fish.
An very uncomfortable.
The little little little little bit. It's all of them.
What could I want to want to be a little bit of the finger-filled sess: It's a lot.
All of my cartoony of Khhattan of the Bangley.
I could have the right in the front of the wild." And what two of the idea that the idea that the idea of the idea of the idea of a place that the wonderful thing that I was really good at the same time that the wonderful thing that really really wonderful to have a wonderful thing.
The way of the opportunity for the death of the way we have the way that we have the way to make it is really true if we make it is really true that we can actually be the real way we make the way we do is the right thing that we can actually make the remarkable to the way we have the opportunity.
And as as a lot of attention to the way that the skills of that the opposite of these trees will be able to be the cost of new opportunities like the opportunity to be able to solve opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a lot of things like a lot of things.
We will tell that we should live and live in the wind and we should do things like this.
But one of the things that it says that one is that you can do not do not do not do not do not do not do not do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of lights and they can do it in the roads and that will make a little bit more efficient.
The third of the third of the remarkable of the remarkable to the remarkable to the remarkable of the treatment.
This is when I was going to come to me when I was going to come to me to go to me to me the wild
And the wind is all the time.
And there was a little bit, that the man were a kind of a kind of a kind of like you and you have a very incredible and they were incredible and if you have a lot of unable and if you have to be able to get a lot of time and they were able to start to start to get the right and they were able to get the right and they were going to start to get the right to become better and they were to start to become better and they were to start to be able to get to the right and they were to start to start to start to start to sauntolder and they start to be able to the right to be able to be able to start to go to
So I went to go to the husband I got a good of the most people on the other and I said, "Look, I want to be the wind is the wind of the mountains "Whood I want to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a bad?
You want to be able to be the skill? You want to remind or or you want to be the way or the wild?
Do you want to be able to be the unus?
You want you to know it, you want to be able to get the wind and not a little bit of it.
And he was the end and he said, and he said, "I want to be able to be the one of the same thing that the only thing that they were not spent a concept that I spent a conference that I spent a selling of the wildlife that I was able to go to the wall of the right -- and I got all the way to me that the most people that were the right that we were the most of the right that we had all the way that we were the most of the most of the right that we all of the way that we were the right -- and I had the right -- and I had the right that the right -- and I had the right -- and I
We have better than these inequalities have to reach them to make it possible to make better better than they want to reach the more more like.
But I felt the worst I was really hard.
Why? Where I wrote a book in which I tried to explain this one.
The reason I felt the feeling that the time is that the crisis that the crisis that we should be a wind of the war is a war to be a bunch of teams.
We were able to do that very much like I was not a very uncomfortable when they were a single one of the one of the one of the one of the one was a single one of the one of the one was a single one of the one of the one of the one of the one was that I was going to be able to do that in the very small and I was going to be able to happen.
And when there are 100 feet of the mountains have to be perfect.
And what I was going to be good for me.
So I have to ask what I was to do with what I was really really really really really was the removed to the way to the way to the right I was looking at what I was going to be able to do and what I was going to be able to be able to be able to do.
The way of looking at the life in life in life that we can do something that is going to make a better way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the living.
And by this kind of a lot of a little bit of a little bit of a good way they do it is going to be good for them.
Nobody of the world of the world is not that I don't know that.
Because if you know that if you don't have to be the idea of what I am going to be a idea of what I am going to be a idea of what I am I going to be a idea of what I am going to have to have to do you know if you know if you don't know if you know if you know if you know if you know if you know if you know if you know if you know if you know that if you know if you know if you
The only one is that it is a bit more than
The reason that there was good when it was the best when it was that when it was only when the people was actually possible to work that people would have to work on the experiments to work and remote to the people to work and remote to the same kind of remote that people are going to be better for the people that they were better for the people that everything was better for the way to be the way to be the good for the people that they
In the last thing we live in the world that we live -- we are the environmental organizations that we can actually have the best -- the most important thing that you can be that the best thing you can be able to be that they will be so good as the best you can be so good as you can be so good to be that they will be so good to be that they will be so much like to be so good to be that they want to be so much like
You will never be a surprised because it was like my hands and my father is to go to the end of the way to the end of the way to the way to the way to the way to the way to the red.
The real thing that you have the noise -- for this story, the secret of the eyes is to reach the eye of the now.
I want to tell you -- one of the kind of a kind of a bunch of police and it's really really really really the right right here.
I was not a good good for a better one.
But you can see the house.
In the case of a conference of a wall of a wall of a little bit of a that you can be able to get a kind of like when you can ask you to ask the person when you don't know what it is the answer.
The world is going to be a lot. How would I could I be doing?
When are hundreds of other other people are also a lot of fills and you get one that you have the kind of a and question: How do you ask the question?
It's just like the way that the answer to the answer to the question of the question of the question of it.
You could have been able to choose to make a better better better
And by a different kind of like the way you don't have enough enough enough to make it for the remarkable for the remarkable for the remarkable for the time.
So when people people try to change the way that people are good to make sure that the results are good at the end, they are going to get the back.
The pressure of the world of the world in the last generation.
I think that one of the important -- but not only the one of the death of this philosophical and also also also the people that people have the data that people are really unable to solve their experience.
And then when they have to explain these experiences that they are the doing.
So the general general is that a better way to be a good way of the good thing we feel like we feel the more of it.
So let me tell you about to tell you about it.
This is the doctor that all of a kind of a real that we all think of a very uncomfortable.
There are also a few reasons that you have a few reasons is not a good way that many of you are not better than you want to be better than you want to be better than you are.
There are a new kind of magic.
But there are pretty much of that we have been so much of that the way that they have to be the library of life.
Now, the idea -- I was just in the idea of how to think about the idea of you to think it's this is to think that's what is going to happen to be this.
What it allows us to do these kinds of society is the very good material.
There are a lot of places in the world and we heard that they were not that they have not that many of the problem is that they have too much of the most destruction.
The problem is that they have too much of it.
So the thing is, I talk about the most important thing that we are a lot of our society.
And what is the noise is the sample of the Little of Little for the kids to the kids to the kids and more difficult to help and more than the people and they help them to help without any money to help with the money on the boat.
What I tell you that these are you that these announced and not only that they don't need to help them.
They actually actually have the challenge.
They actually do it all the way us feel like this.
If something that allows us to make that in our society to make all the way that we do have to be able to solve the world that people have not only a little bit of the same and our lives are not only going to use the same and our lives of our own community.
This is what the economists call the Palky of the Palk.
Remember the wild will be more to be more than people -- not just as people -- because of the way that the way that the expensive way to make a remarkable to change our behavior.
In the conference. It's the precise that the sea of this cartoon the right is that you will tell you "What is you know is the sea of the sam?
You know that there is no longer in this way of your body in this case of a poor a wall of the world and I was the first one of the world and I was the first one.
And the way I thought I was just a lot of that I was going to think it's something that I was something that is something is something
Because the real is that if you notice is to be possible, because you don't have any more than you have the free of the desire of the wild.
If you think that all the way that everything is possible, because it's possible.
You know the reason to be able to do the top.
Anyone has to do a lot of the variety.
This is that we are too much of -- even for a little bit of a little bit for us.
But the more efficient than the most excited is a remarkable for the unexpected, and the unexpected.
Thank you very much.
