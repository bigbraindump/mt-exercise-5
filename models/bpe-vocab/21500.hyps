The year I got these two divided photographs to show that the role of the last three to the last three million years that in the last three million years ago was the size of 48 million years ago was a little bit of 48 percent of the size of 40s of the month of 4th century.
But this is serious serious about this specific issue because the size of this specific issue.
The police is in a way that the global warming system, the global system.
She is expecting and contraction and contraction of the bread.
The next positive positive that you will show you a very quickly fast to what happened in the last 25 years.
Give the peak is the marriage.
So you can see it is expectancy of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the white ways.
This is the anuity of the lad.
And it is the morning.
An uncomfortable with a old old old old old old old old old or you can see that it's almost almost like a bunch of the bodies of a body.
In the 22-year-old got from this one.
This is a problem because the inquality of the challenge of the ocean, the dead of the airplane around the air.
where it's a big amount of carbon nitself is a mammmmatic -- it's transformed in the metal catastrophic of the microorganisms.
Compared with pollution of the global warming of global atmosphere of global atmosphere if we go to this extreme way we do this in the extreme way.
Detropies in certain ways, in the Alaska metal expansive and the airplane is the soup.
The Katch Katin Walter in Alaska was on the Walter was on a little teenage of a little teenage in the past.
An video: Oh, yeah. She is OK if we can do it --
And a reason is that enormous "this enormous is Grower is Groensian in the north.
This is a range that are all over the years.
But the volumes are more than the one ever ever before.
This is the Kangeruseless of the Grower Grows.
If you want to know how the cause of the toilet of the toilet that is the place where it is the place where it is the soup.
These are very quickly.
And at the other side, Antarctica largest planet.
The last people of the last people have report that the continent that the continent is the continent is negative of the Antarctica is the subject of the Antarget on the island of the island of the insult of the insult of the rest of the world.
This is the equal equipment of the size of the Grland.
In Himalaya, the main the same side, on the side, on the street of the new force of the new people.
40 percent of the population of the world of the watch of the water of the water of these toilet.
In this case, this little guy, this is the surface of this city for this order.
They have been raised by it.
But when they are getting the water and the water and the water water and the water of the water and the water
In California was a 40 to 40 percent of the Sierra of Sierra.
This is the affection of water.
And predictable, as you read it, they're seriously.
On the global warming of the crash of the crash of incenties.
And the disaster of the global warming of a global rabbe.
Two times more in the last 30 years, the 75 of the 75 of them of the 75 of the 'clock
This is a completely unusual.
If you look at the context in context you can see what happens.
In the last five years I added up the 70 million of dioxide in every 24 hours of the airplane in every day in every day in every day in every day in every day of the ocean.
The Up of the Arab of the Pacific area of the South America, and every part of the subcontinent of the Acontinent of the Arab of the oxygen of the oceans.
The biggest because of the global inquiry of global warming the global warming of the inner of the food, the arm of the fossil of the fossil of the fossil of the fossil of the fossil of the highest fossil of the global inquality of the global warming of the
The Petric is a problem and the best cars is the most serious side.
The United States is one of the two big emerging of China.
And the proposes was going to build a lot of factor.
But we start to see a change change the whole change.
Here are the people who have been the last few years of the species with alternative alternative process.
There are all sorts of our political political country.
And the cost of the carbonate and okay was ended up a billion-dollar space.
promote the good newspaper of what is a oil.
This picture of something.
In the presence County, at a billion, a billion, a billion-toilet book.
You probably probably probably see it from the state.
This is, on the top of the second big deal. He was happened in the American Saharan Saharan of the Croute in the presence.
One of the reclaims of the books of the Croute of County, it was this.
Video: I mean, it's a little bit of the book, it's a same, and you see it and you see it.
He is from abundance, here in America, and help the economy.
Frosty, the stomek with the book, it becomes more curve.
It's also available and adorable and workers are getting souple.
Al Gore: This is the major correlations of the Virginia.
The most of the most graphic of the great career of Massey of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenny. I want to be clear to be clear Pelosa, Harry Reii Reijing Reio Reio Reijing.
Al Gore: So as Aliza for the Climate Captain to the second campaign.
This is one of them, a part of one of them in one of them.
Video: The first is the COALi we see new new changes, we see that a three-dimensional business of our business.
And so, our truth is to spend a lot of money for the public transportation of the public force that to help us to report us to the good news.
The idea is -- in fact, the goal is not didn't.
We think it's curious, and I think it's curious.
So it's not going to be the climate change for climate change.
You get that in our way.
Video: The rule of the goal, you heard a map of it.
So let's take a chance of this case of this in the case of the forest of the cartoons.
I love yeah. Masinary.
But this is the sound of the goal of the goal.
And as the good cars is one of the magic causes global remarkable technology, the good technology of the forest of the world that you can see the whole thing that you can change the whole thing.
The Up is the A-technology is to be a good technology.
Secone: In the last positive events of positive economic insects of the economy and the problem of the security and the problem of the security and the problem of the security of the security of the security of Gore:
Video: Narrator: It's in the national economy, the economy, the global warming.
The near that the mention of all the advertising the produces of the carbon: the good news on the bottom of the good news.
But now we have a new solution to the new solution to the incucucucups.
You can take the electricity of 100 percent of the power of 100 percent of the time.
A plan to put the America to go to the third thing, and it makes us more significant and help us to help the global warming.
In the end, a solution that is to help us to help us solve the problems.
You can have America's more like.
Secone: This is the last one.
Video: It's about the re-energy, the re-energy.
One of the most most of the most most of the old pollen of the old compounds, which is our planet has didn't, our Life is here -- the Life is here a new redding new revealing new reditself.

Al Gore: There is a old old old old old African who's saying, "If you go to go ahead and you go ahead and get the only good?"
If you want to get it back to the hat!
We need to get it back, it is very quickly.
Thank you very much.
The year I did a TED I did a introduction to LHC.
And I promised to come and give you a data about how this works.
So I think of it. And for those who have not here was the most scientific experiment that was the most scientific experiment that was the most scientific experiment -- the 27th or is to recreate the Street or is to recreate a little bit of a second to create a fear of a fear of a fear of a fear of 600 to the universe.
It's extremely aware of both of it.
This is the ownership of Genevelevation.
They do do photographs of these minds "Big Bangs" in the jail.
I work on this one. It is called the ATLAS -- Lunged 44 meters of 44 meters of a 22 meters of a TLALS photography here of the ATLALS in the building of the ALS in the building of it.
On the size, I went out to the first time I was the first one.
And this picture was the ATLAS was made
It caused a lesson in control.
It's a picture of the first one of the first particle that has been the way of the LHCHC, the LHC, the LC of the HC of free LC is detect.
In other words, when I have this picture of 10 sediments, I knew that the device is a huge successful of what is a huge success.
I don't know if this was received or that, when somebody has been a little bit like the first page of Google and you see the first peak of the same as the first page of the same as the first peak of the top of that,
It means that I did a cultural impact on the street of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the impact of the evolution of the impact of the end.
And so it was about a sample with the device, which is actually a problem with these daily -- these days.
Those are the transportation of the fish of the power of the power of the power of power of the power of power in the power of power
Now, engineers in the roads of these days, "You can't transport the among ancient of the ammpers."
But I can do that when they're at the temperature of the temperature that is called the superconductor.
So as a 271 degrees of the forest of the hospital of the bedle of those people can transport the door.
At one of the laws of the CHC, was a define of the LHC, was a define of fact.
So the company was inquited and the 13 thousand ample of the air-to-and-redded electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressive to the magnetic accent of 20 tons of the same as 30 to 30 to be 30 to 30 cents.
So I got about 50 magnetic magnetic than 50 magnetic magnetic magnetic
I had to get the door, what we did and do we do it.
I reconcusioned the top, I repair I was beating.
And now we take magnetic magnetic and then in the subteran.
Pn at the end of the LHC of the LHC is will be like new in the new lads.
Let's go out and start with us, and we get to get the data in the unfortunate data and we will continue to find research.
Now, of course, that in a way, those accident accident of the importance of science and engineering and engineering to the extreme to reject the extreme to reject the disappear.
I think that it is that the fact that it is the fact that we have a little bit of the fact that we have a successful experiments like LHC.
I'm going to go so inchance of a human science, Humphily, I think that the Aavator, I think that the opportunity of the experiments of the protection of the war, and he said, "No." He said, "Nimic advantage" is not as we have a very exciting of our minds are not the nurgent of the nurtures are inequivalent and the world as we are not the finite of the world, and the light as we are fin."
Thank you very much.
I want to start with the rugly remember your childhood od of your childhood has.
On the magic of the first people invent them to get them and get them and get them to get them to get them to get them to find them to solve the problems and choose and choose and choose and choice.
The hospital of the hospital is the professor of how we understand a lot of the inconclusion.
So in the way of reading this meant to this this utility of our physical objects, the physical objects, the impression of our physical objects, and my collaboration -- I would have my collaboration -- I would be able to use my own -- I would be able to use my own positive to the digital and the journey that if we use the digital bank you could be a little bit of a digital bunch of magnitude and the map if we can be so much of the modishshshall of the way to be so much of the mages to be so much more and put to be the maging to take to the maging to take to take a little bit of this whole bread, and then we use to be a computer to make a little bit of my own magmagmagmagmagmagmagnitude and then we use to tremendoubumpitown, and the
So what do you want to do to not?
The question was the fascinating thing about my research as I was the end, I was building to Swearing Swearing Swearing Stable to do it.
On the short, a Siztal model is a big computer interaction of a ball of a bunch of a bit.
They can be text -- they can be dangerous to the receive the mission of one and they have a version of one and a radio and a radio versus radio correctly.
The most important thing is that they're palpable, like the game, like the bodies, you can just get them as much as you get them to get them to get them to get them.
And Sifting the Gatar Take of a new ecosystem to be the digital process.
On the magic of the magic instruments are more likely to be their own initiative expensive sive, and the other nutritions of our nutritions and destructive new new waiting for us to interact with us and destroying new ways to interact with us and destructive act.
I'm going to start with simple.
This Sizarre is consistent to the video image, and if you include in a direction, if you include in the other side, if you include in the other other side.
These are interactive interactive to one other things are the other other side.
So if I put them one of the other side, they become interested.
If they are instructed and they can become a little bit of confused and they can become a little bit of conclusion.
and you can feel feel like the mission and inclining.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction of interaction is we can use the disease of the purpose of the purpose of how we would be a lightning light.
In this case, we have three Sweet Sweet Puba bunch of your color and can use them to use them to use them to use the core of the cell, they want to use the one of the cell,
If we can get too much more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more accurate in the accurate of the water.
There are also possible to educate education, how to be able to educate games, mathematical language, and the mathematical possibility to try to see people to see people as quickly as well as the results of the possibility of the immediate results.
So here I -- this is a range of the Kbonace, which is doing with a simple equation program.
Here we have a game game, a kind of rule -- a kind of combined Scrabs and Boggles.
So in every single one of the first one of the first one of the Siftable, and the main the way of doing the worst of the worst -- they are grew with a dictionary.
And then after 30 seconds of course it is about 30 seconds and you have a new set of letters, and you can be able to do it in the incities.
Thank you.
These are the kidnists, the people who came to the Middle Middle and I reded them to death them and movie a material.
They were going to get the crazy.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of application is that you don't need to have a lot of instructions.
All you have to say, "From the worth," and they know what to do.
Here are the people who are the people who are looking at it.
This is the most of our phones that we have a fear in the right side.
It seems like it was that I wanted to do it was to make the Siftable to do the other side.
So for him was just a cupy of it.
This is a application of animator.
We wanted to build a kind of data for the people who invest language.
And this is French --
He can introduce us to us to the stage in the stage of the Swee cameras the human beings.
So here is the soil.
Video: The answer is the answer of the question.
David Merrill: Now he introduced a tractor in the scene.
Video: The Tractor of the pirors.
Very of those.
I mean, when Siftable and the sample of one of the sanger can make your personal help -- Video: Ham!
DM: It creates your own narrative.
Video: Oh, yeah.
DM: It's a open, and he decided, and he decided, and he will be able to get the bit.
Video: Hary, bish, I h!
DM: The example I have time to look for example, I show you today is a instrument and interpretation and interpretation and in the Swe'd built the role of the sound of sound, and the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the role of the sound of the pressure that we would have been to be rhythm and all of the way we all to the way
Every few different variations of different types, you choose to use it.
And you can inject the sounds of a successful of the same as you can get the same as you can see it.
Induction are going to get the sound of the sounds of a successful Susty of success.
There are effects that you can control the table of control, how it would be reversed.
You can see a certain point of a certain sounds and then including it to help it off.
It's going to go to generate and the volume and volume that the role of Hi Hi to see the Hi Hi to see it.
Video: I can start with a couple of resider in the second Street in the Street of the successful of it, a serious expensive.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: I love to add a little bit.
Video: And now I'm going to add the top, I will add the whole thing to control the light.
Video: MM: I can see the inclined of the inclined or other side.
Video: I will think that the movie on the bag.
Video: Yeah, I can do receive the time of the time.
So I don't have to do it in the presence of the positive and the same, the gloads of the walk.
Now, in the end, they can I find the initially use of the Sustice of volume Sheater in the clinical pain in of the phase of the phasssn't in the clined in the air.
Thank you very much.
As you can see, my passion is the creation of us to interfe our brains that are worries of our brain.
And today, I had ever been able to show a coordination of this new text of design, and how we have to get them from the law to the law of the law of the lawyer of the laws.
The one that I want to retinent is that we are at the new generators with this new generatory interaction with the most of the digital disorder, the world will bring the rule of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of the rules that we want to retinent this new world.
Thank you very much.
These are the exciting of you can all be able to talk about you.
I'm writing out.
He wrote my books is my teacher, but also more than that.
It's my mother, my loaded and fascinating a minute.
And I don't think that this is going to change the way.
But this is what it was told by the way, and it was in my career and in my career that was my initially released my intreatment with the works.
And the truth is that I wrote this book, this is the "Pancient of the "Manancy, the Roager and the theory of every one of my career than anyone of my career in the world for a short positive position, and became this important piece of the so-called international symphology.
The theory is that the city is that the city is that they go ahead and I was the amated.
Serosophy, the same, the same.
In the example of the ingrights, you say, "You don't know it -- you don't have to be able to be more worth of this one of the performance?
You don't have to write that you will continue to write the foot of the forest of the world that will ever be able to do it all the way to do it all of that will ever be on the world on the world of the world that you will never be here?
It's very linear line.
But it was more and more likely if you don't have any time I was 20 years ago when I was going to get people -- I want to get the people -- I want to get the writing -- I just told you the same as a kind of a kind of a kind of deep response than the African reaction of the kind of death as a kind of a kind of a kind of deeply of a kind of choice.
And people said, "You don't have any theory as you don't have any of success?"
Don't you know that the hopping you the want?
You don't know that you're going to work in this field of the country and nothing will be a moral and no one of the dream of the dream of dreams of the dreams of the scream?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the answer -- the answer to all those questions is """Yeah."
Yes, you have the theory of all of these things.
And it always was my red.
And you have to be the same thing as many other things that people can not get them to meet them can't afford.
As an example of the magnitude of the magical algorithms.
But when it's about the writing thing I thought about the last thing I was like, "Why is it "Why is it "Where is "Where are you who is "Where are you like, "Where is what is the when I was "Why is it about the fact that is about the writing thing about the work I was going to be about the work I was going to be in the last thing I thought about the last and I was a whole thing I was like, "
Is this something rational?
It's the logic is to wait to be able to do them as they feel like they were able to do it as a Pame.
And what is the specific specific fic is that it seems like we have a real sense of the health of the health of the health of the health of the health of the health of the teacher doesn't do it?
I was my father was a engineer and I remember that in the 40 of you have no one of the 40 years of the engineering of the engineering is to be a engineer to be a engineer and the question is a engineer to be a engineer to be a engineer
It doesn't happen -- John, how does it go to the chemical engineer?
It's just not going to happen.
But we are to be honesty as a group of chemists, we don't have a lot of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the desire to be altered already.
We write the insects we have this reputation, and not only writing all the way to the other things that have been like this reputation of the same as the reputation of the wildlife of the reputation.
And everything we have to do is to look at the numbers of morning of the 19th century, in the 20th century, in the 20th century and they died by the lawyer and they did.
And even those who didn't get to the own one of the own wider steps of your own own own own own talk.
Norman Mailer, the fact that in the last time I said, "East, he said, "Even my books me a little bit more and more and more and more and more and do."
A great great great thing about the work of a life of a life of a life.
But the black holes we don't see anybody in the way we hear that I heard this because I heard of a lot of things that I have absorbed and unacceptable to add the idea of the color and suffering and the action of the purpose of the event and the conception will always get to the end of the way.
And the question I want to admind, you know, you are all here with this idea?
You can comfortable with -- because so that they see the list of the eye -- I don't have to be on this pocke.
I think it's like odid.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to want to go to a fly in the future.
I think it's better if we invisible to the artist to the state.
And I know about my case, in my case, my case, my case, I would be very dangerous for me to go to the card of this -- especially in this poverty of a circumstance.
For example, I'm pretty good for for 40 years.
I probably have seen as four decades of the work of the work of the work of time.
And it's very likely to write the end of this moment to be judge of this moment of the work of the work, and as my work, right?
What it would be a little bit of the men, because of the same as we are already going to be the most successful of my best I can be happened.
Oh, God, what I is.
This is the kind of gas to do somebody to the road to the hit of the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I mean to do it in the continues that I love it.
And then, the question is, right?
And so I think it is a lot of my meditative that I have to work now, to try to go now, to try to create a kind of building a kind of a productive, right?
I had to find a way to find a way to fly to the distance of my own consistent and my father who was going to be able to be able to be before I was going to be able to ask what he would write to what I was safe.
And as we have all the last year in this last year, I started to find out the time, and I ended up to find other society, and we could have to have other societies of how to make sure if we could have to help us create a emotional wisdom to make sure that our emotional wisdom to make emotional emotional emotion.
The researchers this went out of the Great and Rome.
So the great thing about the circle of the circle.
But in the Glo and Roming and Romania does not believe that the creative of the people in the inside the human inside the inside of the human inside of the human right?
People thought that the creative creatures were a spirit of the people who are coming out of people in a surrounding and unintelligent, the unitable and the needs.
The range of these spirits own facilities are helping to the terrorist "The terror."
Socrats was the immediate that he thought it was a demand that it has the department of the department.
The human human beings had the same -- but they called that spirit creates that spiritual creature.
What is wonderful because I think that the romantic nounced as a individual genius was a individual person.
They create a kind of a kind of a kind of magical insects that are excuse of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the way that the forest and unded the origins of the work of the work of the work of the work of the workforce of the workers of the workforce of the works.
Absoldier -- this is the distance of that I was talking about the kind of psychological tries that I was going to protect your work,
And all the world as it is the way that it is right.
So the artist was protected by certain things, as much as a little as a little narrative, right.
If you have the work was strong, you couldn't get the whole thing for her, the all the way to her, the whole world that has helped this genius to the world that held held the world that he had helped it.
If the work was critical work, it was not completely completely uncomfortable to ask him, right?
Everybody as the world as a gene as a ignorance.
And they have watched people in Vest for a long time.
And then came to Renasting and everything is changing, and it was the main this mad, the idea of the animal as the individual of the universe, the environment and the mystery of the universe, the mystery of the mystery of the mysteries that I get to defend up in the disorder.
It was the human human as a human rational, and people started to create the creative creatures like the creative of the individual person.
And for the first time in history of the history of the people started to tell one of the people of the artist as a genius.
And it will be able to married, I think it was a huge error.
Persially, a simple person, a simple person, to create that or it is actually received the receptor, as the eye and the surface and the surface of the mystery of the mystery of the myth of the emotional responsibility of the footprint of the psychic emotion.
It's like you have a little bit of the so-like so-called hats.
It's just the incotton and deforms and generen't going to make all these these astepleasure that all of these areas of performance.
I think that the pressure of the artist of the last hundred years of the last 500 years.
And if it's true, I think that is, what do we do is we do it?
Can we do to do things different?
It can go back to the sensitive sensor of the relationship between people and the creative and the creative and the creative of the creative speech of the creative relationships.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't just to get 500 years of the rational thinking.
And it probably as a person in public public questions that would raise the question of the questions that are absolutely unbelieving people in the course of the world are actually going to be the same and the whole thing that are going to be the same thing.
It probably probably not to coopt to this idea.
But the question I want to ask is -- why don't I do it -- why don't I do it?
Why do we don't think about that?
Because it has a much as I heard a lot of something I heard about what I heard in the end, the dance of the creative process.
And it is what it is that anybody to create something -- in fact -- in fact, it doesn't change the behavior.
And in fact, sometimes it can be able to go to the paranot.
I had a sense of where I met I met the amazing American I met the American Mr. Rutch Stone, who has been in the judge of 90 years and that he was the moved and he told me when he told me that he told me when he was the one and just like a little bit of the roads and just as a little bit, and just feel like a pound and just like a little bit.
The story was like a south like a soup of the air.
And it is the same catches around the camera.
The symbol of the symmetic in the roads of the leg.
In that moment that it has a single thing that has a single thing to do is, "Wa" as a leader as a leader of a leader hat."
And the way that the water to the house and the foot of the house. And the idea was to come to a piece of paper and a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the map and put it on a map.
Sometimes it was not enough enough to be so much like the pain and the chain and the house, but they don't get the rooted and the poem and the poem on the roads and the poem on the roads of the roads of the road, I read a poetry and taste.
They were also in the way, and the part of this is not a late -- the moments of the story that the story of the story that the story of the loss.
The other day at home, the mother, and the cause of the third and the foot of his creator, and the story of his own and the story of the other one and the other one of the other and the other and the other.
The role of the cockroached and the role of the main the main the math.
So in the situation, the poem on the right app of the right and the last thing to do is the last time at the last time of the worst word.
When I was hearing -- it's the only one of my own own process.
My father doesn't make sure that it is not the way to this -- I'm not driving yet.
I'm a catching and the way that they work in every day and I hope to get the same and you can see and get it and traveled with the same and you can see and get it and to be able to do it with the same thing.
But even though I was like, in my hasn't been able to do that I was asking that phenomenon.
And I imagine that as as as much as you were a lot of you have been and many of you have been and many of you have seen
I had a projects or I had to have a new source of a source that I don't know it.
And what do you do that?
And how it is it that we should be able to report us to get our minds of the human beings, we can we help us to help us the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the range of the risk that we should be able to report us to report us to report us to report us to report us to report us to rescue us to the route to be lose of the lessons of the tings.
For me, the most relevant example of how we can do about how we can do is make music is why we can do is a musician's interview.
I was going to be about this subject and Tom was almost all the way of the Art of the artist of the artist artist and gentlemen, what started to control, and gentertained and gentlemen.
I mean, when it comes to the bottom of the story as a day as a day as a day of the Los Angeles, and then everything was changing.
Where I was a short of a short t of a short tool that comes in the mind, as the near and magnificent with the income and a dream and a dream and it doesn't have to be as a little bit of it, but it doesn't have to be like to go and it doesn't have to go to the water.
It doesn't have a bunch of math, not report, not report,
The fact is the same equipment that ecky of "Arab in the place of the Mr. and the Sweden, and the paper for everything.
They don't have enough enough to reve."
And as much as it was as a little as a house.
It was the same thing that I did was something like to do with everything with it.
He got the foot of the footprint, "You can see they're at volcane?"
"Are you going to write a trip of a traveling to write a chance of it?
If you want to be true, you want to be able to do it in a sense of your own time.
If you don't have to get a different thing.
You can see it and get it on the Leonar."
The truth of creative process.
not the operation, the operating would be able to be able to be able to do it anything.
But the process, and the process, and the same thing that he took the time to go out in the time he took the road, and he had only because he was in the road, and he gave them to come back to the road, and then they have to be something that you don't need to be something that you should not have to be something to be able to be something that we should not have to be something to be able to be something to be something to be something to be something to be to be something to be to be to be to be something to be able to be to be to be to be to be to be to be able to be able
It could be this collaboration and the great development and the south of a conversation in the form of a list and exterrist that was not too much like Tomanist.
And then I heard the story I was a little bit of the way I was working on my data.
This approach me to save my middle, the word "Heany, Roager and I have a way of the Hubest, and I have a kind of wider wides in which we all know when I work with a kind of a bad thing that I would have to think that it will be a bad thing that it will be a bad thing to be a bad thing that it would be a little bit of the provide.
Not just that, but the most profound that he ever told me.
I would think I should think that we should just reach the project.
I remember my opening my God, and I was trying to talk to the open, and I was trying to do it.
I went out on on on the way of the criminal and I got a colleague of the cameras a cameras in the camera.
I said to you want to tell you the south, and I know if you think that if this is not the amazing thing that I am not going to be the great thing to be a husband is it going to be one of my voice, right?
Because you can see that I put it on the table to ask, and more than I would have to be anything.
So if you want to be better than you want to know the machine, you have to do the same as you can do the right side of the ways.
Okay. And if you don't want to do that, you know, you know, to all of it.
And I would write to write my son.
And I want to consensus to me to my work on my side side side side of my side.
Because -- the Conclusion -- the Conclusion -- with hundreds of years of North African people are going to get the poorest of the people have to get the disease and muscles of the rights.
And they were always awesomes for the dance of the dancers were remarkable and they were right here?
But sometimes they are very rough, and one of the desire of the community of the community of communication.
I'm sure you all know about what you do is to do is what you can all be able to do you -- so a certain kind of interpretation.
It's like the time is the password and the dance of the password of the park of the sample of the other 1,000 of them in the other 1,000 of them are all sorts of the other 1,000 of them are alien.
So in a time, it doesn't have in the whole bunch of glass.
It's the list of the bottom and the bottom of the forest is the foundation.
On the time, when they have been able to know what it was called and they said to call it.
and they have residents and incepted the scanning of the Alllah, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, Gam."
It's God.
A year of the history of interesting, when the maps have been attracted with them in the Spanish Spanish and the sample of them in "Hlay in Allah Allah Allah y," "Mr. Oh,"
and they hear about the time in the forests and the judgment and the soup.
In Spania, when a represented and magic and magic is possible and the Allaws, Allay, Allay, Allay, Allay, Allay, the Allay, the w."
It is the unintelligent -- a little bit of God God Gull.
It's wonderful, because we need to have this to need that.
But the part of the second day in the morning when the dance of the dance of the trip is a little bit of the morning, 11th and it's not a range of the Dialco and the Dider.
It's a dirty that is a dirty that you can not be able to do not worry about what it was not to be as well as to be as well as to be as well as to be a more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and the way it is a dirty that is a dirty that is a dirty that it is a diraging and that
Can you think that no one of the names of the Domn's name, so what it should be able to do with the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the life?
It's hard.
It's one of the most painting in the worst of creativity.
But it may not be a big chance if you don't think about it as you don't think of the most amazing part, as you have a great park of the most amazing people.
Maybe if you think about it, it was imposed to be immediately for a source of a source of the next time of the next to the next to the next to the next to the next to the next to the other side, when they moment.
If we think about it, it is what it is is going to change it.
I started to think that I was able to think about the last few months of the last months that will be published by the way, a curriculum and cross and cross and crisis.
And what I did is I do when you get your sounds like the tent of the -- you don't have a lot.
It doesn't have a dream and just the cure of your own presence of your own beats.
If you get the dance of the dance.
If the gene gender is come and expression that you know about the extraordinary decision, and for a great deal with a task, and for a clever to a late of the force of the force of the forces of the force of the force of the force of the debate and and the expensive gency of the desire and the extent of the footage and
And if no, it doesn't work.
And with all of you say, "You're going to you.
I think in these things and I think we should pretend to prevent them to presence them.
"By for you, just just because you have a love for the human beings, and the end, and the end,
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ohen: Oh!
I talked about some of these projects, about the genome, and what could be able to predict and discover of the discovery of the genes.
Now we start to start a new point of biology -- we are digital biology, and we're trying to start to start to start to take a new biology, and to go into a new biology, modeling and asthusive biology, modeling and associated force and initiate force and initiate force and asking the force of a new way.
We tried to put it together to ask us questions.
"What is life life go?"
We tried to put different approaches of life, is the based on the basic components.
We are already able to take almost 20 years.
When I was the century I went out of the world of the analogy of the analogy of the digital biology in the digital world.
Now we try to ask question: Can we regenerate our life or we can create new forces of life, in this universal university?
This is the map of a little organism Mycoplasma genitalia, which has the most genitarian species that can replue in the law of the lawyer of the laws.
We tried to see if we can come up with a genome,
We were able to get the surface of a hundred genes of the size of the size of the 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of the map of metabolic compared to us to our compared to us to our time.
I think it's simple.
But when we look at all of us that we can get the first time to a time, it's a little bit of a single single one of the cell.
So we decided that we had decided to really get this thing to do is to be this crossy, we can can can use the results to the most fundamental components to the most fundamental questions of questions.
And so I started on the road, "Can we can can we get a cross?"
Maybe the chemical allows these molecules that we haven't done before?
And if you can actually a cross of a cross of this?
A crosis, by the way, the way, is just a piece of chemical material.
So our digital speech of digital life grew up to a ritis.
Our ability to describe the genetic code, but it was very slowly slowly slowly reaching.
The last time he got to a confused to a curve.
I started this is a little bit more than 15 years.
I went through a few days of the bottom of the animal events, the same as a bio-et-based journals.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult to be so difficult to do.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that make little bit of DNA and 10 to 50 miles, but it's a generative process, but it's a generative processes, so that you build a longer, so much more and more and more ertaining with more hopels of thousands of ertainty.
So we had to create a new way to put these little bits and and correct all of the error.
This was the first of all, the digital tenth of digital world, to the digital genome, to the Ph.D.
It's a little virus that is a little bit of bacteria
I did did the piece of paper I went through the right correctly, and I got a number of DNA by about 5,000 letters.
The interesting thing that I came to when I took this piece of chemical materials and I put it in the bacteria and I started to read this genetic code of the genetic code, and to prove this genetic code,
The animal animal animal have been released and released in the cells and they have come back and they have been able to get the E.
I was going to be with the oil of the oil, and they would understand that they understand this model.
They have rights, they are laughing.
And so we think this is a situation where the software can build their own magic can build their own habitat in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something more and more of it.
We wanted to build the entire cross of a bacteria of a bacteria
This is over 58,000 letters of the genetic code,
So we said, we have to put the wall to the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of a cell that are the remarkable components of a cell phones.
The design is critical trial, and if you start with digital data in the computer needs of the computer needs of the computer needs to be very positive.
When I was the first first of this gender man in 1995, the standard was a range of a 1,000-wider wider of the bottom of the based on the side.
I find it in the residents, 30 to the last 30 to the original corner, this was not able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the resident.
The book is the design is the project that has been designed by 50 letters, which has to be able to take the other side of 50 letters to build 50 letters to build 50 miles to build more than we have to create some more than the door of the other people that are able to compatible with each other with each other with each other with each other with each other with each other with each other with each other with each other with each other with each other with each other with the other with
We are able to make elements of element.
You can read that I read "marks" in the house. Grace to this one. We have a genetic code, we have a genetic code, and T.
Tries in those letters -- those letters of the codies of a 20 notes -- one of the immediate every one of the income every known as a concept.
So we can use the genetic code to write the words, the proposition.
I mean, the whole thing I did was to hear the code.
Some of them were unable to think it's not the poetry is not poetry
We designed those pieces of that we can define them with them.
I'm sure that they are repart, and they are all going to be anything.
So we started to do the gentlemen, we started with a five to 7,000 lets the doors, and then we put them on these two letters and then put it in these laws, and then they go to 72,000.
Every time we have these pieces of these pieces of these pieces of the abundance to create a very road that we try to create a very robust -- as you can see a very routine.
We try to get to get that point of the automobile of automobile
So this is what a theater looks like a theater.
When we get to the very large pieces, over 100,000 walls of 100,000 walls don't grow that in E.
It is a modern molecular biology of biology biology of biology.
So we have been able to other hand.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the biology of biology that biology uses the biology is useful to remind that it makes it a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a human beings.
This is a example.
There's a organism called Deincockroaches that can be the phase of radio radio o radiation.
As you see in the panel in the panel of the cross is is in the gang.
124 hours later, he took a new lawyer in the lawyer as it was at the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These are able to be able to be able to be on the top.
I can live in the light.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be able to existence in the extreatment, to find a new environmental environmental environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is that this is going to happen.
Here is a microthal microthal molecule that we build these produces we actually use these procle gun to the design of the bodies of the footprint of the box that we put on the side.
Drojaw it together together to put them together and automatically.
This is not a picture of a microscope, but just a microphones but just a micro-dial phony of microphenomenon.
It's so a molecule that we can see a microscope.
These are images of about a third time of a six seconds.
This is a audience that I had a little bit of time.
These are over 58,000 lets the genetic code,
It's the largest molecule made by people, with a definition of the definition.
It has a map of the 300 million of the 21st of the 300 million
If we get a couple of 10 and no space and without a space of 142 pages to add this genetic code,
So how do we start a cross of a cross of it?
Again, with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria to work with back.
It also also also looks more like when you get to the nine ine -- you can just put your nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear and you can put it -- and that's something you heard -- but that's something you have heard --
With the arrow of arrow is integrated in the cells is integrated in the cells that we can do a completely transplant to make a completely completely transplant to the other cross of the cells, and we can activate it it to the other boat.
I got a kind of a microbal in one of the microbial species of the microbial species
These are the second distance as people like people and bread.
I added a few genes in the plus to the chromosome.
I had deeply to the enzymous of all the protein.
And it was pretty amazing when I put in the cells, you will put in our very sophisticated -- and the cross of our -- and the crosome of the cells end.
In fact, I thought that this is how it is how it can go back to the process something more and we tried to design something more and more and more and more and more than it does.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are looking at all sorts of species that have been able to come up a second cross of the tree, or another tree, of the other new features of new new new characteristic new characteristic books.
So those who are thinking about evolution as a single gene to change a certain gene of biology.
I'm sorry, called the restrict of restrict that they actually had a DNA of DNA.
The genome that was in the cells that was in the cell.
The -- the philosophy that I put --
It was except and he was except the other cross like the skyphilosopher, and I got to the new cross of the cross of the cross of the new cross of the cross of the cross of the cross of the new cross of the cross of the cross of the cross of the other cross of the cross of the cross of the cross of the cr
It became blue because of genes that we put in the cross that we put in the crosis.
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristics of a species have lost a new species in a new species of a new species that I put in the cells that I put in the cells that I put in the cells that I put in the cells that we put in the cells that I put in a very short period of time,
All the proteins were changing, memory -- when we were changing -- when we are changing the genetic cocky of the genetic cocke.
This can sound like alchemical alone, but we can also do it as a produced to the DNA to change things that are pretty soon as well.
Now, I had to rescue that is not genuine -- but a half years and a half years and a half years ago, and we have to create a new version of the Web, in which has a new version of the Web, the design of the digital mammals.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obviously obviously in the way of needs.
We're on the way to go from six billion people over over 40 to 40 years.
So to give me this in context for me to the finish: I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each of us in 1946, in 40 years, in 40 years, in 40 years, they will be four.
We have the death problems of the water -- the bizarre water and a drug, commitment of the six billion and a half billion and a half of them and a half and a half of the forest.
It will be difficult to do it for us to do it for us.
We use over five billion tons of the book, more than 30 billion of the barrier of oil hills.
This means a hundred million barriers on the day.
When we try to think about the procent or any of the process, or whatever the process that will be a challenge.
And then of course, it's all the CO2 from this material this material, which is it becomes in the atmosphere.
Now, from our discoveries of our world, we have a basic data with 20 million genes, and I like to think that I want to think about these components of the design of the design of the future of the future of design of the future.
The electronic electrical electrical bombsight, or so something like this, or this is the diversity that has been out of this.
We're limited here, in the first time, in our first and imagination and imagination.
We have now now is the same kind of ways, to do what we call what we call what we call it genuine genuically.
We have the ability to build a big robot that makes a big robot that will make a year.
When you think about this 20 million genes of genes or try to optimize these 20 million genes to make sure you to make the pharmaceutical philosophical pharmaceutical equipment -- we only do more biology than the last 20 years, to do more biology than the last 20 years, the rest of the science.
And that's just the standard of the standard of the standard of the standard of the standard of the standard of this is just the standard of this is just the same as it's just this is the kind of a standard selection of the standard of the standing of the standard of the standing of the standard of the standard.
We can select for the substitution of chemical chemical diseases or fuels or productive, productivity.
This is a head of a design in a design of a design of a design that we work in order to wake up to these species in the computers in the computer.
You know, we don't know how to show you how it will show you.
We know exactly how it looks like the genetic cocke.
Now we are focusing on the forest of the forest of the food.
You saw you saw that in the migrancy of the migrateful.
We have the second generation of the next generation and the third and the third and the third of the phasis that they are noticing the phasy of the house.
But the only way we think that we think that the major impact of the food that it has no longer the cost of food and the fear of their own food is if we start with the first time to design the cells, and we work to design the cells, and we think we will have the first generation of the next generation of the next generation of the next generation of the next generation of the next four.
The solar and the solar and CO2 is a way -- but in our discoveries of our world, but in the world we have all kinds of the world have all sorts of the world have all sorts of the world in the O2 meters of the O2 meters and and the role of the O2 is a way and CO2 is a way of the O2 is a way of the O2 is a way of our O2 is a way of the O2 is a way of the O2 is a way of our world.
This is a organism that I wrote in 1996.
It goes into the deep ocean, about two kilometers and half in the expensive temperatures of the temperate of the dark side.
Transform CO2 in metan use of hydrogen as a molecular as a energy as a energy as a energy as a energy as a energy as a energy as a energy of energy.
We try to see if we can take the CO2 intuitive, which can be easily shaped in the country and conversations in the gload to the base in the bbank of the road, to the product of this stuff.
So in a short period of time, we think we could have been assuming what is the question is the "What is the life?"
We really know -- you know, we have objects to replace the entire industry of oil industry.
Yeah. If you can't do it at TED, where in other way?
Let me become a energy of energy.
But we also work to use these same sources to invent these vaccines to invent the vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of the same thing.
You saw this year, we always saw with a year and we're always a year and a dollar in the right thing to do about the right thing to do about the right thing to do about the right thing to do is the right thing to do with the right now.
I think that situation can be able to change vaccines of vaccines in the data.
So here's how it could go to the future to look at the future we are going to look at the evolution of evolution with the bacteria with bacteria with bacteria and finally, finally finally the aesthetics.
We're almost to improve people.
Our new is just to make sure that we have a long way to survive us to survive to survive to do that. Thank you very much.
And what I want to show you more quickly is a fundamental work of the fundamental thing I had to ask me to Microsoft as a part of a year at a year at a year at a year at a year at a year ago in a year, this is the lot.
It's a medium that can interact with a large distance of the data is the visual data of visual data
We look at a lot of the digital bons, many gigables and the slide of the continuous and to this one of the end, rescue by this way, rescue by the way, we wish anymore.
It doesn't matter how much information is the way of the door, how big data is these big colorful colors.
Most of them are doing with a digital camera that is a digital camera -- for example, this is a Plllessons of the Nongress of the 300 methods of the 300 methods of the 300 methods of the Earth's --
It doesn't really important because the only thing that should be limited to the incentive of a bunch of the month of your money's month to a very fly of an architecture of a very fly of an architect.
This is a book a book for nonimagination.
It's about "the Kosky of Charles Dickens. Every colored is a capital.
To show you that it's about the text, and not a imagine, and we can do it as a report that is a report that is a picture of a text; it's not a picture of a text.
Maybe this is a kind of artificial way to read a book in the electronic form.
I don't want you to recommend.
This is a real case of the Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardia.
Every picture is the beginning of a second second second one.
This is really going to be able to read a piece of experience, the one of the version of a revivid or a revious environment.
We did something small with us with this little bits of the Gardies of Gardies
I created a false reclaim to a very large -- much more than in any cloud in any cloud -- and I was able to get a conclusion.
If you see it the properties of this machine, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific species.
And this really is the way of seeing the certain ideas, the report of a monitor.
We hope that this is to be able to enable to do the popppy and other like this -- that are not necessarily necessarily required.
Of course, the mapping is one of the same applications for a kind of like this.
I'm not going to tell you a lot of time to tell you that we have to tell you that we have to do this for the time.
These are all the roads of the United States of a gee of NASA AASA AASA AASA AASA ASA ASA ASA is all the way of the United States are all the way of the United States are all of the way in the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States.
Let's go to now something.
This is actually active to accumulate the Internet.
This is a project called Phoosne, which is the second technology. Where is the two different technologies. Where is Sealove and the other research of visual views of the visual visual views of the Washinged Libringing Steve Savart, the State University of Seatal Steve See Steve See See See Steve God to C.
and Rick Szeliski at Cersus.
So this is active to the Internet.
You can see that when we create that when we create these perspectives, when we can not have this kind of experience in many ways, we can have this kind of a lot of solving in many of the wildlife in many of the wider experience.
But the space of these images of these images of the real images of the truth.
The other vision of visual perception of these images have been recorded to the real space that I would give up to the real world -- all of these -- all of the God and the God and the Stanford and the Stanford and the wants, and these tools and these relationship or and these relationship or and these relationships, and these relationships, these are the spaceships.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There are some of the space.
I want to go to to one of the original core of Noah -- this is doing a big time in a Phoosnia that I worked in a case of the Photos that I think is the pigs of this technology, and the technology of this technology, not as a result of the projectome.
We had to have to have a range of aspects of the laws.
This is a reconstruction of Chase of the Day of Day Agained Flickro Flickr, and you find something with the Flickr, and you find something with the guys in the room, and every one of these conportraits of the cockroaches that were found that the cooke.
These are the Flickr, and all of them were related to the space.
We can just not just to get in this way.
You know, I never thought I will go to work on Microsoft to talk about a part of the man I was a contain to a first and I have a first and I have a first and you know the first here.
I don't see that I'm noticed that I'm a lot of the camera, all of the stage of the SLLLLLs to SLLs to SLLs in this environment.
If I can find out the strange of these strange strange.
There are so many traveling from the feature,
Some of you here is a series of photography.
This is a poster with NAser who was recorded in the right thing was record of the right now.
You can get your hands to a physically physically physically in this environment.
The idea is that they can do some of the environment. This means to collection of the world -- from all of the world -- from the world -- and to interact to the memory of what the Earth looks likely to be connected to the earlier, they have been connected to the highest than the outside.
You have a model of what is the entire Earth is the entire Earth.
Think about this as a long as a code of Stephen Lawler "The Earth."
And this is how it creates as the world as we use as well as the world as we use it to use it to use it.
The teacher is the cute with meters that somebody else that somebody else has come to the way to the away.
If somebody would all these daym; it would say that I would say that I hope that I would say that I would use the NDs of Helf would be able to use all of these data to make that space, and I could use it as a social experience.
And of course, a produced but all of these are the specific areas and the virtual areas of the Earth's life, college, collection of the Earth's earth and images of the earth and images of the village and images of a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood the right thing to say is, what will allow you to vote the first time, is that all the photographs of somebody in the end, is that all the photographs of somebody on the sticks?
BAA: What makes it really true.
It makes the hyperper-sensitive -- if you want to see each other.
And it makes this process of intervention of imagination.
And this is becoming inquality of the data that you think about the significant information that they have these images.
As you do a case of images on the Internet, and you get some words, and the text of the Internet gives a lot of information on the Internet is positive information about what is the positive information about what is the positive information about what is the positive information about what is the positive process.
Now, what would it be if that picture is the connection to all the picture?
And the amount of connection and the amount of connection and the disease that is a huge amount of the resident.
CA: Blaws, it's incredible.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of the intense of the trip and one of the great piece of the foundation of the night-hand side, which they don't feel the last old -- they still feel the last few of them in the road, they still feel the last roads of the plants of the among plants in the among plants of the plants of the planet.
You don't think that the Jaguary Jaguary last, or that I would still be able to understand the old lesson with the old old or that in Himalay, or that in Himalay, it's going to remember the revealing of the subject of the world that we live in a center of the world that is not only one of the world that is not just a sense of reality -- but it's just a sense of reality.
The consequence of a certain set of decision--making decisions that our own initive, and with a lot of our generations in the next generation of a lot of generations in the next generation of the next generations of a generation of a certain generations of a certain generations of the initiative decisions in the next generation of the decisions that we have to do the decisions that they are the doing.
And of course, we all use the same imperative adaptive and imperative
We are born and all of us to bring the children on the world.
We are going to take through the initial ritual initiative.
We need to do the separation of the moral corning, so that you should have some of your songs, with all of you have to do the art.
But what is interesting is the dead is the dead of the human beings, the ritation of the culture.

And then on the poor and then on the bottom and then the best, and of course, the bits and of course, the bank you very much more and more and it comes out of the best.
You know, it means that that it doesn't mean that they will not only take money to the hands of the food for a few people to put money in the pensive, that means that the way it means that the ability to make a decision-making making making that unfortunate the comment of the compending of the compensation of the commercial commercial commitment.
Never to the bottom, I put the legs of 5,000 dollars a year from the employees of the employees of the employees of the classroom.
So the creative thing is a consequence when you have too many options.
And I think that this is doing something like this.
You really want to take your decision, if it's good for all the elderness, right?
You don't want to choose to choose or even the wrong thing to say.
So this is a second effect. The second is that if we were able to do it for the desire to make a little bit more villager to be less enough enough to be less enough enough enough to be a little bit of options that we want to be a little bit of options that we want to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to do.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that we had a lot of snapped for the people to choose if you buy one and not is perfectly -- but it's not perfect?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that could be better choice. And what it is that the alternative you would imagine you imagine the voice that you have to regret your choice that you have to regret the power of the roads that you get to the choice that you have been a decision.
The more opposite you to regret it is the more easy to regret something that is above to be the opposite of the option you have a range of the option you have a range of the option you have a lot of options.
Secondly, what economists call it for opportunity.
Dan Gilber demonstrated that he showed up in this morning as we evaluate the way we evaluate the things we see how we compare to the comparison to what we compare to them to the people that we compare to them to what we think about the Gilla -- the Gilla has been shown to do it very clear to the very clear that we were going to be able to be very clear to talk about how we eventually we come to the way to the way to the quick the way to do it is that we evaluate to be a very claim to the
Well, when they're a lot of alternative alternative to have a lot of alternative to imagine the characteristics of the communities that are uncomfortable to make the alternative of alternative that you have a little bit of the alternative that you have a little bit of the alternative that you have a little bit of the alternative that you have a lot of alternative to be a lot of alternative to imagine that you have a lot of the alternative
So here's a example. I mean, I think it's not New York City.
But here's how we should take it to take a look at it.
We have this one of the Hamberg.
A very expensive properties.
It is a superbit. They have a wonderful thing. They have to be anything.
What could you want to want to want to be able to do is thinking, "This is aud."
All of my career in Manhattan are leading are my hattan.
I would have to be like in front of the off." And I spend two weeks of the idea that the idea that the idea that this is a little bit of the fact that this is wonderful.
The rights of the opportunity in the village that we have on the way we have to know if we choose to choose is to be the exception.
And the more options of the footprints of the same characteristics of these options are going to be dangerous as we will be dangerous as for us as an opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoons says a lot of things.
We should say that we should live in the loud and probably we should do things more and we should do it anything.
But one of the things that say is that anybody is that anybody can do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of lights and this is going to make a little bit more attractive and that you do something less attractive.
Their three-roughly expecting.
And this was when I wanted to replace to replace my best.
I can see almost almost almost every time.
And there was a claim that in which they were kind of like a single kind of loved and they were incredibly uncomfortable and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you get them and they were starting to get them to get them to get better and saving them better.
So I went to the blew my lads after I got a few days, I said, "Look, I want a bunch of the old and I said, "Look at the measuring thing to be the wrong "You want to be the smiles, right?
Can you want to be with the peak or with the tas? You want to be able to get your or in accident?
Can you want to be able to be able to be the same thing.
You want to get it, you want to get the bank -- you know, you don't have the end.
He painted his face after I said, "I want to come back to the guy said, "I'm the only guy who was the only one of the guy that was the one of the wall of the wall of the wall of the walls -- the truth -- the truth -- the truth -- the truth -- the right thing that I was the best of the right thing that I had been on the right of the right -- the best of the right of the right of the best I was the right now.
I have a little more of these options have been able to choose to choose better.
But I felt more worried.
Why? I wrote a book in which I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt more worried about that I felt that it has all these options of my expectations about how I should be a bunch of the beats have been a war walled wall.
I had expect to be able to be a very important expectation of when they were a single waiting when they were one of the same as they were the same as they were the same as the same as they were the same waiting for a single way.
Now when I'm 100 eyes, my mother, one of them should be perfect.
And what I have got going, but it's not perfect.
So I compared to what I got to do with what I was expected, I was assumed to the compared to what I was the hope.
The options of the options of the people can do something else than to create something like to create the best expectations that people have to be those are the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the oppositions of the opposite of the options.
And as as it is going to take to the south of the door even though they get good results.
Nobody in the world of the road.
Because if you knew you would have no idea about what I am I going to talk about.
The one is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was worried when it was really worried when it was actually possible to experience.
And the day of today, we live -- we live -- we are living and we expect and to have the best and we expect the best thing you can say that the best thing that you can be so good to be that the best thing that you can be so good to be so good to bee.
You never never have a surprised because of my expectation and my expectations and I get to the way to try to figure out the way to try to defend up to the way to defly to be a surprising paid you never have a surprised to be a surprised to be able to be a surprising because of my expectation because of my expectations and I never had a dream of my expectation and I
The happiness of happiness -- for this is the secret -- the secret of happiness is to have the expectations of reduse.
I mean, I want to say -- just a little bit of biography -- I actually have a wonderful goal and it's really a wonderful thing.
I couldn't find something better than I could find anymore. I didn't get the time.
But let's look at your home, it doesn't have a way of the case.
And finally, a consequence of a budget to a wall comes to the good when you can buy a single one one is that you can't see a single one that you can't ask you to ask why this is the answer to the answer is, and the answer is the cloud.
The world is the way of doors.
When they're hundreds of different stars of different stars and scares and hopes that are unable to ask you, what?
It's as a clear that the answer to the question is,
You could have to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose you could have to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choice.
I mean, a different wake of different waves of choice to choose to the choice.
So when people do the decision, even if people do the results are good to do with them, they feel good about it, they are good news.
Depression of the pressure of the world in the last generation of the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not the only one of the erupdate -- but also the fact that people have to be able to assumptions that people have have been so real.
And when you have to explain these experiences I think they're going to be able to come up to the her.
So the result is that the result is that a better object, and we feel more and we feel more worse than the right thing.
So let me remind you you.
This is the doctrine doctor, that we all think about a very surprised and it's true.
Without the discussion that you have a few choices that it doesn't matter that many of the choice are better than you are the good choice.
There's a magical number is a magic.
But I'm sure that we have been able to do that this point in which the way that choice the way of the choice.
Now, the idea -- almost the idea of reach, the idea of red, the thing to think about it.
And what it allows to do in society in society is good at the materials.
There are a lot of places in the world and we heard about a few of them are not that they have too many of them are not too many of the opposite of them.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the thing about talking about me is a strange problem.
And what is the frustrating is this: Steve Levitt talks about how these cars and hard work for the children of the children are not held to be held to be held to be held on the road.
What I say is that these opposite opposite and complicated not only that they don't help it.
They really really challenged to the pain.
They really do it is what we do to feel more worthy.
If something that allows us to do as in our society to do all the choice that we do all have been transferred in society in the society that people have too much of our lives are not only improvement but our lives are not only the lives of the amora.
This is what economists call the Patito.
The range of the income to be better than all -- not only people -- not only poor people -- because of the way that we are able to choose us to make us seem to be able to get us to be able to sick.
So in conclusions that you have this cartooner and it was a person to say, "Wo! Who is the cook?"
You know that nothing in this active action of the action of the poverty, a migratulate of the world -- so I read it and I have my first time.
I thought more about the more I thought about the way I was able to think about something like this.
Because the truth is that if I hope that everything to be possible to be possible, not more frequency of the initive.
If you hope that everything that is possible, that everything is possible, and I think about the village.
You can create the demand and the scale.
And yet, it takes a variety.
This is almost almost too limited -- probably even for a fish -- unless for us to be able to us.
But the absence of a metaphor is a reette for no inhappiness and presence a her, unbelievable.
Thank you very much.
