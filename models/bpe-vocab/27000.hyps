But this mornity is serious because this particular particular problem because it doesn't show the size of the blose.
The polar polar is in a way that the global global system that global climate crisis.

And that our main is to spend a lot of money for the public forces that we can help us get the complicated thing about the car.
The real thing is the goal is not didar.
We believe it is -- and we are splited and good.
So you won't get to the climate change for climate change.
You know that we are.

Thank you very much.
The year at TED I did a introduction to LHC.
And I promised it to give a data about how this function about how this function.
So here is what they were here and the people who were not the biggest experimental scientific experiments that was the most scientist -- the 27 kilometers or is 27 kilometers or is a 33-year-old fear of a billion times a fear of a billion times a fraction in a half a second.
It's very much of it.
This is the device under the Geneva.
We do the photos of these minds "Big Bang" in the decades.
I work on this one. It's called the ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLS product.
And on 10 days, I went to the last year, I started on the first time.
And this picture was a ATLASS.
It caused a great celebration in the room of control.
It's a first picture of the first particle of particle that has been put in the lab system around the LHC, crossing a part of LHC is detector.
In other words, when I saw that image of 10 sediments that are a functioning functioning, which is a huge success.
I don't know if this was received the biggest oils, or when someone went on on on the Google and I see it as the first page.
It means that I did a cultural impact on the street of the intelligent impact of science.
And then about a year I had a problem with the device, which actually actually had to do with these songs -- these days.
Those are being able to transport 13 thousand ampers to the maximum of power to the maximum of power
Now, engineers in the roads of these days, "I can't transportation today." They're being beaten on."
But I can do this because when they're at temperatures become a superconducting.
So as a 271 degree -- because of those steps can transport that can transport these bees can transport these bees can transport these beats.
At one of the layers of the ones of the ones of the LHC, it was a define of factory factory of factory factory in one of the factory of the layers of the layers of the layers of the laws of the layers of the layers of the people in the LHC, the next thousand magnets in the LHC, was a define in the LHC, C,
So that the company was inquited and the 13 thousand ampons have innited electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impression, and they are now going to be over 20 tons of tone, and they moved almost 30 miles away, and they moved to 30 miles.
So I have a thousand magnetic magnetic magnetic math.
I had to take the outside, which is what we did and do it.
I reconceded on the top, I repair to it.
And now we go back and then we go back and then in the subterm.
And the end of his head of the Middle will be like new lass.
We're going to start with again, and we get us into the whole data or we will keep the research or we continue to find the research that are the elements of the universe.
Now, of course, that are in a senior those who are able to discussion and engineering to the extreme to rejection and engineering to break up the way.
I think that it is the fact that it is the way that we have young inalso, this is the important thing that we have a big experimental of experiments like LHC.
So I'm going to go to a worst of British scientist, the Humphilanical scientist -- I think that the experiments protected by the way, that this is Michael Faraday, he said, "Nowaday, it's not more dangerous for human mind to previous progress to presence our human beings are not more myths in our minds are not more mystery and that our new girls are not more worthy and as we are not more usualley, and as we don't have more mythical and more and more natural gymous and more and more and more than our own beattemptilosphilosophes."
Thank you.
I would start with the rugly launches when you play with your bodies.
And on the top of the source you to get them and get them to go and get them to get them to get them to get and sold and sold and sold and manipulate the spillnesses and manipulate the spatial spaces.
The point of view is deep to the law of how we understand a lot of inconceptuitive people in the world injury.
So, in the quality of the inner of this new kind of interveness with our physical objects -- impressions -- impression of my own Pator, and my collaborator -- I was trying to use -- I started a computer -- I would be when we use a computer -- I would be able to use a computer -- I would be able to use a computer that could be all of a computer that we can be so much more missing a missing of a missing that if we can be all of a layer to be so much more missing of a little bit of a little bit of a dealthy of the wrong with a computer to each other and a computer to be a computer to be a computer to be a computer to be a computer to be a computer to ememempower, and a little bit of a little bit of a computer to be a little bit of a little bit of a computer to treattempt that we use of
And then you want to ask what do you want to no?
The question was that the fascinating thing that I was going to try to build Symous Stable to build Sismet.
In short, Siftable is a computer interactive interactive of a bismale of a bismit of a biss.
They can be manufacturing -- they can perceive the resident, and they have a screen, and they have a screen and a radio of a wireless of the wireless of the wireless of the wireless of the wires.
The most important is that it's palpable, like the games, like you can just get them as just as you get to get them as just watching them as just applied by the way,
And Sifwitness providing an ecosystem to be a new instrumental of digital information.
And on the top of these instruments become more hopeless of the other's mission of the other ones that we can start to explore our nutritional and we can start explore new new new new new and destructive new and destruction.
I'm going to start with simple.
This Siftable is configuring image, and if you include the film is a step, if you include in the other part, they include in the other part, they get into the other hand.
These are the interactive interactive are the ones that are one of the other side.
So, if I put them one langle one gets interest.
If you are inconfident and they can be a little bit of confusion.
They can also feel the mission and inclining.
We realized that one of the interaction of interactions is like we can use the same way we can use the database of manipulate how we would be a liquid of a liquid liquid a liquid liquid of a liquid liquid on a liquid of the interaction of a light-to-implications of the interaction of the interaction of interaction is that we
In this case, we have three Switzerlands like the table of voice and they can use them in the central where they will among the center in the central --
If you get too much, we can get too much, we can get back to the back.
There are also interesting possible for education, as education, as they would be a mathematical and logical logic and the way we want people to see people who we want to see the outside.
So here I -- this is a Tbonacy, the same equation.
Here we have a game game of formation formation of the combination of the Scrabs and Boggles.
The reason is, every single one of the first one of the first Stable to intimate and forth to forget that people who are grew with a dictionary dictioned with a dictionary dictionary dictionary dictionary dictionary dictionary to a dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds are reseem to be in the letters and we have a new set of incent and new possibility and new possibility of incled.
Thank you.
These are the kids who came in in the ''Laborators, and I returned to the Media, and I returned them and filmed a material.
They like to die at the time.
And one of the interesting thing about this kind of applications is that you don't have to do to do many people who are many people who are to many people who are to do with a lot of instructions.
All you have to say is "From the word "From the right thing to do.
Here are other people who are asking people to get out of it.
This is the most tanker test of our right -- the right thing in the right.
It turns out everything that he wanted to do was to do is to be one of the other.
So for him were just box.
This is a animal animal animal animal being an interactive.
We wanted to build a instrument for those who invest language.
And this is Frix.
He can introduce new persons in the scene, just raise on the main that same switch on the personal
This is where the sounds of sound.
Video: The force of the race.
David Merrillr: Now he introduced a tractor in the scene.
Video: The task for the portrayl.
Very of y!
When Stable and the same, he assumptions to interact with one of the time to interact -- Video: Ham!
DM: It creates and narrative.
Video: O!
DM: It's a open-up story story with how it will be debate.
Video: Z, pish, pico!
DM: The last example I have time to show you today is a tool of the player I built and interpretation and interpretation and the role of sounds that we were going to be rats and all the rhythm and all bought and all the bagging and all bread.
Each of these are four different variations of you choose to use it.
And you can get the sound of a succession that you can get a lot of you can get the same time you are.
The sounds like the sophisticated Switzerlands of success.
There are effects that you can see poem control, as the filter and filter filter and filter filter the filter of the filtration.
You know, you have a certain sound and then you include it to help it reach it to help it reaches to help it reaches to help it out.
The general effects like the general effects like the topic that are applied to see His to see the His to see it.
Video: YM: We start with a riting rate in the Switzerlands in the successful of success, we have a lot more than a curriculum.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: YM: Now add adputs of dangerous.
Video: And now I'm going to add the film to control the top, to control the effect to control the light.
Video: DM: You can get inclined inclining in a part of a part or or something.
Video: I will think that the movies of the base of the bagging of the expression.
Video: YM: You can do it in the time it is.
So I don't have to do the plan, I can improvise, you can improvise, you can improvise, or a short too.
Now, in the end of the intree of the Spanish of Sismatic volume to the Sweb in the stangle of the sea snake.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is the creation of us is the way that they are right with better and the body with our brain.
And today, I had time to show a coordination of this new space, and you ask the possibility that we try to get out of the launches that we try to get out of the launches of the launches of the launched to show them a way to show you a time to show a coordination of this new time to show a coordination of this new space.
The Gand's going to retina is like we are at this new generators with this new general interviewer with the most digital rules, which will bring information into our rules our rules in our rules.
Thank you very much.
And these eps with nerdation of you are all going to be able to all of you do.
They're writing it.
He wrote the books is my teacher, but of course, more than that.
It's all my mother, my mother, and fascinating a life.
And I don't think that this is going to change everything.
But this is what it was going to happen in the neighborhood was my career in my career that was going to require me to the workers.
And the strange thing is like this book is like the "biography of the "Manana, Renense Roags -- which is a very important to any of my career as a result of my career, has become so important that the reasons in the world for a little bit of an international concept, and became this kind of an international international.
The answer is that the way that I go now, people go now, people are being dead.
Serios -- the connote!
With an example of the saming and you say, "You don't have a theory -- you can't be able to do this for a more passenger performance that?
You don't have to go to the whole whole bunch of life is to create more than a book that will ever be able to do that one one one that is that you ever have a book that ever ever se?"
It's very linked to true.
But it was even more likely to remember if you were not mixed to marriage people -- I want to get people -- I want to become writing -- I want to become writing that kind of writing that kind of a kind of African reaction on a kind of African reaction on a kind of African reaction on a kind of African reaction on a kind of African reaction of African reaction to the same African reaction on the same thing that I was going to get to get to get the people -- I was a kind of a lot of about the
And people were saying "Don't tell you that you don't have any more success?"
I don't know that humility to break your deep your own ideas?
You don't have the framework in this field of life in this field of a boat here and not going to be a degree on a box with a boy of dreamss?"
Something like that.
The answer -- the answer -- the answer to all those inner is "Yes" is "Yes."
Yes, you feel about all of these things.
And always always med.
And you have a lot of things that are being in a lot of things that are not able to intuitive.
As an example of the great algorithms that are crying.
But when it's about the work that I was all the question I think about the last time I was "Why?"
Is this something rational?
It's logic to go to this is that they feel like to do that they feel like to do that they were destroying this Pame.
And what is that that is the specific initiatives that seems like us is really true of health care in a way that other teachers don't do it?
My father was a chemistry and I don't remember chemistry, and you don't get it as a chemical engineering to be asking if you don't ask somebody to be a chemical engineer to be a chemister.
It didn't happen -- John, how do you go with the chemical?
It's just not going to happen to be happened.
But we are honestly, engineers like the group of chemistry that groups are not very much of being alone that are alcools of maniacative reasons.
We write the inss; we have this reputation and not only writing all the way of all kinds of things that are like this reputation to be powerful for being very powerful for.
And all we have to look at the numbers of the numbers of morning in the 20th century, in the 20th century, which have died by young and often often died by young and often often often often often died by the way.
And even those who didn't work on their own beats to be really unredefine life-to-life-to-to-lived lights.
Norman Mailer, even before I get in the last time he said that "Each of my career killing me a little bit more than I have a little bit more than a lot of my books."
A great great great news about a life of a life.
But I don't have to be customer when we hear someone says, because I heard these things like things that we have absorbed and unaccepted and accepted as the collective and suffering, the idea of collective and suffering and suffering and as an inherent in a enemy to the end of the enemy is going to get in a sense of happen.
And the question I want to advertising today is you all of this is you are all the idea?
You can comfortable with it -- because the library of the library of the eye -- I don't get this from the eye of this is the iphase of this is the same.
I think it's like odizzing.
And I also think it's dangerous and I didn't want to see it in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage our artistic artists.
And I know the case of my case, in my case, in my situation -- it would go to the meant for me to this one of the neighborhood of this kind of circumstances, especially in which I think is a circumstance.
As a little bit of Panda, I just have about 40 years.
We probably have been in the time of four decades.
And it's probably probably like I will write the inceptible with this moment to be judged as a work that I came up with my first time my career, right?
What would be to say to the men, because in a kind of a kind of a kind of a -- it's probably the biggest consistent to my biggest consistent to me.
Oh, Doame, what gand!
This is the kind of the way that could do someone else to do to get to go to the end of the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I do to do this in continuing this message that I love.
And then the question is, when?
And so I go back to my meditation, as the manian is that I have to do now, to write a kind of a way to try to create a kind of protective productive, right?
I had to find a way to find a distant way to fear a distant distant that write, and my father who write, and my father would be now before before I write the reaction to what he wrote in what he wrote in what he wrote out.
And as we all went to this in the last year in this sense, I started to find other time to find other society, and I tried to find out if they could have better ideas about how to make people better than our creative creature's emotional risk of how to creative.
The research has led me to the Greece in Greece and Roma and Roma
So the next thing is the inchitchen.
But in Golden and Rome ancient Rome ancient Rome and they believe that the creative of the human being in the human human beings of the human human beings in the way of humans are in the way of the Golden and in the Golden and the way to the real and the Rome of antennia and the human human human human oms and the human human human human human being being being being being being being being in the inside of the way of the people who don't believe that the people who don't believe that the quest of the human be
People who thought the creative of the creative was a spirit of people who are coming from a source and unintelligent and unintelligent and unactive and unintelligent and units.
The GDP call these spirits of creative creatures are the key to the term "proce."
Socracked was because he thought that he was a demon which is a department in the department of the department.
Romans were the same pitch, but they call that spirit created, immoral genius.
What is great, because the romantic genius was actually because a genius was a very exciting individual sample.
They thought a genius was a kind of magnitude as a magical entity of the wall of the wall of the artist studies that Dobby, the same, and unable initially innocent and unusable iness and unitable work in the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the deep that you have the work of the work of the voice that you can do that
Absoldier -- this is really the distant thing that I was talking about the psychological building that we were talking about the result of the workers.
And all the world is that the world has functioned, right?
So the ancient artist was protected by some things, as much narratives?
If your work was strong was the straluma, you couldn't get the world for her, the world as you have this genius that helive the entire genius that helped off.
If your work was critical, it wasn't completely income was completely come from?
Everybody has the strengths were quite ignorant.
So they looked at people in the West creative for a long time.
And then came to Renasting and everything has changed, the idea of the main the center of the universe as the individual in the center of all the mystery of the state of the state of creatures that are going to be more of the natural creatures that are in the divinting.
It was the human immediately, and people started to create the creative that the creative of the individual in the individual way.
And for the first time in history in history and people have started to be one of the artist or the genius to a genius.
And you have to remain is that I did a huge error.
The task, a simple person, a simple person, as he is actually the receptor, as the receptor and the surgeries and the source of myths and the initial action is a little bit of a very unexpected time to agree on the fragile psychological psychological immune of psychological voice.
It's like you have a cooking hill.
It just just incotton and deforms are informing all these things that are all these kinds of things that are in the performance of performance effects.
I think that the pressure of this killing one of the last 500 years.
And, if it's true, I think it's the question is, what do we do we do with it?
Can we do things different?
It can go back to the most old senses of relationships.
It may not be it.
It can just like we don't just want to stand and a rational human beings in a way of 18 minutes.
And probably as you can find people in the audience that would raise us to ask the theory of the theater people are actually doing their press and all their own projects and all the ones and all the world.
It probably won't be able to coverage this idea.
But the question I want to ask is -- why not?
Why don't we think about that?
Because it has a sense of as much as I heard about anything I heard about what we were looking at the very intriguing the creative process of creative process.
It is about any of the time to create something -- basically to create something -- very very useful -- it doesn't always change the behavior.
And, you know, sometimes you can go to the paranormal paranoral to the right side.
I had a reminded where I met in the American American Ruth Stone, which now has been in the way that he was now in the 90 years and that he was told when she told me when she told me when she told me when she told me when she was going on on on the top of the camp, and I just felt a poet on the camera.
The story as a vast of the same.
And it goes on the roads of the camps.
The idea is coming up because you are same, because you are sample under the legs.
In that moment that it has one thing to do, and in which is, "Wah as a applataa."
And the chain to the hill, and the third of the strength of the map of the map and a creative creature, and a creative creature, and to put it in a map and to put it on the map.
Sometimes it wasn't enough to remote that runs and running and running and running and running in the house, and he didn't get the rostereotypels and the poems that were losing the roads of the roads of the roads of the roads around the roads of the beetles of the poet and the one of the poet and the other poet
There were time in the moment that -- and I will never look at this time -- moments that story as much as a lose.
The chain home, the case of the main and the third of the main and the purpose of the creation of the creation of it was going to get through the other and the other man's table and through the other man's and through the dead.
The release of the code and the tragedy of the main and then it is transcription.
So in this case, the tasks on the map of perfect and undogs from the first worst worse from the first worst worst worse.
When I told him -- it's the only one of my own creative process of creative process of creative process
My creative process doesn't really get the consists to this -- I'm not driving y!
I'm a catching that and the way I work on the same day and transparency every day and you are going to go and go out and trucked up with a lot of remain and I think of it.
But even though I was like, in my inner and I was attached to sometimes that phenomenon.
And I imagine that as you were also being many of you are.
And I had the design or ideas that were able to do with a source that I don't know it.
And what do you do you do that?
And how do we support that we should report us to get our minds, the main our minds, the details, the details of the same?
For me, the most relevant example of our days, which is what we can do is the musician that we were doing a musician with a few years ago, I took a lot of years to go to the reviewer in the demand in the demand in the demand of course of the most relevant from the rest of us in the entire day of our daughter that we can do is make a review.
I was going to tell you about this and all of this was almost all the time of the contemporary artist of Chinese contemporary artist and gestablished and gestablished these in-controlled controlling completely integrated efficiency of creative controlling completely inside the creative of creatures.
And by the time it was linked up and immediately the story as a day as a whole day as a result and everything that has changed.
While leadership from a short time of a short piece of a piece of a piece of teenager, as a magnetic and magnitude as a time and inspire as a time is not as a whole, it's not as a little bit of a lot.
It doesn't have a map of math, it doesn't have reported reporto.
The whole thing that the old old old old old anxiety in "a moment to lose this one to be a month for always one.
I'm not enough to remain to reusues."
And instead of just by the time it was just stopped
He stopped the entire process and he did something with everything with a whole new one.
He raised the question of the question and said, "You don't see that they're in volan?"
"Are you like to write a little bit like a chance of now?
If you really want to be able to be in a moment when I can do with you get to you.
If you don't get it and you get to another today.
Take it up to Leonard Cohen."
The tricker process has changed the time that he has changed the way that he was changed the way that he was going to go through this.
It didn't operate to be able to be dealing to be all sorts of intent.
But the process process is in the end, and the third of the time that he took the time he took the same, and only because it was unknown and only because he had to come back and then they gave them to the way to go back and Chinese and then they have to go back and China.
It could be collaboration and the bizarre, and the bizarre in the form of a conversation and the external external that was not too much like Toman-ancient Toman-and-a-Toman ancient one.
And then when I heard the story I started to change a little bit of the way I was doing a data.
This approach me to save when I was at the middle of the "Manca, Iubest, Iub, and I have a lot of available available to where we all work with something that we all know when I work with something that I never think of a disaster to think that it would be a confident of a reposited to be a disaster to be the most propositive.
Not just this thing but the most propositions of the writing one.
I would think we just think we should just abandone.
I remember my time I was talking about the opening hospital and I tried to get the hospital and I tried to get it.
I raised up on the manuscript and I added my comments, and I add a collision of camera.
I told with vot: "sculp," and you know, you can see if you ask that if this book is not going to be the very large one will be just be the very large one of my daugh?
Because you can see that one I put on the beach, and more than I have to do not worry.
So if you want to be better than you want to do is better than you are the right side.
Okay. And if you don't do that, you know, you know, you all of it.
So let me tell you that I was going to give my message.
And I want to consign that I did this me."
Because -- the Conclusion is -- with hundreds of years ago, in North African people get to add people who are going to get to the tough mushroom and music, sacrifice that ended up in the role in the role in the role in the role in the rate --
And they were always wondering, because the dancers were teaching and they were remarkable and they were remarkable to remarkable and they were remarkable to be remarkable and they were all wondering, right?
But sometimes the range of happening, and one of the interpret of the communication of the community.
I'm convinced you all know what I think you all know about what you would see in a certain moment of interpretation.
It's like the time it goes and the dance is in a kind of parking and it's not doing anything different than one of the other 1,000 series of 1,000 series of them -- everything is alone of the 1,000 ser.
In a time it doesn't seem to be in the third way.
It's all in the bottom and the bottom is the air flowers.
Whereas when it happened, and they were saying what they were saying,
and they were all the hands and they were able to scanning the "Alllah, Alllah, Doam," Doamh, Doamn Doamn Gamn Gamn Gamn and yeast and they have a wild."
It's God's God's going.
A interesting history -- -- when the main history -- when the Turn Spanish Spanish and the pronounced it has turned out to the second century has turned out to be in "Allah" in "All's, Allah," and old, "oles."
and they hear that in the time of bats and dancing and dancing.
In Spania, when a remain remains a very impossible and magic is a "Allay," and the arm of "my" -- magnificent voics."
The unintelligent -- a God -- a God of God --
It's wonderful, because we need something like that.
But the head comes up to the second day morning, when the dance is the outside, is the conclude as a big as the morning, it's a scaling scale.
It's a dirty that chances are and that you might not be more and you might not be more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more than the dirats that are a dirty that is a dishiting and it might not be a more and you might not be more and you might not be more and
Would you like to be more invoid to the name when he was the name of the rest of the rest of the rest of your life?
It's hard.
It's one of the most painting of the most painting in life in creation.
But it can not be a big tasking if you don't think about it as you can think of the most extraordinary part, you know, the most extraordinary are coming from the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the world.
It can just like if you just thought they were improud of a source of a few few years of life that are going to be more than any other beaten to be more different from another beaten to each other had been sicked up.
If we think about it is all the way to change it.
I started thinking and think of that I thought it was going to think about the last months of course that will be published by my own position, dangerous and cross and crisis of my succeed and criminals.
And what I do is, I do when you lose the table of the lesson.
It doesn't tell you.
If you come to your dance, then dancing.
If the gene of the gene of the die that you are repartied to go to a quarter in the end, and for a quarter of the forces of forces -- then "le!"
And if no, it goes to anyway.
And with all of you are in the bott!"
I think we should have to do it and I think we should have to pretend to be done.
"Oh!" I just have, because you have a lovely because you have a lovely ininforce and inforce to participate in continuation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We talked about some of these projections, and what it might be able to do is predict of the genome and discovery about new genes.
Now we start with a new point from a new biological point of biology, and now we're trying to start to start in this digital code and go into a new biology, and to go into a new biologists, modeling and asthanks of life.
We tried to put all the time to put our very important questions.
"What is life?" It's something that I think many biologists have tried to understand different levels.
We tried different approaches, simple approaching life, simple components.
We are already already about 20 years.
When I sequenced the human genome -- this is a way of the analogical analogical world in the digital world.
Now we're trying to ask the question: Can we revivivid, or we can create new forces in this digital universal universe?
This is the map of a little bit of genitals, which has the most genome for a specific genome that can replug in the lab that can replant in the lab in the lab of a layer in the lab of a little bit of a little organism of a little organism of a little organism -- ycoplasma organism
We tried to see if we can come up with a genome and smaller one.
We were able to receive the surface of a hundred genes in the judge of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the metabolic map of metabolic map in compared to us.
I think this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can get the first time we can get a little bit of a life that will be a living.
So we decided that the only way we think the only way we can do this crosis, we can get the way to add the components to bring some of the most fundamental questions.
And so I started on the street of the catchromosomomomomer?
Can you have the chemistry allows these molecules that we ever did not do more than we ever did anybody else I ever did not do it anybody ever made it more and more than we ever do before?
And if we can get a crososomerosom?
A crosis, by the way, the way, it's just a little bit of chemical material.
So, our speed of digital life has grew up to a exponential rate to an exponential rhythmal rits.
Our ability to write code code that very very very slowly grown up.
The last time he came to a soup of exponential curve.
I started this on about 15 years ago.
We went through a few ethical examination, in fact, with a bio-et-et-the-the-the-to-making experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficulty is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that make little DNA, long terms, long time that you are 30 to 50 letter the generative process that building a lot more general erosive a lot more ertainment.
So we had to create a new way to put these little pieces together and right right together and right all the errors.
This was our first tenth of the digital information from the digital synthesis of the British CE.4.
It's a virus that killer human gender.
We did the design design of the skills, I went through the errors, and I get a molecule of DNA DNA in a thousand letter about 5,000 letters.
The interesting thing that I took this piece of chemical material, and I put it in bacteria, and I put it in bacteria, and the bacteria, and the bacteria, and to produces this genetic facts in the virus.
The viral viral criss were then released and they came back and they have come back and they have come back and they have come back and they have come back and they have been back and forth of the viral elevents were then released by the viral Particular of the viral and they were released and they released the viral parties of the cells were then released and they were coming back and forth to the E.
I was going to give with the oil industry and they would say that I understand this pattern.
They were laughing more than you are.
And we think this is a situation where the software can actually build their own main in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the entire cross of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code of genetic code.
So we said, we were to put the letter in the top of the virus to actually can actually understand that the size of the size that are the size that are the size of a life of a life cells.
The design is critical critical is critical to the digital information in the computer needs to be very precision, that information must be very very accurate to be very very accurate as well.
When I sequenced this genome in 1995, the standard of the presence was a 10,000 tons of the walls of the basis of the basis of the basis of the basis of the basis of the basis of the basis of the first century of this genome in 1995,
I found it in the resident, 30 to the entire original of the error, that didn't use to be activated.
The design is from design is to design data is the way that has to be a little bit of a different piece of different pieces of different types of sub-to-re-to-re-to-re-to-design to be a little bit more than the other people have to be compatible with each other's televisions.
We are able to do things differently.
You may read that I put "waters" in the house. Get in your homework in four letters of four lets in four lets four letter: T.
Tries in those letters, those letters -- those letters of course, a single literally literally account every precision.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, propositions of the reasons.
And the idea of all I did was to hear the code.
Some of them were disappointed to that it's not poetry is not the poetry.
We designed those little bit so that we can see them was with enzymous enzymous
They're aszymous and they do them and they do it.
So we started doing the pieces, beginning with a five to 7,000 lets to 7,000 lets them to do these pieces of these little bonds, and then put it on these lawyers in this 200,000.
Every time we have these pieces of these pieces of abundant to sequence them to make them sequences a very range of robust -- as you will see a lot.
We try to get to get to that point in this point of automobile automative.
So, this is a baskety of baskety.
When we get to the very large pieces, over 100,000 basses, they don't grow up as much more than E.
They are all the same technical molecular biology of modern molecular molecules.
So we went to other hanisms.
I knew there is a mechanism called recombination of the human biology that that biology use to recombination to recombination.
This is a example.
There is a system called Deinocockroaches that can be the porting of radiation that can be millions of radiation.
As you can see in the chain of the crosome is to be destructed in the kitchen.
12 hours to 24-hours later, he put it on his own way that was at the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be often often all of the organisms.
They can live in life.
I am absolutely sure that life can be in the extraterrestrial space, to keep it a new environment to go through a new environment to get a new environment in the lighter of the human environment.
In fact, NASA came there.
Here is a micro-graph of a molecule that we build these procities -- actually using only only only only the design of the design of the design of the design that we put on the topics that we put on the top.
Drojjaws them together and they put them together into the machine.
This is not a microscope with electronics, but only a to-micro-graphic video games.
It's a big molecule that we can see a microscope with a microscope.
These are collected in a time of about six seconds.
This is a public that we had a little bit time.
These are over 580,000 letters of genetic code of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule made by the way, with a definition.
It has a mass of molecular over 300 million people.
If we put a two-to-10 pages, 142 pages to get a genetic code, this genetic code, this genetic code,
So, how do we start a crososs-gravy?
Evivil with a virus is quite easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
And I also also have easier when you get to euhave, you can just take the nuclear nuclear nucleus, and that's something you all heard -- and that's something you heard --
With the archa, the crossing cha, the cross is in the cell phone, but we showed that we can do a completely transplant to a completely transplant from one of other, and we can activate it.
We had a crossed of a micro-to-species.
The second is that as as people and the same.
We added some genes in the full of gene to this crosphomosome.
I had been dealing with enzymous proteins in all the proteins
And it was pretty amazing when I put in the cell -- you will appreciate our sophisticated -- and cross -- and cross the cell -- and the chosomer has come in the cell.
In fact, I thought this is how far it can go out and try to design the process of something more and we tried to design a process of something like this.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are all sorts of species that have been able to drive a second crosis, or a third of the third of the party, or a new ways, thousands of new new new characteristics in a second.
So those people who think about evolution just as a single gene of changing in biology.
They're called enzymous restrictions that were actually destruction, which actually had the DNA
The philosophy that was in the cell not a one.
The way -- the crosome -- the crosome that we put us --
It was expressed and recognized the other cross that material, and so I got it as a dized, and so we just reached with the crosome of the cross of the cross of the crosome and the new trosphorosphorosphorosphorosphere, and it was conceived and the other cross of the other crossing crosome as well.
It became blueprint because of genomomomomomomer-
And after a very short time -- the characteristics, all the characteristics of a new species that has lost in a new species, and it was a new set of software that we put in the cell that we put in the cell that we put in the cell phone.
All the proteins were changing, membranes were changing -- when we do we do is exactly what we have is exactly what we have is exactly what we have is exactly what we have transferred in the way we transferred the proteins were changing.
That can sound like alchemistry, but we can move through the DNA, to change the same thing.
Now, I suppose that this is not genesome -- but it has to build three billion years and a half years and we support that we can support a new version of the lab in which is a new version of a new specific design of a new specific design that is a new design of design design that is a new design of digital design that is based on the digital design of a mammal-year-old design design of a new version of the evolutionary of the Talec
Why do that?
I think it's quite obviously of being a needle of needs.
We're on the way to go from six and a half of them over 40 years.
So to ask this in context for me to my own I was born in 1946.
There are three people on the planet for each of us in 1946, in 40 years, will be four.
We have been snapped to insist water drinking water and a few hundred billion and half-billions and half.
It will be difficult to do for us.
We use over five billion tons of the books, more than 30 billion bars of oil.
That means a hundred million barriers per day.
When we try to think about profound biological or any process that will replace that will be a challenge.
Then, of course, is all that CO2 from this material, which is that reaching in the atmosphere.
Now, from our discoveries around the world, we have a basic data with over 20 million genes, and I like to think about these as the design design of the design of the design of the future.
The electrical surgeons has only a due of a party, or something like this, and the diversity that has come out of it.
We are limited here, in the first one, biological reality and our imagination.
We now have the technical technique to do things that we call what we call what we call what we call the genymical genimick.
We have the ability to build a big robot that make a million cross on the day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of genes of different genes or try to optimize the occurred to produce the chance to produce pharmaceutical products and products we can change more biological than the last 20 years, we can just do more biological biology than the last 20 years, to do the same biology than the last 20 years,
And that's just just the standard selection of standard selves.
We can sell for viable to do chemical products or fuels or fuels, producing the citizens.
This is a head of an ecological design that we work in order to wait to wait and work in the computer species in the computer species.
You know, we don't know how it will show you how it will show you.
We know exactly how they look at their genetic code in their genetic code.
We now focusing on the fourth of fourth generation.
You saw it recently in the mithan-the-in-ended experiment.
We have the second generation of the generation of the third and the third of the things that are safe, which are often at the larger or different values like occupy or different types or different types of button.
But the only way we think that biology can be a major impact on the food products and the fall of the way of doing the limitation is if we start with CO2 as a matrix is that we are going to build the cell phone, and we believe that we will have the first combat the generation of the generation of the fourth of the generation of the fourth in about 18 months.
Low and CO2 is a way -- but in our discoveries we have all different ways of our world is we have all different ways of the world we have all different ways of the way of the world we have all different ways of the world is a solar and CO2 is a solar and CO2 is a solar and CO2 is a way of the O2 is a way of our world is a way of our world is a way of our world.
This is a organism that I wrote in 1996.
It goes into the deep of the ocean and about two kilometers and half a half of the falls of bees and a half of the bees of beats.
Transform CO2 in metan use of hydrogen molecular as a source of energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 capital that can be able to transport that we can make that we make that CO2 back to the CO2 back to the product to the product to the product to the product that propose.
So one short time ago, we think we could have what is the basis we can ask what is the life?"
We really know -- you know -- we have a path of replacements of oil industry.
Yes. If you can't do that at TED, where another park in the other park?
So to get a big source of energy.
But we also work to use these same same same sources to invest to the same thing that is immediately safe.
You saw this year with the Your net, we are always a dollar in mind when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think that the situation can be able to build vaccines that we were able to do anything that before before you are.
So here we could go to look at the future change the evolution of evolution, accelerating evolution, accelerating, architects, and finding evolution, and finally, infinally, eukars.
We're almost to improve people.
Our own is only to make sure that we have a lot of advance to survive to survive very long for you to do that. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you now, is a fundamental work, is a new technology, a new technology that I added up to Microsoft as a part of a half a year. This is a year. This is a year. This is a year. This is a year. This is a year. This is a lot.
It's a medium that can interact with a lot of visual data from a big data of visual data visual data.
We're now looking at a lot of digital pictures of digital and the big photographs and half-time spending it in this one, rescue by this way, rescue anyway.
It doesn't matter how much information we are looking at the facts of the big data or how big are images.
Most of them are showing up with a common digital camera, but this is a very special scanning from the Bible Congress, the surface of 300 methods of the month of the month of the month.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that we should limit limitations a system is the number of marker you are also a very data. It's also a very fly of an architecture very flow.
This is a book book that is a very imaginative example of a nonimaginative.
It's about "Hicken." He said, "Hickens.
To show you that it's about text, and not a imagine, we can do something like this, to show that it's a real representation of a text; it's not a positive positive.
Maybe this is a way to read a book in form of electronic book in formed electronic book.
I wouldn't be recommend.
This is a more real. It's a "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian of the "Gardian ide of a "Gardian inal case.
Each image is the beginning of a century.
This is really going to really play a piece of experience of a quarter of a reviewer or a theory or a theory of multi-dimensional environment.
We did something we do with something little bit of this number of "Gardian of Gardies."
We created a false reclaim to a very large -- much bigger than any clear -- and I got a common conclusion, and I reached a contains a contension of a concrete reclusion.
If you want to see the property, you can see the property, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the technical specifically specific species.
And this is really through the ideas, the enemy of a monitor.
We hope that this is to be able to get the pop-in-in-in-in-in-in-scale -- which are not necessarily
Of course, the mapping is one of the same applications for a certain kind of thing.
I won't say much time on this is a long time to tell you that we have contributed to this particular field.
These are all the way in the United States of the United States of NASA.
Let's go to a little bit of something else.
This is actually active on the Internet accounting.
This is a Photosyne, which is a different technology. Where is Sealopon and the other one of them is a wonderful research in the field of visual perception of Novadon Novador, absolutely unpreceed by Novador, reveredadly, Steve See See See See See See See See in Washington, the U.S.
and Rick Szeliski at Cereliski Microsoft.
So this is active on the Internet.
You can see that when we create these kinds of perspective, we can get this kind of imaging images in many ways.
But the space of the space of these images are true.
The other visual allim of visual perception of these images, so that to cover the real place where these pictures -- all of the Grases of the Grass of the Grass -- have been done by the Grass' -- there were these tools here are visualized or panorbs here are the creatures.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There are some more space of otherness.
I want to go back to one of the original core of Noah -- this makes a part of a certain basic protool that I worked in a vast -- to show you what I think is that the pioneered by this technology, it's just a part of this technology, it's not just a very unexpected projects, not just of course of this technology that I put on the website.
We had to care about the lawyer things like this.
This is a reconstruction of Cathedral Hug of Damr. Does Flickr. Does Flickr, and you find something with a guy in the trick, and you find something that in the trick, every single one of these conported contain conported in the truth is a picture that would find that cool.
These are a Flickr, and all of them were related spaces in this way.
We can just have to be navigated in this way.
You know, I never thought I would go to work at Microsoft is very measuring to be part of a part of a part of a very first here.
I don't know that you see there are a lot of camera, all of the camera, all of the cell phone at SLRs in this environment.
If I can find out that kind of falling this weight.
There are so many mammms, sized by the way,
Where this is a series of photography --
This is a poster of the Damer who was recorded by the right thing.
You can remove to a poster to a physically environmental environment.
The idea is that I can do some things with social environment. This is to collection from all the world -- from collection to collection that Earth visualize the Earth -- and interconnected to them all those pictures, they have been connected to them all these pictures. All of the ones that is more than the summer than the parts.
You have a model of what comes out of the entire Earth.
Think about this as a long as the code of Stephen Lawler to the Earth Virture."
And this is growing in complexity as the world as the world as you use it as much as they use them as they use them as well.
The design is the book of meters are the meeting of meters that somebody else comes out.
If someone would all these shaped stock and say who I call my photographs of the NDs are improved with all these data and you could use that as a signal experience to get that kind of social experience that space, to realize that space, a kind of social interaction.
And of course, a product of a bond, but all of these are virtual models of the Earth's life that are not only from the Earth, collected, collection of the village and images of the village and images of collective and images of collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood the right thing to allow you to get your software to be like a moment in the next few years, it's like a few years, it's like to be interrelated by someone on a giant interrelate?
BAA: Yes. What is really to be able to do is to be able to do is to be able to do that.
It creates hyper-connected to the top, if you want to do.
And it turns out that they based on the images of the images.
And this is going to read when you think about the outsides of the signal information that have these images.
As you do a little bit of imaging image, you hear the Internet, and the text on the Internet is a lot of information on the Internet is going to be a lot of information about what the position.
Now, what would be if that position does the connection with all the picture?
When the amount of interconnection and the box that is a huge amount of require that is where the classrooms.
CA: Blaise, it's quite incredible. Felics.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the illness of intense and one of the research and one of the research is that they don't look at the old research is not looking at their old old who don't look at their old in the window, who feel the last of the same, they still have the plants in the roads of the plants in the lead of the planet.
You don't know that the Jaguary Jaguary Lacuary Lacy, or that the myths of the older of the older of the people who are still continuing with the Himal-hill, is just the revelation of Dhard's revelation is to remember the world that we actually have the world in a sense that there is no sense of the world that we live in a sense of a real model of the world that we have no sense.
The consequence of a certain set of choices that our ancestors have been doing their own generations in the next generation in the next generation in the next generation.
And of course, we all share the same adaptive adaptive adapties.
We all are born borders. We all bring kids on the world.
Those are coming through the initial ritual ritual ritual rituals.
We need to do the separation of morning of morning is dead, so we should be surprised that we all have to do we all have argues of the art.
But what interesting is is the real tough the task of songs, the rhythm every culture.
Whether is that the Penan Elamo of the Borneo, or the war in Haiti, or warning the Kaishad, or the war in the north of Kenya, or a day. The main of Enlightenment of Anyahai.
And this is the guy that I traveled by the desire and even a month or even a long time on Qomold, Evered, Everest, the Evered, the earth of the world.
All of these people are learning that there are other ways to think of other ways to think about the whole way of thinking about Earth.
And this idea, if you think about hope, you can't play
Now, miridges of the world is working together a spirit of spiral life that cover and cultural health for the planet and the cultural health for human health health health health as a network as a biological resident, we know the biological quarters.
And you might think about this network as being the nosphere of life as being able to definition and you could definitely define the myths, myths, intuitions of intuitial intuitial human imagination from the imagination of the conscience.
Etnosphere of human beings is the great human being.
It's the symbolt of what we can be like a surprising specific specific specific species.
And as the biosphere was seem to be seero-ets, and maybe a lot more higher scale.
For example, no one of the most exciting would suggest that half or more of all the species of all the species of extended as a quote, because it is not true, and yet this is not true, and yet this is the most exciting storyteller -- the biological scenarios -- the biological storms -- the above of the cultural diversity of cultural diversity.
And the biggest one of these is the most famous disappears.
When you were born to you, the people in this room, there were 6,000 languages.
Now, a language is not only a lawyer or a set of free rules.
A language, is a scaling of human spiriting.
It's the vehicles that the slow of the blue of particles are going to get in the material.
Every old language, is a very old based on the mind of reception, a reception, a quote, a spiritual immential possibilities.
And from those 6,000 languages, as we know here in Monterey, a half of them are not the opposite of children.
There are no babies of babies that means that if they don't change something, that are already going to change something, that are already moving.
What can be more than you are going to be able to get the last linear of your own way to talk to you who are to talk to you not have the way to be the way or the enemy of the children or to anticipate the tree of children?
And yet, that sounds like the soft is really the unless you can see on Earth, about every two weeks, because every two weeks, a single older of the morning is a male of a morning, a nal language.
And I know some of you will say, "Well, would be better going?
It wouldn't be better than I all talk about if I all talk about a single language? And I said, "Grozavo language. Or to be the ia.
Or to Kogi."
And you will find out how it would be able to find out how you are to talk to you about your own language.
So, what I want to do today with you know, a nosphorus -- a short journey to try to give you a sense of what to do is losing you some of the fact that you will lose you lose to be losing you of the fact that it is going to be losing of you today

They can be remains only with each other with other computing and chemistry that brings you to MA.
Now, the fascinating thing is that the cars find in that time in that time is the MAAO are the same kind of potential to potential to be a blueprint of 80,000 species of flying on the floring of 80,000 species of dirty assrobs that have these two nitrogen plans that have created a verphysiological initial plane that have a single verphilosophers in this particular one of the entire neighborhood of the entire plane that are the entire body?
Well, we use that as a great woman, which is trying to heroids that is not a sense.
But the question of you and they say, "Plants" speak."

He put the balls on the street of the excreditions and when he finally sweet a few hits and he smiles a few of it.
He was judged and improvised a mammoth-maybe, he took a few inelse's spring and improvised a few slopped up a same, and he died a same, and it ended up on the street in the excrediling, having a same.
And we're talking about to be more of nothing. And in a lot of ways in many ways, it's a symbol of the Industrial Middle of all the world.
In the 1999, 1999, the canadian ended back to a lot of controls a lot more than California, and Texasass together.
It's our new new new one. It's called Navel.
It's an independent territory of independent controls all the mineral resources.
An amazing example of how a national store can look and find reparations for the people for the people for the people for his potent to his own beats for his own main his own own own idea,
And finally, at the end of the end of us is obviously the ones that we traveled in these planets are not going to be able to be unless than they are not going to be removed to be dealing with it.
They are the pays of people.
They are the human images that are coming from the time of human beings to all of us to all of us as a little bit of the children, like the dreams of the kids are become part of hographs of hopels.
What we tried to do is doing in the National Geographic is that we believe that policians will never realize something like that.

where all the wisdom of all the poor of all the collective of our collective commodity.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about a book about a book that I hope will remote with other things that you would have heard that you already heard that you already heard that you would have already been a lot of you have a rats.
I want to start with what I call the "doct."
The Docchring of that?
The Docchring of all the Western society of the Western industry.
And this doctor is a little bit like this: if we are interested in the way we are interested in the very good level of the citizens, the quarter to do is a maximum of individual freedom level.
The reason is so freedom is so the freedom is that the very basic value, which is essentially to be many, which is the human to be many,
And because if people are free when people are free and make the individual and make things that are going to make our own good decisions and not one need to decide in our place in our place in our place in our place in our place.
The maximum to the freedom is the maximum of choices.
The more choice of the choice, the more freedom of the ethers, and the more freedom of the more freedom of the more freedom of the more freedom of the way you remain the way they remain the way they were more freedom of choice, and the more choices of the choice, and the more freedom of choice, and the more freedom of the choice, and the more freedom of the edom of the way they have a lot of freedom of freedom of freedom of the more freedom of freedom of freedom of the rest of the rest of the rest of the til
Then, I think it's so good in our system that would not get to get to go through the head of the head of the head of the head to put it on the same.
And it's deep in our lives in our lives.
I'll give you some examples of what made is doing is what it did for us time.
This is a supermarket.
I want to tell you only two words about safe.
175 snoses for the supermarket, if you don't cover and the 10 different types of measurements of the two different types of hopelined and the 12 othals that you can buy their own inner in a very large number of balloons that you can buy the one of the 175 that you can buy a very large number of the 175 that are the strength of the 175 that are the strength of the 175 that you can buy the stage that you can buy the staggapped the stagged in a very large number of the stage in in a very large number of be
So it's the supermarket.
And then you go to the electrical components to confused to confused a stereo -- the shape, the shape, the shape, which is the shape.
And in this process of electronic components are a lot of the stereo.
We can contain six million and half million people are stereo stereo stereotypt.
You have to recognize that this means a lot of options.
In other fields -- in the world of communications --
It was a hitchen, when I was a child, where you could get any kind of a vast phone service as much as it was offered as MBell.
The one-two-phones.
By the way, one of the consequences of this is not the right phony.
And those days are very apused.
Now, we have a lot of telephones, especially in the phones, especially in the telephones.
These are the mobile phones of the future.
My previous is in the middle -- with MP3 player, apart from the near of the night and the tors for the Spanish to make me credit creep.
And if you have seen it didn't see in the stage you can see it in the room because in the cure of it.
And the result is that they do people to go into the stores and put this question.
And you know what the answer is the answer to the question of the question?
The answer is "No." It's probably going to be able to buy a phone that you don't know how much it is.
And in other lights of life that are much more important than the base of opinions that are the number of options.
The health system -- in the United States is not the case you are going to do with the doctor and this is telling you what to do.
Instead, you go to doctor and this is saying, we have a variation and the variation of B.
It has these advanced advantage and these risks.
BBBy these advantages, what do you want to do you do it?
And you say, "Yocking," and the doctor says, "It has these advantaged these advantagoes and the rises of these these advanced and the rises of these and rises the rises of that.
What do you want to do?
And you tell "But if you were in my place you do the doctor says, "But the doctor says, "But I'm not in your own place is -- I say "authority." And the result is a very benefit that a thing that makes a lot of efficiency.
But what is actually a transistor transition and decisions of trying to figure out what you know is something -- in this case, in the case -- someone who don't know is almost almost as a disease as a disease -- and it's not just as a way of how that patient -- in this patient.
There are a huge level of public health levels for the medical medical school with the reets, which if you think is a little bit of a lot, it has no loved a lot, because we don't have any love.
Why do we adjusting the new audience if we don't we do it?
The answer is that the people who do this is waiting for us to call the doctors in the morning, and to change our network and ask us to change our country.
Something as important as our identity has become a choice, and this transition of a role of a role to show that.
that we don't die is a identity but we have the ability to have the ability to have the ability to do it.
And we can reinvest us to reinvent any of the ones we have a check.
And that means that every day when you go to the point you have to decide what kind of person you want to be able to be there.
And with the same thing for the sun and familiar with a lot of the people who are going to get you at least any any time you have to go to the children as much as you get to get the kids as quickly as you start to have to have to get kids to get to the children as quickly.
The only one was a little bit of a dinner with no one of the same thing you will do after it.
And in our days, everything is very close to the end.
I give you incredibly smart students and give them to 20 percent more than I was doing a little bit more than I was doing it.
And this is not because it would be less dealing because it would be less maps.
What do you think of the question because they are being able to do with all sorts of questions?
I should I go back to me and I have to do it for children, or a cary?" All of you are questions that consumption.
And they will answer to these questions, no matter if that means to be not to do all the bones that give and not a good at my cure to my cure on my curves on my curves of my curves of my curves of my goal --
And that's what you have to do. These are the questions that you have to answer that we have to answer it.
The way -- we're blessed and the Carl and the Carl and the technology that allows us to work every minimal of every minal -- more than a little bit of a planet -- more than the Hotels in the Web Randphenomenon of Hotelevision.
By the way, there's a region in a cold, which I didn't get to revealing anyone in which they work is where they work is the wireless-free so-called so-called so-called the so-called the so-called the French is a core of a collaboration in a collaboration in a collision of a collision of in a collection of the color,
I won't tell you about it because I want to use it.
So this is that this incredible incredible free to choose that we have to choose a worker, is that we have to take a decision, and you know, if we should not be able to work and if we should be done.
We can go to see how our football of our football in a bunch of the other and Blackberrylackberry, probably that on the other six.
And even though they're all prison every mind that we look at that the door you are doing a fotal piece of football, we ask us "Are we asking us to this else?
I should answer this email? I should write the letter this letter this letter?" And even if the answer is "not that experience experience the way of your own football of you are very different from what it would be quite different.
So in the enemies of things and small objects and little things that are a lot of life is a lot of options.
And the world I was living in the way that I was doing this.
To say that, I was doing that, I had some choices to do that, but not everything was a different thing.
And the world where we live here is what we live on it.
And the question is, is good or or use?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what I know is good at this, so I will talk about what I'm going to talk about what is going on.
All these choices have two facts of negative effects on people.
One of the effecties, it's a paralyze, it's more than released.
And by so many option that can choose people who are very difficult to choose for something like something like that.
You would give you a very significant example of the investment of investment in the private private private expensive.
A colleague was in the data that has had access to the blood from the Valley, so that has almost a million employees and nearly 2,000 sees and nearly 2,000 sees.
And what it turns out that for every 10 percent of the engine that office the employees of participation with two proper participation.
50 foundations -- it is about 10 percent of the time you are looking at 10 percent of the people you have only a few few few cities.
Because 50 foundations of mutuals between which is the naid to choose you to choose you to choose that you will want to choose and you go on and a handle and a handle and on the hand.
And then on the tuned and then the same, and then you know, and the feeling and the course of course, is not going to be more and of course, it doesn't see.
You get that this doesn't just mean that they will be consuming people who are going to use for a few hundred money to put it on the death of a way to put a choice is so hard to make a big decision-making making that kind of a lot of money from the compensants that would provide the compensants that would provide the compensants that would provide the employees that would provide the employees the employees that would provide the employment to the employment to give you the employees of the compendant people who would have
And we were looking at the leg at the top of 5,000 dollars a year from the employees of the employees of compensants that would give the compensing.
So the credit is a consequence when you have too many options.
And I think that this is going to show that this is something like this.
You want to take the best choice if it's for all the eternity, right?
You don't want to choose to choose or even the one of the wrong or even waste.
So this is a second effect. The second is that we can do to be able to keep the strength and make a little bit more satisfy to be less satisfy than we have been doing with the outsides of the choice that we are going to choose the choice that we choose the choice that we choose to choose it.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that you have a lot of snoses for a lot of people who are going to choose if you look at one and it's not perfect?
It's easy to imagine that you would have been able to imagine that would be better choicing you would imagine that alternatives you imagine that alternative you imagine that the way you would imagine that you have a way that you made it in the village that you have a good decision-making decision-making that you really was a good decision-making decision.
The more opposite of the opposite of the opposite you to regret on the option that you have alone you have a little bit of the option you have it.
Second, which economists call it costs to be the opportunity.
Dan Gilber shown up in this morning, in this morning, we are talking about what we compare things that we compare to what we compare to do is what we compare to what we compare to them to what we compare to what we think we are very clear that we were very clear in this morning in this morning in the morning in this morning,
Well, when you are a lot of alternative alternative to have a lot of alternative to imagine the characteristics that you break the materials that you break that you get less satisfy of alternative that you have a little satisfy that you have a little satisfy that you have a little satisfine that you have a lot of satisfy of alternative to be a little bit satisfy of alternative
Here's an example. I ask the people who are not New Yorkers.
But here's how it should be about.
We have this box in Hamptons.
A very expensive property.
The superbits superbon. They have a wonderful day to do.
What could you want to want to do more than the drug is thinking.
All of my career in Manhattan are coming in.
I could actually look at the office in front of the office that the idea that the idea that the sea and the point that the same.
The bottom line of opportunity in the village that we have on the way we choose is even the exceptional choices is just the exceptional to be exceptional.
And the more options of how much of the options are going to be so dealing these options will be perceived as we are perceiving as we are dangerous opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon television says a lot of things.
It says that we should be living and be able to live and probably we should do things even do right now.
But one of the things that tell you is that anyone in the choice you will not do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of lights in the lights that you do what you do you do what you do you do what you do you do you what you do you do what you do you do what you do you do what you do you do what you do you do is a lot of things can have a lot of things can have a lot of things can have a lot of things can have a lot of things that are going to do you do what you do you do what you do you do you do what you do you do what you do you do what you do you do you do what you do you do you do what you do the same attract to do you do you do what
Third of the wave ways.
That she loved when I wanted to replace my bluegies.
I can get almost all the time.
And there was a way that the blugs were one of the bees were a single one and you buy them and they were incredibly unable and if you box them and they were incredibly uncomfortable and saving them much time and they were starting to saying, and they were starting to stay better than they started to stay better than it was to stuck to the right right to the right now.
So I went to my blueprint after I had been paid on the old and I said, "Look, I want a wall of the beetles, which is the right thing to be smiling, the right thing to be smile, sweet you?
Do you want to be with farmers or with far? Do you want to prepared or your side?
Do you want to be the same thing.
You want to eventually do you want to be smiling on the beetler --
He painted my face and she said, "I want to say, "I want to be the only guy who were the only kind of have a idea that I spent a city that I spent a city that I spent a city of all the walls -- the trallel -- the trillion -- the launched -- the truth -- the way that I had the right -- the one of the right -- the one of the ones I had.
I have better good. All of these options have done better possible.
But I was feeling worse I felt worried about it.
Why? I wrote a book in which I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt more worse is that I felt that we had all these options that I should be a wall of my expectation of how they should be a wall raised up.
I had very sweep. I didn't have any ways.
Now when there are 100 sorts of timens, one of them have to be perfect.
And what we have was good, but not perfect.
So I compared what I was going to get what I expect is that I was disappointed in compared to what I was hopped in comparison what I was hopped in the comparison what I was hopeled to do with what I was going to do with what I was going to get what I was going to get what I was going to get with what I expanding with what I expect is that I was
The law of option in the lives of people can't do something else than to grow on how people have to do they have to be those options.
And the right thing to take on a little bit more satisfaction even if they get good results.
Nobody from the market, the fact that you don't know that.
Because if you knew it was not going to be the idea of what I talk about.
The real thing is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was the best when it was the way that when people who were actually possible to expert was actually possible to be paid source of sources.
Today, in the world we live -- we live -- we are in the world that we expect the perfect thing -- the best thing that you can tell you that things that you can tell you how things that are going to be so good to be so good to be as well as you can be so good.
You never never have a surprised because the expectation of my expectations and my grandparents' and I was going to be on the sky.
The happiness -- because you all came up with this happiness -- the secret is to be waiting.
I want to say -- just a short time -- I actually have a little bit of a wonderful -- and it's really a wonderful thing.
I couldn't find something better good. I didn't have any one.
But let's look at the house not necessarily not necessarily for a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of a bubble to a wall you can buy a lot of when you can buy a single one one is that you can't get a tumor and ask you who is a lot of you are going to be the end is the same.
The world is coming out. What is you could be able to do you do?
When are hundreds of different stills of different stars and somehow do you disappointed and you ask the question of whenever you ask you whenever do you ask the question?
It's as a clear that answer, the answer to the question is,
You could be better to choose better.
In a hundred different ways of voices that you don't have any extensive to be a same.
So when people take decisions, even if people do the outsides are good to do the choices are good disappointed to the bees are slowing up.
The fact of erupon the world in the last generalized world in the last generation.
I think a big contribution -- not the only thing -- but important in this erupon this erupon the synchrons, it's that people have experiences that people are too much more grown than the standard are too much resolved.
And when you have to explain these experiences believe that they are coming in.
So the general result is that we take a better thing we do is worth and we feel more so.
So let me remind you to remind you.
This is the doctrinitial doctor who all believe that we think is really true.
Without the discussion to have a few choices better than nurse, but here is not better than the best choice are better than the beaches are better than the one of the bed.
There are a magic. I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty sure that I went to a lot of this points of life on the way that the state of life.
Now, the idea -- almost I was finally finally -- the thing that is this one.
What allows these choices all these choices in society is good as the material.
There are many places in the world in the world and we heard of some of them are not that much of options.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the thing about talking about is a strange problem of Western societies.
And what is frustrating and suffering is this: Steve Levitt talks about how these machines are going to be able to get on the mouth of the way you would have money on the mouth.
What I tell you that these options, expensive, and complicated not only help you.
They actually actually really challenging the path.
They really do it is what we do is worth to be worried about.
If something that allows us to do as in our society to do is what we do would be transferred in society that people have too much more than the ones that are not only only the lives of the same and our lives would be improvement but our lies would be improvement but our lies are all the way of our lives.
That's what economists call the Pareto.
The income from the income will be better to do is better people -- not only poor people -- because of the way that we are making us sick.
In conclusions that you think about this cartooner and being a sophisticated person you are going to say, "W! What do you know is the pitch?
You know that nothing is possible in this active actor." Imagine a mid-to-quarter sized and I read it and I read it and the first time I read it and the first time.
And the way I thought I was a lot of my time I was able to think about it.
Because the real thing is that if you hope that everything to be possible, you don't have possibly freedom of the desire.
If you are going to go on so that everything is possible, the way that the village is the street.
You believe and the credit and the scale.
Which is necessary to do a variety.
This is almost too limited -- probably even for a phase -- probably for us to be safe.
But the absence of metaphor is a reetter for unhappiness and presence and support it to be a lot.
Thank you very much.
