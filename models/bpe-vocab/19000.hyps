And the year we have arrived these two diameter to prove that the big island of the last three million years ago, the most of the last 48 million years ago was the size of 48 percent of the month of 400 percent of the mon.
But this morning, this is the serious issue because it doesn't have the range of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the mid-to-the-theater.
The police police is in a way of the global system that is the global system.
She was expected by the way, and the contraction of the country.
The next month of the next positive that you will be a very quickly quickly will be a little bit of what happened in the last 25 years.
Given the peak is the marclever with the microscope.
As you can see the blue is the blue of blue be.
This is the opposite of the year.
And it is the morning.
Aretered the code of the hypothese, with a year or more than a single single one of the destruction of a body.
In 2-year-old has been in this case.
This is a problem because the inquality of the destruction of the ocean.
where it's happening is a mammal of the carbon disorder, when it required in metaphor of the micro-organisms of organisms.
Computers with the pollution of the global warming global warming in the atmosphere can take this extreme way to do this is the extreme way of doing this is the extreme thing to do is that we can do this is the effective of the pollution.
In certain cases in certain cases of the Alaska metal ruma is to report the range of disease.
The Katch Katout Walter in Alaska was on the Alaska team of a team of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the past.
Another video. Hau! The Gore: It is the word is if we use it.
And a reason is that enormous "Ye" is Gringredian is Growise.
This is a range of anual.
But the volume are much larger than no longer than no one of them.
This is the Kangerlan of the Grushenland.
If you can see how the big the debate of the destruction of the skin in the way that is where it's the place in the sea in the big place.
These debate very quickly.
And at the other side, Antarctica largest main the largest main the planet.
The last people have the last people have report that the continent of the continent is negative that the continent is negative negative of the Antarctica of range of insulin the submarine rying over the fastest range.
This is the equivalent of the high-quality levels of Growise.
In Himalaya, the main the third of the monkey as the new as a new force of new forces of new travels.
40 percent of the population of the world of the world of the water of the water of these toilet.
In Andrew this guild is the ball of the poverty.
The fact that they have recool.
But when it gets happened, and the water is happening with the water and the water of the water
In California was a report of 40 percent of the farmer in Sierra.
This is the remarkable of water.
And predictable, as you have reading it, they're serious.
In the world of the drug has been to a crash of the incentive of the incentive of the incentive of the incentive of the desire of the world.
And the only one of the global campaign is the extraordinary rich with a great great great rats.
Two more than the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the 75 years of the 75 degrees.
This is a huge model of remarkable.
If you look at the context in context of the context of what happens.
In the last five years we have a 70 million various dioxide of the carbon dioxide in every single day in every day in the ocean.
The Up will with the Saction of the Pacific, and the way to the Western of America, and every part of the subcontinent of the oxygen of oxygen in the ocean.
The largest because the largest country of global global warming global networks, which repression, is the report of the insurance of the fossil of the fossil of the fossil of the fossil of the high-fossil because the largest role of the world's largest because the largest because the largest because
The problem is a problem and the cars is the most serious issues is the most serious problem.
The United States is one of the two big other other other inition, the other China.
And the proposal was to build a lot of factor.
But we start to see a change.
Here are the people who have an opposite of the last last years with alternative produced report
Everything is, there is a policy of our politics in our own country.
And the industry and the oil and the oil was found a billion dollars in the last year.
The good news is what is a cool.
This picture of a reminder of something like this.
In the Crank County, a billion French of Tennesian iPhilosophical carto.
You probably probably hear about the stories.
This is the whole thing on the big tape, the second largest resident.
One of the reclaims of the book-up industry, was this.
Video: Whoomen, the cartoons, the book is a flight and you see the symmetry and yeah,
He is an abstraction in America, and help the creation of the creation of the economy.
Frosty, the man with the book, the good book, it is what is happening in the way of doing what is the more curriculum.
He is also a lot of work and work and work of the report of the bad.
Al Gore: This is the only of the cartoon-Virginia.
The inner of the most most famous book is the great bley of Massey C.
Video: Don Blankenz: I want to be clear the month. The Nank, Harry Reison Reiham of what I am I am not about what I am I talking about what I do.
Al Gore: So that Alizon for the CEthiopia Cidie.
This is one of them, a lot of them from one of them.
Video: The COLOALOALi we see our climate change as a three-dimensional threats of business.
And that our magic is to spend a big amount of money for a long time to help us do our own inforce to help us to do good news about the car.
The idea is clear, in fact, the good books is not didn't.
We think it's a curriculum -- and the road and so on.
So it will not be the remarkable of climate change.
You can get this in our way.
Video: The book you have heard a map of it.
So you can do a tube a tube a culture of this poverty of a good position.
Uent! The Masinaria is about the gypt.
But this is the sound of the technology of the book of the carto.
And as the cars of the magic causes the global remarkable global remarkable technology, the good technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of all the time.
The other will be with the technology of the technology of the book is the good news.
Al Gore: In the end, the opportunity to report the challenge of the challenges of the security of the security of security.
Video: Narrator: The crisis, the economy, the desire of the climate of the climate crisis.
The report that they are the destruction of all the compounds of the destruction of the destruction of the skills of the sky.
But now we have a new solution to the new solution to the new initious in the incities.
You know, the energy of the 100 percent of the 100 percent of the 100 years ago.
A plan to put the money in America and then make it more likely to help us to help the global warming global global global global global global global global global global global global global global global global world.
In the end, a solution that is to help us solve the big problems.
You can come to America.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: Narrator: It's about re-risk of the United States.
One of the most define of the fastest report of the old compounds of old didirty didn't, our future is here in our planet here is here to be here in the new replication.
Barby, 2: 2: We invest to create the destruction of the room.
Narrator: The energy is the time for the privacy.
Al Gore: Exister proverty proverty that says, "If you go to the right thing to do is going to go fast."
If you want to get to the road up to the wise.
We need to get back to the way.
Thank you very much.
The year I was doing a TED of the LHCH.
And I promised to come and put it into a series of how they work work.
So the ide of it. And for the people who have no largest experiment that have been the largest experiment that was the largest experiment -- Cirosphorus or is the 27 kilometers or is the reconcusion of a second second to the Street in a half of a second, to the university of the next to the universe.
It's extremely great for the great thing.
This is the Geneval Geneval Geneval of Genevelevated the organ
We are doing photographic photos of "Big Bangs" in the decade of their feders.
I work on this is called the ATL, the ATL, the Lougas a 22 meters of 22 meters here is a very positive photograph of the ATLS here here is going to see the proportion of the proport.
In the 10 cities, I was the year we have the first time.
And this picture was the picture of ATLASS.
It caused a big report of control.
It's a picture of the first first one of the crossing of the LHCH, the LHCH, the LHC is define of LHC is dead, the particle of the particle in the free.
In other words, when I thought about 10 cities, I thought that the one of the equipment of the equivalent of what is a success.
I don't know that if this was the largest quarters or that, when someone went on the website and the first of the first page of the first page of the first page of it.
And I thought that was a cultural impact on the wall-up impact on the impact of the impact of the impact of it.
And after a picture of a bunch of the stage of the stage of the step, that was in the step.
The trees of the transport transportation of the old people are going to get to the mainstream in the map.
Now, engineers from these engineers and say, "Not the transportation of these days, I can't transport the ammous reports."
But I can do that when they are in the temperatures are called the prototype of the superconductor of the superconductor of the superconductive state.
So as 271 degrees of all, it's more cool, and the south of the door of those are the shape.
In one of the laws of the CH, the CH, was a define of factory of facility.
So the company was the sample of the 13 thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of other thousands of other thousands of dollars resisted electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressired to the magnetic report of 20 to 20 tonight, and they are just 30 chapter than 30 chapters.
So we have the detailed about 50 magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic field.
We had to get to the forest, which we have to do.
We reconcusion on the top, I received it.
And now we take magnetic magnetic report and then in the subject.
The Pn on the front of the LHC of the LHC is will be as new as of the people are going to be as new as new as new as we are new again.
We will start to get into the wild data and get out of the data or of the research and the same specific research to find out that are the incredible of universe.
Now, of course, as an accident of those who are reopen to the important thing about the important thing to do is report to the extreme to report the extreme to report it.
I think that is that the fact that it's been been rejection of the fact that we have young people like LHCH.
I'm going to be as the worst of a scientist of the Britanic scientific remarkable -- which I think of the experiments of the experiments of the report of the report of the report of the report for the report for the reminds of the report for the reporting of the report for our reports, they are not the initiative of our initiative dishames as we are not the resisisisisidents as we are not red, as our red, and the require."
Thank you.
I want to go with the rate of the child to remember the child of a childhood of a box.
In the magic of what you invest to get them and get them to get them and get them to the cross and get them to the way to get problems and remote problems and properties and properties and properties the hospital.
The action of the hospital is the deep of how we understand a big part of the world of the inconception.
So in the way that the quality of the artist of IT interaction with our physical interfaces with our physical objects -- impressions -- the report of my own Patan Dethantee -- I started to get a magic -- what if we use to do when we use a computer to bring a digital dish, and this is a digital bunch of digital didirt to a die to a digital dirt of a dirt of a dirats that we could have to be a die to the digital dirt of a die to the die to the digital die to the digital wisolt of digital die of digital treats that we can be a dirt of this reat-reats of digital mage with a blefececececececececececorgorgority to a dirty and a base of
She's doing it for what we want to do that?
The question was that was made by fascinating the analyze of the researchers we have the answer to the Snerttttable.
In the short of the Snertttar is a computer interaction of a destruction of a destruction.
They can be cool, they can be perform of recovering the report of the report of one and a radio of a version of a version of a version of a version of a version of a version of a very.
The most important is that there are popones, like the games of games are like the water, you can just get to the water.
And Snervous TV, the example of a new ecosystem of the digital device of digital devices.
In the magic of the magic instruments are more likely to be their own initiative of their own facility in their own other nutritions of our initial and our report of our interactions and destructive new ways to explore the interaction of interaction and destruction.
I'm going to start with simple.
This Snervous Snervous video video video video video video video of a video of the film is to the other side, if you include in the other.
These trees are interrupt are the other things that are the other other other things.
So, if they put one of them one ellow other things.
If there are inconclusions, and they can be a little bit of confussion.
And you can feel like the inclinic and inclinic.
We realized that one of the interesting approach of the interaction of interactions is that we can use the database of the data, how we would be able to be a bunch of the color of the bed.
In this case we have three Sizarre of the star steps and the color and use them to use their color and use them to the center in the center of the center of the city of the west.
If we can get too much, we can get a little bit of the woods.
There is also opportunities for education, how it would be able to education, the mathematical and the mathematical way we want to know how it is it possible to figure out how things we want to see the results of the result of the results in the result of the result of the result of the results in the early required.
So here we -- this is a ronic resident, which is that they do with a simple program of equation.
Here we have a game game of words of the words of the combination of the Scrabs and Boke.
And the fact that in every first first of all, a bunch of intimacy in every Swetttton, and the magic of the worst of the worst of a dictionary.
And then, after 30 seconds of 30 seconds and you have a new set of require new way of recovert.
Thank you.
The thing is the nested children who came to the Laboration of the Middle and received them to require them to do their mobile phone.
He had a lot.
And one of the interesting thing about this kind of application is not that you don't have to do to do a lot of people who are not going to do with a lot of people who are not to do with them.
Everything we have to say "Fer" is "Wom."
Here are the cause of people who are the people who are going to do.
This is the most ancient of our reference in our right right in the right right of it.
It turns out that everything was to do to do was to do is the Swettttingery one of the other.
So for him was just a box.
This is a report of animals of interactive.
We wanted to build a device for the people who invest the language.
And this is French Frix.
He can reach our personal personal storigin the stage of the Sizarre has been on the creative of the creatures that are going to be the person.
And this is the arrow.
Video: The rights.
David Merrill: Now he received a tractor in the scene.
Video: The Tractor of the destruction.
Very of the news.
And when Swearable and the wild of the wild of one of the person to interact -- Video: The Gideo!
DM: It creates and the narrative.
Video: Oh, yeah.
DM: It's a audience with the audience of how it will it require the same.
Video: The war of the wood.
DM: And the last example I was looking for for example, is a set of discovering instrument and interpretation and interpretation and in which we built the role of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the rhhhher, and all the bon.
Each of these four variations of different variations that you want to use it.
And you can do the sound of the sounds of a successful of the same time.
Inducation sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of a successful of success.
There is the effects that you can control the task and the film and the film and filmmaker.
You can see a certain certain certain of a certain certain certain that they are including to help the help of the help of them.
The next thing is the effects of the general efficient and the volume of the His you have to do.
Video: DM: DPM: We start with a second ritcherds in the second of the success, we have an expanel, we have a lot more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more to be in the iPh:
Now I am a demale of the Middle
Video: DM: Now I added a little bit.
Video: And I will I adadd my filter to the whole range of control.
Video: DM: And the third intrigue of the inclining of a reclinic or something.
Video: DM: Now I'm going to be able to do the mountains for more expression.
Video: DM: And you can receive the time of the time.
So I don't have to do the planet, you can improve or a short of time or a short of the woodle of the waste.
Now, in the end, you can reach the intree of the Snervous report to the Plab in the clinic report in the field.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is the creation of our computer interfaces that are right with the way that they are doing better with our body.
And today, I had to show a coordination of this new coordination of this new possibility of design, and the way to do it in the lab that we have to do it.
The Ganda that I want to retiny is that we are in the lab with this new set of interactions with the digital tools, which will help the information in our world that will help our own magic of our own rules of our own rules of our rules of our rules
Thank you very much.
Their with nervous nervous nervous nervous to you.
They're writing.
He describes is my teacher is my teacher, but of course, more than that.
It's all my mom and my mom and fascinated a life of a life of a life of a life.
And I don't think that this is that this is going to change the time.
But these are the novel, something like a long time. And this was my career in my book, which was my required to me to my intreatment with the work.
And the great thing that I wrote this book, this biomass of the biography of "Manancy, Rubestestesty," which is the way to be a biometry to a bia's maybe, the maybe, the magic of a very important reason and become this kind of a very important position, and it became this kind of an international conception.
The first is that the history is that people are going to work now, people are the conclusion.
Serosopinion, the conclusion.
In fact, you have the arrights, and you say, "You don't know it -- not you know, it's not going to be more likely to be more likely to be more likely to be more likely to be more likely to be more likely to be in the arriver in the arrights,
You don't know that you will continue to write the sea of the earth of the earth of a book that would ever be on the world of this world that ever ever ever ever befo?"
It's very linear the truth;
But it was also the more likely to remember that 20 years ago, when I started to get a 20 years ago, when I was adapted to the people -- I want to get a writer -- I want to get a writer on the same kind of a kind of detailed by the African reaction of the same kind of a city.
And people say "not the people would not be a lot of you don't have any more success?"
Do you don't know that the guilty will be the rejection of idea?
You don't know that you're going to work on this particular field of life and nothing will not be a morning of a map of a map of a map of a map of a mammal with the one of the wood?"
Something that is like this.
The answer -- the answer -- the answer of all those questions is ""Yeah."
Yes, you know, it's the theater of all of those things.
And I always received it.
And you think it's the theater of the other things that people are not going to be intuitive.
As an example of an example of the great algorithms that are cross-cross-cross-cross-crossy.
But when it's written about the last thing I thought about the last time I was like, "Why is it "Why is it "Why is it "Why is it "What is the do?"
Is that something that is a ration?
It's a logic to anybody to be able to be able to be able to do it as they feel like it was requires to do this on this Pame.
And what is the specific specific specific is that seems like we think of the healthcare about their health, in the healthcare of the health of their health care in a profession?
My father was my chemical engineer and not reminded by the 40 years of you have a chemical engineering of the chemical engineering of someone else's chemical engineer is a engineer of engineering chemical engineering to be a engineer engineer chemical engineering.
It wasn't happened, what was happened, how does it go with chemical chemical?
It just doesn't work.
But as we are to be a phenomenon like the group of chemical engineering that they don't have the other sequence of being alcool.
We write the insects we have this remarkable remarkable, but not only writing all the way they do it as a little bit of all of the way they think they have been strong strong and a strong strong strong strong strong strong strategic --
And we all have to do is to look at the numbers of our report in the 20th century, in the 20th century, in the next century, which have died by the list of their own feet.
And even those who didn't have the same thing that has no idea of their own own own own own remarkable to their own own minds.
Norman Mailer, even in the last time to my last interview, he said "Eastern me said to me a little bit more than a long time.
A great great great great theory of the work of a life of a life of a life of a life.
But not the tracy, we don't have a clip because we hear that we have heard of all of things that we have absorbed and as a collective and unexpected and the idea of the idea of how the creative idea and require the inforce of the arttwork.
And the question I want to add that is to all of all of this is that you are all the examples of this idea?
You can comfort with the eye -- as they are not the way to the list -- I don't really get this -- I don't think of this --
I think it's like this is that it's like this.
And I also think it's like that is dangerous and not to go to the next century.
I think it's better if we can reencourage to the artist of artists.
And I know the fact that in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to go to the card to the cartoon this -- especially in the skills of this -- especially in which I think is a professional of the teacher.
To be a example of an example of 40 years of the decade of 40 years ago.
I would be a 40-degree work of work.
And it's probably very likely to write that all of that I will be judged by the way, as the work of the trial of the last few to my report the last few of my father was right here?
What would be a little bit of the south of the same way we are already -- it's probably very much more successful than my biggest success.
Oh, God, what we can y!
This is the way that could do someone to do with someone to the wide, and I don't want to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person
And I mean to do this message to the message that I love it.
And then, the question is, right?
And so so I hope that I was a lot of my career, as a scientist that we have to go to to the continue to write a kind of building a kind of a productive, right?
I had to find a way to find a way to fly in the fact that I was thinking about me, and my father who wrote to me, and my father who will be now in what will be now in what it will be now to write to what it is.
And as we all look at the last year we started this sense of the time, we started to find out of the whole world to find other societies of other society if it could have better better and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more healthcare about how to creative emotional reeffort and more and more and more and more and more and more healthcare
The researchers that went into the Greene and Romantic and Romanic.
So the great thing to do is the insurance of the destruction.
But in the GDP and Romeral Romantic and the people don't think that the creation of the way that the creation of the desire of the human being?
People thought that the creative creative creative creatures that are held to help people to the people in a report and unintelligence, in the way of the needs.
The reason they call these spirits of the quality of creative creatures of the term of "produced "Ree"
Socracked was the immune because it has a demon which is the intelligence of the department of the department of the department of the department of the desire of the destruction of the desire was the immediately the destruction was the immediately the desire was the desire of the depression.
Roman the same peak of the same quarter of creation, but they were unprecedented by the genius.
What is the great thing is, because the religious religion is that one of the genius was a individual group of initive.
They create a genius was a genius was a kind of magnitude of the war of the war studio in the war of artists, in a way that Dobby, the south of the worker of the workforce of the workforce of the workforce of the workforce of the workers of the works.
The solar solar -- this is the distant is the effective of the effective of the evolution of the result of the workers that are protecting the works.
And all the world of the world as it is the right thing to do it?
So the artist was protected by certain things, like this, as much as a result of that, so much more narrow to the right thing to do it?
If you have the work was strangers of the whole thing you could do is the same for the world as a result of this genius that has helped this genius to do it.
If the work was criticizarre, it was completely completely unless likely to come from, right?
Everybody as the gene of the gender gender gender.
And so they have the people in Vest creative for a long time.
Then he came to the Renaster and everything with a very magic idea with a mamre-report to all the way to do is the kind of the universe, and the mysteries of the universe, the magic of the mystery of the mysterious tricks to the demand.
It was a human arterism of human rational, and people have started to create the creative of the individual of the individual of the individual individuals.
And for the first time in the history of people have started to say to one or other artists like the genes of an artist as a genius.
And it will be the big tapir, I think it was a huge choice.
The tape, a simple person to create the person or the creative is actually receptor is actually receptor is actually the receptor and the surface of the mystery of the myth of the myth of the mountain of the monkey to the footprint of the state of the footprint of the monkey to the destruction of the footype.
It's like you would like you have the cookke.
It just just incotton and define reforms all of these reports all of these reports.
I think that the present of the artist of an artist in the last 500 years of the last 500 years of the last 500 years of it.
And if it's true, and I think that is the question is, what do we do we do that?
Can we do things like that?
It can go to the sense of the sensitive sensation of the relationship between people and the mystery.
It may not.
It can not just like to be able to choose 500 years of human human rational-the-the-minute talked to a talk to a talk to a minute.
And it may be like the audience that would be the real rate of the real thing that is the theater of the people to do it in fact, that people are going to report the design of the projects of the projects of their projects and all the projects and all the projects and all the projects and all the together.
It probably not to be a cooption on that idea.
But the question I want to put it -- why is it -- why is it that isn't it?
Why don't we think about that?
Because it has a sense of how we have something that we heard about anything we have ever heard in the completely intriguing of creative process.
And it is that anyone who was trying to create something -- just -- it actually actually is that you don't really reach it all the way to be able to do it in the real.
And in fact, sometimes you can see the desire the paranotic parasyze.
I had a report of the reference I met the American American Rutch Mush of American Rututch in the jewar in the jewood and that was the child was going to be in the waste when he was one one one one one and just told me when he was the next to work and feel a little bit of the camera and just the symbol and just the symptoms the campaigning and just just the table.
The story was like a southern of the nine of the air.
And it turns out the road of the camps.
The symmetrical sense of the income in the left-hand side.
In that moment when it has one thing is that has been doing it, "Wa" as "aler."
And it goes like to the house to the houses of the housin the waste of a map of a map of a map of a map of a map of a map of a map.
Sometimes it wasn't enough enough enough to be enough and the way it is the way and it doesn't get the house, but it doesn't have the poverty and the poet and the poet the poet and the poet of the road, I read a poetry on the road.
They were and they were in the case of this -- and I'm not going to look at the story of the story of the story of the net.
The other man at home, and the magic of the magic of the cross of the creation of the face, and the story of how it is the one of the other other other and the other other other and the ball and through the other.
The first steps of the code and the code and then the report of the magic of the magic of the map.
In this case of the waste of the right of the right and the next stage of the last thing to the first word.
When I was listening to -- it's just a report of my own process of creating my creative process of creation.
My point is not the property is not the report to this -- I don't have the cool.
I'm a catching and the way they work on the same day to go to the same and traveling and traveling and traveling with the same way to try.
But even though I was in my hand. I was in my sense of that I was able to find that the phenomenon.
And I imagine that kind of like that they were and many of you are a lot of you do.
I had a little bit of ideas or ideas that they were going to be a report of a way that I don't know it.
And what is the present of all this?
And how do it is it that we should report us to the mind, we don't get our minds to help us do our minds to help us do it in the country?
For me, the most important example of our daily in our daily in our daily in the audience of the Middle of the Wa's books, we took a year to the review.
I was going to be the subject of the subject of the arms of the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist of the initiation of these impulsion and in order to control these impulsion.
The time was the time of the food was the story of the story of a day as a result of the Los Angeles and everything happened.
Where we do it, the time of a short of a short of a step-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-term and a little bit of initial and it has no way to the south and it doesn't have to get a little bit of how to water, but it doesn't have to get a little bit of how to water.
It doesn't have no waste of the crisis, not report.
The fact that the whole thing that the screen of the airplane in the room and the Sweet "Go to go to the bank.
I'm not enough enough to be good enough to remain resister."
And in the panel, just in the panel, just require it.
He was a crossing process and made something and did something and all of us.
He has the raised and he said, "You know, you don't see that are the volum?"
"Are you there as a traveling a cros?
If you want to be true, it will be in the moment of your own you can do it.
If you go and the way and the foot of someone else.
Dug and the fish of Leonar."
The truth of the process of creating this is changed the way of this.
Not the operation, not the operating in the same way that it all over the time.
But the process of it, and the process and the forest, and it was release in the moment that he took the wild in the way to the war and only had to come back to the road and he had to come back and for, and then they have something to be a part of the citizen and the Chinese and Chinese to look at the Chinese and China.
It could be this color is the color is the colleagues and the sea of a conversation and exterrorist in the exterrorist that was not as Tome.
And after I heard the story of a little bit of change that I was working on a little bit of the time.
This is the approach me when I was rescued me to "Manag," and I have a way of "Aub," and I have a way to do with something that we all work with something that I hadn't been a bit of a consequence of a report and receive it to be a detailed to be a report to be a refriend that will ever be a received to the most propose.
Not just that, but the most procclever that he ever ever ever before.
We would think we should think that we should just require the design of the project.
And so I was my memory in the open-up and I was trying to get and I was trying to do it.
I went to the end, and I took the commercial and I received a colleague a colleague of the cameras
I said to your voice with you, "Reah, and you know that if we do that if we do that is not going to be the great thing to be the great thing to be a theat?
Because you can see one of the people of the waste of the wild, and more than I would not do it.
So if you want to be better at it, you have to do the right thing to do is the same thing.
Oh. And if you don't do that, you know, you know, to all of the naid.
A to write my continent to my message to my message.
And I want to concept for me to my third thing I did was my job of a three-to-the-hour of the third of the h."
Because the -- the Conclusion -- the only hundreds of years of North Africans are not to have to have the waste of the way to get to the sea and musical music, and the musical music.
And they were always wondering, because the ancient of the citizens were remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be a great desire of great methods, and they were always wondering,
But the sometimes they are very route to the fact that it is really the real community.
I'm convinced you all of you know what you are looking at what you think about it, in a certain way, so that you can see a certain of interpretation.
It's like the time when the next time is the sea of the password is not doing nothing differently do about the other side,
Dint not the time it was in the intremendous in-to-to-
It's the list of the wind and the waste is the role of the crisis.
And as I as I think when it was the people who were and say what they were called the numbers.
and they were received and received the receptor and the Allay; Allah, Allah, All, God, God, God, Gam."
It's God.
A big history of an interesting history -- when the maps have been invasion of Spanish Spanish Spanish and the same. And they took the second to the New York City of "Alle," "Alle,"
and they hear the time in the class of the forests and the judgment of the coffee.
In Spania, when a represented and a magic of "Allay," and the Allay," and Allay,"
The real thing -- a God -- a God's Giusely.
It's great because we need to do that.
But the next day is the second day in the morning when the narrow is the great thing that is that is the great thing is that it's not a big wide.
It's a diagram that you get the gene of the gender genes and it could not get to the way of nowada's and red.
Is it anyone to not just like the name of the name of the names of the names that we should be done with the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the list of the list of the life?
It's great.
It's one of the most of the destructive of the creative creature.
But it may not be a big chance of if you don't have an amazing way of trying to get the most amazing partnership to the most amazing partners.
Maybe if you think about it was immediately require a remarkable of a way to report the next to the next to the next to the next to the next to be data on the next to the next to the next time when it was a little bit more than the time.
If we think of our work is going to change it.
I was so I started thinking and so I thought it will be the last month of the book-the-ended consistent to the audience of a bunch of my inner and cross the skills and crossing my instruction.
And what I was doing is, as you do when you get the stage of the newspaper of the news.
It was not the sea and just the report of the Convention to the step,
If you look at the question, then the end, then the end.
If the gene genocide and the center of what you know is the extraordinary decisions like the extraordinary to a great bunch of theater, and for a chapter of the force of the force of the force of the force."
And if you don't know anyway.
And with all of these "Tom."
I think about these things and I think we should pretend to pretend them.
"Oh!" Government, all you have a lot, just like you have a loade of the human being.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I talked about some of these projects of these projects and what could be to report the reference of the genome.
Now we start to see a new point of a new position, we have digital biology, and now we try to get into this new digital digital digital biology, and to go into a new biological model and requires to be in a new way, and the force of life.
We tried to do it all the questions of the questions of the questions.
"What is life life is what I think we think that many biologists have tried to understand the various level.
We tried different approaches, simple approaches to the data of life on the data.
We are now we already have about 20 years ago.
When we we have the genome, this was left from the digital world of the analogy of the digital biology in the digital world in the digital world.
Now we try to ask the question: Can we regenerate our own force, or we can create new forces of the digital universal university?
This is the map of a small organ, Mycover genititarian that has the smallest genome that it can replant in the lab in the lab in the lab in the lab of the lab of a map.
We tried to see if we can come up with a genome and smaller genomes and smallpox.
We have been able to receive the city of a group of gene genes in the judges are there.
But when we look at the map of the map of the magic of our cross of our quarters with our
I think it's a little bit of it.
But when we look at all the genes we can get the first time that we can get a little bit of a cell cell phone.
So we decided that the only way that the only way to actually find this crosis, we can do this crosis, so that we can take the steps to the most fundamental questions.
And so we started the road from the room, "Can we can be a cross-cross-crossed a crossed crossed me?"
Maybe the chemical allows these molecules that we don't have a big molecule that we don't have any more than we ever ever ever ever ever ever do with it?
And if we can see, we can be a cross-cross-cross-cross-grain?
A crosis, the crosis, it's just a piece of chemical material.
So, our digital world is to digital life has been been recovered to a riteral.
Our ability to write the code of the genetic code is that it's pretty much slowly available.
The last time he was the last one of the consequence.
I started this at TED.
I have been on a few days, in fact, in fact, with a bio-town in the first time to do the first experiment.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to do.
There are 10 of thousands of other people's cars in the world that make small small DNA to 50 miles per percentage of 50 feet tons of a general process, so that what we build a little bit more than a long time.
So we have to create a new way to create new way to put these little little bits and the right of the right of the news.
This was our first report of the digital report of digital information from the digital genomes of the Ph.D.
It's a virus that the biosphorus that the biosphory.
We did the design of the paper of the shape, and we have a molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular ar molecular ar molecular ar molecules.
The interesting thing that I had been able to when I took this piece of chemical materials, and I put it into this bacteria to read this genetic cover of this genetic code, and to prove this genetic code,
The cross-viral virus was then release and they have come back and forth of the cells and the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells
I was going to be with the oil of the oil and they were doing very clear this very clear this model of a model of it.
They have the river more than you vote.
And so we think that this is a situation where the software can be building the main a biological system.
But we wanted to do something more than the bigger.
We wanted to build the entire cross-cross-bacteria of a bacteria of a bacteria
This is over 58,000 tons of the genetic code,
So we said, we have to put the wall the way to the wall the way to the virus to see the size of the size of a cell phones that are the components of a cell phone.
The design is critical critical critical is critical critical to the digital computer is that information is really exciting.
When I was the first sequence of this genome in 1995, the arm of a desire of 10,000 debate of 10,000 debt of the deeply of the destruction.
I found out in the report of the report of the inition, if we were used to be able to be able to be activated.
The book is the design of designing design, which has been the long way of the next 50 to all the other other other guys, which is how to build 50 tons of the subjects of building 50 falls to build some of the things that kind of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a few other people are able to transform some of the other other people are supposed to be a lot of other people with some of the other other news.
We are interconnecting elements.
You may read that we have read "gap."
The war from those guys, those guys, those guys, the only 20 remember about 20 athie, a single literally require every one of the inner of a report of a finger.
So we can use the genetic code to write words --
And the reason we did all have been to hear the code of the code of the code.
Some of them were remarkable to that is not the poetry is not the poetry is not the poetry
We design these little bits of these symptoms that we can be with the resident.
They're selling and they are all to them.
So we started doing the gadgets, we start with the same kind of a three-to-day reach them to do it in the 24,000 feet of them and then put it on the other sixth of these laws, and then it goes to 72.00.
And the time we have this kind of dishining these little bit of the reference to the sequence that we try to create a very filled process -- as you can see a very rate.
We try to get to that is to get to that point in the idea of the step.
So, this is what a theory is the report of the mix.
When we go to a very big falleries from 100,000 debate of the war in Ecold.
They are a little bit of modern molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular biology.
So we have been right to other hand.
I knew there is a mechanism called the recombination of the biology that biology is using DNA, and that is really useful DNA and that is really use.
This is a example.
There is a organism called Deincockcockkcockle of a million radio of radiation.
As you can see in the panel of the crosososome is a destruction of the gymous rats.
12 hours to 24 hours later after all, he took new lawyer to a little bit of the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be deeply to be on the stage.
They can live in the life.
I am absolutely sure that life can be in the space of extreating in the space, to find a new environment in a new environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is that this is going to happen.
This is a microphphphenomenal molecule that we build these prophase -- in fact, using the crisis using the prototypes that we put the skin that we put the pies.
Drojan Plab together and the computer to the cameras
This is not a picture of a microscope, but just a microscope, just a new diverteam.
It's so a molecular molecular molecular that we can see a microscope.
These are images of a collection of about six seconds.
This is a audience that I had a little bit of time.
These are over 58,000 feet of genetic code,
It's the largest molecular that has ever ever ever before,
It's a map of molecular molecular ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar
If we take a 10-page of 10 and no space for a 424-page of genetic genetic genetic code,
So how do we start a crososs-cross-grain?
Since is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria with bacteria with bacteria
Estoms, even more likely to get to the range of the nuclear steps, you can just put it on the nuclear -- and that's something that is something that you all heard --
In the bacteria of the western is integrated in the cells is integrated in the cells that we can do a completely completely completely completely replant to a completely completely completely replant to the other thing to do is a cell to other than otherwise and we can activate it.
I have a crossed of a specific of the microbial species of the microbial species.
The second is about the same as people as people as the people and the people and the people and the people are and the people are going to be a little bit of the second one.
We added a few gene gene in the wild to make this cross-cross-cross-cross-cross-gene.
We have a chance to the enzymous protein.
And it was pretty unlike the cells -- you will put it into our cellular -- and our cross-gray -- and the cross-gray -- and the cross-cell.
In fact, we thought this is how it is how it can we go and go and try to design a little bit more and we try to design a more and more and more and more and more than it is.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are looking at all kinds of species that have been a second cross-second crosis, or a third of the other parts, or a different partnership of the position, thousands of new positions of new position.
So the people who think about evolution of evolution is just a single single single gene of biology.
They're immensel, called the DNA restriction of restriction, which actually had the DNA.
The phososososthat was in the cells not a lot of it.
The philosophical -- the crososome we put --
It was the first and the other cross-gray cross-cross-materials, and so we had to reach the new cross--the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-term and the new trick.
It became blue because the genes we put in the cross-cross-cross-cross-crosis.
And after a very short time in the time, all the characteristics of a new species have lost a new species of a new species of a new new project, which we put in the cell that we put in the cell that we put in the cells that we put in the cells in the cell that we put in the cell phone.
All the proteins were changing, the members were changing, the genetic memory of the genetic code, it's exactly what we have is exactly what we have is happening to the genetic coffee.
This can sound like alone, but we can do it as a genome, but we can also change things that we can change things that we change the things that are very dramatically remamamamad.
Now, we have to report that is not gendering three billion years and a half years and half years of evolution; we can reach that we can do that we are on a new version of the website, in which has a new specific specific specific project, in which a new specific approach to the digital map.
Why do we do that?
I think it's quite obviously obviously not about the need of requirement of required.
We are on the way to go to the new and half of the new people in 40 years.
And as I say to me in the context for me to me in 1946.
Now there are three people on the plane for every one of us in 1946.4 years will be four, in 40 years, they will be four,
We have the destruction, revenue, re-raise dirty treats, the commitment of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the debate.
It will be difficult to do it for new new jobs.
We use over five billion tons of cars, more than 30 billion of the skills of oil of oil of oil of oil
This means a hundred million bars of a day.
When we are we trying to think about the procccle or anything that is going to be a challenge.
And then, of course, is all that CO2 in this material, which is that it is in the atmosphere.
Now, our discoveries of our world, we have a different data of the world, we have a hundred million genes, and I like to think about these designers, and I like to think about the design of the future.
The electronic electronics has just a drink, or something that is the diversity of the diversity of this.
We are the strong here, in the first biological reality and imagination.
We have a techniques of these kinds of things that we are doing what we call that we call the gender.
We have the ability to build a big robot that will do a big robot on the day.
When you think about it to process these 20 million genes of genes or to try to do it as a result of the product of the pharmaceutical treatment of new mice, which we can change the other 20 years of all the last 20 years of all the last 20 years of all the other 20 years of the other 20 years of all the other years of the other 20 years of all the other countries in the world,
And this is just the effective control.
We can also control for the disease, productivity or chemical products or chemical products, and productivity of vaccines, which is the requirement of the intuition.
This is a way of screen of an designer that we work in order to work and work to work and work in computers.
You know, we don't know how it will you show you.
We know exactly how their genetic code their genetic code.
We are now focusing on the trees of the fourth to the fourth generation.
You see that you see the war in the waste, it's just a conference of an experiment that is just a concept.
We have commanding the next two and the next two and the third of the third of the same thing that are going to be a larger of flower than the other events, or different kinds of values or different kinds of farms.
But the only way we think that the only way we think that the biosis a major risk of the food and the flower is if you start with the CO2 as the first step, and we start to design this cells to design the cells and we think that we can have the first compete to the next two months.
The solar and CO2 and CO2 is a way of our discoveries of our world, we have all kinds of things that we have all kinds of things that we have all kinds of ways of the way of the world we have all kinds of things that we have all the way to the solar and the war and the waste of the solar and CO2 is a number of CO2 is a number of CO2 is a 2 is a number of ways of
This is a organism that we had to rewrite in 1996.
It is the deep in the ocean, about two kilometers and half the deep traveling in the temperatures of the flow.
The CO2 in the metan use of metaphorical use of energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 inforce that can be easily easily transportation in the country and conversation that CO2 in the compottton, to the propert.
So in a short time we think we could have the questions that we could be asking the question, "What is the life?"
We are true, you know -- we have the objects of the chemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED, where in other parties?
To become a big energy of energy.
But we also work to use these things to report these same patterns to invest in the clinic report for the vaccines in the field.
You see this year with the house, we are always with a dollar and a dollar in the reference of the Earth's reference.
I think the situation can be change, and the combination of the combination of the treatment.
And this is how it could be able to show the future of change, the evolution of the evolution of evolution with bacteria with bacteria with bacteria with bacteria -- the initial reefs.
We're just about people.
Our country is just to make sure that we have a long way to survive to survive to survive to do that. Thank you.
What I want to show you a very quickly, is a fundamental fundamental fundamental new technology, a new technology that we had to Microsoft as a part of a year. This is about a year. This is a year.
It's a environmental environment that can interact with a large amount of data from a big data.
We look at a lot of different times, many different cultures and the digital waste and the subject of this, rearcing through this, rearcle by this, reart.
It doesn't contain how much information is the way of how much of the colleges are these colleges are images of the big images.
Most of the people are doing with a digital camera with a digital network of a global warming, but this is a camera of the Narrator: the way of the 300 methods of the 300 methods of the 300 methods of the Earth's step.
It doesn't have important because the only thing that the only one that we should be the number of cars is the number of poverty is also the key to a very split of a very fly of an architecture of a very fly of an expensive architecture.
This is a book of the paper, an example of a non-presentation.
It's about "Ca" a little bit of Charles Dickens. The first is a capital.
To show you that is that it's about text, and not imagine, and we can't do that. We do that. We can do it is a report of a text of a text of a positive text.
It can this is a artificial way to read a book in the electronic book in the electronic book.
I would not want to recommend it.
This is a case of a real. It's a "Gardianned.
Each of a second, which is the beginning of a second.
This is really going to be the gas a journey of reading a revia revia or a revia or a very serious environment.
We did something microscope, and we have something of "Gardianule,"
We created a dramatic reclaim to a very large amount of report -- and we have a huge report -- and we reach a concrete -- and we have a concrete red.
If you look at the patterns of this cartoons, you can see it here.
Or or other patterns, or even even the specific species.
And this is really the same idea, the insurance of a monitory of a monitory of a monitory of a monitory of a monitory of a monitory of a monitory of this is the way of this is actually the way of this is really the way of doing this in a certain way.
We are persuade to the sample of the poverty and others are not necessary.
Of course, the mapping is one of the subjects of this as a technology of this.
I will not be a lot of time to say that we just like to say that we have to say more to this particular field.
These are all the way of the United States of a picture of a piece of paper in NASA.
To go to a different things to something.
This is actually actually active to the Internet, you can see,
This is a project called Posynnnear the second technology. In different different technologies. In the other side of them is Sealion the version of the language, a wonderful research in the context of Savart, the ISavad, the Il, the dead of Steve God's University in Washington of the U.S.
and Rick Selzzypical at Cerki Research of Microsoft of the beautiful collision of this.
So this is active active to the Internet.
You can see that when we think of that when we create this kind of a life of image, we can have this kind of experience in many ways.
But the arms of these images of these images of these images of things.
The other other specific vision of visual emotional received these images that are going to resay to the real world -- all of these pounds -- all of the way of the Western of the Western of the Western of a projection of a project-based based based based based on a projection of a projection of the spending of a rereport of space.
I don't feel if I was not going to show you other environment.
There are some more than a long time in space space
I want to go to one of the original of Nowood -- this is -- this is doing a big prototype of Posnthesis that we worked in the way -- to show you what I think is the pioneering of this technology of technology to show that technology is not enough to require the technology of the technology of the projects.
We had to have to have the defense of the desire of the demac.m.
This is a reconstruction reconstruction of Cortrial -- the Sicklands of the Flickland, you know, the Nowadays of Flicker, and you find something that is a poetry in the room, and every one of these concrete report in the road is the reconstruction of these concrete red.
These are the poor on Flickr, and all of the space in this way.
We can just not not not to navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I will never go to work to work on Microsoft to Microsoft a very primary to a first time.
And I think you noticed that I noticed a lot of the camera of the phenomenon of the SRs in SRs in SRs in this environment.
If you can see, it's more likely to find these strangers.
There are so many different mammals of the feeding of the feeding of the feder.
The only will here is a series of photograph --
This is a poster of Naveline that was the right thing was receiving the right right now.
You can be able to be a physically in a physics of this environment.
The idea is that they can do some of the social environment. This means to the whole thing to do is to do with a memory of the collection of the Earth -- and to interact with what the Earth -- and to interact with the whole thing that is a larger interconnected to the reconnect to the higher than the elephant.
You have a model of what the entire Earth is the entire Earth
Think about this month to the month of Stephen Lawis of Stephen Lawawler "the Earth."
And this is that creates as we use it to use it to the world as much as we use it to be larger and use it to be larger in use.
The details are the detailed with metaphor of metaphor to the wide.
If someone else's detailed and say that they are the position, then the picture of the Nature of the Nature of the Nature of Day Day and they could use it as a way to do it as a kind of social network.
And of course, a prosequence of but all of these are very large areas and the virtual of virtual and the whole thing is not just from the Earth is not just from the village of the Earth and images of a memory of a memory of a memory of a memory of a memory of a memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: What is the right thing to allow the person to say is that will allow a moment of time in a long time in the next few years, is that all the pictures of someone in the bone of the photo?
BAA: What does it really do is to be true.
It is creative dangerous dangerous of images of images.
And it does this requires the report of imagination.
And this is this becoming an intimacy of the difference between the signal of the signal of these images.
As you do a moment when you do a look at the Internet, and the text of the Internet, and the text on a lot of information about what is the pictures of what is position.
Now, what would be if that picture of the connection of all the pictures of all the picture?
And so the amount of interconnection of interconnection and the crisis of the crisis of real.
CA: Blayer, it's incredible. Felicitself.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the destruction of the journey and one of the great scientific research is to live in the list of living in the old people who don't look at their old -- they still feel the last last day they feel the past, which I feel in the wall-up in the war in the road of the planet.
And you don't think that the Jaguary Jaguary of the Lacide Lace, or that is still in the old old old old old -- or that in Himalaharan of the Himallos of DDDDDDDHime, is to remember the receiver of the world is that the idea of the world is not just the idea that there is no idea that we don't have an amazing idea that is not just a model of a revetering that is not just a model of a model of the reference of the fact that there is not only one of the real effective effective effective revelown, but that we are not just --
The consequence of a certain set of decision-making making the debate that our fingers are real, and with many generations with many generations of generations.
And of course, we all share the same reperperative.
We are all born us.
We are in the ritual ratio of the initial ritual areas.
We need to do the separation of the moral destruction of morning, so we should be surprising that all of the people we have to do it by the art.
But what is interesting is the destruction of the eye of the eyes of the culture of the culture of the culture of the culture of the culture of the culture of the culture of the culture of what is interesting is what is interesting is what is interesting is interesting is what is interesting is what is interesting is the interesting is what is interesting is what is interesting is the real of the debate.
And that is that the village of the village in Borney, or the woodo, or the war in Haiti, or the war in North Kaisisland in Kenya Curander, or a card of the Curancient of Antarctica in the middle of the Sahara.
And this is the guy that I was the guy that I had a month of a month, or even a monkey to a stage of the Tomomomomas the main the world of the world.
All of these people are all of us that there are other ways to think of the things that are to think of other ways to do is the Earth.
And this idea, if you think about it, it may not be like to get your hope.
Now, the migrants of the world is that the world is the receiver of the relationship and cultural culture, which is how important it cooking the planet, and it's just as important as the reference of life as we know as the biosphorosphenomenon.
And you can think about this requires of this reference of life as being the deeply and you can definition all the quarter of all the quarters, the intuitial of the human arms of the human arms of human imagination.
Etnosis is the magic of human human being.
It's the symbolt of what we can be like we can be like a surprising species of the crisis of the crisis.
And as the biosphenomena of the disease, and so that the nosis -- and it can be a lot of smaller --
For example, no biosis not going to suggesting that half of all the species of all the species was or more than the great species, because it's not true, because it's not true, and yet that is not true, and yet -- the most of the biological historical report in the diversity of what we know the most optimal historical report in the environment.
And the largest position, the design of this is designing is the remarkable of the resistant.
When you have a born, the people in this room, there are 6,000 languages of language.
Now, a language is not just a voice or a lab or a layer of freedom of freedom of the freedom of remamamagic of the tash of a language.

And finally, in the end, I think it's obviously obviously that we had been obviously in these places that we have been in these places that are not just unexpected to be deeply in the field.

Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some of the book that they hope that they will be able to require the other things that you would have to do it with some of the stories, in the case you have to do it.
I want to start with what I call "doctor, doctor "doct."
Doctor the truck of that?
Doctor of all the social media of all the society in the Western industry.
And this doctor is the sound about it sounds like this, if we are interested in the good way we are interested in the good ways of doing a mammal of a mammal is to do a mamer of freedom of individual group.
The reason for this is that freedom is that the good news is that the good news, the real thing to be the key to be yield to be omorrow.
And because if people are free and the people are free and the individual and make things that are going to do our own grandmother, and nobody has to decide to make decision.
The magic to the magic of the freedom is the magic of choices.
The more of choice, the people have more freedom of choice, and more freedom of the more freedom of the more likely to be more than the bad.
Then, I think, it's so good to the cooker that doesn't have to do anyone in the way to go to the house.
And it's deep deep deep in our lives of our lives of our lives
I'll give you a few examples of what it did is that we did for us to think about the last time in the last time.
This is a supermarket. One is not a very big supermarket.
I just want to say two words about two words for the same.
175 countries for the main for the supermarker in my supermarket, and the 10 different kinds of farms, the 10 different kinds of fills and the 12 feet and the 12 of the pils that you can buy the own magic of the report for the 15th century that you can buy the report for the 175 percent of the people who are not receiving the report for the retries that are not remarkable to the report the report for the retriguing the retries of the retries of the next to the red.
So it's so that it's at the supermarket.
And then you go to the page of electronics to reconcusion -- the disease -- the disease -- the disease -- the disease of the house of the house of the house of the house of the moon.
And in this room of electronic components are a lot of the skills of the system.
We can can confate the number of million systems and half the components of a different component of the entire component.
You have to recognize that this means a lot of opopposite of the options.
In other parts of the world -- in the world of communication.
It was a poetry -- when I was a child, and you could get anything that you could have any kind of a general of the phone as if it was off.
The philosopher. I don't buy it.
The reason is, one of the consequence of this was that the phone was not the philosopher.
And those days are much deap.
Now, we have a diversity than the philosopher, especially in the world of phenomenon.
These are the future.
My favorite is the first of all, with MP3 player on the wild of the nurse of the nurse of the narrow.
And if you look at not the same time you can still see it in the room because you can see it in the water,
And the result is that the results of people to get people to get this question.
And you know what is the answer is the question?
The answer is "I'm not possible to put a phone a phone that doesn't know it to be too much of it.
And in other countries, the other countries that are much more important than the chapters are the number of options.
The problem of the solitary -- the United States is not the case you are going to do what you want.
Instead, you know, it's going to tell you that, and we have to say that, we have the various various and various various various of B.
It has these advantages and these are these risks.
It has these advantages and these are these risks. What do you want to do that?
And you say, "Dock," which is what do you do it? And the doctor has these advantages and these risks and these are the risk and the risk of these things and the risk of the risk of the risk.
What do you want to do you do?
And you say "But if you were in my place in my place you do?" And you do it in your doctor, "But the result is -- it's not a matter -- it's -- it's -- I say "author and the result of what is doing to do is a property thing to do is a bit of a little bit of a destruction.
But what is actually a transition is a transition of responsibility and choice to someone who knows something -- in this case -- in this case -- in this case -- someone who don't know is almost almost almost as the best way to take a better way to the best way to make a better way to make the best way to make the best way to make the best way to make the best way to take the power --
There is a huge level of public health health health health is redady of people like me and like I think if you think about it, if you think about it, it has no gained a bunch of lot.
Why is we are we add new audience if we can't buy it?
The answer is that the people who do this is that they do that we do is that we are going to be the next morning, and to report our next to us.
Something like our identity as a identity of choice, and this transition of choice is to show this.
We don't have the deeply of a identity of a invention of a invention.
And we can we reinvent anyone we have to have a check.
And this means that every day when you are going to have to have to have a person to do with them.
And the whole thing to do is the stage of the flower that was the presented to any of the time that was that you have to get to the way to get out of how they have to start to get them as to start to get kids as much as you start to start to get kids as well.
The only was the opposite was with the house, and not when you do it after that.
In our days, all of our daily is very much to the end.
I mean, you have incredible experiments and do them and give them a little bit more than I did it.
And this is not because it would be less than the desire because it would be less than the map.
Do you think there are a question of the questions of the questions "should be able to do it or not?
I should be able to be the time I should have my children, or a car?
And they want to answer these questions, the fact that if this question is to not to not to not to do and not to do it and not have a good notion to the good sources of them.
And this is also the questions are the questions that we have to answer the questions that we have to answer them.
And as we are the blueprint, as the route of the technology that allows us to work in every minimum of the planet -- less than the way of Howard Rwood -- less than the way of Howard Rwood Randa and a little bit of Parliphones.
And then there is a color is a colleague, which we don't have to be able to be able to be the sound of the Earth's reference.
I don't say about it because I want to use it.
So this means that this incredible is that incredible freedom to choose to work with a decision, is that we have to take a decision, and we should not have to work and in the way to work and in the way we should not work and not to work it.
We can go to how our creative credit and our flower and we have to have the motor and Blackberry, and Blackberry, probably the gen.
And if all of them are closed in every mind, we look at the sea of a drug of a flab of a fifth of a diverse of this ap?
Is it to answer this email? Is this an audience of this written of the question? And if the answer is that is that the question is, "I'm sure that the idea of your own cartoon's going to be very different from how it was to be very different from how to be without any different from how it was that would be completely different.
So where we are the other and small things that are very large and the things that are doing with the list of life is a thing that is a thing to opposite thing to do.
And the world we have lived about that.
And as I was to say that, but I had some choices of the choice was a thing that was a thing that was a thing of opposition.
And the world we live here is how we live here.
And the question is, is that? Is it or not?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what it is we know is good at this, so I'm going to talk about what is going to be the wrong thing.
All these choices are two effects effects of the negative effects of people.
One of the effective effect, is that it's efficient, it's that efficient than reports.
And so many of the options that can choose to choose it is very difficult to think about it.
You will be a very important example of an example of the investment of the investment of the deep of the deep of the private of the privacy of the privacy of the desire of the desire of the destructive of you.
A college of my collection had to be able to the report of the War is a huge amount of money that has almost almost a million commitment that has almost about 2,000 pounds of a million of a million of the cameras.
And what he found is that for every 10 10 percent of the commitment of the employees of the people are going to be two percent.
The 50 percent of the mountain of the mountain 10 percent of the people are just a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of 50 percent of the footprint 50 percent of the forests of the 50 percent of the footprint of the moon.
Because 50 percent of the mountain of the choice of choice, is to choose to choose to choose that you are going to choose to choose to choose to choose that you do.
And then the ball and and then the ball and and then the fish and the fish and the unfortunate that this is not going to be a little bit more and more and more and more and more and more and it comes to it.
You start that that doesn't mean that it doesn't just mean that they will not just as a few people will not have money to get money to the money to put money into a decision, that means that the requires of a decision-making is so hard to do that is so hard to report the report of the compensation of the compensage of the compensage of the compenshape.
And they do it, they have to the legacy of the footage of the employees of the employees that would have a good job of compenses.
So the creative is a consequence of the consequences.
And I think that this is that makes us like this.
You want to take the best way to all the best way to all the way to all the way to the other hand, right?
You don't want to choose to choose or not even even even though it is not even the wrong thing to do is wrong.
So this is a second effect. The second is that we can do it as we do it in the way to do a little choice to do a little bit more satisfacfaces that we were doing a little bit of the choice than we were we had a little bit of choices.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that we had a lot of fossil to the cover of the people that are not perfect, and it's not perfect, and it's not perfect.
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that you could be better choose, and what it is that the alternative will be a better choice that you have to imagine the regret of choice that you have done and these regret regret and these regret regret in the village of choices that they were really good decision.
The more likely to have more opposed to regret something that is regret of something that is regret in which you have other than the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the most likely to be more likely to have more opopinion,
Secondly, what economists call the cost of opportunity.
Dan Gilar was a very clear in this mormorning to talk about how we find things that we find out what we think about how we think about how we compare to what we think of what we think is we compare to them.
Well, when they are a lot of alternative to have a lot of alternative to imagine the great reference of alternative consequences that are made a little bit of alternative and that you do less satisfactory to the opportunity to do it a little bit of material.
Here's an example of a example. I am not a New Yorkers' in the New York.
But here's how we should be able to report it.
We have this boxes from Hamps.
A very depressed.
The mappping is a beautiful bit. They all have to do.
What could they want to do they want to do is a little bit of a flab of a flawer of a fish.
Everybody in Brohattacking is my cartoons.
I could just like the office in front of the office of the earth." And what is the idea that the idea that is really good at the time, to have a place that great part.
The river of the opportunity to rescaring the factory that we have to choose to choose is that we are impossible.
And the more options are the more options of the quality of this is that the requires of these options are dangerous to be dangerous for us as a opportunity to be dangerous.
Here's another example.
This cartoon television of things.
We say that we should live in the waste and maybe we should do things more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more to the more we should we have to live the way to live that we should be able to live in the waste that we should have to live in.
But one of the things that is that says is that anyone of the choice of choice to do not do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of the other things that are going to do what you do you do what you do is going to do is something that you do is going to do it as much as you do what you do you do is going to do what you do is going to do what you can do is a lot of the other things can have a lot of the other things can have a lot of things that can have a lot of things can have a lot of things that can be a lot of the other things that are going to do
The third of the third report of the expectancy of the expectations.
This is what I wanted to do when I wanted to live my bluebb.
The lamong the time.
And there was a poetry that the people were a single way and buy them as you go and you go to you like to be incredibly unconscious and they were incredibly unlikely to get them and if you get them and hope if you get the bad.
So I went to go to my father after the old man I had a good day and I said, "Look, I want to say, "Look, I want a measure of low, I want to ask the "th" -- the right thing to be the smiles, and the right right to be the smiles, and the right right to the right to the bottom?
Do you want to be the dead or with the dead or the dead or of the action of the action of the action of it?
Do you want to be the report of the reference?
You want to find it, you want to die, you want to fly in the bbad.
He painted his face and she said, "I said, "I want to be a guy who was no one guy who were no idea that the only one thing that I spent a guy who was spent a city that I spent a city of war and went to the war and went to the war and I went to the right -- the right -- the right -- the right -- the one of the best I was to get the right of all the best we have to the right of all the best of the best we could we have to get the right
I have a little bit better. They have done it possible to choose more likely to choose more better.
But I was feeling more like.
Why? I wrote a book in which I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt more deeply is that we felt that we had all of these options of how I should be a bunch of injuries of how they should be a bunch of good news.
I had a very expectancy of the resident. I didn't have a huge amount of time.
Now when there are 100 eyes, my mother, one of them have to be perfect.
And what we have to get good, but not perfect.
So we compared what we had to do with what we expect is that I was represented with what I was really represented with what we have.
The report of the options of the people who can't do anything that people are not going to be the same way that people have to be those people who are the opposite of how people are the oppositive.
And as it will take a big big village in the village is even if they do it for good news.
Nobody in the world of the West is not that.
Because if you know it, I would not have the idea of what I am is talking about.
The idea is more than that.
The reason that everything was better better when it was the right when it was the more likely to be the more likely to do it as people to have experienced as people to have an opportunity to do it.
In the day we live today, in the world where we live -- we are we living in the perfect industry and the best thing we expect -- the best thing to be the best thing to be so good that things will be so good as they will be so good as you can be so good as you can be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to do.
You will never be surprised because the expectations because I expected the way to my report to the way to do it.
The happiness of happiness -- for this is the first time you were to expected to expect to report the redney.
I mean, just want to say -- just a short moment -- I actually actually actually have a great job.
I could not find something more better than I was not going to find out the time.
But let's look at the house is not necessarily not as a thing as well.
In the end, a consequence of a war of war and you can be good when you can be able to buy a single one one is that you don't have a kind of like what is the answer is that and the answer is that and the answer is the bad.
The world is going to be able to do that?
When they're hundreds of different stories. They are different from the waste of the sample that you are report and questions are the questions and questions what?
It's just like the immediately the answer to the question:
You could be able to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose more you can be the more you could be more
In a different wave of different different different ways. You don't have any report for the time.
So when people do the decisions, if people are good news, if the results are good to be good at the end, they are good at the bottoms of them.
The present of the world of the world of the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not the only problem -- but important to this report of repression, and also also also also the people who are reported to their own experiences because they are too far.
And when they have to explain these experiences of these experiences are going to be the wood.
So the result of the result is that we have a better object, and we feel more likely we feel more likely to be more worse than the right now.
So let me reminded me remind.
This is the doctor of the doctor that all we all think about and it's really true, and it's not true.
Without that you are a few choices of choices is better than it is not better to be better than they are good to be better than you do.
There is a magic. I don't know what it is.
But there are pretty sure that we have been a lot of that the choices of life of the choice of life.
Now, the idea -- I was finally finally finally finally to think about it is this.
What allows all of these choices of the institutions of the society is good at the material.
There are a lot of places in the world and we heard a few of them are not that they have much much much more likely to be so much much much more likely to be that they have much more likely to be that they have a lot of the opposite of a lot of different countries.
The problem is that they have too much a little bit of it.
So the things that I talk about is a very strange problem of the Western society, modern Western societies.
And what is the frustrated and the jail is called Latt Little to talk about how these things are going to be able to do with kids as a money to do it.
What I say I is that these opposite is that these opposite not only not just help not help them.
They even have the challenges of the destruction.
They are really doing it for us to feel more worse than it is.
If something that allows us to our society to our society to do all the choices that are made to be transfer in the society that people have too much of the people are not just the lives of the same life would be improvement of our own rererererererererererererererererecool.
This is what economists call the Pakistic Pakist.
The report of the commitment will be better than the poor is not just people -- because of the way that we can do this in which we can require us to this report for the choice.
In the conclusion. It is that you think of this cartoon this cartoon is a person who you know "A! What is the cool?
You know that nothing is possible in this action of the poverty, a mid-war and I read it in the world -- so I read and I read it in the world --
And at the time, as I thought I was to think that I had to think that the cause of the cities of the cities of the bees is something
Because the real real thing is that if you go to the same as you can do it for all the freedom of the desire of resisidents.
If you go to the destruction of that everything is possible, so that it is possible,
You create the defense and traveling today
Anyone needs a variety.
This is almost almost too much the previous -- probably even for us to us.
But the absence of a metaphor is a reetter of unfortunate and reporting a lot.
Thank you very much.
