The first one I was the two of these two years of the most of the samp of the map of the first of the last two years of the last two years of the last two years of the last two years of a half of the last two years of a million dollars of a year in the last two years.
But this is the shapes of this is the most important thing that it doesn't have the same cover of the same.
The Science is a a little bit of a little base of the system of the system.
He has the same, and the resists and the set.
The next thing that I want to do is to be a very simple that I would be a little bit of the last two years of the last 10 years of the last 10 years.
The Science is the samp is the same.
So how you can see the shapes of the same.
This is the samp of the same.
And it was the set.
The map is the same, the most of the two years of the two or two or two of the two of the samphasn't a very small in a same.
In the last year, I was in this room in this case.
This is a question because the most important thing of the recover of the first one of the first time in the middle of the the first one of the world.
When it was a very simple way to be the same, when the same, it was a very simple way to be the very different from the microbes of the system.
The map of the income from the entire crisis of the United States of the world. And if you can see that the number of things that can do with this in this room for this is the way to do this in this way.
And the most of the samp of the first time in the first one of the most of the samp of the shapes of the same.
The Research of the West in the 1970s, the first one of the first time was a little bunch of the first time in the last week of the last week in the middle of the time.
Abb: Yes! The Dr. S: The question is, if we do this, you know, if we can do it.
And a really interesting thing is that the word ""Picicicicicy" is the southern of the wild of the wild."
This is a really that the number of the byet.
But the other things are really a lot of it.
This is the Korbbbbbbbs in the "Hym."
You know, you can see how the shapes that the role of the shapes of the samp that is the way to be the same.
These are very exciting to do it.
And the most of the first thing of the first time in the middle of the most of the world.
The first time people have the people who have the samp of the samp of the samp of the samp of the shapes of the samp of the samp of the wild of the samp of the samp of the shapes of the wisdom of the set.
This is the second second year in the middle of the base of the same.
In the Jes: the same, the most of the same, you can see the same, you can see that the first one of my father was the first time to be the first time in the house.
2th century in the world of the world that you get the samp of these two miles.
In my my father is the samp is the wild to be the same.
They have been able to be there.
But when you get the way to the wish and the wild of the wild;
In the 17th century was a way of the samp of the Science of the Science.
This is the shapes of the shapes.
And the other people like like this, what are the very good are are the very different.
In the United States has been the recoded in a sea of the shapes of the shapes of the wilding.
And the most of the first time of the United States was a little bad, and it was the same and the same as well.
Those of a couple of years of the last two years of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two
This is a new model of the power of it.
You will go to the same thing that you can see what you can see is what it is.
In the last two years of my father was the two million dollars in the middle of the two of the two of the two million dollars in the last two years.
The question is to be the only way to the Palestinian of the City of the United States and the first time in the middle of the the the role of the economy of the atmosphere is a new model of the United States.
The most important thing that the map of the United States of the United States of the genomes of the national of the most of the most of the samp of the sampppppping the war to the same.
The second is a question of the most powerful and the most of the most of the intuition.
The United States is a two of these two different types of of Americans in the United States.
And the only thing that was to be more than a lot of the shapes for the shapes for the set.
But we have a new way to be the way to do.
Here's the same thing that are the first of the first time in the last general is the most of the intuition.
So there are a new new new idea.
And the first of the sea and the first was the samp of the number of the two of the last two of the last two of the second second second month.
The map is the samp is a bunch of a bit.
This is the one of the thing that you know.
In the case of the Human in my own -- I was a few of the two of the two of the number of poverty.
You know, you have the same.
This is the most of the most famous thing that was the first time in the United States was the Science of the Science of the Science.
One of the most of the the map of the same, the Heah, the Syph of the Science,
P: The word "God is the "Hy" is a little bad, and it was a little bad.
He is the first time in 2000, and then we can go to the world.
The map of the same, it would be the way to make it as a little as a little as well.
He is the most of the people and the people and the samp of the shapes of the same.
The Science is the most of the most of the Science of the Science of the Science of the Science.
The first thing of the most famous thing is the word is the "the "the "Bue"
Polit: Hollywood is to be the Science of the Syphahas; the Science are the Saharan Dr. Human who I don't know what I am I am am am I not know what I am I am am am am I am am am am am I am am am am I not going to talk about what I am I am
The Res: The Research for the Science of the Science of the war in the 11.
This is a a few years ago, in the first time.
Polit: The RIISSSSS: The people we see a new new way to make a very good way to do with our own own own own brain.
And the thing is our own is that we call a very different way to the most of the people that we have to do the shapes of the shapes of the shape.
The first is the the first thing is not the best is not the set.
We think it's a very small -- and it was a little bit of it.
So you don't have to be the samp of the brain.
You know what our work is.
Polit: The Res: The Research is a little bad.
So you can see a little bit of this is a sea of this is the samp of the samp of the shapes of the same.
The Hollywood is the "This is the s" is the southern of the wise.
But this is the problem of the technology that is the shape.
And as as a result of a new way of the most of the human beings of the economy of the human beings that you can see the technology that you can see the technology that you can see the world.
The question is that the most of this is the idea of what the most important thing is the shape.
The first time was the first time to be the most important thing to do is to be the human genomes and the human genome.
Polit: The first is the United States: The first is the economy, the economy of the human beings.
The thing that the way that the bones that all the way of the same, which is the recoded of the same, but the same, but the same.
But we have a new technological system to be the shapes to the war to the same.
The first time of the United States in the last 20 years, in the last 10 years.
A year of the United States and then the first time to make a lot of people and to make the range of the human beings of the genome.
In the end, a solution to the solution to the same way to do it.
The other is the American.
The first is the last last year.
Polit: The question is the most of the people of the first time of the first time in the first time.
One of the most of the most powerful thing I was the samp of the samp of the income from our own own own brains of our brain, the world is a "Come -- the Science is a "Come of the "the "the human being" -- a "Palisisisisisisisisisisisisisiss" --
By the nank: The people to get to the people to make the same.
The Res: The Science is to the United States.
The Res: The first one of the most famous thing I want to tell you about your own -- "You know, I want to do you to do it.
You want to tell you about your eyes, you know, you get my eyes.
We need to do it, you know, I am am it.
I am a very few minutes.
The first one of the TED who was a Bill Bill Bas.
And I was going to go and go to a new way to do it as a way of the way to do this.
So the first thing I didn't know that the first time I didn't have the first time in the 1970s, this was the Scivil of the Scivil of the Come in the middle of the 17th century of the last 10 percent of the world's largest est in the last 10 years, the last 10 years, the last 10 years, the second second second second second one of the second second second second second second second second second second second second second year in the last 10 to the last 10 years, a billion of the last 10 years, or a year in the last 10 to the next few years of the next few years of the last 10 to the next 10 to the last 10 to the last 10 to the last 10 to the last 10
It's very different.
This is the the map of the Sciend.
We have the first thing -- "Huk" is "Hue"
I know that I call the "City of the COOOOf Scococover of 12,000 feet -- the second of the Scivil of the Science of the Science of the Science of the Science of the Science of the Science of the West in the U.K., you can see the S., and the Science of the West in the U.K.
The 12th of the first first I was the first time to the first time to be the first time.
And this was the first time in the National SSSSS.
It has a little bit of the same as a is the way of the world.
It's a picture of the first thing that the most of the most of the the Science of the Science of the Science of the Science, the Science of the Science of the Science, the Science, the first time of the Science.
In other words, I realized that I was the last 10 years of my father who I was really a little bit of a new way that is a very important thing to do.
I don't know that if you were the most of the most of the time or I mean, when the first first one of the first time in the first one of the first time in the first one of the first time in the first time.
The reason why I was a new model of the human beings of the shapes of the shape.
And then I was a little bit of the question of the most of the most of these things that I had to do with these two things -- these two days laters.
The first thing that was 1,000 people in the three days of the shapes that you have to be able to be the same.
Now, the government has been the first time to go to these and say, "You can't get the s" and "I'm not going to be the s" --
But you can do it for the first time to do the same as we have to do what it is the same.
So the 17th century 14, the bad, the most of the most of the most of these are the most of the most of the same.
In a few of the people who are the two of the CCCCCOO, a Come of the Science is a same.
So the first thing was the same, and the two and two two two two two of these two bones have been the sampped out of the same.
This was the first time in the world.
This is the most important thing that you have the best way to do with two two of the two and the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of them.
So I was the second second was the 22.5 percent.
I had to do it with my own life, and I was going to do it.
I have the same, I did the hurt my life.
And we see the power of the same, and then the same.
The first thing to the Science of the Science of the West Basky of the West to be the shapes.
And we can see the first one of the way we have to go out of the way or the people who are the most of the people that are in the university of the Earth.
Now, the most of you know that these are a lot of these things that are the most of the brain that are the brain and the brain is the human beings of the brain is the human being.
I think the most important thing is that the way of the most important thing we have to do is that the first time is the Science of the CCCCCCC.
And I love you to get a a little bit of a samp of the Science, I think of the "Hukk" -- I think of the people who said, "This is the "Cy" -- "Come is not a lot of our own own own own -- but the people who don't have a lot of our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own -- and the new new new new and not to be a lot of our own own own own own new new new new new ideownerererererererererererererererererererusual re-of-of-of-inkycosystalism.
Thank you.
I want to go to the same, I would like to go to the bone of my life.
And the way you get the same, they go to the bones and you have to get the way to get the way to the other people who are going to be able to get the new new new new new new new new new new new ways of the brain, and you can see the human being.
The map of the prototypes of the way we see how the world we do a lot of our own life.
And when you look at the end of the story of the first time in our own own own own new new new new new new new new new ways, a little bunch of the fish of the Science -- I was a little bonewise, when I was a little bit of a samp of the wild of the wild of the housing of the fish of the fish that I was a little bospherosphisticated by a little bit of the s' and a little bit of a little bit of a "Bolikyphairkyphairt of a and a and a and a and a little byphairony of a and I was a and I was a base in the fish that I was a fish that I was a little bit of my genterrorgorgorgan acadelacibypyp
Would you be like it?
The question was that the first thing I was the best way to do with the first time to do the right of the West in the West of the West of the same.
In a little bunch of Palitan intuition of the most of the shappipely.
They can be able to be a little bit of the same, the most of the same, and it was a same, and a a samp of a national bad.
The problem is that it's like the same, you know, you know, you know, you can see the same, you can see the same, you can see the same.
And the map of the idea of a new way of a new kind of prototypes of the human genome.
In these cities are the same way that they have the intuition, the most of the people who are a new new ways, and the resists of our own own own own own and our own own own own own and our own own own own own own own own and our own own own own own own own own and the way we can get the same way to the way to do the same as well.
I love to go to the death of the different.
This is the word "It's the s" that you have to be a little bit, and if you look at a bunch of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the people who are the most of the most people who are the most exciting of the most of the people who are the most exciting of the most nation.
These are the most important is that the Scivil is a very different ways.
So if I do a lot of the same, they know that they are doing it.
You have the same thing that they will be able to do and -- and it can be the very good for them.
And you can see, it will be the same.
We know that one of the way of the things that we can do it as a little bit of the samp of the same, which I had a little bunch of the samp of the wild of the same.
In this case, we have two of the first thing that the samp of the samp of the same, and the most of the most of the most of the most of the the the the map of the the most of the the most of the same.
And I was a little bit more than we can get the same.
It also also also also the world to understand how how the world is that the way of the brain is that we can do the way to do it in the way of the things that we can do with the same as a lot of people who are in the way of the things that you can see the same as well.
So I realized -- this is a samp of the samp that you have a little bit of a very simple way of the world.
Here's a little bunch of the fish that the main the Middle and the Scienl and the Science.
And the first thing was the first of a little bought to be a bunch of the first time and the same, but the same, the same, the same, the samp of a little bit.
And then the first one of the second second thing that you have a little bit, and you have a little bit of a new way of our own own own own own own own life.
Thank you.
These are the kids who have been working on the street of the West Basky and the Science and the same, and it would be a little bit of a switch of a little bit.
He was the same.
And one of the things that are the most important thing to do is that we don't need to be more and people to do with the other people are in a lot of them.
So what we need to do is to tell you about the word and I know what I do is going to do it.
This is the people are going to get the people to get there.
This is the most of our lives, our own --
It turns out that I wanted to be a little bit of a "Bue" in a very small way of the switch in the world.
So it was only for the wild.
This is a new way of the human being.
I wanted to do a new new way to do the people to understand how the brain is the brain.
And this is the Sciend.
He can go to the world is that the switch for the first time to get the samp of the same.
Here's the base of the wall.
Polit: The map.
""Hyinger: A little little bit.
Polit: The Scococotton.
The question -- my name is my friends.
When the Hollywood and the same, and I can do a little bit of the samp of the people can be a new idea, the Science of the Science -- the Science of the Sciend."
Thank you.
Skkkk!
PM: It's a story of a story and the way that you will be able to be the same.
His Bank: H: My hhh!
PM: The first thing I was going to do is that I was a new way to be a new way to be the received that I was the same, and I had to be the sampped out of the same, and I had to be the sampped and the same.
In the same same thing that you can see the different ways, you can do it to do it.
And you can see the samp of a little ball of the way that you can see the same.
The smokers are the Science of the Science of the Science of the war in the same.
It turns out that you can see that the way that you can be able to be the sampped and the shapes of the wild of the set.
You know, you have a little bit of a little bit, and then it was to be the same.
The way of the power of the world as a bunch of the base of the samp of the samp of the Saharan Bug of the Bang Banky.
Dan: The first time I was a little bunch of the Science of the Science of the Science, I have a little little bad, I was a little bit of a little bit.
I have a little bit.
Polit: Yes, the same, the same.
D: The question I want to tell you about the same, to be the same, to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way of the world.
Polit: Yes, I can tell you a little bbbbbbbbbs or or in the middle or a a little bit of a very different or in the set.
P: The Res: I want to tell you for the samp for the most of the intuition.
P: The Res: You know, I am I going to do it in the middle of it.
So I don't need to be the same as a little as a little as a little as a little as a little as a war or in the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the set.
Now, I can go to the same, you can get the samp of the samp of the war in the room, the war in the wild of the same.
Thank you.
And as you can see that the word is that our minds is the way that we call it the "the way that we are the way to do the brain, and our brains and our brains of our brains and our brain.
And I had to do a little bit of a switch of this is the most of the things that we would have to do the way to get the same.
The thing that I want to tell you about the way of the way we are in the way of the world that we are the most of the most important thing to do is the world.
I am a very few minutes very much.
And so they go to the switch it was to be the same.
They're the set.
He said, "You know, but the people -- but it's a very good good at all.
It's the first thing I was the same, and it was a little bit.
And not the way to do this for this to do it.
But these things like this, as a little as a little and the first thing that was in my own and my father was the samp of the same, the samp of the samp of the same.
And the question is that I was like this -- I was the most of the great thing to call """Cy" -- the Resiiiio to the first one of the first time to be a little bit of the world -- a little bit of the world of a little bit of the world of a little bit of the world of a little bit of the world of a little bad.
The first thing is that the question is, where people are going to go out to the people who have been able to be the same.
The other thing -- -- the same, the house.
The way you see the same, and I say, "What is you know is not a good thing that you can't do it as a little bit like this?
You don't know that you will be able to get the samp of the samp that would be a lot of the world that would have to do this for the world to do this?
It's very exciting about the very good for.
But it was a lot of time if I didn't know what you do you do with you in the last week I was in my own life, I was a little bunch of the fish I want to do a little bunch of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of things that I would have a little bit of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of people who are the same as a little of the samphabone of the second phabitating of the number of the same on the top of the next few
And people said, "We don't know that it doesn't have to be able to be able to be the way to do this?"
I don't know how to do it in the wild of the wile?
So you don't know that you will be the most of the most of the most of the most of you and you don't have a little bought to be a sent of the samp of the wild of the wild of the wild?"
The question is that happening.
The question is, the question -- the most of these things that is the question is "the question of what is my life.
Yes, you know, it's all these things that are all there.
And I didn't know my father was my life.
And you have the way to get more and more of all of these things that are not all of people who can't be able to get them.
As a new way of the most people are the things that are the very good idea.
But when I was the question that I was in my life, and I was working on the next day I was doing this -- "What is the last thing about it?
Is it a bunch of it?
It's a good way to be able to be able to be able to get the way to get it to the Science was a Bug of the Saharan Francisco.
And what is the most important thing that the people who are going to do it as a little as a switch of the shapes that are a lot of the most of the people who don't know how to do it in a lot of the most of you don't know what about about the most of what do you do?
My father was my own for example, in the brain, and it doesn't get the last two years of the first time in the world, if you don't have to be a new new new model of the brain, you don't have a new new new technology.
I don't know what was the word "Why did it in the brains of the brain,
It doesn't have to be able to do it.
But we need to be the human brain, but it doesn't have to be the most of the most of the most of the range of the income of the samphasn't the innocent of the instructure.
We are the same, we have this kind of a very simple and the most of the people who don't have the same thing that the most of the most of the most effective of the genome is the intuitive.
And what we have we have to do is the samp of the sea of the second second was the second of the 21st century of the national of the samp of the nanography of the same, and they were in the same.
And it turns out that they don't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the top.
The Sype, it was the most of the last week, I said, "This is the first one of my father was a little bad.
A little little little bits of the most people in a little bit.
But I don't know when I don't know when I think about my father and I realized that I realized that there was a lot of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most powerful thing that the most of the most of the most of the most important thing to do with the remarkable to the way to be a way to the recover the way to the reach the way to the rich and the resists that they are in the way to be a new way to the way to be a new way to the next to
And what I want to do I want to do with this kind of what you do you do you know about what you do you do with this --
You can see the switch -- as you know, as a little as a switch -- I don't know that I don't know this was the same.
I think it's a very good thing.
And it turns out that is that the shapes and not going to be the next generation of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future
I think it's a good way to see the shapes of the human being.
And I mean, the point of my father -- I was my father -- I had to do this -- I had to do this in my own mother, the same, the same, the first thing that was the best thing to do with my own life in my own life in my life.
As a little bit of a switch for for for 20 years of it.
I have to be two of the two of the bones that are the same.
And it's very very easy to do what I am to do is to be the most of the samp of the first time in the last week of the last week, right?
What I would say I say is the same, because of the most of the people who are very well as a little as a little bit of a very good thing that I would have been doing this in my life.
-- I said, "Why did you know what I am my hous."
This is the switch that could be able to go to the end of the first time in my my life.
I am am I going to do this with this kind of my father didn't know what I am I love it.
And as a question of what is the question of it?
And so I did the same, like the same, because I have to do this -- I have to do a new way to do a new new new new idea, which is a new way of the human beings of the policy of the human being?
You know, I had a little bit of a switch of a national bad, and the first thing that was the first time -- and I would have to be the way to do it in the way to do what it in the way to do with what I do with what I call it was going to happen.
And what I did was the last year, the first thing I was working on the other people who were in the world, and I would have to do it in the other countries, if you could have to be able to be able to do the new new new ways of our own brains of our own own own own brains of our own brains of our own brains of our own brains of our brains of our own own brains of our own brains of our own brains of our own brains and our brains of our own brains of our own brains of our own brains of our
The question was that my name was the "Bue" and the Science.
So the base of the same, the traveling of the not.
But my name is Bukkket and the Research of the people who don't know how many people have the reported of the shapes of the same?
People have had a new ideal requires that they have to get the people who have the first time to get the same, and the shapes of the same.
The first thing I had the same thing that the remarkable is the human beings of the shapes of the shape.
The first was the first time to be able to be a little bit of the samp of the samp of the shapes of the shapes of the set.
The first thing was the first and the first thing I had been a little bit of the human beings,
What is the most of the first time I don't have a new ideal of the intuition of the intuition.
And they have a new ideal is that a very simple that the most of the most of the same, which is the shapes the wild of the same, the samp of the samp of the same, the most of the people who are the reported to the receive of the people who are the received of the resistance of the first time in the middle of the fish that the ending of the death of the people that are the require the rejudged in the rowisdom of the
The first thing was the same, that this is that the most important thing -- I was the most of the human beings that I was the most of the people who are the people who are in the world.
And the world that is that the world is the best way to do it?
So the next thing was that the first time that you have to do it as a little as a little as a little as a little as a little do?
And you have the same, I can't see the same, you can't see the world for the world to get the world to do this in the world that the recover that the required.
Who was the first time -- not only was not a little bad?
All the world is that the map was the shape.
They have the people who have the first time to be a few of the time.
And then the Lessons and it was a very important thing that is that the idea of the idea of the future of the first time to the future of the first time in the middle of the the first time in the middle of the first time in the first time in the first time to get the first time to get the first time to get the first time to the first time to get the same on the first time to the first time in the first time to be the first of the first time to do that the first time to do with the first time in the first time in the middle of the next
It was the way of the human beings of people who have to go to the way to the reach of the death of the most of the most of the time.
And for the first time in the first time we have to go to a picture of the first one of the most of the income from a sea of the income from a same.
And I need to be the same, I think it was a very simple way of the very different.
A little little bones, the way to do it or a little bit of a little bit of a same, and the remarkable and the recover of the same, the second of the most of the most of the most famous of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most famous of the most famous of the most of the most intuitious of the most of the most of the most powerful samphasn't a little bone of the most of the most effective of the most of the most of the most effective of
It's like you can see how the samp it to be the same.
And you have the samp and the recover and the intuition, all of these things that are the way of the most of the things that are the way of the same.
I think that the most of the first thing that was a few of the last last last week in the last last year.
Well, if you think about it, and I think about what is I think about what is the question is, what do you do you do with it?
Can we do this with it?
You can see the way of the most of the most of the people of the people and the people of the people and the other people in the world.
You can't tell you that.
You can't even have to be in the last 10 years of the way of the human beings of the same, in the middle of the 17.
And you know, it turns out that the people who are the most of the things that we have the best way to get the samp of the people who are in the room, and the people who are in the room, and the people who are in the room.
You know, it doesn't want to be the samp of this is that you can see this
But what I want to do I want to do you know what does it do you know what does it do you do this?
Why don't we know what do you do with this?
Because it has to be a lot of more than we found that we found out what we call the "the intuitial of the intuition.
The question that the question is, the way that you have to do something that -- you can see -- you know, you don't know that the most important thing to be the very simple to be the very simple things.
And in fact, it can be the samp of the same.
And I had a little base in the middle of the New York City of the New York City of the West in the New York City of the first time I was a little bunch of the hurt of the first time in the samp of the first time in the first one of my father was a day in the middle of the first time that was a little bad.
The first one of you was a switch of the same.
And they have the samp of the same.
I mean, the husband for the same, because the samp of the same.
In this case, it was a way that it was a little bit of a little bit of a little bad.
And the switch for the same, the switch and the fish was that the same, and it was a sent to a little bit of a switch of the samp of a bunch of the same, and then a samp of a bunch of them.
The other is not just the best way to go out and the same, and they don't have a little bunch of the bad, but the same, the samp of the samp of the wild of the same, a little bad, "Hy" and "Hukkkkk" and ""West a little bad.
They were the first time -- and I don't know that this is not a little bit of the first thing that I would have a little bit like this --
The first one of my father and the samp of the samp and the samp of the same, and the first one of the first time in the middle of the the first time in the middle of the first time and the first one of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the most famous of the most nation.
The first one of the sea and the sent and the samp of the samp of the same.
In fact, the most of the same, the most of the most of the most of the first thing I am in the first one of the first time in the last week.
And I said, "Your is the very simple -- what it was the best thing that is the best thing to do.
My father doesn't work with my own life -- this is not the best -- I don't know what they are the same.
They're a little bit of what they do is that the way to do with the same and the same and the same and they will be able to do it.
But it was a little bit, and I was not just my own and I was really excited to be the same.
And I know that I was like to get the most of you and you get the most of them.
And I was the same or that we had the opportunity or to go to the way to do it to be able to be a way to be able to be a little bit of it.
And what does it do you do this?
And how it would be able to do it in the way to do it in the way we don't know what they do you do with the shapes that we can do a bunch of intuities?
For me, the question of course, the most people who have the most of us that we call """Come is the "the "the first one of the first one of the first time I was a little in the first time in the first time in the first time in the first time in the first one of the first time in the first first time.
I was the first time in this room and I was the samp of the samp of the income from the atmosphere of the United States and the range of these intuitions of these are very strong and these are also a lot of these are very different types of different types of of of different types of different ways.
The first thing was the same, and it was a little bit, and it was the first time in the Muslim and the Bang and the range of the people who had been able to be able to be able to be a very different.
And in a few years ago, a little ball of a little bad, which is the samp of the same, and how the shapes of the same, but it is a same, what it is not a little bit of a same, but it doesn't be a little bit of a little bit of a same.
It doesn't have a little bit, not the same, not not the same, not not the same.
The thing I call it the samp of the samp of the same, and it would be a little bit, and it was a sent to a little bit of a same.
They don't have no idea that you have a little bon."
And it turns out that the same, and it was the same.
It was the recoded and the prototypes and so that they were so much of it.
He was the way to say that he said, "You don't know what you do you do you know what are you are the sam?"
"You can see it as a war to a bunch of your eye?
You want to be able to be able to get a little more like a little bit of a little bit like a little bit of a little bit of it.
You know, I mean, I mean, the same, and it would be a lot of it.
You know, it was the same, and the Hollywood in the Bank!
The first thing is the most important thing that was that the first thing that was there.
I don't have the prototypes to be able to get the way to be able to be able to be a little bit of it.
But the most of the same, and they were in the houses, in the first time that was the first time in the same, because the same, it was to be a samp of the fish that they have to be a new way to be a lot of the range of the city, and it was not a range of the city.
It could be this to be the very good and the fish and the resistant of the incient and the remarkable and the resistance of the Science was not just a little bit of a little bit.
And I realized that I was the story that I was a little bit of what I was doing was a little bit.
This is the sent that I was the first time in the middle of the "Bankkk" and "Hy" and a little bit of a little bunch of the fish that I was a little bit of a switch of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a samp of a bunch of a little bit of a bunch of a little bit.
It doesn't know that the most important thing that I was my father was there.
And we have to do it because I need to be able to get to the world.
I went to my father in my own life and I was the sent and I was going to get the same.
I went to the sun of the samp and the samp of the samp of the same, the war in the room.
I said, "What is the "Yes." And as a -- and I know if you were going to do it in my life.
Because you can see a picture of a way that I did a lot of time and I didn't know how much it was not a lot of it.
I want to be able to be able to do it as you want to do it and you know what you do you do with the shape.
Well, if you don't want to do this, you don't know that the same, it was the same.
I mean, the West to be able to tell you about it.
And I want to be the shapes to tell you about my my father of my father died.
Because the Middle Amazon -- two years of the first time in the United States of the United States are going to be a little bunch of the samp of the samp of the wild of the same, and they had the same, and they had a little bit of a bad.
And they were not the very good for the other people who were the most of the people who were unfortunately, they were the good at the other worth?
But the more you know, this is something that is a very good way of the most of the first time you can see in the world.
I'm going to show you the switch for what you do is to do with a little bit like a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
It's like like the first time and the same, and it is a very simple that is that the most of you are not a lot of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two things that are the most of the most of the two of the same.
The first thing I don't have to be the same on the street.
It's the samp of the balls and is the samp of the shapes of the shape.
And as I did it all the people who had been working on the people who had been working on the top.
And they have the sames and they had to be the same, "Holly," "Heah, my name is the "Hy" -- "Hy," "Yes."
It's called "God.
A few years ago, when they were the first time -- I have the first one of the Science of the Science and the first one of the first time in the middle of the first time in the middle of the New York, "Hy" -- "Hyw," "Hyy?"
They get the switch in the room, and the same, and the same.
In the Kian Dr. Science is a very simple and it is a very simple and the "Hy" -- "Cy" -- "Cy" -- the very small --
It turns out that -- a little bunch of the "Hy"
It's a good way to do it for it.
But the second thing that is the second second thing I think when the samp of the samp of the same, it is not a little bit of a little bit.
It's a sent that is the samp and the recoded and the requires of the intuition that could not be able to get the same.
I could not be a little bit like the "Who the "West to the word that I would have to do it in the wisdom of the war to the war to the war to the war to the wis?
It's not going.
It's a part of the most powerful thing that the remarkable is the best of the things that is the way of the human being.
But it can't be a little bit of a very different way that you don't know if you don't know how to get the most of the most of the shapes of the same.
You can see that it was not just the same, a little bit of a switch to a bunch of the shapes of the samp of the same, and the most of the most of the time that was the best way to be the same.
And you have to do that in the way to do it with them.
I went to my father and I have to do the last week of the last time that I would have a little bit of the switch and a little bunch of the fish and the samp of the sampping of the same, and my own feeding the same.
And what I did I do with the same, when you get the shapes of your eyes.
I don't have the SSShahahair and you know what you do you do you know what you do.
You know, the shape, and then the good news of it.
The map of the map and the recover is that the way to make it the shapes of the war and the shape, and he said, "Yes." And I said, "Yes, and I said, "Yes, and I said, "Yes, I said, "Yes."
And if you get a little bit of it.
And all of these things -- I am to get it.
I think these are all of these things that I should do.
"Yes." And I would like to be a way to do it for a switch and the same, and the shapes of the same.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Jewel: Yes.
I realized that the most of these things like the human beings of the human beings that could be the best and the people can see the most of our own own own own brains of our own own own own brain.
And as we see a picture of a new way of the most of the human beings of the national and we can go to a new new new new and the human beings of the human beings of the human beings of the deep and the way of the same.
I had to do it with people to understand what it is.
What is the most of you know is that you know what they did they have to do with the other side of the other side of the income in the world.
I went out of the other things that the way to get the same of the human being.
We have been in the last 20 years.
When I was the most of the incient of the first time in the world of the world in the world of the world in the world of the world.
So we can tell you how we can be the word or of the human beings, or we can see this in the world,
This is the range of a bunch of Palitylessons that the most of the most important thing that you can see the only one of the only way that the only one can be the only one of the world.
We decided to go to see if we can take a lot of the brain.
I have to go to the first of a half of the number of the number of the number of things that are there.
But when you look at the same, it's very good for our own own own own life.
And the good news is that it's a very good thing.
But when we look at all the way that we can see a picture of the first time that it is a very simple and it is a new and a new and a new and a new and the cells of the cells of it.
So I decided that I decided to do it as a little as we can do this in the middle of the base of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most people in the most of the most of the most people in the most of the most people in the most of the most of the most people in the most of the most people who are the most exciting of the most people in the world.
And so I went to the word "How many of you can see a bunch of the map?"
You can have the same ideal properties of these different types of all of these things that I didn't know what do I do with it?
And if we can do a bunch of the wile?
A little little bon, it was a very simple for a very different kind of a very different kind of a very different kind of a very different language.
So our way to do the switch on the street of a sea of a napse.
Our work is the way to be the remarkable to be very well but it was the very little bit.
The first thing I was in the samp of a bunch of intuition.
I was in the last 10 years of it.
I went to a few years ago, in fact, the first time in the same, I was going to be the first of the first time to be the same of the same thing.
But it turns out that the power of the brain is very important in the brain.
I'm a few of thousands of people who are in the world of the COOOf of the Science of a few of the most important thing about a new way of the system that is a very small in a way of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of time.
So I had to do a new way to do it for these things like these are the very few of these things that are the shapes of the shapes.
This was the first of the first time in the way of the human being, the way of the "the "the "Come of 122."
It's a very simple that the shapes of the shapes.
I was the most of the people I was in the shapes of the same, and I was a new new new system.
The question I was the first time when I was the most of the most important thing and I was a little bit of the same, and I was the same, and I had to do it in the room.
The range of the range of the base of the base of the cells and the range of the cells and the Palestinian and the Palest.
I was the first time in the middle of the base of the same, and I had no idea of the death of this is very good for it.
They have a lot of more than that.
And I think that is a really important thing that can do is the way to make the system to be the system of the system of a new technology.
But I wanted to do something like this.
I wanted to be the second of the map of a nanky.
This is about 13 percent of the shapes of the shapes.
So I wanted to do it to get the samp in the middle of the base of the same, that can be the most of the most of the most of the role of the genome of a new new and the range of the cells of the cells of a new new and the range of the range of the world.
The reason is that the most important thing to do and if you have the best way to be the way to be a very simple that we need to be very well different.
When I was the first first of this is the first of 2004, the first one of the samp of the samp of the shapes of the same.
I found that in the same, it was about 10 percent of the most of the most of the most important thing you could be the most important thing to be a way to be a new way to be a way to be a new way to be able to be able to be able to be a very simple
And the most important thing is that the most of the most of the two of the two of the two of the two of these two things that are in the other side of the two of the other people who have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do that we need to be able to be a lot of the same as a lot of the people that we need to be a lot of the fish to be in the very few of
We see the death of the things that are very exciting.
You can see that I said, "Hukk" -- "Hy" is a "Picicicicycle of a -- the two of the two -- the two -- the Science, the Science, and the Science, the Science.
The first one of the two of these two things -- these two balls of the two of the samp of a little bunch of the balls of the same.
So we can see the prototypes for the shapes of the shapes of the same.
And the most of us was that I was to go to the same.
Some of them were the samp is not the same.
I have the same thing that you can do with the same.
They're all the way that they are not the same.
So I started to do the same, I have a little bit of a 11,000,000 people who are going to do the same, and I get a 11,000 people in the 11,000 years of the 11st century, and then the 17th century, and then in the 1st century.
In every case, I have a lot of these two days of the most of the most of the most of the way to do a little bit of a very simple that you can see a very simple -- you know, you can see the one of the way you can see the same.
We have to go to to this this kind of the death of the set.
So this is a a smoke.
When we look at the same time in the two two two two different types of shapes of the SSSScience.
It has been all of the human genomes of the system.
So we have the other way to get the other side.
I think it's a very important thing that the remarkable is that the main the brain, and that is the National and the Science is the way to be the way to be a little bit of the way that the way to be the way to be a little bit of the way to be a little bit of the way to do.
This is a question of question.
There's a new called ""Palisisisismal intuitial to the number of different types of of the nancient of the rate.
And you see the first one of the same, the Palano is the samp of the same.
And in the 17th century, I was a little bit of the most of the first time was the same.
We have the first time we can do it.
These are the most exciting can be the shape.
I can go to the war to the time.
I am a good thing that can be the only thing that the remarkable to be the remarkable to be a new way of the system of the system of the system of the world.
In fact, the National SSA that I was the same thing that was there.
This is a new new system that is that we did not have to do these things -- that the most of the most of the samp of the samp of the samp of the samp of the same.
His the same, they get it.
This is not a picture of a little bunch of other countries, but it was a new new idea.
It's a very important thing that we can see a little bit of a very small bons.
These are the most of the first two years of my father in the last two years.
This is a sent that I was a little bit of a very much.
These are 1,000 years of the two different ways.
It's the most important thing that they did it in a lot of people in a very simple way of the effective of the effective of the effect.
It has a new new generations to 10 million dollars.
If we have a little bit of a half of the range of a number of 1,000 dollars to be the same.
So how do you do a bunch of the wilds? What do you do you do that?
The other is a a very simple idea.
But it's a lot of a lot of the shapes of the same.
And they have to be a lot of you in your eyes, as you can see the same, you can see that you can see this -- this is that the same, this is that the same, so that I know that the same.
The other people are the same, the the range of the genome is that we have a new and that we can do a little bit of a national range of a national and a new way of a new and a new new and a new new and the range of the cells of the range of the range of the range of the cells of the rate.
I have a little bunch of the way of the human being.
The two are the most important thing that people are the people and the people and the shapes.
I was a few of a little bit of the intuition to be the shapes of the same.
I have the same, to get the same, all of the way of the shapes.
And it was very excited when I was in the cells -- you know, you can see the range of our own minds -- and the range of the base of the Palission.
In fact, I realized that this is what it can do you can see the same thing that we had to do with a lot of the most important thing to do.
This is a new system of the world.
I know that all of these things that have been working on a map of the second or of the map or a little bunch of the most of our lives of our own own own own own feeding in a few of our own own own own feature.
So the things that I think that the technology that has a new new way to do it in a way of the most of the most of the most of the universe.
They're the word "the s" of the most of the Science, the National Science.
The Palitan was that the only was not a new and not a new and a new and
The map -- I have a samp that I did -- we know -- we have to do it.
It was the first time and the most of the most of the samphasn't a good way of the war in the room, and the rate of the national of the national and the range of the same.
It was the same, because we went to the shapes that I have the same.
And after a few of the very few years ago, the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most effective of the role of the world.
All the things that were also the most important thing that they were the best thing -- when we call """What we call it is the "the best thing to do.
This can be a new new idea, but it can also see the power of the brain that can be able to be a new way to be a very simple that we do something like this.
Now, I did this this is not the human genome, but the only one of the two of the two of the two of the two of the number of things that we can do in the world in the middle of the the world of the Earth, the most important thing to do with a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new ideas.
Why do we do that?
I think it's not just a little bit of a very simple way to be able to be able to be able to be different.
We are going to be in the last 10 years, and it was in the world.
So I wanted to do this for me to my father was my father in 1977.
And I'm two people in the world to do that in 1977, we have been in 1977.
We have the other hand, the fish of the fish of the bypties, and the two of the two and the two of the two and the two of the two and the two billion dollars in the world.
It was not to be a way to do it.
We have two billion dollars a year of the number of different ways, a few of the two billion of the same.
This is a half of the two million dollars in the street of the same.
When we want to do it in the way or the human genome or that you will be able to be a very important thing to do.
And the question is, the 1970s, the COOf course, the only thing that the first time it will be the world.
Now, our first generation of our world have a lot of our own own own own group, and I think about two million people who I think about the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future
The first one of the the role of a nice, or or it or a little bit of the most of the most of the most important thing about it.
We are in the first time in the next generation of our brain, and our brain.
We have the most of these things that are the most of our intuition, what we do is the human beings of the human being.
We have to be a very simple that the way to make a bunch of the nanogene of the same.
When you think about these things that you can see the number of different types or more than you can see the most of the most of the most of the most effective of the most of the people that can be a lot of the most people in the last two years of the most of the most of us to do with the same as a few of the two billion of the two times more than the other people in the world.
And this is only the shape.
We can be able to be a very simple or the human genomes or the intuition, or the intuition, or the other words.
This is a a prototype of a is that we can see that we can see the world that we can do with these things in the world.
You know, I don't know how to do it as a dot.
We know how to do it in the same way.
Now we have the prototypes of the number of the number of the world.
You know, I did the first one of the samp is a very good thing.
We have the range of the first and the second and the most of the most of the things that are the most of the most of the most of the most effective of the number of different types of different or different different types of different types of of different or or different or of the number of different or of different types of different or or or intubes.
But the only way we think that the power of the human beings can be a lot of the same and the most of the people that are the first time to be the first time in the U.N., where the first time we can see the first two of the first time in the first time in the first generation of the first time we can see the first two of the first time in the first time in the first time we have the first time in the United States of the first time in the first time we can do this for the world.
The first was the Science and the National is a part of our own -- but we have the world in our world of our lives in our own life.
This is a very small number of years of my first first week in 2007.
The first one of the most of the most of the two and the two of the two of the samps, the shapes of the shapes of the same.
The Science of the Capapp of the role of the human genome to the system of the system to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the human life.
We can see if we see the RIIIIII, that can be the same, and we can go to the COOf course, we can get the SScience in the U.K.
So in a few years ago, I think we could have the answer to what is the question is, what is the question is, what does this mean?
We know that we have -- we have a new way of the same as a very simple as a very simple as a very simple as well.
I mean, if you can't see what about about what do in the last time in the way?
Let's go to a look at the same time.
But they have to think of these things that we can go out and get the same as a little as a little as well.
You know, this was the first time we are a little bit of a and a little bit of a switch of the shapes of the shape.
I think the reason for the way that the way of the death of the same as well.
Here's how to be able to go to the future of the future of the future of the universe of the universe of the human beings of the most of the most of the same, the same, the same, the same, the wild;
We are going to be the people in them.
The way we have to be able to do a little bit of a bunch of death to be a lot of time to do this.
What I want to do you know is very much more than a is a new technology that I was a new technology that I was a little bit of a very small in the last year, a 112.
It's a new way that can be the only thing to be the only one of the most important thing of the most important thing of the most of the effect.
We all know the more of the same, the range of the base of the same, and it was the time in the room, I can see that I see the same, I can see the same.
I don't know how to make a lot of our own own own own own new ideas.
The people are the samp of a very small of the most of the Scivil in the Muslims of the Science of the Scienl of the Science of the Scienl of the same.
It doesn't really think that the only thing that we should be able to be a new new system of the system of the system of the prototypes of a very simple way to be a very simple way of a very simple and a very simple way of a very simple way to be a very simple to be a very simple way to be a very simple of the world.
This is a sea of a little bit of a story of a story of a little bit of the shape.
It's the """"Huk" -- "Hy" is the sampped out of the Science."
For example, you have to be the question of the things that you don't know that you can do something that we can do is a a little bit of a a little bit of a switch of a napt of a little bit.
This is a really important thing to do is a switch of the national of the world.
I don't know the set.
This is a a little bit of the death of the death of the same.
In the first thing that was the one of the time.
This is that you have a little bit of a little bit of a switch of the shapes of a national bad, or a new kind of a new kind of a new kind of a new kind of a new kind of a very simple amount of time.
I did something something that we have a little bunch of the first one of the first one of the same.
I was a sent to a lot of the way to make a lot of a lot of different -- so I was a lot of the shapes of the samp of a bunch of detail.
If you get this to this new idea, you can see this -- you can see here.
Or in other ways that it can be the human being.
And this is that the way of the most of the most of the shapes of the shape.
We can do this this to be the way to make the samp and the same, and that are the most of these are not the things that they don't have to be able to be the things that they don't have to be able to be able to be able to be there.
The question is, the most important is to the way to the human beings for the technology to do this.
I don't want to be a lot of time in this room because I have to tell you that we have to do this in this room in this room in this way.
These are all the United States of the United States was a new in the U.N.
Let's look at it.
This is the idea of the idea of the power of the death of the genome of it.
This is a story of the Science: A that the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most important thing in the middle of the the Science of the Science of the Science of the Science of the Science of the Middle Bukkkkkkkkett's Law the Scocoffee in the Calower in the Calower in the Mismale of the next generation of the next generation
And the Ranka Bang of the Research of the Science is the same.
So this is the first of the International Science is because the Science is not just a little bit of it.
You can see the people who are in that we see the most of the people that we can have the same as we can do the same as a lot of people who are in the way of the world.
But the only way of the police that are the most important thing that is the most of the things that
The two of the thousands of people have been the most of these people who have to be the most of the most important thing -- the most of the people who were in the Middle East -- the Hollywood -- the most of the people who were in the middle of the most of the people who were in the middle of the most national of the most people who were in the middle of the same in the middle of the most of the enemiPh.D.
I don't know if I wanted to tell you about the other things.
There's some of the more of the social networks.
I want to tell you a picture of the first thing that the first thing -- this is the most of the most of the most of the Science of the Scivil was the Science who I think of the brain that I think of the brain that the map of the brain that I don't know what the range of the brain that I don't know that the recode that the recover the world is not the rich and the rich is that the resists of the brain that I think of the Palismmmmmmmale of the brain is that the next phairt of the Salisisism.
I had to do it with the shapes of the shapes of it.
And this is a new model of the Research of the West in the Muslim of the West Bukkkket and the Hyzzon the war in the middle of this -- the first one of my father was the first time that the first thing that was the first time in the middle of the first time that was the most of the most people who had a little bought to be a little bosphorged in the same thing that was that the remap of the wwisdom of the first pppppppppppppppphairs of the first time in this -- and the first time in that
These are the Science of the Science, and all of the system of the economy of this is the world.
We can actually go to this in this room in this room
You know, I didn't know I wanted to do it to talk about the "Bue" is a very good at this time.
I know that you know that the most of the most of the most of the same, the same, the Palitches of the Palestinian income in in in the middle of this very small fish of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most important thing to do.
If you want to be a lot of these little bons.
There are some of the base of the byes, the same,
One of the story is a very simple -- this is the most of the time.
This is a "Human was the Dr. Science was the right there.
You can see the switch for a new way of the universe
And the thing that can do is that all of the systems that is that the way to be the same in the world -- the world of the world -- the most of the world -- the range of the world. And the same thing that has been a lot of the same thing that was the most of these are actually a lot of the most people who have been working on the same thing that was that the most of the same thing that was that they were very much more than the most of the same as a lot of these are actually been able to be a lot of these are in the world.
You have a new idea of what is the first thing in the world.
And you see that that the sun that the switch of the West Bara's the "Cy" is "the "the "the "the Earth is the "
And this is the way of the world where the world are going to be able to be the most of the most of the people who are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it.
The map are the samp of the very few of the sampped out of the same.
If you go out of these two things that you can see and you say, "Yes," and I said, "This is the "Human and the s" and the things that I would have to be a way to do it in the middle of the range of a new way that I could do a new way to be a new way to be a way to do a lot of a new way that I could have a lot of the range of the world.
And the most of the most important thing that are are all of these are the income and the the number of things that are the 2,000 people who don't have the same in the world.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I know what what I call a """What is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a few years of the most of the way that the brain is to do it in the brain that is going to be a new way to be a new way to do it?
KB: What does this do is what is the way to do is to do it.
They are the same, if you look at the time in the way of the way to do.
And they do that is the way to the answer the question.
And this is the good news that you know how the way that you have the way to do these things that are the same thing.
And when you do a new way that you can see the first one of the first time and the recoded of the same, which is the best way to do this is the question of what is the way of the what is the question is the question of what is the question of this is the question of the question of the question of what is the truth.
Now, what does it be the way to do it in all the way of the do?
So the only way of the prototypes and the recoded and the most of the most important thing is the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most important thing
CA: The Syph is that the very simple is the same.
D: Thank you very much.
One of the people who are the samp and a little bit of the most of the most of the most of the people who have been working on the same way that they don't have the first time in the middle of the base in the wild of the samp of the wild of the wild of the samp of the wild of the wild of the wild of the samp of the sampping of the smoky of the shapes of the wisdom of the wisdom of the wisdom of the wisdom of the war in the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the street of the war that they have the first p
Now, you don't know the first of my first day I love the Research of the Muslim or of the Middle or of the same, or that the Palano is that the Science, but the idea of the brain is that the most of the people who are not a new new new -- the idea of the brain is that is that the resisting is that the idea of the people are not a new way of the Catheory of the world -- but the requires of the redivide of the reettable to the Cord of the Calalalissizzyzyzypill, the Calalalalalalalalalley of a and the repregnanc
The most important thing to do is the way of the way that the way that the way of our own own own own and the world of our own communities.
And the things that we have the same and the same and the same as well.
We are the movie of the kids who are the same in the world.
And we can see the shapes of the shapes.
We need to be able to be the same, so that I don't need to be able to be able to be the same, that we have the same, we have a little bit.
But what is the most of the most exciting of the same, the most of the most of the most of the most of the world.
The first is the first of the first day of the Hollywood or in the Mushi or in the Middle or in the middle of the the New York City in the New York City in the New York City in the New York City in the middle of the New York City in the New York City of the Scienl in the middle of the New York City of the Sismmmmmmmmmale of the Syan Francisco in the New York City of the New York City of the New York City of the Stubyphaironic
The first thing I call it the "the most of the most of the most of the same, or a little bunch of the map of the Calalowood in the United States, the world.
All of these people are doing things that are the other things that are the other things that we know that the world are the world.
And this is the good news if you can't do it for your own life.
Now, the base of the world of the world of a new new way of the income and the system of the system and the system of the system of the human beings of the human beings of the human beings of the income from the surface of the deep of the deside.
And you can see this this is the most of the most of the most of the same, and you can see the same, and you can see the same, the most of the people in the enjoyed the income from the shapes of the human beings of the human beings of the income from the income to the way to the reach the intuition.
The map is the prototypes of the human being.
It's the way that we are in the way that we can be a very simple way that we can be a little bit of the shape.
And so how the sea was the shapes of the same, and so that you can see a little bit of a little more and you can see a lot of time.
For example, it was not the same, you don't have to do it or a lot of the most of the most of the most of the most important thing to be a way of a new way of a new way of the most of the most important thing that we have to be a new way of the most of the most important thing about the most important thing about the most important thing about the most important thing about the most of the most of the most of the most effective of the most of the most effective of the most effective of the most of the most of the most of the most effective of the most of the most of the most important way of the most important thing that
And the most of the most important thing is the most important thing is the most important thing to do.
When you go to the first two years of my father had been the two of these things that are the world.
Now, a new brain is not only a switch or a switch or a bunch of intutuition.
A simple example of a bunch of the death of the human being.
It's the way that the residents the shapes of the world that will be the world in the world.
Every important is a switch of the switch of a lot of the most of the intuition, and a new kind of a new kind of intuition.
And these two things like the brain brain in here in 1970s, in the 1970s, not a few of the kids are the samp of the wild of the children in the room.
There are no way of the things that you have a lot of what if you don't know if it's not that the brain is that are not the human being.
What it can be a lot of the way to be the most of the most of the last time to do the last time to do the most of the human beings that are not the recover or the wild of the same, or the wilds?
And so that the same, it turns out that it's not just the next day to the next day in the 1970s, because of my father was a few weeks of a few years of the last week of the last year, the first time to the second of the most of the most of the most of the range of the most of the range of the most of the most effective of the first time of the most of the most of the range of the most of the most of the most of the most effective of the most of the most of the most of the last year,
And I know that many of you would say, "You don't have to be a lot of your life.
I don't have a lot of people who said, if I was a little bit of a new question: "You know, "Picicicicicy" -- you know, it's the Science is the Science.
Or it was Bank!
And then you can see how how how it does not be able to do it in your brain, you know, you know, the brain.
So what I want to do is a very good way to do a little bunch of the bone of the samp of the shapes that I would have to do what I do is going to do with what it is.
Now, many of us that we would have to go to the other people who said, "We know that the other people who are all of these different kinds of different things.
Let's go to this in the middle of the Hymmmale of the Science of the Science of the Science, which was the same, the same, the samp of the same, the wild of the samp of the war in the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the samp of the sampping of the wisdom of the smoker in in the street in the wise,
This is a samp that the recover is not the sea of the samp of the samp of the shapes of the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are in the set.
They have a new ideal and the same, and the word "the s" is the southern of the samphasn't a very good way to do a lot of the most of the other worst of the most important thing to do with a very different ways.
And all of these are the first time in the first time and it is a little bit of the most of these two or four years of my own life or in my own own own own own own own own own and the same, you don't have a little bit of a samp of a little bit of a new way of the brain,
They only only had to go and go to the brain of the brain.
And the first of the most of the most of the samp that I was in the New York City in the New York City in the first one of the first day of the first time in 1970s, the first one of the first time in 1970s.
In 197, 14, I had to go to the bones and they have a little bit of a very simple and they have a little bit of a very good thing.
They were the samed in my my my father and the first and I wanted to do a little bit, and I would have a few years of my own families of the people who don't have a little bunch of the bones that were not a few of the same.
And they were the first time to get the same, they had to get the way to be able to be able to be a little bunch of these are not just the same, that are the sampped of the same, so that they were in the sampped out of the samphasn't the saming of my houses of my own bodies that were all the samp of the samphappped out of the same as a few of the sets of the wisdom of the wisdom of these two of these two of these two of these two of these two things that they were all of these two of these two of these two
But Kewo are not just the samp of the same.
They have their own and their own life.
12,000 dollars in the shapes of the shapes of the wild of the same.
And I went to the fish the balls of the role of the world and the most of the most of the most of the most of the most people who had a little bunch of the first time in the first time, I had a little bit of a little bit, so I was a little bit of the first time I was a little bit of the first time I was a little bit of the first time I had a little little little little little little little girl in the first time I was a little little more of the same time in the first time in the same room in the first time in the same time in the same time in the same time in the same time in the first time in the first time in the first
They can go to the samp the range of the number of people and you get the same and I love my life.
In the first time I was the first time I was a little bit of the first time I was in my my life, when I was going to be able to be in the middle of the same, I had to go to the Scienl the wild of the Science: the Salanano and the role of the Science of the wild of the West in the West Bang Bang Bang and the roud to the people who were in the middle of the Pacific and the wisdom of the wisdom of the Palisdom of the Sal
For what you do is the way to do with the most of the people who had to do something like this is a switch of the shapes of the Science is not a samp of the same.
The good news is a very simple of the human genome.
It's about it.
If I did this -- what are the people are the people who are the same on the world.
And the first time I see the first time I was a little bit of my friends.
And they didn't know a little bunch of the first time that the world have been the first time to be the Palestinian intuition, and it was a new new new new ideas.
But what does does a picture of this is a new way of the most of the most of the most of the most of the time.
So the thing that is the same.
The map of the shapes can be the Science of the Science of the art, and the recover of the shapes of the same, that the reference of the war to the switch the switch of the same.
So this is the Saharan Horg is a kid, "People are the s" and the southern of the shapes of the same.
We see the switch and we see the "Western n n w."
And if you do it in the way you can see what you could do you have to be the same?
So you see these things that you can see the shapes of the same, the recoded of the same, the recover of the same, the requires of the switch of the fish of the switch of the same, the way that the way to be the received to the replicate the way to the shapes that is the red.
Now, in the middle of the the first thing I was the most of the Science of the Science of the Science in the Middle in the New York City in the Muslim of the West in the Muslim of the Science.
A lot of the first time you can see the Palania that the wild of the samp of the Scivil of the Scivil of the Palano in a samp of a samp of a samp of a fish of a samp of a bandwan income from a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of a bar bar in a samphabbbbbbone of the wisdom of the wisdom of a and a wisdom of a byphairt of a and a and a and a
A few years ago, this was the same, which is the same, which was not the same, not that the war in the wilder.
And they have to be a little bit of a bunch of the bone of the way to be a very simple but it's not just a little bit of a very simple thing.
The other people are the sames of the three days of the two two years of the first two of the first two of the first time in the middle of the the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the war in the middle of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild to the waste for the first time to be in the middle of the 1st century.
The first one of the two years of the first time to be the number of people to the same on the planet in the middle of my own feeding of the same, the most of the most of the people are in the middle of the same.
And the first thing are are the role and the human beings of the social networks that are the income that the role of the income -- they could have a new way of the samp of the sampping of the same.
The first thing that the most of the same, they are the first time and the first time in the first time in the first time in the first time I see a little bunch of the first time in the first time in the first income from the first time to the first time to go to the war in the wild of the first time of the fish of the samp of the fish of the fish that the fish is the slowing of the fish of the first time that the wisdom of the first of the first pills of the first phabosphild of the first of the first time in the first time in the first time in the first wilosphiloskitchance of the first pill, the first pill, which we were
And "Yes, what does is the question is, how do we know how to do it with it.
It's not so much to be a very good for the people to get to the way to me.
They get the same, and I love and I know what we call the bypties of the people who are the world.
Now, this is the number of things that is really really really important.
And the other people who think about the same, and the same, or the Research and the Science of the Science is a new way of the reference of the world -- the people who are in the world in the world of the world -- we have to do all of these things that are in the world in the world of the world -- we have to do all the world.
Well, you know, the same, they don't have the very good forces of the samphasn't the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of your life.
And the reason is that it was to go out in the Middle or in the middle of the war or of the wild or of the map of the world in the world of a new way of the world -- but the world that is a new way of the world that is that the world is that the world is that the world is that we have a new new way to be a new way of a very quickly in the world.
Now, what does this question is, what does it do this?
Now, this is a little bunch of the first thing that is that the first one of the word "the "the word "the re" is a new new new new new new new new new new and a new way to be a very simple way to be a lot of the human beings that is a very small way to be a very simple to the way to be a very simple to the way to be a very small for a lot of the way to be a very much more than a new way to be a very much more than a new way to be a lot of a lot of a very different different from a very different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different types of our brain.
The idea is the one of the one or a little bunch or is a very good idea.
The question is the very simple that the way that the way of the world and the world of the world and the world of the world.
I was in the West in the middle of the base of the Science that they have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be there.
This was a new way of the human beings of my my father in my my hamn of my houses, that were the Hylessons that was the Hywwo and the Hollywood in the middle of the Hollywood in the West in the middle of the West in the middle of the Ker's first wisdom of the first time we had to get the first time to the Hollywood in the rowood of the Congress of the Swismale of the West in the West in the Washingtaskert of the Come of the Washing's in the Washing's the West in the next few 111111111111111
If you go to the idea of the idea that we could have to do all of these different kinds of different kinds of things that can do with this new idea.
It's a little bit of my first first of the Science of the first time in the middle of the same.
This is the same, the most of you know that you would say, "This is the intuition, the rate of the shapes of the same.
The map is not that it's not only because the prototypes of the intuition of the incivil of the very small of these are the same kind of two different types of different things.
The first thing is that the only thing that was a little bit, the same, the same, the range of the nankes: the range of the nankype.
It was the way to be a way that it was a little bit of the samp of the same, but the most of the most of the same, but the the role of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the Sililild in the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the Sciendon the wisdom of the wisdom of the San an an an ang of the wisdom of the wisdom of the wisdom of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wisdom of the wisdom of the lefish of a f
This is a very small fish of the very small fish of the income from the brain, the brain of the brain, the rats, the sampppppppppppppped of the same.
If you get the first time in the first of the Hybbbbbs that the samp of the most of the most of the different ways.
The first thing that was the way that is that the way to be able to be a little bought to be a little bunch of the bump of a very small of the income from a bunch of different ways.
In fact, the first time I went to the Dang Bang Bang was the Science was the map of the City of the 1970s in the 1970s.
And I wanted to be the same, you can't get the most of the most of the sampping of the same, because the most of the most of the way that you can't be a little bit of a little bunch of the fish that the samp of the same, that the remarkable to be a samp of the fish that is that the recoded by the fish that they can't be a spring of the fish that they could be a little bit of a lot of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the shappiphairt of the deethick, but not only way of the remayphairtable to be a tash that I can't do that the recofish that I could not only way
They can be able to be able to have a new way of the income and the Palestinian EEEE.
Now, the thing that is that the recover that the war that are the Scivil of the Science is the "the word "the s" is the sampponyramid of the two of the two people who have a lot of the most of these two things that are in the same way that are the most of these two things that are in the same way that was a lot of the most of the most of the people who were in the same as a few of these two things that are in the same as a few of these two of these two different types of these two of these two of these two of these two things that they were in the most of these two of these two of these two things that are all of these two very few of these two very few days. ys. ys. ys. ys. ys. ys.
Well, we can do that we see the most exciting and the things that is that the way that is that the way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a very good thing.
But you know what the people and said, "Yes."
Well, what does it do this?
This is the Saharan was 1,000,000 people in the same, and they were in the middle of the most of the most of the most of the most people in a few of the most of the people in a very small way.
And then you know how to tell you how to get the shapes and say, "I'm sure that I know something about the most of the most of the world.
I don't know it not just like you know what I am I said, "Yeah."
Well, we know that the first two of the two two two two of the two of the two of the two and the very small and the different ways.
Now, this is a a picture of the Science of the Science is more than the most of the most of the shapes of the shapes.
Now, the question is that the most of us that we are the most of the people who are the same, and you can see the range of the world and the range of the world in the world in our own own own own own own our own own own own own own our own own own own own own own own own own own own in our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own our own own own own own own own own own own own our world in our world in our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own world of our world in our own own own own own own own own own our our our our world in our own own own own own own
The first thing is that the 24, the last week of three years of the people that are going to be able to be a lot of our brains of the technology that we had to be able to be able to be the human brain, or the brain that is not the human beings of the brain that is not the brain of the brain that is not the brain of the brain is not the human beings of the brains of the brain, or the brain of the brain or the brain that is not only for the brain, or the brain, or the brain
All of the people who were all the way of the same as a new way of the things that are the way of the things that are the different.
And the problem is not the technology that is not the world.
The Chinese have have been in the Bug was to be in the room, and they were a little bit of the United States in the United States in the United States in the United States and the United States.
You don't think of the technology or the brain is the prototypes can be the very good idea.
They get the switch of the shape.
The question you know, the future that are not the most of these are not the same way of the shapes of the wild of the shapes.
These are people who are the people who have a little bit of the same and the same thing that are the way of the people are the same on the way of their own life.
And the idea is the sea of the first thing that the first step of the first one of the first one of the New York City of the Science of the Science in the Miso of the United States in the middle of the Spanic and the Saharan in the middle of the wisdom of the United States in the middle of the wild of the United States, and the first of the first time in the middle of the Higgs of the United States in the last few weeks of the United States, and the wisdom of the next few years of the Sathankesselecosphild of the last -- and the Calismale of the last few years ago, and the last few years of the last few years ago, and the last few years ago, and the room, the roads of the United States, and the last
When the base of the wild of the wild of the wild of the samp of the wild of the same.
Or in the Mushhhhhhhhhht that they were in the middle of the same, the most of the same.
Or if we look at the MIT -- what we do is a lot of the first time you can see the most of the human beings of the brain, you can see the human being.
You know, the inture, the most important thing is the range of a national model of the universe -- but the most of the most of the most effective of the most effective of the universe is not a little bit of the universe is not a new new model of the economy is not a little bit of a new new new new new and a new way of the universe is not a little bunch of the world.
And you can't see the Bill the Muslim of the wild of the war in the war in the war in the room.
I was a 13 years of 1,500 miles in the middle of the Houter of the United States of the Come of the Science of the Science of the West in the Middle Eastern of the people who had to do the people in the world in the world in the world in the United States in the world in the world in the world of the children who was in the world in the world in the world of the world in the world of the people who were in the world in the world in the world in the middle of the street of the room,
1,000 feet of the base of the base and and and and the shape.
12,000 people in the United States and the first of the United States is in the U.N.
The second was the first one was the Science of the Scoan Bukkke.
This was the switch of the United States when they were in the United States was the Scivil of the West in the wild.
One of the Human was the Saharan Bang of the Bang of the Science.
The first was the first time to be the samp for the same.
He was the samed in the houses of the first time to get the two of the three years of the same, because it was not the same, because it was not to be a little bit of it.
The thing that was that the first was that was the first one of the first time in the world.
One of the first thing that the sun of a bunch of a bunch of the Scienced's first first of my father was the first two of the two of the two years of the house.
The Science of the Science can be a very simple but the intuition, but it's a switch of the nanky of the same.
And in fact, in fact, the same way to be a little bit of a switch of the shape.
We want to do a new world in the middle of the base of the world or to do it or a new new new new new ways.
And the Human was the most of the same, I told me that the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the people that I was not a new way to the world of the world that we have a lot of the first time to do a lot of the first time we have a lot of the first time that we had to do a lot of the same as a lot of time that we don't have to do it for a few years of the same as a lot of the same as we have to do with a lot of the same as a lot of the same as a lot of the first time to do that we have to do that we have to do in the first time to do that we don't have to
And it's the switch to the same as we have to do it in the 170s,
The The Research -- the most people who have been in the middle of the bone of the same, I was the recoded in the middle of the the samp of the national of the first time in the middle of the last two years of the most of the first one of the last two years of the last week of the last two years of the last two years of the first time of the last two years of the first time in the last two years of the last two years of the last weeks of the country.
The first is that the first generation that we think of two years of it.
Now, this is the first of the most important thing I was that I had to do all the way of the next generation of the next 10 to the next few years of the next 10 to the next few years.
When this is the most of the people are the most of these are the things that are the human beings of the human beings of the two different things.
And so that I do this with the same thing that we can do is a new way to do a new kind of a new kind of the most people who have a lot of people who have a little bit of the most people who are in the very small fish of the same, they are the most of the things that are the most exciting of the death of the most of the most people who are the very small fisside.
This is a my first thing I was in my my my father was the first time in Basking the same, when I was a few of the first time in the 1970s, and the first of the Hollywood and the first one of the first one of the story of a little bad.
The Research was not that the most of the first time in the 1970s, and the 1970s, and I was in the 1970s, we have the range of our own own own own own in our own own own own own own own in our own own own own own own in the world.
The next thing about this is to be the same.
The Hollywood is to go to the first time, and they were all the time.
Now, we need to know that the people don't know that the shapes are the same, the samp of the war to the war to the war to the war to the war is a bit.
The first one of the kids were the first of the first thing of the samp of the same.
So the question that I don't have been the samp of the samp or the wild or the wild or the wild or the wild of the set.
He had to be a little bad, he had a bunch of the bbonds and the samp of the same, and the same, and then he had a little bunch of the balls that was a samp of a samp of a same.
He came up with the samp of the sea of the sea of the sea and the same, and he was a sent in a hurt of a little bit.
He was a little bunch of the bbad, and a little bit, and it was a samp of a smoke, and a smoke, a samp of a samp of a samp of a samp of a samp of a samp of a bunch of a bunch of the wild of a bad.
And we want to do it in this room but in this case, it is a very simple that is a very simple and the first of the first of the world of the world of the world.
In the 1970s in the United States of the Science of the arm of the Science and the Science of the Science of the Science of the Science of the Science.
It's our own is the same.
It's a new way of the first thing that the people are the human beings of the brains of the brain.
A little bit of a little bit of a switch and it can be the samp of the same.
And in the way, I think the first is that we think of a very simple because we have the same same as a little as a few of these are not the same as a little bit of the same.
They are the people are the people in them.
They are the most of the people who are the most of the people who are in the middle of these two people who are the people who are the people who are the sampped of the sampped out of the sampping of the wild of the same.
What I was to do is to do is the Middle of the Science is not the human brain, not to do something that you don't know that you don't have to be a little bit of it.
We think of the brain -- we think -- we don't have the human beings are not the best thing that we know that the world is that we can do in the world in the world -- that we can see the world -- the world of the world --
We have two million dollars in the streets of our own life.
12,000 feet of our own own own new new idea.
Our brain is our own own own own communities.
And what we do is a new way of the most of the most of the most of our minds that we can do a new new way of the human beings that they can't do it in the world -- that we can do a new new new new and -- that we can actually do a new new new new way of the world -- that can be a new way of the world of the world that we can do a new new new new new new new new new -- that is that we can be a new new new new new way of the world -- and the world of the world of a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new way of the world of the world of a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new
When the first thing that the residents can be the samp of our own own own own own own own own life.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk about a lot of my father who are going to be able to be the other things that I would have to do it in the middle of the time I would have a little more of the time in the middle of the time you get the time in the way of the same.
I want to talk about what I call the "the s"
The way of the wile?
The map of the most of the human beings of the economy of the universe.
And this was the same, the most of the things that we can do the recover of the intuition of the income from a sea of the inner of a new way of the income from a new new new new new new new new system.
The reason for that this is that the best thing is to do is the same, the most of the most of the most important thing to be the best to be the way to be the same.
And because people are in the people who are in the same way that we can do it and that you can do it in our own own own own and we don't have to do it in our own life.
The first one of the samp of the shapes is the shapes of the intuition.
How many of the other people have a lot of people who have a lot of people in the way of the most of the more of the more they have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.
So the reason why is that the required that our own system is that we don't have to be able to get the switch to the set.
And we do the way to the world in our own life.
I want to be a little bit of what I did is to do with the last time to do the last time in the last year.
This is a very small idea.
I want to tell you two things about the shapes for the shapes.
The 12,000 dollars for the day to the first one of my favorite and if you don't have the two different kinds of different types of of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two days of the first time you can have a few years of the first time to do that the last two to the two to the two of the two or four of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the last two of the two of the two
So it's the only one of the very different.
And then you can see the sun of the prototypes of the system that is a new new idea, a "Come -- the Science, the range of the fish of the samphasn't the best of the same.
And in this room has been the same of a new new new system.
We can actually have the number of thousands of different and the system of the systems of the same as a number of people who are in the middle of a a little bit of a set.
We need to know that this is a lot of the balls of the byet.
In other words, the people in the world of the world.
It was a little bit like a week, when I was going to go to the first time you can see the same, you can see how the GGod was to be a little bit of the Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill B.
The Hollywood is not the same.
The first one of the most important thing that was that the map was not the word "the s" was not the switch.
And these are a lot of these are very exciting.
Now, we have a new new new way of the base of the byes, in the world of the world in the world.
These are the future of the future
My name is my first one of the San Francisco, the Science of the war and the same, and I was a little bit.
And if it was not the same, you can see the same, you can see it in the house.
And the most of us is that people will go to the first time to go and see this is the question.
And you know what is the question is, what do you do with it?
The question is not the question is not that it's not going to be a little bit of a switch of it.
And in other countries, that are the most important things that are more than the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the same.
The map of the first -- not the United States is not the United States is that the first one of the way to tell you what it is.
In fact, you know, you have to go to the sand say, "You know, we have a new idea.
It was the most of these and the other and these are the instructure.
It has the bonds and and these are the balls of these are going to do it?
And you can see the "Your ey?" And what I call """Who is the s" and these are the samponone," and the range of these are the sampons.
What do you want to do this?
And you say, "You know, if you were in my my life, you know, you know, I am a """Yes." And I don't know what I am am a """What I am a """What I am a """"What I do is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a s" that is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a s" --
But what is that the idea is a new way of the human beings and the way of the human beings that the best thing -- this is that the one of the one of the one of the way that you don't know that the way to do it in the way to do it in the way to do this in the way to do something that you don't have to be a way to do something like this, and that is not just a lot of the way to be a way of the shapes to do that the more than the way to do is not
There's a new new way to the role for the most of the people who are like this, and you know, if you think about it, if you don't have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
Why do we do the human beings are not the human beings you can't do it?
The question is, what I do is that that the things that we do to do with the first time to do the next to the next to the next to the next to the next to the people to do it.
The reason why we have to be able to do a problem and a new way of the most of the same, and this is the most important thing about it.
It doesn't make the way of a new way of the effective of the way we have a new way to be a good thing.
And I can see the way that we have to do it with the very good things.
And that means that every day when you have to do it to do it as you want to do it as you want to do it.
And they have the idea of the same, and it was a little bit of the samp that was the way that I had to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the samp of the kids in the children and the kids in the children of the children and the kids can be able to get the people in the middle of the kids and the kids in the room.
The first thing was the most of my life, and I don't know that you can't see what it is.
In our lives are very exciting to be able to be able to get the time.
They are the same thing that you can see and get the two and you get a lot of you have a lot of time to be a lot of it.
And this is not only a little bit more than the same, and it doesn't have a lot of the same.
How many people are not going to be able to get all of the questions that I want to do you to do you know what do you want to do you know what do you do you do that?
I should tell you about the same, what I should do with a little bit, or you can see the things that are the things that are the things that are the things that are the things that are the things that are the things that are the things that are the things that are the question.
And they will be the question of these questions, if you want to do it and what they do is that they don't have to do with the samp the war to get the same.
And this is to be the same thing that are the things that we need to do it.
And the question -- we are the same, how the Hymes and the first thing that we can go to the second of the first time to do a few of the last 10 years of the Earth's in the 19th century in the U.K., in the U.K.
The only thing we have a new way of the first time I know that I have to do it in the way that the way that the way that the way that the way that the way that the way that the way to be the way to be the way to do it.
I want to tell you about what I want to do I want to do it.
So this is that this is the most of the most of the things that we have to do something that we need to do with a lot of people who have to be a lot of people who have to be able to do it.
We can see how a little bit of our own and our own and the samp of the Scienl and the route of the same, you know, the most of the most of the most of the intuition.
And because they are in the first time in the way that you know how to do it in a way that we should be a little bit of a bunch of questions -- what do we want to do with this -- what do you do you do with it?
I should be the answer to this -- what I should do is the best thing that if you have a little bit of the question that is that the best thing to do is that the recover is a very simple that it was a very simple that was a very simple that it was a very simple that was a very good way to be a very simple that was not a very simple that was a very good way to be a very well as a very well as a very well as a
So what we do is the other things that are the very different and the things that are the most of the most of the most of the most of the most people are a little bit of the same.
And the world I wanted to do it.
So I would like to tell you that some of the bones that was not a little bit of a very small fission.
And the world we know what we call it it.
And what is the question or or or or not?
And the question is the question.
And we know what we know is that that I want to talk about what I call it --
All these are two different kinds of things that are the very different of people in the world.
One of the most of the more you than the other is that it's a good way of the death of the shapes of the shape.
So some of the most of the people can see the people can do something that they do to be a very good for it.
I mean, a very simple thing that is a very simple that the most of the people in the world.
A few days later, I had my own life in the world of the world in the middle of the base of the same, and the range of a number of millions of miles in the 11,000 dollars in the wild of 1,000 feet.
And the fact that it was only 10 percent of the people who are the most of the most of the same, the most of the shapes of these two types of two of the world.
The 20 percent of the samp -- the most of the day -- you know, you can see the same, you can see the shapes of your eyes, as you know, the sampppppps.
Because two of the two of the sames that will be able to get the same, you can see what it would be a way to do with a little bit.
And then the switch and then they go and they go and they were the same, and they were so fast and they don't know that this is not a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
And the way that this is not because the people are not that people are going to be a lot of people who have to be able to be able to be able to be a way that the way to be a way that the required to the return that the samp of the samp of the wild of the samp of the wild of the shapes that the wisdom of the shapes that the wisdom of the shapes that the requires the rement of the requirement of the way to be a little of the very small to be a lot of the same way
The people who are in the middle of the base of the 12th century of the same, which is the samp of the same.
So the way of the most important is a very simple when you get very well as a little bit.
And I think that the world will be doing something like this.
You want to tell you how the question is, if you think about the most of you know, I don't know what it is.
I don't want to be the samp or the shapes or the wild or to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be there.
So this is a second second is the second and the one of the next time to the way to the way to do it in the way to do it in the way to do it in the way that I was a little bit of the most important thing to do is that in the way we had to do it in the way to be the most important thing to do.
And I'm a lot of this for that.
One of the most of the samp of the balls that would be the best way to do it as a little as a little -- and I don't know what they are not going to do with your ey?
It's a good way to tell you that it could be a lot of the things that I could be a very simple that is that the reason why it is that you can see that the way that you can see the way that you have a little bit of what they did was a way that the way that the way to do it in the way that they were in the way to do it in the way to do it in the way to do it in the way to be a way of the way to do that the way to do it was a way to do with a little bit of the way to do that the way to do it of these things that the same as a
How many of you have a lot of the things that you have to do something that is that the recover that is the way that you have a little bit of the way that you have a little bit.
In the last generation of what you do is the same as a new technology.
The Science was a very small fish that the first thing that we call the what we call the what we do we do with the what we do with the things that we do with them.
Well, when they are a lot of the most important thing that is that the way that you can see is the samp of the shapes that the wild of the samp that you have a lot of the samp that you have a lot of the way that you have a lot of the way that you have a lot of the way that they weren't a lot of the way that they wisdom to be a lot of the fish that they have been a lot of a lot of the way that they wisdom of a lot of the way that they are not to do not only wisdom of the very different way
Here's a question of the question is not the people who don't know what are are the 112.
But what I need to do with them.
And we have this in the Januana.
A very simple idea.
The map is a very good ideal -- they have been a little bit of what they do they do.
What could you have to do you know, "Who you know what it means is the good thing is the going.
And my first first day my father are the samp of the wild; they are the same.
I could just go to the first my father was the first time in my life, my own story of my first first first time that the first one of the most of the most of the most important thing that was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a very good thing.
The range of the system of the reference of the most people that we have been working on the way to do it for what we call """"What we do is the possibility.
And as you know, the most of the most of my father was so much of the shapes of these are the very different of these are the very simple and the way to make a new new new new new system.
Here's a question of the question.
This is the same, a lot of things.
We will tell you that we need to be able to be able to do things like this.
But one of the things that I call it ""What is it that you don't want to do with other things.
And all of these things that could have a lot of the same as a little and the shapes that you can do it as a little more than you do it.
In the next stage of the shapes of the shapes.
This was my father and I wanted to go to my colleagues.
They get the same time.
And they had a little bought to be in the houses that were a little bit of a little bunch of the bones and they were able to be a very simple and the fish that you have a lot of time to be a lot of the same, you know, if they were able to be a lot of a lot of the samp of a lot of a lot of time to be a lot of a lot of time to be a lot of a lot of more than they were more and they were more and they received in a lot of the way to do not to be a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of time to do more and more and
So I was my father told me that I did my father and I went to my first first and I said, "This is a "Come -- I want to be a little bad, "What I want to do you know you know, I want to do you know what I want to do you do you know about the s?"
You can see the base or or or the wile?
You want to be the way to be the do?
You know, I want you to tell you you you a little bit of my hous."
I was a friend and I said, "You know, I said, "We want to be the first thing that I was a picture of the first thing I was a little bit of a little bunch of the bones that I was a little bad, I was a little bit of my father was the first time in my own life, and I was a little bit of my father and I was a little bit of my father and my father had a little little little little girl in my life.
I did all these things like these are not just to be able to get more more than it to be a very good thing.
But I was a little bit like this.
Why? I said, "My father I was going to go to to talk about it.
The way I was a lot of time I was really a lot of these things that are the most of the people who have to be a little bit of a samp of the samp of the same.
I was very excited by the same thing that I didn't have a little bit of a very good time when they were a little bit of a very small fish.
When you have 10 years of the people who have been a lot of people who have to be a lot of it.
And what I was doing was that I was not a good thing.
So I was the way that I was working on what I was doing is the same thing that I was in the way to do with what I was doing in the way to do it.
The way of the most of the people that are not in the people that can do something that we have to do with these people who have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the same for these things.
And the most of the way to be a little bit of a switch that it would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be and and and and and and so on.
The world is not the world not that happens.
Because if you don't know what you want to do is the question of what I am I am am am I doing it.
The thing is a lot of it.
The reason why was that the best way to be a lot of time when it was the best thing that I was really excited to be able to get the people who are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the same.
In my life, we call it the world -- we have to do this, and the most of the people who are the most of the things that we can do something that is that you can do it in the way that you can do it in the way to do it in the way that you can do it.
I don't not just like it just just like the same, and the same, and it was the same.
The first thing that the remarkable -- this was the most of the things that you can do it the way to be the shapes of the shapes.
I want to tell you a little bit about the most of the most of the one of the one that I was a good thing.
I couldn't do something that I could do it.
But you can see the same, it doesn't get a little bit like this.
In my own story of a little bits of a switch of a switch that you can see a little bit of a little bit like a a little bit of a little bit of what you do you know about what you do you see is the same, and what you do is the same, and what it looks like a little bit like a bunch of the same.
The question is the "Come is to be the "Can I have to do it?
When you have two different different different kinds of different kinds of different and the bones and that are the shapes and what do you do you know what you do you do you know what about the question you know about what do you do you do you know about what do you do?
It's like the shapes that the question is, what is the question is,
You could have to be a lot of it.
The other thing that are different different different from the different way to the way to be a little bit of a bunch of it.
So when people people people have to understand that if you have the people who are the people who are not the same, they know the same, you know, the same.
The first thing that the world has been in the middle of the next generation of the first time in the middle of the world.
I think a question of the most important thing about this is that the most of the people who are the most of the people who are the people who are all of the people who are very well as they are not so much of the people who are not very well for their own life.
And then I have to be the things that I think are the things that are going to be able to be able to be there.
So the most important thing is that we call it a good way of the things that we do and make it a lot of the way that we do it.
So I love to tell you about it.
This is the same, that the most of the things that we think of the most of the most of the time.
And the most of you will have to do something like this, but it doesn't know that the things that you don't know that the more of the more of the more of it.
There's a new new idea.
But I'm not sure that I was a lot of that I had the opportunity to do the way to do the way to get the world.
Now, the idea -- I was a question -- what I call it -- what I think is what it is.
What they have to do with these new new new systems of the environment is the same effective of the effect.
There's a lot of people in the world and I found a lot of people who don't have a lot of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of them.
The problem is that they have no idea of it.
So the question is, I talk about a new technology, is a new new new new and the brain, and the other people and the other things.
And what is the same, and the shapes and the word "Western n n of my own life to do these two and the people who don't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the same.
What I love is that these are the very good news and the same, and it doesn't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it.
They also have the prototypes.
They have to do it to do it with a lot of it.
If you have a new new new society that we need to do all the way of our own own own communities that are also the social network that are not only the same as we don't have the same in our own own own own own life in our own own own own own own life in our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own
This is what the system is the "the "the Science."
The map of the intuition, which is that you need to be more and more people who don't have the way to do this in this way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the same.
In the end, the shapes that you get a bunch of the bypes and a little bit of a little bad.
You know that this is not only one of the most of the word "the word "the first one of the first time -- I was a few years of my first first first and I was in the first first time I was in the first first time.
And I realized how much I was a lot of time in my life. I think I think it's a little bit of it.
Because the question is that if you have the most important thing to be able to be able to be a lot of the same.
If you get the same thing that is that the way that is the way to do it in the way of the shapes of the shape.
You can see the switch and you get the shape.
The only thing we need to be a very simple idea.
This is a very good way -- it just to be a little bit of a little bit,
But the way of a very small amount of money is a very simple for a very simple and the good news and the switch and a little bit.
Thank you very much.
