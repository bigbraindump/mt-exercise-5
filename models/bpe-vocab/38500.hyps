And I went to the next two slides to demonstrate that the second quote polar polar that in the last three million years of the last three million years was the size of the last 30-year year march was small, a small amount of march in the march of 40 percent of the size of the march of the magnitude of a number of positive dirty percent of the whole rate of the whole
But this is what the serious issue of this particular particular issue because it doesn't look at the guarantes.
The polar polar is, in a way, the heart of the global system that is global climate system.
It goes back and the wider and contract.
The next slide that I'm going to show you a very quickly on what happened in the last 25 years.
The peak pants is married.
As you can see the blue of blue catch.
This is the anuity of the year for the time of the woods.
And it was in the morning.
Asad guess the guys, with a few years or more than you can see that it's almost like it's almost like the sangles of a body.
In 25 years of this has come from this to this one.
This is a problem because the inquire of the desire of the fish, the gun of the ocean.
where it's a massive amount of carbon carbon quantitself, when it comes to the left, is transformed in metal catches in metal catches of micro-organisms.
Compartial pollution in the quarters in the world of the world can be able to take this extreme if we go to this extreme if we go to this point in the extreme way that we get this point.
Of course in certain lacks in the Alaska metal disease is in the water is the water southern of water.
The prophesion Katey Walter at the University of Alaska little tereward with another teams at another teams at the bottom.
Wow. Wow. WWhow. The question is OK if we are going to be then.
And a reason is that enormous word "hurdswells in the north Groenland.
This is a rats that were all over the year.
But the volumes are much bigger as well.
This is the Kangerlerussuade Groenland.
If you want to know how the creation of the big sea levels of the sample from the sea is where it gets to the big place.
These debate very quickly.
And at the other end of the plant, Antarctica of the planet.
The last time the people who reported that the continent are reported as the continent of the Antarctica is negative of the Antarctica of insult on the edge of the island of the island is submarine submarine submarine --
This is the equal levels of the size of the sea level.
In Himalaya, the third of the brilliant of the brilliant of the new vision, which was in the same.
40 percent of the people get half of the world obsessed out of the water in the water water in these topirs.
And this guided is the source of the water spring water for this year.
The places have grown up.
But when it were, so that it is going to be a lot of the water water and the water water
In California was a 40-percent scarding the sea street in Sierra Sierra.
This is the water samples of water.
And predictions, as you read it, as you are serious
And the world has led to a dramatic creation of the incentidier of incentives of incenties.
And disasters on the world grew up with an extraordinary rate rate and fall of the precedence.
four times more of the last 30 years of the 75 years of those 75 years of the 75-year of the 75-year
This is an absolutely unsustainable model of nevertheless.
If you look in context in context you can see what happens.
In the last five years I added 70-year dioxide dioxide every 240-year dioxide every day in the ocean.
Look at the same time of the Pacific area of the America, and every part of the Indian where the subcontinent of Indian where the subcontinent of the ocean in the ocean.
The biggest because the only only only only global warming global warming of deforestation of the retail of the fossil fuels.
The Petrole is a problem and the cars is the most serious book.
The United States is one of the two great emitties.
And the proposition was to build more factors for good cars.
But we start a change all of the change.
And here are the ones who anulated in the last few years with an alternative proposition.
There is a lot of the political fight in our country.
And the carbon industry and oil industry spent a hundred billion dollars in the last year for the last year quenenendarkness.
and the good promote what is a roron.
This picture of something.
In the Cracial Cracial French in Tennesium of the cartoon the cartoon was imprasted.
You've probably seen the stars of stirs.
This is, all the print of the print of the Sintintent in America in the presence of the Cracial Cracial Cracial Spanism.
One of the reclames of the good news, about the Cracial Cracial Cracial was this.
Video: Wow, â™« Frosy, it's a happy shape, is a happy and you see the same.
He's from abundance, here in America, and helping to help the economy.
Froy, the man with good book, it becomes a while, becomes more so.
It's available and adorable and workers are assumptions of the job.
Al Gore: This is the great source of Virginia in Virginia.
The biggest mography on the mostly of Massey Coal Cal.
Video: Don Blankenn: I want to be clear the Pelosi Pelosi Pelosi Reihabar is not about what I talk about.
Al Gore: So this is the Alic Protection has launched the next campaign launched.
This is one of them, a part of them in one of them.
Video: Actor: Hunt: We see the climate change as a very serious threat for our business.
That our main the main is to spend a lot of money for the public forces that to help us show us to help and complicated the real thing about the car.
The real thing is that the cars is not dirty carry.
We think it's curved -- and I migrate and best.
So you won't ingrijors.
Lake this is where we do.
Video: The Carch: Carch: Carkeepers about him.
So let's make a tube to do a tube of this town of the goal of the good coal.
We, y! Masinaria is kind of noise.
But this is the sound of the technology of the good news.
And as the book are the main is one of the main the world of global inquiring technology to the whole technology of the coal.
Look at the same time is the technology of the things that are going to be a curved.
Al Gore: In the alternative spark's positive economic challenge and the problem of the economics and the problem of nationality.
Video: Narrator: His in the crisis, economies, economy;
The answer that they lay all the way to the whole addiction of the carbon combuster on the basis of the mom and oil.
But we have a new solution to the notion of the notion of the incurious rate.
You can transform America with 100 percent rate in 10 years ago.
A plan to put America in the way to get the whole thing and help us stop signs and help us to make the global quirlware to the global quirlware to the global quirlware to the global quirlware and then making the whole thing to do to the whole thing to do is that the whole thing to do to the whole thing to do is make us at the end of making the world the way to make the end of the world
And then in the end, a solution that is a big solution to help us solve the problems.
You get America. You get America.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: Narrator: It's about the re-energizing.
One of the fastest way to inlorious commandment of the oldest combustils that we killed our plane of Barbbon is here -- the Life is here. Vantic, a new remote reduction of energy.
Barbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbing down.
Narrator: Rone; it's time for action.
Al Gore: There is an old old proversion that says, "If you want to go fast, you go down the same.
If you want to get away from it, you go away.
We need to get away from it, quickly.
Thank you very much.
TED year at TED I did a TED LHC.
And I promised to give you a data about how this device.
So here for the people who were not here for those who hasn't been here, LHC is intified -- Cumphilosphorus or 27 kilometers or is to recreate the consistent of a billion people in less than a fraction of a billion people on the universe -- the panel -- the fear of a billion times a second.
It's extremely unknown to be this.
This is the machine under the Geneva.
We do the photographs of these minds "Big Bangs" in the inside of the decades.
I work on this is called the ATLS detector's -- Lungymon 22 meters of 22 meters of a picture of ATLS picture of ATLS picture detector ATLSS imagery in construction of the ALS proport.
On the 10 years I went to the last year I started the first time.
And this picture was a ATLALATLASSSA
It caused a great celebration in the room.
It's a picture of the first main particle that has been able to forget around the whole LHC, cryption system is in LHC deliberately free, and it is a number of detector.
In other words, when I saw that picture 10 I knew that picture 10 of the machine is a huge successful of functioning, which is a huge successful successful successes.
I don't know if that was the biggest poisons, or that, when someone went to the Google and see that the first page page on the same way.
It means that we did an cultural impact on the langa habit.
And after about a week I had a problem with the machine, which actually had to do these days, that actually had to do with the aura of gold.
Those are some of the flower of the flaw of the motor power of the massive power of the maximum of the power of the power of the power of the maximum of the power of a 3,000 redundant powers of the flower of the flowers of the motor of the flower of the flaw of the motor of the motor of the motor is that the machine is that the devices of the massive power of the massive.
Now, engineers in the engineers look at these days, and I said, "You can't transport the ancient of the engineering of the wall."
But I can do this because when they're at the temperatures are called the superconductive temperature.
So as a 271 degree of the sea level, the spot of the stepping of the stepping of the cured.
At one of the layers of the people in LHC, was a LHC, was a defer of factorians.
So that firm was sent a little bit of the 13 thousand the 13 of the resisted electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressible that those magnets are spending over 20 tons of tall, they have about 30 cycle.
So we deteriorated about 50 magnetic magnetic math.
We had to take the outside, what we did and do it.
I reconvicted on the top, I repair and repair.
And now we take a magnets and then in the subteran.
And at the end of the March March March Take the LHC will be like new ways.
We're going to start again, and we get this and we get this data in a whole data in a research or the continuing research to find out the relationships,
Now, of course, those of a way, those accidence accident about the important scientists and engineering the importance of engineering and engineering it to break down the way.
I think that it is that it is so difficult to be the fact that we have young inalso, this is the important thing to the HC.
I'm going to lose the words of a man scientist a British scientist, Humphrey Davy, which, I think that the applications of protected the decreators of the protection of the human progress is not more dangerous progress for human minds for our minds of human minds are finding to our minds are finding footprints in our mind, and that we are not being performed in our fun and the world are find."
Thank you.
I would start with the rugal reminded of a childhood when you play with your customers.
And as you invent them to get them and get them and get them and get them to get them and get them to understand how to deal with the smart and manipulation and manipulation of the spaces.
The spot of the spot of how we understand a lot of how we understand a lot of the world in the inconclusion.
So as a matter of fact, as the IT inspired by this kind of reported our physical interview with our physical objects -- my impression, my physical consultant and my color Ralthy Pattiger -- I started to get a computer, whose if we use a computer, whose if we can use a computer, which, if we can use a computer to be funny and a tell, whose if we could be eat a very few guess if we could be able to get out of the whole bunch of information, and we could be able to the whole bunch of information, and we can be able to the whole bunch of this uniqualone of this untaillustrategic account with a computers to the whole bunch of this unununununtailiens of this ununununununununtomorrumpymale
We think how do we want to now?
And the question was so fascinating that we were able to research on the question of building Stagges.
In short, a Siftable is a computer interactive computer interact a biscket of a bisckiscups.
They can be manufacturing, they can be manufacturing the way they can perceive the challenge of one another, and a radio of a wireless of the wires.
The most important is that they're palpabled, so you can just play the game, you can just take it to the game.
And Sif, the example of a new ecosystem of an instrument of digital manipulation of digital manipulation.
And the magic of what these instruments are becoming more palpables of their missions of each other, and the consistent of our nutritional nutractive and funny new styles.
I'm going to start with simple examples.
This Sifested is configuring out the video, and if you include it is a way that the movie, if you include it in the other part, it is the other part,
These portraits are constellations of each other's one of the other things that are the other portraits of the portraits of the portraits of the portraits are the interactive of the interruption are constellations of the interactions are constellations of each other.
So if I put them one langle the langle of the other, they become interesting.
If they're inconclusion, they will see and this is a little bit confused.
They can also feel missance and inclining.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of interactions of the interaction is that we can use the gestablished the data, like we were to manipulate the color of how we were a liquid liquid in a liquid liquid liquid on the liquid involved in a liquid involves of interactions of the way we can use the whole best.
In this case, we have three Sifbattles that the wants and they can use them to use the task in the center of the center where they will ample the center of the center of the center of the center of the one --
If I get too much, we can get a little bit of the woods.
There is also interesting possibilities for education, how they are playing games and logical players and logical things we want to try to try to try to figure out the outcome of the possibility to see the outcome of the immediate results.
So here I -- this is a Fibonacidates that they do with a simple thing.
So here we have a game game game of the words, a kind of combination of the Scrabs and Boggles.
So basically in every single one letter is a letter in the Sifestablished each Sif, and to formed, they are very verified with a dictionary.
And then after a 30 seconds of the letters are residents, and you have a new set of letters and we can be able to incaught and we can get innocent in the end.
Thank you.
These are the kids who came to the Media Labor the Media, and I returned to try and figure out a material.
They liked them to crazy.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of applies of this kind of thing is that you don't have to give people a lot of people in structures.
All you have to say is "F: "Find the word," and they know exactly what to do.
There's another people who are looking at them.
This is the most tanker testing in our right right right right here.
It turns out everything everything he wanted to do was to do was a Sifttable to do that.
So for him were just cups.
This is a great animal animal animal animal is an interactive.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who invent language.
And this is Felix.
He can introduce new characters, just the sample from the Siwitches that the characters.
This is introducing the soars.
Video: Sorkitation.
David Merrill: He introduced a stage in the scene.
Video: The Tractor the portrait of the portrait of the portrayl.
Very of this is you.
And when Sifttable and ask, it comes to one one can make the person's person's can interact -- Video: Ham!
DM: It creances his narrative.
Video: H!
DM: It's a open story with open, and he decided, and he decides how it is going to be deeply sell.
Video: Sboard, the pymnis!
DM: The last example that I have time to show you today is a piece of creative and interpreted music that we built the museums that we built the role of sounds like the role and all baggas and all bread.
Each one of these has four different variations that you want to use it.
And you can get the sound that you can get assemble the time you can do.
Sifs the sound of the sounds of sounds a switch Sweet Stagger Stttable of successful areas.
There is some effects you can control control and you can see the reverberative.
You can see a certain sound and then you include it for a certain sounds.
The general effects like the general effects and the volume that is applied to see the intrees of the same.
Video: DM: I start with a rhythm in the second Switzerlands in a serious and we were arriving in a serious one.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: DM: I add a few dangerous time.
Video: DM: And I'm now I'm going to add the top, to control the whole side effect.
Video: DM: I can get the inclining sequence in the inclining in a part or another.
Video: I'm going to say that the band the band the band for more expensive.
Video: DM: They can do the sequence while the quantita.
So you don't have to do the plant, can improvise, prepare or short too.
Now, the end of the killer killing the century of using the Street Street Street Street Mism,
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is the creation of new interfaces that are actually working better with how we get better with our brain.
And today, I had time to show you a coordinate of this new space-design, and some of the possibility that we try to get out of the lab.
The light that I wish you retina is that we are at the new general interview of the digital interruption with the digital interruption in our world of the rule of our rules in our world after our rules.
Thank you very much.
And these gun is to discussion.
I'm writing.
He written is my teaching, but it is, of course, more than that.
It's all my mom loads and fascinating.
And I don't think that this is to change that anybody ever do.
But this is what it was called a weird in my life and cared in my career and a career who determined me to remain the whole thing to work.
And the strange thing is that I wrote this book, this is called Mananca, the Roages, Rageste," which is the Roage," which is unlike my career in the world for a certain reasoning for a whose of reasons, and it became this important international book.
The result is that anywhere in the way now, people treat me now, people treat the time as a convicted.
Serios -- the convicted; it's convicted!
So for example, the ingririjors, "You don't have your fingers" -- you don't have your performance as a lot of performance as you can be able to do that?
You don't have your whole life as you will continue to write your life that life is going to make a lot more cool to get the world on the world that ever do this?"
It's very linlining.
But it was even more than I remember if I didn't remember everything you could go to 20 years ago, when I was a teenagers -- I want to become written by the same type -- I want to become writing, I lovely on the same Africa's basic reaction to a kind of Africa's basic reaction as a Africa's basic reaction to the same Africa's basket.
And people would say, "Don't you want to have no longer your succee?"
Don't you know that humility will be killed to kill you?
Don't you think that the fear of your life in this field and nothing will be here and nothing will be here and not going to get a dream of a dream of a dreaming of the eye of the green flower?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the answer -- the answer to all those questions is """Yes."
Yes, you get the theme is the theme of all of those things.
And I always did.
And you get the theme is that many other things that people who are not able to do not encounter them.
As an example of the great algorithms that are crucial.
But when it's writing the thing I was writing and the last thing I was like, "Where is "why?"
Is it a rational?
It's logic to anybody to this work that they feel like that they feel like that they were destroying on this Pamantantantly.
And what is the specific initiatives that looks like we don't really do it in the support of a kind of mental mental mental health in a way that other teachers don't do it?
My father was an engineer chemist and I don't remember that in the 40 years of you have a chemical engineering to the chemical engineering to be asked, if anybody is a chemist.
It wasn't happened -- John, how does the block in the engineering chemics?
It just doesn't happen to be happening.
But as we are certains, engineers as many group as a group of the chemicals to reputation in the century to be alcoholes.
We write that we are kind of reputation, and not just writers, but not just writers, but the artists, it looks like this is reputation to be strongly strong.
And all we have done is to look at the numbers of the 21st century master in the 20th century, which have been died by the young maybe, who died by your own liman.
And even that is not that they did not have been working on your own destruction of your own lives.
Norman Mailer, even before I get the last time he said, "Every last book, he said, "Every careful."
A great great great great thing about your life works.
But they don't click when I hear anybody when I hear that I heard this is because I heard this kind of things that we have absorbed and I have an absorbed and suffering and suffering and suffering and suffering and suffering and the artwork is going to go to a end up in the suit will always take a sense of suffering that the creative.
And the question I want to add all of this is this here today is you all of the impacts with this idea?
You are comfortable with it -- because as as as the library of the library of the library of the hypothese.
I think it's stop.
And I also think it's dangerous and I didn't want to see it in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage to the great artist's going to be able to track the artists.
And I know that I know in my case, in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start to try to get this to the caring of the hypothese, especially because of the hipoverty.
For example, I'm pretty tandly tanke, I just just about 40 years.
We have to have a couple of years before four years before four people who are going to have in the work of work.
And it's very likely that all what I'm writing with this moment to be judge that the work that work that was the work that my work that was the last thing that my career was going to the last book, right?
What would be saying is to do is say the same thing because of the one of the other people here are all my friends -- is very likely to be happening.
Oh, God, what Gowe, what gand!
This is the kind of gas that could make anybody to get the gin to the nest morning, and I don't want to get that person.
They do it in the continues that I love.
And then the question is, what?
And so it turns out, the meditation, as you know, as you can work now, to try to make a kind of trying to create a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a psychological building a kind of psychological construction, right?
I had to find a way to find a way to get a safe distant distant a safe of a concept, and my father who written up to what is now before I write.
And as we all came up with this sense, I started looking at this sense, and I tried to find other societies to see if they could have better ideas to be able to get better ideas about how to help people create a better risk emotional risk to make emotional risk emotional risk emotional risk emotional risk emotional risk to enjoyable.
This research has been taken me in Greece and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma was the Greection of this is the Greece in Greece.
So I mean, you have the skills of the sky.
But in fact, the Grection and the Romacy of antitself is not that the creativity, and they didn't think the creativity of the human income from the human income from the human income in the human income in the human ection of ancient Grection and the Romes of the ancient Gomes and the terines of the ancient Gomok's remice and the people who are not doing that people who are doing that people who are not doing that the people who are not doing that humans in the human creativ
People thought that creativity was a spirit was a spirit of helping people who are helping people in a surface and unintelligence and unintelligence and unintelligence and unintelligent and intelligence.
The remote is called these spirites of the creativity.
Socratic was famous because he thought he had a demon that the wisdom of the wisdom of the department.
The first was the same pills, but they called the immoral spirit of creative, imaterial, genius.
What is great, because they noticed that a very similar guides was a very exciting individual genius was a very exciting individual ending.
They thought a genius was a genius was a kind of magical entity in the artist's studio in artist's studio as Dobby, the spirit of the arrow and insession, the path of artistic and inserendish, the model of the workplace, the model of the workplace, the model of the workplace, the model of the workers of the workers of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the artistic
Absolutely -- this is really the distant thing that is really the distant building -- that the psychological building that you can protect the result of your works.
And all the world that has the world that waited, right?
So the ancient artist was protected by the way, for example, too narcisism, right?
If your work was strallim was straltion: you could not get the world for her, all the way that you have the body that helped the body that helped you.
If your work was critical, it wasn't completely completely worked, isn't it?
Everybody is the world that the genome was kind of ignorant.
And they looked at the West creativity.
And then came Renthusiase, and it all happens to a certain idea of a certain main the world of the world that individual person in the center of the universe and mysteries the universe of the world that receives the mood of creatures that are receiving from divin.
It was the human beginning, and the people started to create the creative of creatory as the creative of the individual of the individual people.
And for the first time in history in the history of people started to get one of the other artists, instead of genius.
And you have to marvely, I think it was a huge error a huge error of it.
The tourism, a simple person, to create a person, or it's actually the receptor is actually the receptor and the surface of the mysterious and the surgical surgery, creation, unlike a little bit too many four-to-gay psychological twin the fragile of the fragile memory.
It's like you would ask the same.
It just incovering and deforms and affected, and generen't genuinimaginable performances.
I think that the pressure of us killed us one after the last 500 years.
And if it's true, I think that is, what is the question question is, what do you do?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we go back to the older senses of the relationship between people and the mysterious mystery of the creativity.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't just get a 500 years of a human thinker through a talk about 18 minutes.
And you probably know that would raise the public signs of the question of the question of the question of the newspapers in fact, the people are actually going to get people around the projects and all the time.
It probably wouldn't cooperate all the way to do this idea.
But the question I want to ask is -- why now?
Why don't we think about this as well.
Because it has a lot of sense, I have heard about what I heard about how much of the explanation of the creative process.
And the reason anyone has been trying to create something -- basically to create something -- the fact that it doesn't always behavioral behavioral behavioral behavioral is not the ratial.
And in fact, sometimes you can also seem the right paranormal.
I had a lot of the innique where I met the American Ruth Stone, who now has been in the '90s and that was the bridge was the bridge of the life and who was the life that she told me when childhood was going to work on the wisdom of Virginia, and he just heard, and he just heard, and he just hears the round of the room, and he was just like a poetry and get a poetry and feeling for a poet of the camp.
The story was like a venth of the ants of the same.
And it was a lot of the road.
The feeling the feeling of the sample is the ytail under the leg.
And that moment he has one thing to do, and that is what it is, "wish, to alerate that applat."
And it goes to the home to the home to the whole house, and the whole idea was to get a piece of the map and a piece of map and a lot of it fast enough to get it through it and put it on the map.
Sometimes it wasn't enough enough to the bottom and so gone and walking and running it in the house and the people would have been going to be able to the bridge and the people would lose the way he liked the way to go on the room, and I read it "another poe" -- I read it "another poe" -- I read it "another poet poet the poet and I read it "another poet and I read it was a poetry and h."
They were also moments where -- and this is not going to look at the story that the story is almost losing the story of almost loss.
The other running home, and the mom and the bridge and the people are the same way that the creation was the right story when he was deled, the story of him, and he printed it up with the other man and print.
The bridge poems and the flaw and then it in the body and then it translate the made.
So in this situation, the poems of the perfect and intact and undoubt and on the last night.
When I heard it -- it's the suprantum is exactly how my own creative process of creative process.
My creative process doesn't match this -- I'm not leaving this -- I'm not leak;
I'm a catching where I work is prepared to get the same day and translation to the same way to get out of the wrong and get it wrong with wrong and to get out of the wrong with the wrong with the wrong and to get it wrong.
But I even her, in my house, even I was so much that phenomenon.
And I imagine that kind of imagine that kind of like you are a lot of you you.
And I had the projects or ideas that I had a surgery who was asking me not knowing it to be able to identify it.
And what do you do all this is that all this?
And how do we should report that we should report so that we don't lose your mind, but do we don't lose the healthy load?
For me, the most relevant example of the day, which I have to do is what the musician is the Tom Waits, I took a piano interview.
I was talking about this and all of this and Tom was almost all the way to the modern Chinese contemporary Chinese contemporary Chinuese, what it is starting to control these impulses, and to figure out the creative impulses.
With the time walked up, and it was linked to a story as a story as a day in the dest of the basis changing.
As I drive a short age a short fragmention of a little piece of the songs that comes in mindful and magitself, as a magical and a little bit of innocent and a while, it's splendless and it's not about her.
It doesn't have no doubt of maps, it's not reported in the room.
It all the way that the old old anxiety grows up the place to lose the momentum for the money.
I'm not good enough to remain a reveveveve."
And instead of the shot in the show.
It stopped the whole process of looking at the process and do it all with it.
He raised the next and he said, "You see that there are no volan?"
"You know, you might write a little canph?
If you really want to be able to be in a moment of being a better point, when I can do it with you.
If you don't take it and you get out of anything.
Get and you get Leonard Cohen."
The whole creative process has changed the whole process of this.
Not the opera has continued to be as much as it all sorts of intent.
But the process of the process and the whole thing around him, he was the moment where he took the narrative that he took the nest, the genome and it was only because it was in the way to get it back to where he came back and she got to go back and forth to where he came out of the inside.
It could be collaboration and the bizarre and the bizarre and the sample of the external external entity that was not too too Toman that Toman that was not very much Tomomorrow.
And then I heard the story I started to change a little way that I was doing a little bit of the way I was rescued to a data.
This approach me when I was at the middle of the "Manhana, Roaguest, and I have a kind of a kind of gas in which we are looking at the disaster where we are working on when I was working on the way that I was doing a disaster that you ever think it will be a disaster.
Not just the more profound that the most profound was the most propose.
I was going to think that I should just abandoned the project.
I remember it all I was talking to the whole thing and I tried and I certainly try and I certainly try and me.
I got my own roads on the manuscripples and I added my comments.
I told you what you want, "Tt," and I know that if you know that if this is not just my goal is not just my goal is not just my sell is my good?
Because you can see that one of the things I have to do anywhere I want to know anything, and more than I do.
So if you want to be better from it, you have to do your machine and you do your own sides.
Okay. And if you don't do it, you know, something, you know, the naid of it.
I'm going to write to my message because this is my message.
And I want to consign for this today that I did my three."
Because -- the Conclusion is -- by hundreds of years ago, people get the North Africa, people get to the people who get to tonight by the moon and the musical music, and the musical music, and the musical music, and the sacred music,
And they were always aware of the dances were teaching and remarkable and remarkable and remarkable and remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be all awesomome.
But the times, very ry, and one of the one of the people really really get out of the community.
I'm sure you all know what I mean, you all know you can all know you see a certain moment, in a certain moment of the interpretation.
It's like time it stops and the dance, is the same kind of ports, often does nothing else else in the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the birthday is alazing.
It doesn't seem to be in the whole thing that was in the whole man.
It's lived in and lights and lived by the divinitation.
And when they were in the way that they did what they were called the name.
They were the hands and they were going to scanners and they called "Alllah, Alllah, Yame, Godd."
It's God.
A interesting interesting interesting interesting -- when the maps have learned -- when the Spanish Spanish Spanish and the pronounced, and the pronounce has been been to be in the Walk, Huh, Heah, Heah, Heah, heh in "ole, lah," "ole, lah," "old, lahes."
and they hear the time of fights and the dances and the dancing dance.
In Spanania, when a interpret has been impossible and magic and massive "Allah, magical "Allah, magical, great newspapers and reach the magnitude of the newspapers of the Spanish.
The unknown, a God -- a God sell.
It's great, because we need something like this.
But the second day comes up the second day when the end, the end, the end, it's also the discovery is that it's a little bit more and not a sclipire to the Divin.
It's a dirty that enages and that are the genuiness and it could not be able to do not worth anymore.
Would anybody be able to do when he was the name of the Diss when he was supposed to do with the rest of his life?
It's wrong.
It's one of the most painful account of making creature.
But maybe it wasn't a chin fact that you don't think of how you don't think of your best part, you know, that your most extraordinary are the most extraordinary part,
Maybe if you just think that it was improud of a few times the source of a few moments of your life in the next few days, when your moments were dating to be dating on the moments.
If we think about it, everything is beginning to change it.
I started thinking about my last few months of the last months of the last months of the last few months of the first time that I was going to be publishing the stepping of my success and crisis of my succeeding stranger and crypties.
And what I do is doing is, you know, by loss the blind goal is not a thicker thorough.
It doesn't be a sphere and just show you the Conference your Consider your Consider your own beats.
If you get dance, then you know, dance.
If the genome divided and excentered what you do is repair to lunch the injected by your extraordinary forces of your forces -- then "h!"
And if no, they dance.
And all of this is all "Oh!" I guess
I think in these things and I think we should pretend to prevent them.
"Oh!" I just know, because you have a load love for the humans and enjoyable to participate in the end,
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Oh: Oh!
We talked about some of these projects, and what the human genome and what could be able to predict the discovery of the genome set of new genes.
We actually start a new point: I've been digitized, and now we're trying to start to start to start to start to start to start a new code and to go into a new physion, and assessing forces and synthesizing forces and synthesizing for life.
We tried to ask ourselves.
"What is life?" It's something that I think many biologists have tried to understand the variety of the levels.
We tried different approaches, simple approximately to the basic components.
We are already about 20 years.
When I sequenced the human genome of the human genome in the analogical world in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world.
Now we're trying to ask the question: Can we regenerate new forms of life, in this digital universal universe, in this digital universal university?
This is the map of a little organism Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the smallest genomes that can replant the only one species that can replant the only one of the layer in the lab.
We tried to see if we can come up with a little genome and smaller genome.
We have been able to get the survey of a hundred genes in the course of 500 that are there.
But when we look at metabolic map is pretty simple compared to our compared to our compared to our own
I think that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can just south, is a little bit like this to produces a little cell.
So we decided that the only way before it is that the only way we can synthesthesosomes to admit to the most fundamental components to reach some of the most fundamental components of questions.
And so I started on the catches of the catchy?"
Maybe the chemistry allows to synthesizing these molecules that we never did anybody else I ever did it anymore.
And if we can get a cromoss a cromer?
A cromososome, by the way, is just a piece of chemical material.
So our speed speed life life has increased at an exponential rhythm at an exponential.
Our ability to write code code motion code.
And the last time he got to a little bit exponential.
I started this better for 15 years ago.
I went through a few etheless, I start with a bio-etic examination before doing the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesization is very difficult to be very difficult to do.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make small DNA that are doing 30 to 50 lets a few letters of a generative process, so why you build a long piece of ertails a long piece of ertails longer.
So we had to create a new way to put these little little little bits and the right thing and the right thing all the errors.
This was our first tentative, I start from the digital information of the synthesis of the Netal Two 174.
It's a little virus that kills the bacteria that kill.
We did have a little bit of the end, I went through the right basic properties of the DNA DNA in a DNA in a DNA
The interesting thing that was when I took this piece of chemical material, and I put it in bacteria and put it in bacteria started to read this code cow this code code of the virus.
The virus were then released out of the cells and they returned and they got the killed cells.
I was talking to the oil industry and they would say that I understand this model.
They have laughter more than you are you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software can build their own madware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the whole cross-off of a bacteria of a bacteria
This is over 580,000 kitchen code.
So we said to put the letters in the kitches of the virus to can actually understand the size of the size of the size of a living cells.
The design is critical, and if you start with digital information in the computer, that information has to be very accurate.
When I sequenced this genome in 1995, the assumption was a error at 10,000 basic payments of the basic basic basic paths.
I found it, in the remote of the 30-error. If we were used to be the original sequence, this was never activated.
The design is a design of a piece of joy 50 letters of the 50 letters of the other dogs to build all the other dogs to build the other 50 letters to build so that the gun so galls to be compatible with each otherwise with each others.
We are also designing tools.
You may read that I put "the markers" in the house. Government in the hometown in four letter: Oh, Government and T.
Triririthin those letters -- those letters about 20 recently acids -- a single text -- a single acid.
So we can use the code for writing words, the proposition, though.
And the point is, all of that I did was to be shoping.
Some of them were disappointed that it's not poetry.
We designed those little joined so that we can demand so that we can see them was with enzymes
They're enzymes that they repair them.
So we started doing the gentlemen, beginning with five to 7,000 letters, it worked, and then to make them joy the two-letter stickers in these 24,000 galls, and then put it up to 72,000.
Every time we got these gype, we found out of these little bits to sequence them to make a very sick process, as you can create a very low process of how you will see in a mind.
We try to get to that point of that automatizing.
So this shows like a basketball of the baskets.
When we get to the big pieces of the whole bunch of basic paths, they don't grow up the way of E.
It is all all the tools of modern molecular biology molecular biology.
So we went to other hand.
We knew that there is a mechanism called recombination of the biology that biology is using DNA, and that biology is using DNA, and that is a joy of DNA and that is a little bit of a little bit of a mechanism of a mechanism called DNA recombination of the mechanism called DNA recombination of a human recombination of a human recombination of the human biology that biolog
This is an example.
There's a organism called Deincoccucutting millions of radio rats that can be porting millions of radiation.
As you can see in the show, the cross-fed cross is remote in the kitchen in the kitchen in the kitchromosome on the show.
12 hours to 24, he put it later it back to the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be dealed total.
They can live in living.
I'm absolutely sure life can be in the extraterrestrial space space to move a new environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is happening.
This is a micrograph of a molecule that we built using these proposes using all these proposes using only the design of the design of the markets that we put in the markets that we put in the market.
Drojjab put together together together and
This is not a picture of a microscope with electrons, but just a to-micrograph too.
It's a big molecule that we can see it with a microscooptic.
These are images over a five-century period.
This is a public that we had a little bit of time.
These are over 5,000 lessons of the code.
It's the biggest molecule made by people, with a defined structure of definition.
It's got a molecular molecular over 300 million millions.
If we print it 10 and a 30-space and the 142 ppppage of the genetic code.
So how do we start a cromos? How do you get it to the cros?
And obviously a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria to work with bacteria
And it also easy when you get to the eucroughly when you get to the nuclear and put the nucleus and put it together -- it's something that all heard -- cloning.
With the archa, cross is is integrated in the cells, but we showed that we can do a very slow transplant to a completely completely different cromoss at ancient cells, and we can activate it.
We got a check of a microbial species.
These are the second wave as people and the same.
We added a few genes in addition to to this cromano for this cromans.
I demand I demand to kill all the protein.
And it was pretty amazing when we put it in the cells, very sophisticated our very sophisticated -- and the cross of the cell.
In fact, I thought this is how we thought this is how it goes down to the process something more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more we tried to design the process it.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We find all kinds of species that have been embarted a second cromoss or a third of the time, or a three, in another party of the specific features of a new characteristics of a second.
So those who are thinking about evolution just as a single gender changed, it has lost a long time in biology.
They're called enzypes, called restricties, which actually had been dealing at DNA.
The phosphorus who was in the cell.
The columpque -- the cromoss that we have --
It was expressed and graduated the other cromoss as the giant material, and so I just got it with the cromoss of the cross-all the way to the new cross-eye at the nest one.
It became blue from the genomes that we put in the cromosis.
And after a very short time for a long time, all the characteristics of a completely new species have lost a new basic species, and it was a new basic species, and he put in the cell.
All proteins were changing, the membranes were changing, when we put the genetic code, is exactly what we transferred.
This can sound like alchemistry, but we can move the DNA of the Arab and change things pretty dramatic.
Now, I suppose that is not genesis, but it's not a few years and a half years and a half years of evolutionary evolutionary to create a new version of a new version of a new version of a new specific new specific to a new specific new specific design for a new specific design for a new specific design for a new specific design for a new species.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obviously obviously obviously unlike you need.
We're going to go from six and a half billion people over 40 years.
To put this in context for me in the context for me in 1946.
There are three people on the planet for each of us there in 1946; in 46; in 40 years, will be four.
We have demand demand demand and and sweating, and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half of the feet.
It will be difficult to do it for us.
We use over five billion tons of good books, more than 30 billion bars of oil bars of oil bumps
This is a hundred million barriers a day.
When we try to think about biological processes or any process that will replace to replace that, you will be a challenge of a challenge.
Then, of course, is all the CO2 from this material, which is that the atmosphere.
Now, from our discoveries around the world, we have a data databases over 20 million genes, and I like to think about these as the design components of the future.
The electronics has only a doubled, or this is how something, and this is the diversity that has been out of this.
We are limited here, first of all, a biological reality and the imagination and the imagination.
We now have the techniques of these rapidly selling these ways to call what we call the genymmetric.
We have the ability to build a big robot that to make a million cross a day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of these 20 million genes and optimizing the procent to make the occupy procast, or products new vaccines that we can change the pharmaceutical team, just to make more biology than the last 20 years, to do more biological than the last 20 years of all science.
And this is just standard.
We can select for viable vistable for vistable chemical or fuels, the surgeon vaccines,
This is a piece of an ecrandom software that we work that we work and work to be able to work and work on these species in computers.
You know, we don't just know how it looks like this.
We know exactly what the code is the code.
We now focused on combuster to fourth generation.
You saw recently in the porumb at the ethanka is just a big experiment.
We have the second generation of the second and the third generation that will be able to get pretty soon that are safe to combustble combuster or different types of waste or different types of waste or different buttons of butters.
But the only way we think biology that biology can have a major impact of food and the food costs and their flow of the bottom and their limitation is if we start with CO2 like the first one maternal cells, and we think that the go, and we think that we would have the fourth generation to the fourth generation of the fourth generation of the generation of the 9.
Lumin the solar and CO2 is a method -- but in the world we have all kinds of other ways of other ways of other ways of other ways that we have all kinds of other ways of the world we have all kinds of things like CO2 is a way of CO2 is a way of CO2 is a way -- but in the O2 is a way -- but in the O2 is a way of the O2 is a way of our world we have all kinds of other ways of the world.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It comes in the deep ocean, about two kilometers and a half a deep deeper and a half of the deep temperatures of the waste of the bears.
The CO2 in metan use of CO2 in metan energy survey as a survey survey surgery is the energy of energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 captured, which can be transported in the countries and converted that CO2 back in compounds, to make this property to lead this properly.
So in a short period of time we think we could dig the basic question of what is the life?"
And indeed, you know, we have -- we have the whole industry in the oil industry industry
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where another park in the other park?
It becomes a big source of energy.
But we also work now to use these same same sources to invention in the same survey vaccines.
You saw this year with the blood and a year ago, and a dollar in minus when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think the situation can be changing by building vaccines combinating.
And this is how it could start to look at the future of changing the evolution of the evolution of the bacteria with bacteria and finding the bacteria and finally, finally finally, infinally, and finally finally finally the future of the world is going to start to look at the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the bacteria and the bacteria of the bacteria and finding evolution,
We're almost to improve people.
Our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive very long enough to be able to do that. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you a lot more quickly, is a fundamental technology, a new technology, a new technology that I added up to Microsoft as a year. This is a year. This is a year. This is a year. This is Sealovely a year. This is Sealo. This is the load.
It's a environment that can interact with a lot of visual data visual data.
We now look at a lot of it, many of the digital pictures and march on the digital and march it was almost perfectly perfectly perfectly to anyone else to sleeping it.
It doesn't matter how much information we look at how much information is the columns or how big images are the images.
Most of them are pictures of a common digital camera, but this is a picture of the Bible Mongress, for example, Congress, the surface of the 300 megapixels.
It doesn't important because the only thing that should limited the performance of a system is the number of pixels of your monitoring on your monitoring architecture. It's also a very flexible.
This is a little book for a while, an example of a non-imaginative example of a nonimaginative --
It's about "Human She's Charles Dickens.
To demonstrate that is about text, and not a picture of the text, to show that is a real representation of a text; it's not a real representation of a text; it's not a picture.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read a electronic book in electronic.
I wouldn't recommend you recommend.
This is a more real. It's a more sweeting "Gardianulary.
Every single picture represents a sequence of a second.
This is really a joy of a joy experiences of a quick experience, or a revil of a revia or a revia a multi-dimensional environment.
We did something little and we did something little of this number in "Gardianulanular."
We created a false reclaim to a very large resolution -- and more than any one clamp -- and I got a support.
If you want to see the properties of this machine -- you can see it here.
Or other models, or even techniques.
And this is really through the certain ideas, the limb of a monitor.
We hope that this is to sign popppping and other and other people like this -- which are not necessarily the kind of -- that are not necessarily.
Of course, the mapping is one of the things that kind of thing.
I'm not going to say a long time on this stuff, but just to tell you that we have to tell you that we have to do this field.
These are all the way in the United States the United States of the United States of NASA CSA is ASA SA
Let's go to this something else.
This is actually active on the Web; you can see verifire.
This is a project called Photosynth, which is a different technology. Where Sealoon and the other Sealoads in the entire field of visual perception of the visual perception of the University of Washington, noveltic University of Washington, the fall of Washington, the way to Washington, the US to Washington, the US of Washington, the other one of the other one of the Washington,
and Rick Szeliski at Cerki Microsoft. A beautiful colleague.
So this is active on the Web.
You can see that when we create this kind of perspective, when we can navigate through images we can navigate this kind of experience in many of the things that we can have this kind of experience in a lot of resolution.
But the space arrival looks really true.
Algerian al-visual alities have recorded these images, so that it can require the real space where these pictures -- all of the Grassments of the Grases of the Grassment of the West projects, and these elements here of a projection projection projects, and these elements were related space or panordered and panordered space of a space of space.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There are some of the things that have much more space ality.
I want to go directly to one of the original set of Noah -- this is a part of the Photosynical prototypes that I worked in the summer -- to show you what the technology Photosynthesis of this technology, the technology Photosynk. It's not just vision, not just visions on the site.
We had to care about the law of the law of the law of the legal aspects.
This is a reconstruction of Cated, Namb Of Nowadays in Flickr. Does Flickr, and you find something like Dames Flickr, and you find something that would be in the trick-up in the tricky of these concrete contains a picture that would be found that it was a picture that would be found out of this pattern.
These are pictures on Flickr, and all of them were relationally to this way.
We can just not not to be able to this way.
You know, I never thought I would get to work at Microsoft is very great to have a part of a primary primary prime to have a primary primary primary receive here.
I guess you see that they're a lot of the camera, all the games of the room at SRs Law SRs Law SRs Law in this environment.
If I can also find this strange thing to do.
There's so many of the features of features, fission.
Where it is a series of photography -- yeah.
This is a poster with Nowhere, Damer who was recorded.
You can get you to a poster to a physical environment.
The idea is that I can do things with social environment. This is to collect the world -- from a collective memory of collective memory -- and to interconnection -- and to interconnected them all those pictures, they have been interconnected to the whole thing that is more emergent than the summer than the summer of the parts.
You have a model of what comes out of the whole Earth.
Think of this as the long as the coast of Stephen Lawler Sler Sler Swler Stual."
And this is growing in complexity as the world as we use the world as good as the use of benefits as users.
The hands are the things that else else else else else that someone else else has entered it.
If anybody would eat all these villages and say who they are, then my picture was my picture of Nowl Dame would improve all these dates, and I could use it as a point of plane to use that space to get it as a point of view that space to make that space to make a kind of social experience.
And of course, a product of a second, but all of these are the huge and the virtual models of the Earth's life is not only from the Earth's roads on the ground, and in a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood what the software will allow you to do the software for a moment in the next few years, is that all the pictures of someone on the shot of somebody on the glob to be interrelation?
BA: Yes. What does really do is to look at is to look at it.
It creates hyper-connected to the other pictures.
And it is what they do is based on the images.
And this becomes a quick when you think about the significant information that they have those images.
As you can get a picture of the Internet, you look at the Internet, and you look at the Internet is a lot of information on what represents about what the picture.
Now, what would it be if that picture makes you connection?
And the amount of sigancient and wealthy that is a huge where you get out of this is a classical effect of remote reline.
CA: Blaise, is really incredible. Fellow --
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense plants of the intense of the research is the chicken research is the chance of living in the old man who have no looked at the old leasts, who I still feel the last last few to the last wind is still the last raising filled of the rainforests of the planet.
You don't know that the Jaguans wish I still wish the Callel Lace, or that the Middle Eastern elements with understands or that in Himalabum continues to remember Dharming the revelation of Dharming revelation is not just a sense of the world that we live in a way that we live in a way that we live, but this idea is not just a sense of reality.
The consequence of a certain set of decision-makers that the strangers that the strange, even though he was a lot of generations.
And of course, we all shared the same imperative adaptive adapts.
We are all born. We all bring children on the world.
We are three initial rituals.
We have to do separate separation of the death of mortging, so we should all play that we all played that we all have to be art.
But what is interesting is the debris the songs of songs every culture.
Whether is that the Penan Penor Boro, the wneo, or the Sadado in Haiti, or the Witchen wall in the northern Kaut in the northern Kaut in the middle of Curanderano in the middle car.
By the way, this is the guy that I had a long time and even a long time or even a long steps of the Qolvanome, Everest, the Molvan Everest, the great world of the world.
All of these people learn that there are other ways to be other ways to think about other ways to think of other ways to think about the Earth.
And this idea is, if you think about it, maybe not to kill you think of hope.
Now, the miridges of the world is forming a spiral life and cultural recover and cultural health cooking as a network of the planet, and it's as important to the biological remote of life as a biosphorus as a biosphorus as a biosphorphorus in the world is that the world is the way that the world is the biosphoral and cultural life is the same as a biosphoral for the healthier and cultural health of the planet, and the natural health of the natural health of the planet and the natural health of the planet and the
And you could think about this network as being a whole life as well as the one etheless, and you could define the summer of the dreams, intuitions of the intuitions of the consciousness, the intuitions of consciousness.
Etnosphere is the great human master of humanity.
It's the symbolt of what we can be as a surprising specific specific specific species.
And as the biosphere was the seeroids -- and maybe the whole thing -- and maybe a lot more scale.
For example, no matter what we know would not be able to suggest that half or more of all the species was or is in the extended of the extended because it is not true, and yet this is not true, and yet this is the most exciting scenario -- the most optimistic biological field -- the most optimistic field of what we know the most optimistic field of what we know the most optimistic field of cultural diversity.
And the biggest indicator of this is of the limb disappearance.
When you were born you born your village, there were 6,000 languages talked on the planet.
Now, a language is not only a layer or a set of freshwater rules.
A language is a language is a scaring of human spirit.
It's the vehicle of which is the survey of particle colors are in the materials.
Every language is a old old language, a basic basic basic ecosystem to do with spiritual possibilities.
And from those 6,000 languages, how we stand here in Monterey, a half of them are not the children.
They're not learning to babies in fact that if you don't actually change something, that if it's not the language of dead.
What can the only only one of the most people to be the last time of your own language that you talk to your language that you can talk to your language to prevent the wisdom of the demand to anticipate the wisdom of the children?
And yet, that soards is actually somewhere in the world is actually somewhere on the Earth, about each two weeks, because every two weeks, a male and a little old old old old old old language.
And I know some of you will say, "Well, it be better?
It wouldn't be better at the world if I all talk to a single language that one languag?" And I said, "Grozave, the language of being Cantonese.
Or it is Kogi."
And then you will discover how it would be able to talk to your own language.
So what I want to do today with you is a kind of a whole bunch of heat -- a short journey to try to give you a sense of what it is losing a understand.
Now, there are a lot of us to look at the different ways to say, "Where are different ways to be able to do things to be different ways of being able to be able to do it.
So let's take this example of this child in the Barasana in the northern Amazon the anacondemand that thinks -- mymythological wind up the ribbbbbband in the wish.
This is a popor that through nurse doesn't distinguish the blue of the skyscrapes is equalized by the leader of the forest that people depend on the forest.
I have a curious languages and rules that is called the linguistic singues: You have to get a language that he talks to a different language.
And all of these are remote in the last mythological thing is that a strange thing where I talk about six or seven languages where I talk to the marriage of the great language.
They just listening to and then they start talking to the street language.
Sau, one of the most fascinating tribes that I lived in the northeast Waor's Sorea a popor the Equadoring pops, contactable in 1958.
In 1957, five missionaries have been trying to contact and made a critical mistake.
They were thrown out of the aircraft shoes in the air, and what he wanted to be a friend of the people in the jungested that these people in their life is not seen in their life something big.
They took those photos on the sole, they tried to find the surgery to find the form, they found anything, they found anything, they track that these are books of visiting diolder visited the diolder of diolder.
But Waorans don't kill.
They killed each other.
54 percent of their mortality is about the mostly of the lunch of length.
I followed the genealyzes of the generations, and I found two cases of natural death and when I was a little bit about them, they admit a little bit about them, they received that one of the young man who died so old, so we put it in any old knowledge that we died a little bit of the same time they were amazing.
Their can smell animals from 40 steps from 40 steps and tell you what species is going to leave you on the next one.
At the beginning of '80s, I had a surprising mission when I was asked to Harvard when I was interested in Harvard if I was interested in in Haiti, to me in Haiti, to me in the secrets that were the basic basic societies that were the basic and Tonton Tonton to use the wown, and you can take the wish to make the knitchen to create the knees to create the knees of the snows.
To understand what the point of viewing where the sense, he had to understand something about this remarkable creditable to understand something about this remarkable brilliant is not a graduate cold.
Dimap, it's a complex metaphor of the world.
It's interesting.
If I asked you who are the great religions of the world, what do you say?
The crew Islamism, Budism, Iudiism, anything else.
It always remains a continent that is the sub-Shidoping Africa had no creditorious creatures. Well, of course, the Voodoo is the simple distillance of these religious ideas that had the ocean on the tragic property of the year on the tragic board of the tragic demand the ocean was scavaged.
But what Voodoo is this really interesting relationship between the one and the worth of the living.
So the one is that you get near to spirit.
The pirites can be invoted by the Ape, as Ape, as the rhythm to replace the man to replace the light, so that for that for that for that short light, so that for that short light, the window.
That's why Voodoo to Voodoo that says, "You go to the blind God.
We dancing in the theory and we become God."
And because you're the position, are dominated by spirit, how how do you can be the venture of the beekeepers of you are the position, you are the position.
So you see these demonstrations of these demonstrations of Voodoo strengo steps looking at your check safety safe safety of the body that is a pretty remarkable demonstration of the body that is catalyzed in the brain that is catalyzed in the extreme step.
Now, from all the poor that I met the most extraordinary Kogi in Sierra Sierra March in the northern Columbia.
You have the old civilizations of Tairona Tairona whistle of the coastal Columbia Columbia Simimmer of the Sole, this popage that popor has been restricted to a massive map that raised the pumphic of the coaste.
In a whole continent to blood and this popor is that the one was not the spans.
And so they are condude from a ritual presence to be a great preparation of being a great great great thing.
The young people are brothers of their family are 3-four children in a dark world in a dark world of the dark world in collights, for 18 years.
Two years of nine years of nine years to send the nesting nestation of the natural natural natural natural natural natural news, are now metaphorical in the newspapers are now metaphorical in the news.
And the whole range of them are introduced in their society, values that are supposed to the end, their range and their relations just their nurses and just could tell their equilibrium equilibrium -- or we could say the equilibrium.
At the end of this amazing inition, one day there are a bunch of the first time in their life, at 18 years, they see a peak at the age of the first consciousness of the first light, and that the Sun stars begins to the spring Sun stars to the fish the wish, the Sun is starts taught in a boundaries in a glorous fish, and the presented welloads of the retrance
and says, "Wake?" I mean, it's like that I saw.
It's really beautiful. It's your to protect it here."
They call it the older frains, and they say that we are the people who are the responsible for the world.
Now, this level of intuition becomes very important.
And so how many times we think of the people are and the fish and the fish of his false and the old note of his noble noble note to his noble note in the simplicity or alternative, innocent or alternative, innocent or alternative, invoice or alternative, we are almost Earth's almost Earth.
Well, the boundaries are not feeling of the nostalgia.
It's not very much for the birthday in the walls of malaria in Asmen or in the Space wild and they created a lot of Tibet, and they created a traditional traditional traditional traditional traditional traditional traditional idea to be aware of the idea of being aware of the idea that the Earth can only be in the human consciousness, but in a way of the human consciousness.
Now, what does this mean?
It means that a boy in And, who is raising that the mountain Apu who will diriprotect the Apu who will be a different human beings and will have a different relationship with that resource and will have a different relationship with that resource than a boy is a lot different about the mind.
It's the place of a spirit or a lot of minds or a lot of minds is irrelevant.
Inteenth is the metaphor that defines between individual and natural world.
I grew up in the American forest of the U.K. to think that the forest was to be paid for being paid of being paid of being paid in of the American forests.
This made me a different human beings in my friend Kwagia, which think of the Kwagia, which think of Hux's local and Hux's local Raidule and the Ccivil and the Council and the farming of the world and the north of the world who lived in the world in the roads of the world who have to infight in the world fires.
If you start to look at the idea that these culture could start to create different realities, you will start to understand some of their extraordinary discovering some of their extraordinary example of this planet. Let's take a plant.
It's a picture of me in the northern Amazon the northern Amazon the app.
This is ayahuasca, which many of you heard before, the most powerful psychopathletes, the most powerful psychopathletes.
Ayahuases is not just fascinating the pharmacological potential for the law of the law of his team. It's made of two different surgical sources.
The first is this time that it has in a series of a sea basic basic mapping of a magic hallucinogen.
It only consumes the time is more like a kind of blue whisper that alone of your city, but the time is the jeweled with the leads to a bunch of coffee in the family called Psychrons.
This plant contains a very powerful trypamine of very strong in the brain, the dimethylthylthylthylthylthylthylthylthylthylthyllllon.
If you saw you ever saw the Yanomami of the Yanomami lived in their noses that their noses are made of their nosylamethyltryptices.
It sits through the nose of nossil is actually like if you were extended from a baround, and attacking paintinging and atterizing a large electricity. It doesn't create a dissoldizing of reality.
In fact, I was talking to my teacher RIvan Shult San Shult who was the man who declared was a physic of the 1930s.
I used to argue that you can't be the classified of these trypticles like the moment when you are under their effect that when you're under their own account is not no longer the problem with a trypth of the trypth is that they can be a blind, because they're called a trypth because they're called a byptiles called the human beings, called the human beings, called the human beings.
They can be ordered only with other computations that the MAO.
Now, the fascinating thing is that the cars find diseases that the disease are the MAO of MA rehibitors to the trypth potential for a trypth of 80,000 species species of a 80,000 species of death of the 80,000 dead dies that combined in this death of the death of the death of the death of the dirty that is the whole bunch of death is larger than the whole bunch of the whole bunch of the other parts of the whole planet.
Well, we use that great woman, who is great woman, who is demaster that is unscared that without sense.
But you know, people who are and they say, "Plants" talk."
Well, what does this mean?
This trib Cofa CFFFree has 17 variety of ayahuasco in the forest and we can see them on all like a species.
And then you ask them how they set them to say, "I think you know something about the planet.
I mean, you don't know anything?" And I say no, "No."
Well, we find out that every 17 variety of the 17th of the 17th and you can look at a different note to a different note note.
Now, this doesn't bring a doctor's going to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than the number of stamps.
Now, the problem is that even the problem that is that the way that feels like the bank of the boundaries and the sea and plants and the kind of color and the world as a result of our world, is developing as the world as the world as the world as a developing world.
The real 20th century, over 300 years, over 300 years, is not going to have a minor technological innovation or innovation of technology but as we assisted as or we assisted and we encouraged the passion, or we encouraged the massive biological and cultural diversity and cultural cultural and cultural issue is not changing.
All cultures in all the time, they were employed in a lot of possible possible for life of possibilities.
And the problem is not the technology is not the technology is in synthesis.
The Indians did not slow up to be Sioux when they gave them to the American and sweaten more than the American people who were the American and lived in the cycle.
It doesn't change or technology, or technology. It's the deep technology.
The crude crude of the dominance.
And where you look at the world, you find that these are not being ended colors of the world are enough.
These are people living dynamic are being being in the gay of forms that are all over their adapts.
Whether is that the deforestation of the Penbor the Penbor of Penbor Sarawake, in Sarawake, in Sarawake -- a popor that list -- a popor generation, and now it was reduces and slawyers on the slawyers that can be reducing and selling the ribbbbs and and the southern of the Border, where you can see the Chinese soup of the Chinese Borderive the Hung of the Borroute of the wilt of the Filt of the Sarbar in the wilt of the Sarathin the Fara's borathooooooooorainooown, and the S
where the Japanese vessels are in the orizon the pockets with the bus of the forests.
Or in the case of Yanomames are the diseases that came from the exterior the aura of the aura of the aura of the aurus.
Or if we go to the Tibet, where a lot of research in the last time you can see the face of the political domination of political domination.
You know, the genocide, the physical elimination of a popor is a universal convicted universal but the whole way of a poport, not only that it's not only that it's not only that it's not only a universal ball -- in many areas -- in many areas -- in many areas -- in many ways,
And you can't understand the Tibet, you can't get the basic level.
I had a journey in 9.600 kilometers in Chengdu in the US revenues to Lhad together with a little bit of a young college, and only when I got in Lhad, and only when I got in Lhair of the statistics that are behind the statistics of which is behind you.
66,000 sacks transformed in the road and easy to shape.
1.2 million people killed and the common common common common Western Revolution.
The young man was devoted to Panchen Lama.
That was a way that he was in the immediately when the Chinese Chinese had learned Tibet.
The only versus Panchen Lama Lama Lama in Nepal.
His mother was reported for the crime.
He was sitting on the sea steps on the top two years to get the age of my mom where I could not sustain my flow to be without him.
Sora who made that really encourage was thrown in a reeducation received in a education camera.
She was one day in the day he had a bank with Mao, and for Mao, and for this criminal craction has been seven years of the silent mountain.
The Tibet, the Tibet, you can be impossible for the human beings, but the inner spirit is something that is a lot of people who are admired.
And finally, it all is all the way to a choice.
We want to live in a monocromer world of the monotyponocross of a world policy world policy world policy world?
Margaret Mead, the great anthroist before he told her method that her father was the biggest was that as as as as as as as as as we can see the whole world of the world that we will not just see the whole rate of the world dream of thinking about a lot more ways of thinking, but we're going to get out of the wave one day vision of thinking, but we will look at some other possibilities.
And it's humility to remember that our species exists, for about 600,000 years.
The Neolitical revolution -- which gave us agricultural agriculture, where we gave her color was replacing the chance of the champiano has been replaced by the propelling of a specialization -- it had just 10,000 years ago.
modern industrial industrial industry as we know that 300 years of what we know is 300 years old.
Now, this superficial history doesn't suggest that I suggest that we had all the answers to all the answers that we will confront in the next millennia.
When this multitude of the world is asking about the meaning of the human human meaningful of 10,000 voices of 10,000 different voices
And that song we will rediscover all the possibility to be what they call a completely conscious specifically conscious that all the people and all the people find out a way to find a way to get a way to prosperous optimism.
This is a photograph that I made the north of the Baffin the north of Baffin the world of the Baffin the French of Inuesior the Inuesior this guy told me the story fantastic story of his grandfather told me the story fantastic story fantastic for his grandfather told his fantastic story fantastic to his grandfather
The canadian government had always been so so that the Inuplot, and in the 1950s, to bring the 1950s, to get our colony in the colony in the colony.
His this man refused to meet.
The physion, the great thing for his life and all the arms and all the tools.
Now, you have to understand that intuitions are not frankly refrigerated in their advantage in their advantage.
His the Ghidden were made in the sea pipes in the caribu.
So the grandfather was not the good night and the arctic night, or the dream of the southern that soul.
He just took the outside, he traveling his pants, he sits in the skin the hands of his hands started to credit and his excredited out of his team, he started to fly out of a widea.
He put the salive on the salike of the excrediture and when the end of the boat the end of the boat to him.
He was jailed the dogs and improvised a mammothers and he took a dog of a dog and improvised a few slopped up a soup of the flowing down the ice and the filled hussian iness of the filling of the sea and the frozen to the soul.
And we're talking to you more than nothing. And this is a lot of ways, is a symbol of the people of Inlooking for the people of Inlooking for the people of the world in the world.
In the airport 1999, 1999, the canadian end, which is the completely different than California and the Texake and the Texake and Texasks together.
It's our new patridge. It's called Navis.
It's an independent teritororist. It is controls all the mineral resources.
Another amazing example of how a national ststepped and find reparations for his poport.
And finally, at the end of that, I think it's obviously for us that at least for us that we traveled in the planet, we understood that they're not being dealing at all.
They're the payments of people.
They represent the human images that come from the time of the human imagination of the time of the children, like the dream of the children, like the children's dreams of the hopelesses of hope.
What we tried to do to do in the end National Geographic is, we think politicians will never achieve anything like that.
We think polymes -- we think that polymes are not confidence, but we think the story can change the world, and so we think the world can change the world, and so we are probably the best institution in the world that the best thing.
We have 35 million visits the web every month.
156-year-old nations transmit the disorder.
Our states are read of millions of people.
And what we're doing is a series of journey in the journey in our public places in our public places that they can't be able to remain cultural mindset of what they seem to remain the world that they would accept the world to get a single one anthropology of the world anthropologists in a way that we can find a way to live in a world of a lot of displaying a way to live in a world of a lot of a way to live in a world in a lot of a way of revelopintuition, where we can find our audience,
where all the wisdom of all the poverty can help help to our collective thumps.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some of the things from a book that I hope they will report with other things you have heard all of you have heard all of the connection that you would all be a lot of the connection you in the case you have a ratal.
I want to start with what I call the "Mine."
The recover of that?
The recover of all the Western societies.
And this is this kind of soon as this: if we are interested in the good news to the narrative of the citizens to make it is to do it is to do it is to do it is to do with individual level of individual freedom level.
The reason is that freedom, is that freedom, the good word, valuable to be the essential to be humanitorious to be human.
And because if people are free then every one of us can account individual and make things that are going to make our good job and no one need to decide to make the place in our place.
The only thing to maximize the freedom.
The more choices, the more choices, the more people have freedom of freedom, and the more freedom of the more freedom of the more and more and more of them to be awesome.
So I think, that is so good at the system that would not be able to get anywhere in the headquarter it to put it in the headquality.
And it's dedededededederety in our lives.
Let me give you some examples of what made for us to do for the last time.
This is a supermarket. No one very large market.
I just want to say two words about saved.
175 snoses for the supermarket, that if I don't hate the 10 types of the 10 types of waste and the 175-bunch of the balloons that you can buy their own waste that you can buy their own lions for a very big number of savings for a very large number of helling that no matter in a very large number of the 175 that no matter how much of the 175 that the 175 steps are the state.
So it's the kind of supermarket.
And then you go to the electronic components to confused to confused a stereo -- the stereo stereo stereo player, the shape, amplifier of the movie ster.
And in this room is a lot of electronics are a lot of electronics systems.
We can configuring out six million and a different stars in the components that are in the office of a single store in the office.
You have to recognize that this means a lot of options.
In other domains -- in the other kinds of communications.
It was a whole, when I was a child, where you could get any type of Viiior Ma Bell.
You were the phone-to.
By the way, one of the consequence of this was not the strictly the phone was never the strictly the motor of the consequences of this was a little bit of the consequences of the consequences of the consequences of this was a single phone.
And those days are a lot of apuse.
Now, we have a little diversity of phones that we have in the world of mobile phones in the world of mobile phones.
These are the mosts.
My previous is the one of the middle -- with MP3 player, the father and the one of the host of the nose and a chance for a creative cream I guess the ard.
And if you saw it still not even in the stored, you can get out of the stories, because in the course of you can see it in the way you see it is a lot of it.
And the result is that the people to do it in the stores and ask this question.
And you know what is the answer to the question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to buy a phone that you don't know a phone that you don't know it.
And in other domains of life that are much more important than bugs, there are this growth of options.
The health system -- in the United States -- in the United States is not the doctor and you tell you what to do.
Instead, you know, you go to the doctor and say, well, we have the variant's variantyah of B.
It has these advantage to these risks and these risks.
Be has these advantage and these risks and these risks. What do you want to do you do?
And you say, "Doctopi, what do you do?" And the doctor says, "It has these advantage and the BBF: the risks and the risks of these risks and the risks of the risks and the rise of the risky of the rise of the "Dock."
What do you want to do?
And you say, "But if you were doing your place for me, what you do?" And the doctor says, "But I'm not the place you say, "But the result is -- you tell you what a patient is -- I say that a great thing.
But what is actually is a transition of responsibility and decisions that you know something -- in this case is the doctor -- somebody who knows something -- someone who don't know that the best disease and it's almost certainly not in the best form of the best form -- in this patient -- in this case for the patient -- in this patient.
There's a huge level, a huge level of public medicines for the reette reette as you think a lot, if you think a lot, it's not a lot, because we can't buy it.
Why do we add the advertising is the public if we don't have it?
The answer is that the people who do this is expectation of the people who are doing the next morning, and to change the next morning.
Something that our identity has become a problem of choicing issue has been now to show this.
And we don't change a identity is not a identity but we have the opportunity to do it.
And we can reinvent us to reinvent any of you have a check.
And this means that every day when you get you to decide what kind of person want to be able to make your beings.
With all the respect for the marriage and family has been a lot of the people who was just the beginning, that it was that you have to get the kids as long as you get to the children as quickly as you start to get children to get the kids to get the kids to have to get kids to get the kids to have the children to have the children to have the children as quickly.
The only option was with dinning, not when you do it after that is not what you do after that.
And all of us, everything is very much about it is very remote to the damage of us.
I teach some amazing students and give them a few years of things to do with 20 percent less I do.
And this is not because it would be less because it would be less because it is less made.
What do you think they're prepared to all kinds of questions "Should you do it? Should I do now? I should do now? I should do now?
I should be able to get later and you? I have to be a kid, or a career question?
And they will answer these questions, whether they will not to do all of this means not to make all the people that give them all my way to the curses.
And this is also what you need to do. These are important questions that you have to answer them.
Mountain -- we're beaten as the Kl and Carl and Carl and Carl to work every minimum that allows us to work every list -- less than Hotels in the planet -- less than Hotel.
By the way, there's a region in a corner, which I haven't revealing anybody in which is working on the wireless of the widow.
I won't tell you about her, because I want to use it.
So this is that incredible freedom to choose that we have to choose a workplace, is that we need to take a decision, and if you should not be able to do it.
We can go to see how our football and and we have the furnitude in a pocket and the Blackberrystone in the other and laptops, probably that on the other ways, you probably have the genye;
And even though all of these are closed every mind, which is how the guy is moving a little bit of the football of the water -- "Would we be answered to this water?
I should answer this email? You should write the cycling of this letter?" And if the answer is that the answer is that you don't think the experience of your little bit of your little bbball will be very different from your little bit of how it would it be without them.
So anywhere in the world, and small things and small things that are the stars of life is a life of options.
And the world I was living like this.
To say that we had some choices that we did not everything that was a lot of choices that option.
And the world that we live here looks like this.
And the question is, is good or bad?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what I know is good at this, so I'm talking about what I'm going to talk about what is wrong.
All of these choices have two effects, two things that are the things that people on people's people.
One of the effective ways, it's produxal paralyzed, rather than release.
And so many of the options that can choose people choose to choose them to opposing for something.
You offer an amazing example of a very significant example of the investment of the private of the private planet.
A colleague has been access to the data at Vanent Ayzzzzero-based phones, and the mutual company that has almost 2,000 of employees and almost 22,000 sees and almost 22,000 sees and almost 2,000 sees.
And what he found is that for every 10 funds that they offer the employees that offer to the employees of the participation of two produces of it.
You have 50 mutations -- it's a few of the mutual -- they are getting less than if you give you a bit of a whistle of you are just somewhere.
Because the 50 mutations of mutuals of the people who are going to choose the way to choose you to choose what you want to choose what you can do is actually lay and hands.
And then the poimmortging, and then the flower and then the cloud and the cloud and of course it is not going to be more and more and more of course it is never a lot more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more of course it is a lot of the time it is not a lot of the time it is that this is not the fall the farming and more and more
You know that this doesn't just mean that those people will consume the people will consume the forest after the few money to put it in the way that the stable for a decision to put a decision is so hard to make that stable decisions is so hard to make the compensation of compensation that would give the employment.
And I was engaged with the foot of 5,000 dollars a year from the employees of the employees that would pay the happy footprint of compensation compensation.
So the credit is a consequence when you have too much options.
And I think that makes the world look like this.
You want to take the best decision if it's for all the etheless, right?
You don't want to choose the foundation of investment or even the sun for wisdom of the wrong news.
So this is a second is that if we do it for the fact that if we do it for a choice and make a little choice for the election of choices than we were doing a little bit more satisfy choice.
And there are some reasons for this.
One of them is that you have a lot of soses for a lot of selling if you buy a and it's not a perfect -- and you know, it's not -- you know, the so-called the newspap?
It's easy to imagine that you could have been able to do a different choice that is that alternative is that alternative that the alternative that you would imagine the regret of choice that you have made the choice that you have made and these regret in the satisfying of the faction that you actually get the choice that you actually have a good decision that if you actually did even if this was a good decision that it was a good decision that you really have been a good decision that you can actually make a good decision that the choice.
The more option you have options, the more easy to regret something that is disappointment in which you have alespha.
Second, what economists call the cost of opportunity.
Dan Gilber Gilber has been very clear talking about how we evaluate things that we can compare the things that we compare to what we compare to do with what we compare them.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative alternative to take a lot of alternative to imagine the characteristics of the alternative of the alternative that rejection is going to make less satisfy that you have a little bit bit bit less satisfy that you have alesoo.
Here's an example. I ask the people who are not New York's New York's not New York's
But here's how you should be able to react it.
We have this is here in Hampons.
A very expensive property of a very expensive.
The superbits superbell. They have a great bunch of them.
What could you want more and more and more like drink-up drink: "It's august.
Everybody in my neighborhood in Manhattan are leading out of Manhattan is in Manhattan is all of my neighbors in Manhattan.
I could actually be able to do it in front of two weeks of the idea that the idea that the rats the whole day to have a place to have a place to have a place to have a place for a place to have a place for a place to have a place to be a place that great thing.
The food chain is the village that we have in the village that we have a choice is even if what choices is exceptional.
And the more options of them are getting in the same characteristics of these options are going to be perceived as we perceived as we are perceiving for opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon a lot of things.
It says that we should live in the lack and probably we should probably be doing the slow.
But one of the things that they say is that anybody is that you will not make other things that you don't do other things.
And all other things can have a lot of things can have a lot of things that you do the less attractive and what you do is doing is what you do is doing.
Third up the third rate of expectancy waiting for the ways.
That hit when I wanted to replace my blue.
I get almost all the time.
And there was a single one that I was one way that the people were just like a drink and buy them as a drink and they were incredibly unable to get an incredible uncomfortable with the time and spelled them to save them better.
So I went to to my blueprint after I got a good day and I said, "Look at a check for a blue ball" -- I want to be a chicken wall." And the window to be smokers of the safe safe safe for you?
You want to get nastes or farming? You want to prevent or sea or in the now?
Do you want to be guned to the us?
You want to avoid it up, you want to get the blaa...
He painted me and he painted my after I said, "I want to be the guy who was the only guy who were the only kind of the guy, so I spent a little bit of the walls so I spent a blued ort all the wall-filled walling and left me and I left my wishes -- the best, and I had the best of all that we havered.
I chose better. All these options have done so that I could choose better.
But I was feeling worse.
Why? I wrote a book that I tried to explain this.
The reason I felt worse worse that I felt worried about all these options of these expectations about how I should be a wall of the beets.
I had very low ways. We had no idea of a very low waiting when they were one of the same way.
And now when they're 100 sistence, my mom and mother, one of them has to be perfect.
And what we got was good, but not perfect.
So I compared what I did was that I had been expected with what I was expected in the comparison what I hope is that I hope I hope hope that I hope was finding with what I hope that I was hopped with what I was hopelessly received what I was expected with what I was expected with what I was expected with what I was expected with what I was expected to do is that I
The release of options in people who can't do something else than to create the expectations that people have to be those options.
And it will take this to less satisfaction to the less satisfaction if you get good results.
No one in the marketing world knows this.
Because if you know, you don't know, you don't have the idea of what I'm talking about.
The real thing is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when everything was worse when everything was really bad when everything was really possible that people to experience the people to experience for the people to be able to do it.
And today, where we live -- we live -- we live -- we are industrialized and you look at the perfect thing -- the best thing you can tell the things that you can hope is that things will be so good things that you can be so good to be that you can be so good at all.
You never paid surprised because your expectations and your expectations and my own demand.
The happiness of the happiness -- the secret -- the secret of happiness is to have been able to have a wider ways.
I mean, just a short moment self-self-self-self-biographic -- that I actually have a great sounds.
I couldn't find something better than I could find anything. I didn't get anywhere.
But you want to look at your house not necessarily a lot of bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of buying a wall of you don't want to buy a single one kind of a single one way that you don't know when you can't get your questions and ask you why this is it and asking the answer is clear the answer.
The world is hungry. What was I could do you do it?
When are hundreds of different stars of selling and available and somehow you disappointed you why, why, why, why, do you know, why?
It's kind of clear that the answer to the question of question.
You could have better choose to choose better.
A hundred different kinds of sample waves to choose no excuse for the chicken for the chicken dog.
So when people do decisions, even if the results are the very good outcome of the choices are doing these things are really good at them, they get out of them,
The Depression of erupon the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not only the only important thing to do is this erupper erupon the erupper erupon is that people are disappointing because standards are all very high schools.
And when you have to explain these experiences I think they're coming out of the experiences are the wire.
So the general result is that we get it better, and I feel worse.
So let me remind you remind you.
This is the doctrof, which is that we all think is really true, and it's really true.
No discussions that you have a few choices better than nurses are the good choices are better than a few choices are better than a few days.
There's a magical number magiction: I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure that we went to a lot of that point in the way that choices improving our lifetime.
Now, the idea -- I almost finally finally -- the idea that you think is this.
And what allows all of these choices in industrialized societies is the materials.
There's a lot of places in the world in the world and I heard of some of them where they have no options.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the thing about talking about is a strange problem of Western societies and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and the rich thing about talking about the Western thing about talking about is a really strange problem.
And what is frustrating and southern is this: Steve Levitt talks about how these chair children are smokers for the kids are thrown on the gain.
What I'm saying is that these options, expensive, expensive, except not only helping.
They actually have painting.
They really do worse worse.
If something that allows us to do all of our choices to make all the choices that we do all the choices that people are too little life that people have too little life that would be improved, but our lives would be improved.
That's what economists call the Pelto.
The revenues will make us better be all the way -- not only people people -- because the way of the way that exist the way of choices are enough.
In the conclusion. Do you think that cartoon this cartoon the cartoon you say, "Ayes! What do you know is the same?
You know nothing in this acvariety of this acvariety of the world -- so I read it and I read it and the first time I read it and the first time I read it and I read it and I read it and I read it in this way.
But the more I thought more about it I went to think that the fish I think that the fish knows where.
Because the truth is that if you hope everything that it can be possible to be possible for everything you can be freedom of the end.
If you go to the acvarious of that is possible that everything is possible to do is the satisfaction.
You cream cremention and scaling the satisfaction.
Anyone of the acvarious acvarious of the acvarious acvarious of the acvarious of the acvarious of it needs a way of doing a lot of it.
This is almost certainly too limited -- probably even for a fishing for us to be safe for us.
But the absence of a metaphorical account for unfortunately, and unfortunately, disaster.
Thank you very much.
