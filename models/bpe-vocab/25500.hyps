And the year we arried these two disorders to demonstrate that the political cross of the last three million years of the last three million years was the size of the last few million years of the last few years.
But this moral moral problem because of this specific issues because it doesn't take the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of this moral issue of the moral issue of this specific moral issue of this specific issue of the specific issue because of this specific issues because it doesn't really look at this specific issues because the
The police is in a way that the global system that has been cross of global system.
She extended to the bottom, and the contract.
The next thing I will show you the next thing that is going to be a very quickly will be a very quickly above of the next 25 years.
The pilet of the pilk is marriage with the mice.
As you can see the white white catch of the inchame.
This is the anuity of the past.
And it goes to the bottom of the year.
Ask the guy's name, with a few years or more than five years of age, you can see that it's almost like the split of a bodies when a bodies of the body.
In 25-year-old has been from this to this one.
This is a problem because the challenge because the challenge of the ocean around the ocean around the ocean.
where it's been a massive amount of carbon oxygen that when it dish, is transformed in metal category.
Comparing with pollution pollution of global warming in the atmosphere of global atmosphere of the extreme way that we could go to this extreme.
In certain ways, a little lacks of the Alaska metal of metal metaphor is the soup of it.
The prophilosophy, the University of Alaska was on with a terear with a little tereter of a little tereter of the past.
Oh. h. h. The Gore: Who's A.K. C. In. In.
And a reason is that enormous "wor" is the Groenzis Groenland is Groenland in the north.
This is a rare that all over the year.
But the volumes are much bigger than it.
This is the Kangerusha soup of the Groenland.
If you want to know how the big the topier of the topier of the same.
These debate are growing very quickly.
And at the other end of the planet of the world's largest mammmale of the planet on the planet
The last people who are reported in the world have reported the continent of the whale is negative and the state of Enlightened Antarctica in the marine areas of the Antargets on the submarine areas of the remains.
This is the equal equipment, as a little over the big level, as in the Groenland in the Groenland
In Himalaya, the third of the third of the same new wavely, you can get the new force of the new force of a few years ago that was feternal.
40 percent of the population of the world of the world of the water of the water in these topier.
In the day, this guarter is the source of the water for this order.
The fact that they were raised in the room.
But when it gets to the water and the water water fill.
In California was a 40 percent of the country in the street in the street in Sierra.
This is the rate of water.
And predicting, as you read it out.
On the whole world of the dramatically driving the dramatically of the incentive of the incentive of the disorder.
And the disasters of the world have green up with a very extraordinary rate with a great great great requirement of the preference.
four times more than the last 30 years of the 75 years of the 75 years.
This is a completely unusual model of it.
If you look at the history of the history of what happens.
In the last five years we have adauged 70 million of the carbon dioxide every 24 hours of the carbon 24 hours of the ocean in every day in the ocean in every day of the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean of the ocean in the ocean of the ocean of the last five years.
The question of this is to the end of the Pacific area of the American Pacific area and every part of the subcontinent of the country where the subcontinent of the oxygen of the oxygen in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean ocean in the ocean ocean in the ocean.
The biggest because the world's largest global warms, the global warms, which is the report of the report of the sun of the fossil of the fossil of fossil fuels.
The Petra problem and the good problem is the most serious and the worst is the most serious
The United States is one of the two big emits,
And the proposes was to build a lot of factory for the car.
But we start to see a change.
Here are the ones that have been anxed in the last few years of propositive.
There was all the political policy in our country.
And the carbon industrial and the oil was spending a billion dollars in the last year of the last year of the quenenter of the quality.
And the good position, what is a tool of the air.
This picture of something about something like this.
In the Cracial Cracial Tnesnesian alone billion gallons of the book was imprast.
You probably have you to see the stiron.
This is the whole thing on the street in America has happened in the U.S. has happened in the U.S. preparation of Cracial Cracial Crace.
One of the reclouds of the good West of the book of Cracial Octocle was this.
Video: ♫ ♫ ♫ Frosy, the Frosy, is a blue of the whistler and you'd like to the same.
He is an abundance, here in America and hell the economy.
Frosty, the way with the car, becomes a day of a day that goes to the same.
He's also adorable and adorable workers are soup to the soup of the soup of the hanger.
Al Gore: This is the key source of the West Virginia.
The big part of the greatest master of Massey of Massey Coal Cal.
Video: Don Blankenn's cat. The Gore, Nanks of Gore, Nanks -- Sana, and Harry Reihabar would not be about what I talk about.
Al Gore: So the Alic for the Climate Climate Climate has launched the second campaign.
This is one of them of them, part of the one of them.
Video: The COAL: COALy we see change change in our business works.
And that our main is to spend a lot of money for the money for the public force of the public force of the public force of the good book.
The fact is the goal is not dirt.
We think it's a cure -- and it was a little bit.
So you don't want to make the climate change for change.
You have this in the way that we do.
Video: The good newspaper, you heard a degree of it.
So let's do a chance of this case of a criminal installation of the cartoon the cartoons.
The las! Masinaria is about the zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzon.
But this is the sound of the good technology of the good technology
And as the good book is one of the main the world of global remarkable global remarkable technology has a lot of technology that you can change the whole thing that you can change the whole whole thing to change the whole thing.
The question is, this is the technology of the good technology has been a cure of the goal.
Al Gore: In the alternative position, it's the perfect perfect challenge of the economic challenge of the security of national security.
Video: Narrator: America is in the crisis, the national security of nationality,
The thing that you have to get all the addiction of this combat the bottom of the carbon basis of the carbon basic basic basic basic but oil.
But now we have a new solution of the notion of the inccto.
You can be America with electricity 100-percent of the cost of 100 years ago, in 10 years ago,
A plan to put America to the third of the third and then we can help us the stopping and help us to the world of global warming.
In the end, a solution that is to reach us to help us solve the problems.
You can be America. You can get a lot of it.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: It's about the re-energy-re-energy-powered red.
One of the most quickly quickly to the most quickly of the old combat of the old combat that we killed our planet didisorder: The Viit's planet is here a new requirement of the energy of the remote of the energy of the energy of the most effective required.

If you want to get it to get back to the dog.
We have to get it back, fast.
Thank you very much.
The year I did a TED I did a introduction to the LHC.
And I promised to give a data data about how it works.
So, for the people who have not been here for those who have not been here in the biggest experiment that was not the most scientific experiment -- Cirumble-hour of 27 kilometers or is to recreate the presence of a billion of a century of a billion of a century of a century of a billion of the universe --
It's extremely of both sides.
This is the Genevely.
We do these photos of these minds of "Big Bangs" in the decades.
I work at this one. It's called the TLATLASS -- Lun4 meters, diameter of 22 meters of 22 meters here of the ATLS pictures of the ATLALS in the building of the proport.
On the pbrilliant last year, I went to the first time.
And this picture was made of ATLASS made
It caused a great famous required in the room room room room
It's a picture of the first step, which has been quoting over the third of the LHC, SCHC, SCHC in free, and the particle is a lot of a free in detector.
In other words, when I saw that last 10 sediments of the work of functioning works.
I don't know that if this was received the greatest oily, or this is where the first page and it was going to be the first page of the art of the same.
What I did a cultural impact on the wall of the impact of the impact of the challenge of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the encycical impact of the world.
And after this was about a story of the device was a problem with the device, which actually had to do with these days.
Those are transporting a transport of the fish that the device works.
Now, the engineers in the room, and say, "You can't transportation the fillness. They are beat."
But I can do this because when I'm at the temperature temperature of the superconducting of the superconductive of the superconductive of the superconductive of the superconductive state.
So at 271 degrees of the college of the southwest of the state, those days, those days, those days, you can transport this guy.
At one of the layers of the next 9,000 magnets in LHC, was a facility.
So the company was enough, and those 13 thousand ampers were innation of the power of electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressive, and they are now soup over 20 tone, and they move over 20 tons of poisons.
So I have a magnetic about 50 magnetic magnetic magniture.
I had to get the road, which I was doing and they do.
I reconvicted on the top, I repart.
And now we go into the subterm in the subterm.
The Pang of his March March will be like new LHC will be like new again.
We're going to start with it, and we are to get data in the unit of data or weird, and we're going to keep the research of the universe that are elementary tools to the universe.
Now, of course, those accident accident accident of the important accident about the important thing about the extreme of the extreme to break it up to break it up to break it up.
I think that it is that the fact that it's kind of a difficult way that we have young people like the LHCHCHCHCHCHCHCHCH.
I'm going to leave the words of a human scientist scientific scientist, Humphrey Davy, I think of the experiments of the protection of the protection of the protection of the protection of the crats of the recover of the minds of the minds of the mind of the minds of the worse of our minds are not that our natural gestures are finished, as we are not finally finally finally finding the world are not finding and worried, and it's not the world are not finding the world are not the world in our natural sell of our natural sell of a lot of our natural disruptive and not as a lot of our natural sell of our natural sell of natural gest, and so much more than our natural gest, and the world are not the world are not as a
Thank you.
I want to start with the rate of the child you would have to remember when you play with your boat.
On the top of what you invest to get them and get them and get them and get them and get them to the way to get the problem, and you can also solve the problems of the waste and manipulate the table.
The hospital is profit is profit of how we understand a lot of the world of inconconception.
So, in the way that the challenge of this unit inspired by this utility of the physical interface with our physical objects, and my physical consultation, my colleague, and my colleague, I was trying to do when we use a computer -- I was trying to do when we use a computer in this unit in this unit of a digital curriculum that would be so much of the digital disorder, and what we would be so much to the people would have to get to get to get so much of the other informed with the other and we could be so much of this uncomfortune of this unded by the question of this untable.
It does it want to do it for you?
The question was that fascinated by the fascinating we were able to researching Siftable to build Siftable to build Sisset.
In short, a Siftable is a computer interactive computer interactive computer interactive pattern.
They can be manufacturer they can perceive the procedure, and they have a chance of one and have a screen and a radio of a wireless of the wireless of the wireless of the wife.
The most important is that I'm palpitchen of game, like the game, you can just take them as a little watching them as a little as it applied them.
And the Sifwar gives an example of a new ecosystem of digital sensors of digital data of the digital information.
On the main the main of the instruments become more and more of their own initial circles and the other nutritions and contives of our nutritions and destroy new new stilles and and and destroy new waiting for interaction.
I'm going to start with simple.
This Siftable is confident to the video video of the video, and if you include the movie, it turns out to the other part, it has been to enter the other part, they get into the other part, they get to the other part,
These are the interactive interactive are facing one of the other things.
So, if I put them one of the other one, they become interesting to the other things.
If they are inconcepted and they will be a little confussions.
I can also feel the mission and inclining and inclining.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of interacting with the interaction of the interaction of the same thing as we can use the data to manipulate the data, as we would be able to get a light.
In this case, we have three Sismmmile as a gas of your pitch and can use them to use the center in the center of the center of the center,
If we were too long, we can get too much, we can get back.
There are also interesting possible for education, like education, like education, like the language of language, mathematical language, mathematical and logical and logical things that we want to see the results and see the results as quickly.
So here I -- this is a Fibonacy, the Ksand I do with a simple kind of equation.
Here we have a game game game game game game game in the formation of the Scrabs and Boston.
So in every single one of the first established in every Siftable, and the main every Sifttty, and they are grew up with a dictionary, they are greented with a dictionary dictionary dictionary.
And then after a 30 seconds of the letter is resex of letter and you have a new set of letter and new possibility.
Thank you.
These are the kids who came in in the cure of the Median, and I returned to the Media, and I returned to the way and movie.
They like it lost.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of applies is that you don't have to give them a lot of instructions.
All I have to say is "FFF: "From the worst of the word.
Here's the people are clearly enough.
This is the most tantangible test, our hand in the way.
It seems like everything that wanted to do was to do was to make the Siftable to do the other day.
So for him was just a boy.
This is a animal of animation of animal.
We wanted to build a instrument of the people who invest language.
And this is Frix.
He can introduce new personajor a stage of the T-Siftar camp that they seem to the person.
This is the sounds of the soil.
Video: The race.
David Merrill: Now he introduced a tractor in the stage.
Video: The Tractor of the pigo of the same.
Very of it!
When Siftable and the Sweden, he was selling them one can make the character of the characters -- Video: West Video: Ham!
DM: I create a narrative.
Video: H!
DM: It's a final story with open, and he decided, and he will be a basis.
Video: Zhila, pism.
DM: The last example I would show you today is a few of them is a work of created and interpretation and interpretation and interpretation and in which we built the role of sounds like the sounds of soil, and all the sounds of soon as it would be rhythming and all the way to the sounds I would have shown to the end of the way we would have shown to the
Each of these different variations of different different variations you want to use it.
And you can get the sound of the sounds of a successful of the people who are going to have to be a lot.
The sophisticated sounds like the sounds of a Space camp of a successful of success.
There are effects you can control the poor control, like the reversion and filter and film.
You can see it a certain sounds of sounds and then it includes to help it to help it up.
The next effects like the general effects like the post that are applying the size of the K, you can see the His to see it.
Vide: DM: I start with a riting ritself in the second Sifu camp in the successful of success, we were inexpensive expanded by a serious distinct.
Now I'm now I'm a basic line.
Video: DM: Now I add the dangerous dangerous.
Video: And now I'm going to add the top, to control the top, to control the effect of the effect of the waves.
Video: DM: They can get inclined the third of the inclining of a part of a part of a part of a part of the house.
Video: I will now be a baggas for a lot of expressive.
Vide: DM: They can do require the time of the amount of time
So I don't have to do the plan, you can improve or short or short tage or a short of the worst of the words.
Now, in the end of the inner of the crisis of the Siftar track of the volume of the volume of the volume of the stanger.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is the creation of new interfaces that are really really really really better with the way to our brain.
And today, I had time to show you a coordination of this new hope, and it turns out of the possibilities that I was trying to get out of the lab.
The reason that I want to retina is like we are at the free of the new generatal instruments that will bring the digital interaction with the interface of the rules of the rules of our rules of the rules of our rules of our rules of our rules
Thank you very much.
These are the wildlife to talk to you to all of you to all of you it.
I'm a writer.
He wrote the card is the profession is a more of a lot of it.
It's my mother, my mother, and fascinating, and fascinating.
And I don't have this thing to change the change.
But these are the kind of a little bit of a life happened in my life and career that I asked me to require me to require my inner with work.
And the strange thing is that I wrote this kind of biography, this philosopher, Roaging is called "Mananua" -- which is a dealing of a way of every single one of my career and become this important thing that I was a very important sense, and it became this important senior an international sense of an international sense of international position.
The question is that the story is that people are now working on the parachas as as they were convicted.
Serosion, convicted -- confus!
Would you get the ingright-hand and you say, "You don't have the theater -- you don't have to stop the performance of the performance?
You don't have the theme that you will keep the time creating life as a long as we create a case of a book that ever do the world on this one of the world ever ever ever do this?
It's very linear linked to the truth.
But it was also more like if they were not meant to all of 20 years ago, when I was trying to get the people -- I want to become a teenager -- I want to become writing, I loved the same thing I loved the same African response of that kind of a way of the same African response to a kind of a way of the same African response to the same African response to the same African response to the same thing I was going to get the basis.
And people said, "You're not going to be a lot of this is not going to have no success?"
I don't know that humility will be killing your require?
Is it that you are not going to work in this field of life in this field of a life will not stop here and you will not be able to get a picture of a dream of a dream of a dream of the rainforest?
It just just kind of like this.
The answer -- the answer -- the answer to all those questions is "Yes."
Yes, it's the thing that you are the theory of all those things.
And it always med.
And you have a lot of other things that people don't have a lot of other things that you can't get them.
As an example of big algorithms that are cross that are crossy.
But when I was trying to do this work that I thought I was all the time I was asking for the last time is "What?
Is it something like this ration?
It's a logic to get them to this work that they feel like to do that they feel like the work that they feel like the Pame.
And what is the specific specific initiatives that seems to us that we are really really really really really in the healthy of health care in a way that other profession?
My daughter was by the chemist and not of remember as a chemical engineering of the 40-year-old engineering of chemistry of a chemical engineer is a chemist.
It didn't happen -- John, how does it work with chemical?
It just doesn't happen to be happening.
But to be honestly, engineers like a group of chemistry of not so many of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the manipulaction of manipulacy.
We write the insects we have this reputation, and not only writing, but not only writing all the way that they have been like this reputation to be a strongly powerful reality.
And everything we did is to look at the numbers of morning only by the number of deadly in the 20th century, in the next next magnificent of the magnitude and often often often often have been died by the way, and often often often have been died by the way of the way of the way we have to look at the way to the name it.
And even those who didn't have the own waste of their own beat-ended networks.
Norman Mailer, even before the last time to the last interview that he said, "Each of my book, he said, "Eman has a little bit more tol."
A great great great thing about the work of a life of a life of a life of a life of a life of a life of a life of a life of a life of a life of a life of a life of a light-to-ed-to-the-ed-to-the-the-the-to-the-the-ed-to-the-to-the-the-the-
But I don't have a clip when we hear someone like this is because I heard this is that we heard of many times and somewhere and somehow we have the collective and accepted it into the collective and the suit of the collective and the suffer and as an arton and it will always take a sense of the suffer and it will always be a consuffering.
And the question I want to do this is that I want to do this is all of the impact of this idea?
You are comfortable with it -- because it is how they are the way to the lie -- I don't have the chance of this stock of the stage.
I think it's that it's a howed.
And I also think it's dangerous dangerous to wall of the future.
I think it's better if we were able to encourage the marriage of the artist's trouble.
And I know the sum of my situation, my situation -- I would be very dangerous for me to start to go to the next one of the neighborhood, in specific paper in which I think of the circumstances I think about a circumstance.
As for example, I'm pretty pretty kind of a 40-year-old in the judge of 40 years.
I would probably have been a few decades of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the workers of the workers of the workers of the workers of the workers of the workforce of four decades of the workers of the workers of the workforce of the works.
And it's very likely to write the innocent with this moment to be judge by the way, as the work of the last few days, and the last few days, right?
What would be a little girl in the way that we are already friends of the ones here we are already going to be happened.
Oh, Game.
This is the kind of the way that could make someone to get the sea of the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I will do it in the continues that I love it.
And then, the question for the question is, OK?
And so I was slowing my mother's many, as manipulate in the way to try and do it is by trying to write a kind of a global global global global global global global global global global global global global global global global global global global global global global productive productive in the protective of the protective of my meditation of my meditation.
I had a way to find a way to get a distant distant distant distant distant that I write the nature that I write the natural legacy that will be in the global response to what I'm now saying to what I write to what I write at what I write to what I write to what I write about to what I write to what I write to what I was writing a way to the way to the enter to the way to the end of this is going to be a very natural distant to me,
And as I got all of the last year in this sense, I started to go back to the time and I started to find other society and I could find other society to have better and healthy and more healthy and healthy and healthy the risk of how to create creativity.
This is the research of this in Great and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma
So you know, you have the circle of the circle of the circumstances.
But in the Grectent and Rom's Rom's antitchen are not that people who are not believed in the human face of the human nature of the human nature of the human nature of the human being?
People thought that creativity was a spirit was a spirit of a human beings that people are going to go to the people and unintelligent and united in the street and unknown.
The name of these spirits of the creatures of the human nature of the term of the term of "the ter."
Socrats was the fair because he was a demon which is a department of the intelligence of the department.
Roman were the same pares, but they called the creative creative, immoral immersial core of the genius.
What is great, because the romantic actually thought they were not believed as a particular genius was a very expensive individual immersible.
They thought it was a kind of a magical entity was a kind of effective enjoy in the wall of the wall of the wall of the way that Dobby, the nurse of the original house.
Absolutely -- this is the distant that is the distant that I was talking about the psychological building that we were to protect the results of the works.
And all the world as it is working, right?
So the artist was protected by certain things like that, like example, too much narratizy,
If you were stralucity, you couldn't get the whole world all mer, you could not get the world as a little girl that has the world that has helped the world that hell the world to the world that help.
If you have a critical work was not completely the hope, isn't it?
Everybody like the world as the gene was a bit of ignorance.
They looked at people in the West creativity.
Then came to Renasting and everything was changing, and it was all changing with a certain idea of mareaway, the great idea of the universe as a person in the center of the universe and mysteries and mysteries that are receiving the mysteries that they get to dirty in the dish.
It was the human same, and people have started to create the creative creatures that the creation of the individual creature.
And for the first time in history of people have started to refer to one of the other artists, in order to get a genius.
And you have to married, I think that it was a huge error of a huge error.
And if you have a simple person, a simple person, and it is actually the receptor is actually the receptor and the surface and the surface of mysteria, and the surgery, the disorder of four-founds, the fourth of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile
It's like you have a cool of the sun, the husband
It just just incotton and deforms the way of the requires of all these astonishes of the performance.
I think that the pressure of this artist has one of the last 500 years.
You know, if it's true, and I think that is the question is, what do we do?
Can we do things different?
You can go to to the greatest senses of the relationship between people and the mycelium.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't just stand and and to have a human human ration's rational,
And probably it is that there are a lot of people who would have absolutely assume us to the theme of the world -- in fact, which they are release people to the world presentations and all their projects and all the projects and all the projects and all the projects and all the projects and all the projects that would be a lot of people in the world that would be a lot of the world that would be absolutely to the world and all of the way to the world are present to the projects
It probably doesn't want to be cooked to the whole idea.
But the question I want to do is -- why not?
Why don't we think about this?
Because it has a sense of how we heard about anything we heard about what we heard about the explanation of the whole creatures.
But it's also why anyone who was trying to create something -- basically the whole thing -- the whole thing that doesn't really change the way it doesn't really change the requirement of the initial.
And in fact, sometimes you can get the paranormal.
I had a innight, where I met the American American American American American Rutch of American Ruth who has been in the jade of 90 years and that was a poetry and tell me as a child and he told me when a child was going to work and just as a child and just felt a little bit and feeling and just felt a poetry and heard a poetry and hear, just heard a poetry and heard a poetry and hear.
The story was like a south-and-a-rubber of the air.
And it was the cattle on the room.
The symmetry to get the same, because you have the same.
In that moment has a single thing that has a single thing to do, and that is what the people do."
And it goes to the housin to the housing of poisony and the idea was to get a piece of map and a little bit of a map of the map and to the room, to get it up and take it back to the map.
Sometimes it was not enough to be a faster and running and running and run, but it doesn't get the way to the house and the poem and the poem and the poems and the poemission and the poems of the room, I read the room, I read the other poetry and a different poetry and a poetry to the other poets."
They were also in the moments that -- and I'm not going to look at this time -- the story that almost losing the story that almost lose.
The guy at home, the main and the main and the third of the third and the way to the truth and the story of his own story and she was a guy and she was able to the other and through the other worst and through the other worst and through the other worst of the main and through the other way.
And the poems of the code and the tragedy of the main the main the main the main the map.
In this case, the poems of perfect and dark and unless and about the last time at the last time at the first worst of the first worst worse.
When I heard it -- it's the suprancient was just how my own process of creative.
My creative process doesn't really matter to this -- I'm not driving the road!
I'm a catching and the way I work on the room, I work in every day and you can actually take it and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go to the wrong with the weight and to the wrong way.
But even though I was in my innocent and I was attaching to sometimes that phenomenon.
And I have imagined that same of you are and many of you you.
I had projects or ideas that were designing from a source that they were not a source of a source of a identify of it.
And what do you do this?
And how do we should be report us to the report us to the mind, we don't lose our words, you want to help us to help us remote to require our nanose?
For me, the most relevant examples of our daughter that we can do is doing the musician of Tom Wa's carureview of the Wa's review of the revia a revia a revia a revia a a review of the demand the most relevant to me, the most relevant to me, the most relevant of our daughter that we can do is make a musician
I was talking about this subject and Tom was almost all the way to the contemporary of the contemporary artist of the contemporary artist and gestablished and gestablished these impulses these impenguins in the recontrol of these impulses of the subject.
With the time it was being linked out of the story as a result of the world as a result of the world and then everything has changed.
As a few of a short t t t t of a short fragmented in a human beings that comes in the mind of the earlier and magnificent and a lot of inspiration and a little bit of a time to get the soup of it, but it has no way to hit is not about it, but it has no waiting for it.
It doesn't have any hit has no report, no report, no reporter report.
The fact that the whole thing that the screen of the rainforest, and the point of the moments, and the point of the thing to always that.
I'm not sure enough to reus."
And instead of the panels in the panels of the show.
He stopped the process of doing and he did something with all of the new and everything we do.
He raised the way to the end, and he said, "You don't see that they're at the volaner of the volaner of the volaner of the volaner of the volaner and he raised the rainforest.
"Are you there that could be a trick of a cros?
If you really want to really exist, you get into a moment of the right moment when you can do it.
If you don't get it and they get to another today.
Dug and you get the Leonard Cohen."
The creative process of creative process.
not the opera is not going to be able to be the whole thing that always happened.
But the process of itself, and the process of getting around the time around the time he took the soup in the moment of the same, and it only to the room, and it was to get back to where he was to come back to where it was something that he doesn't have to be something that has to be something that has to be something attacked to to the inside of the organ in and look at the inside of the hour and look at the way to be to be a way of it was to be to be to the end and Chinese and look at the way to the soup it was not something like it was something like to
It could be this collaboration and the whole thing and the bizarre in the form of conversation in the form of conversation, and external exterary, and the exterrist that was not too as Tomano to the Tom.
And after I heard the story of the story I started to change a little way that I was doing it.
This approach me when I was saved when I was at the middle of "Manancy, Roag, and I was in a kind of a way that we all go to a way that we all go to the way to think of something that I don't think about it was a disaster to think that it would be a bad bad bad for it to be a bad bad bad news.
Not just that the most proposing this book ever ever ever before.
I would think I would have just thought it should be abandoned the project.
I remember my daughter and I was talking and I was trying to get and I was trying to get it.
I went to the watch and I got my commercial comments of the cameras a colleague of the camera.
I said to the voice of voice, and I love and I love you and I stand I can tell you that if this book is not just going to be the great thing to do with my day?
Because you can see that one I put it on the battle and more than I would have to go to the way to the beat all.
So if you want to be better than you want to do the machine and you have to do the same thing.
Okay. And if you don't do that, you know, to do that, at the naid.
I'm going to write because this is my message to my message.
And I want to consign for me to this up my third part of my third six."
Because -- the Conclusion is -- with hundreds of years ago, he was in North African people are traveling to the poor and museum to the wild and music.
And they were always awesomes because the dancers were professional and were remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be the right of the required, right?
But sometimes they are very unfortunately something of the interpret of the community of the community of the community.
I'm convinced you all of you are to what I mean you all of you know about it, a certain momentum.
It's like time and the time it was looking at the password of the password in a kind of a few thousand series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 ser,
And in a time that it doesn't be in the third of the day.
It's lived in the bottom, and lived on the bottom of the foundation.
While when it was the people who were able to know what they were saying is the name.
and they were unprecedented and they were "Houh, lah, Lah, Lah, Alllah, Game, Game, Game, Game, Gamming Game.
It's God.
A interesting among history -- when the great history of the Turn Spanieie's Spanieieve the Spanieieie's century, and they turned out to the New York City in "Alle" in "Holhh," and the "Holhhh,"
and they hear the time in the fibers and dancing and dancing and dancing.
In the Spania, when a required and magic of a male and massive massive and the "Allah of "Allah Tolk."

It's wonderful because we need to have something like this.
But the second day comes up to the second day when the end of the end of the end of the housin is and discovery is that it's a nurse of the morning.
It's a disorder that you are and that we could not get the genuines and could not stop and be able to not worry about it.
Can you just nobody to the Domat is the named when he was supposed to be able to do with the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the life of the rest of the life of the life?
It's hard.
It's one of the most painting of the most exciting creature.
But maybe it would not be a big chance if you don't think about the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary part, as the most extraordinary parallel of the people come out of the face of the living inside of the wall.
Perhaps if you just think about it was improud of a cool source of a way of life that you would have a data of life of the life of the next to the next step to the other boxes were on the other boxes of the boxes of the board.
If we think about it is all the way to change.
I started thinking and I would think and think of the last few months of the last few months of the book that will be published to the end of the same, dangerous and crucial crash of my successful and cross of my success.
And what I do, by doing it, repetited when you lose the cure of the same.
It doesn't be the hope. It just just just the thing to do is it.
If you get the dance of the dance of the dance of it.
If the gene of the dirty comes and expensive decisions to get the work of the extraordinary decision, even for a quarter of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the disorder of the disorder of the disorder of what you are the disorder.
And if you no, it gets anyway.
And with these "Hle!" for you.
I think we should have to be presented to them.
""You know, all of you, just because you have a love love of a love of loak and indoor and inforce to participate in the continue to keep the engaging to keep the light.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I talked about some of these projections about human genome. And what could do is to presence of new genes.
Now we start with a new point of view: we digitize biology, and now we are trying to start to start to start to get into a new phenomena, and to make a new phone-new forms of biology, and the force of life.
We tried to do all the time to put our questions.
"What is life that I think a lot of biologists have tried to understand the different level.
I tried different approaches, simple life to the life of the basic components of the basic component.
We are already already already about 20 years.
When I sequented sequence of the human genome, this was left from the digital world in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world.
Now we try to ask the question: Can we regenerate new force of life, or we can create new new new new digital universe in this digital universe of life in this digital universe of the digital universe of the digital universe of the digital universe of the digital universe of the digital universe of the question of the question of the question of the question.
This is the map of a little organism of genitalist genome that has the most of genome for a species that can replant to the only one species in the lab.
We tried to see if we can come with a genome and smaller genome.
We were able to get the survey of a hundred genes in the judge of the ones in the room there.
But when we look at the metabolic map of metabolic person, it's pretty simplified with our compatibility to us.
And this is a bit of a simple thing.
But when we look at all of the genes we can get the first time to do this is a little bit of a life of a life cell.
So we decided that the only way we actually decided to stand and and to stand this philosophy, so that we can get the most fundamental components to reach the most fundamental questions.
And so I started on the room, "Can we have a cross,"
Can chemistry allows these molecules that we never did a lot of these molecules that we never ever did before?
And if we can be a cross of a cros?
A crosis, by the way, the way of the chemical material of chemical material.
So, our digital world has to digitize the life green of life greenhouse gase.
Our ability to write code code, and it is moving to the way it grounds.
The last time he got to a exponential curve the exponential curve.
I started this on a better at 15 years.
I went through a few ethanks to a lot of bioteenage of a bio-et-et-et-et-the-to-day journals.
But it turns out that the Science is very difficult to be very difficult to be a very difficult thing.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make small DNA, long enough of DNA, but it's a generative process, but it's a generative process, so it's a generative process, so what you build a long stepped more and more and more ertained with a lot of error.
So we had to create a new way to put these little dots together and the right of the right of the right of the error.
This was our first tenth of the digital information from digital information to the digital human genome to the Physical noise of the Physical X4.
It's a little virus that killer human human kill.
I did the piece of paper, I went through the right correctness, and I got a molecule of DNA DNA with only 5,000 little.
The interesting thing that I took this piece of chemical material of chemical material, and we put it in bacteria, and I put it in bacteria, and I would have to read this genetic code, and to produce this genetic code,
The viral crisis of the virus in the cells and they were coming back in and they were killing the cells of the E.collight.
I was going to be with the oil of the hope, and they said to the very clear.
They have rid more than you are.
And so we think this is a situation where the software can build their own main a biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger for a lot of it.
We wanted to build the entire cross of a bacteria.
This is over 58,000 kilometers of genetic code,
So I said, I would put the table of the kitchen of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of a hole of a cell cell phones.
The design is critical critical is critical to the digital information in the computer of the computer must be very active to be very accurate.
When I was the first time I was the first time in 1995, standard was a precision of a 1,000 tar pair of the basic steps of the basic steps.
I found it, in the requirement of the 30-er-wildlife sequence could never be used to be active sequencing, that could never be activated.
The design is a piece of paper is design, which has to be the size of 50 gaps, which has to be a different types of other joined 50 letter to build the subjects of the other units to create a little bit of a little bit of a few other ways.
We are also design.
You may read that I read "marks" in the hous."
Trike out of those letters -- those letters about 20 aminating a matter of fact, a single literature -- a single immerse of a note acid.
So we can use code to write the word words, the proposition, the propositive.
And the reason I did was to hide the code was to hide the code.
Some of them were disappointed that it's not poetry was not poetry.
We designed those joined that we can define them was with enzyme.
I'm just reparing them and they are hurt and they are hurt to them.
So we started doing the gain, we start with five to seven to 7,000 little, and the right thing to do is doing to make it gentlemen, and then put it on the room, and then he walked up to 7,000.
And every day we have a lot of these joined in the abundance to the resolution, and we try to create a very range process -- as you can see a very roughly robust of -- as you can see a mind.
We try to get to the automation of automative.
So, this is that a basketball of the basket.
When we get to the very large stock of over 100,000 tallons of the basis of the basis of the E.
They are all the kinds of physical molecular molecular molecular molecule.
So we were going to other method to other hand.
I knew that there is a mechanism called human recombination called biology that biology is using DNA, and that makes DNA, and that makes DNA, and that makes it happiness.
This is a example.
There's a organism called Deinococckropen radio radio of radiation.
As you can see in the cross of the cross is of the same.
24 hours to 24 hours later, he took it out of the new layer of the mountain.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be often often often often often
They can live in the light.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the space of exhibition space to move into the space of a new environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is going to happen.
Here's a micrographical micrography that we build these proposes using these procitions -- actually using the journalist of the design of the bodies that we put the star of the market we put the stock of the market we put the stock of a viral micrographical molecule.
Drojje it together together to put them together
This is not a picture of a microscope with electronics, but just a micro-degree photograph.
It's so a big molecule that we can see with a microscope with a microscope.
These are collectors of about about six seconds.
This is a public that I had a little bit of a little time.
These are over 58,000 kilometers of genetic code,
It's the largest molecule made of people ever do with a definition structure of the definition of definition.
It has a molecular molecular ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar of the year.
If we get a step up with a 10 and no space of the space of 142 pages to enter the genetic code,
So how do we start a cross of a cross?
Evil with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
Estone, you have a little bit of a little bit of euplot, you can just take the nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear --
With the bacterium of the bacteria, the cross is integrated in the cells of cure and we showed that we can make a completely completely completely completely a crosis, and we can activate it into a cell, and we can activate it.
I got a crossed of a microbial spectrum.
These are the second distance of the distance of people and a little bit like people and a little bit of a light-to-to-to-the-day are the second of these are the second are the second of these are the second as a distance of these are about as a distant as people and the second are about as people and a lot of distant as people and the same as people and the dogs of the way and the kind of a little cat.
We added a few genes in the plus in the plus of this crosis.
I had a demand I was aszzine to the whole protein.
And it was pretty amazing when we put it in the cells, you will get our very sophisticated gray -- and the cross of the cells -- and the cross of the cell.
In fact, I thought this is how far it can go and go and try and do it to design the process of something like this.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are all sorts of species that have been incorporated by a second crosis, or a third of the third of the other part, of the other parts, of the new characters of new characteristic new characteristic characteristic characteristic to a century.
So those who are thinking about evolution just as a single gene of change, and it has lost a long time in biology.
I'm sorry, called the restriction, which actually were the kind of DNA that actually had DNA
The phromosome that was in the cell.
The philosophy -- the cross we put --
It was expressed and he was grateful the other cross as a material, and it was just like the giant and so we were just with the cross of the cross of the new cross of the new cross of the new cross of the new cross-prime and the other cross of the other cross-re-received and the other cross-crosis as the gestomosis like the other crosis, and
It became blue because of genes that we put in the cross we put in the crosis.
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristic species, and it was also converted in a new species of a new species on the program that we put in the cells that we put in the cell.
All proteins were changing, membranes were changing, when we are changing, is exactly what we do is exactly what we transfer.
This can sound like alchemistry, but we can move the software of DNA, and we're going to change the pretty dramatically change.
Now, I suspect this is not genesis. But it is not genesis, but half years of the evolution of evolution of the evolution of creating a new version of the World Bank of the camera, which has a new specific specific specific special.
Why do this?
I think it's pretty obviously pretty obviously of a lot of use.
We are on the way to go from six and half of people over 40 years.
And to I do this in context for me to me, I was born in 1946.
Now I'm now three people on the planet for every of us that there are in 1946, or in 40 years, will be four.
We have problems of hurt, and the sun water and the drug of the six billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half of the six and a half of the six and a half of the food.
It will be difficult to do for us.
We use over five billion tons of the good book, more than 30 billion bars of the box of oil in the boat.
This means a hundred million barriers on day.
When we try to think about proposes or every process that will replace to replace that will be a huge challenge.
And then, of course, is all that CO2 at this material, which is all the atmosphere.
Now, of our discovery of our world, we have a basic data of the world with over 20 million genes, and I like to think about this component of the design of the design of the design of the design of the future.
The electronic electronics has just a due of a product of component of components, and this is the diversity that came out of this.
We are limited here, in the first place.
We now have techniques of these kind of kind of a very quickly to do what we call genuinic genal genimical.
We have the ability to build a big robot that make a big robot that make a million a day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of genes or generating genes of gene and try to optimize the procosmic procosmic productive, or product products, we can change the pharmaceutical equivalent of the biology than the last 20 years.
And this is just the standard selection of the standard selves.
We can sell for viable to be production of chemical substantial fuel, production of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of the city.
This is a design of a design design of a design design of what we work in order to do and work in the computer in the computer of these species in the computer in the computer in the computer of this species in the computer of the computer in the computer computer of the species in the computer model of a design of a design of a design of a design of a design of a design of a design of design of a design of a design of a design of a design of a design of the species in the world.
You know, we don't know how it will show you.
We know exactly how they look at their genetic code,
Now we are now focusing on the fight of the generation.
You saw the mixed of the etan-based air.
We have a generation of the generation of the next generation that will be slow of a very curriculum that are hopels, to the higher of the soup of a fanolianol.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact of food and the cost of food and the fall of the food and the cost of the resonate of the resonate is if we start with this cells, and we are working to design the cell, and we think that we would have the first fire to the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the fourth of the generation of the next to the fourth of the same way.
Luminum and CO2 is a way -- but in our discovery of our discovery different ways.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It goes into the ocean the ocean in the ocean and about two kilometers and half a half of the bottom of the temperature of the farmer of the farmer of the farmerby.
Transform CO2 in metan use of molecular molecular as a surveillance of energy.
We try to see if we can take the CO2 capital that can be transported in the country that can be transported in the country to the O2 back in the fuel of the flower, to the product in the process.
So in a short period of time, we think we could have this basis of the basic question of "What is life that is life life life life that is life life life life is life life life that is life life life life that is life that is life that we can be a short peripheral time we think we could have a long peripherosphere, we think we could be able to the question that we can we get to the basis of what is the basis of what is the bask?
We know -- you know -- we have the objective model of the entire chemical industry.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED, where else in the part.
Let me become a major energy.
But we also work to use these same source is to inventing the same source of vaccines in the environment.
You saw this year with the south, we're always at a year and a dollar in the right company when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think the situation can be change, combined by any of the combination of any of the time of the before.
Here's how it could go to the future of change the future of change the evolution of evolution, accelerating the evolution of bacteria, and then the evolution of bacteria, and finally, finally finally and finally finally --
We are almost to improve people.
Our base is just to make sure that we have a long enter of survival to survive very long enough to do this. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you the first time, is a fundamental work of the fundamental thing that we added it to Microsoft as part of a part of a hole of a hole of a year.
It's a medium that can interact is the local distant amount of visual data of visual data data visual data.
We are now looking at a lot of digital poor and marriage of digital and marriage of digital and fit through this one of the rearranging of it in this rob.
It doesn't matter how much information is what the big information is these columns or how big the images.
Most are the pictures of a new new new digital campaign, but this is a digital scanning of the Bible Congress, the Congress,
It doesn't really important because the only thing that should be limited to limited the number of skin of the monitor's monitor's monitoring of your own monitent architecture at a very flow.
This is a book book of a few of the non-imaginative example of a non-imaginative example.
It's about "Chan of Charles Dickens. The Dickens. The one is a capital.
To show you that it's about text, and not a imagine, we can do something like this, to really show that it's a real representation of a text; it's not a position of a text; it's not a positive position.
Maybe this is a very artificial way to read a book in the electronic book in form.
I would not be recommend.
This is a more real. It's a "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian of the "Gardian of the "Gardian inal.
Each picture is the beginning of a century.
This is actually gives you a joy experiences of a quarter of a parties of a network of a newspaper of a newspaper environment.
We did something we do with something small with this number of this number of the number of the number of the number of "Gardian in."
I created a false reclaim to a very large resolution -- and we were released by a common required conclusion -- and I was able to get a confidence.
If you want to see the property property the property of this car,
Or or even other models, or even the techniques of techniques.
And this really through the idea, the release of the limits of a monitor.
We hope that we are to split of pop-based property and other people are not necessary.
Of course, the mapping is one of the reasons for a technology of the kind of like this.
I'm not going to be a long time to tell you that we just want to tell you that we have contributed to this field.
These are all of the soup of the United States of the United States of NASA.
Let's go to a different thing.
This is actually active on the Web; you can see great.
This is a project called Photosynthesyne, which is the two different technology. Where is the other other wonderful scientific research of a wonderful research of visual perception of visual perception of the visual perception of the universe of the University of Washington at the U.S., Middle of See See See the U.S.
and Rick Szeliski at the Cerki Microsoft.
So this is active on the Internet.
You can see that when we create this kind of perspective, when we can navigate through images of images in many ways, we can have this kind of experience in many of the light.
But the space of this imagery of these images of the image.
The other visual orientation of visual perception have recorded these images that are going to get to the real space where these pounds are doing with the Grace -- all of the Grass' "see these elementary projections of a projection of a projection of a projection of a new space of space.
I'm not sure if I was sure if I was doing other media.
There are some of the more than the other space of the space.
I would like to go to one of the original corner of Noah -- this does a lot of the prototype of the Photosynal of the Photosynthesis that I think it's the pia technology of this technology, and technology that I think it's not only vision, and it's not only vision.
We had to have a concern about the legal aspects of the legal aspect of it.
This is a reconstruction of Cattoria of Duilt of the images of the Flickch of the Dug Flickr, and you find something like a little bit of a cross of the cross of the cross of these contains are a picture that would be found that cools that would be found that the cool of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this model of this pattern.
These are the filled of Flickr, and all of the space of space.
We can just get to the navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I would get to work to work at Microsoft is very proud to part of a contains of a prime to have a prime here.
I don't see that I'm notice that I'm a lot of the camera, all of the cell phones at the TRs of the cell phones at the SLRs in this environment.
If I can find out of these strange strange ways.
There are so many trouble ble.m.,
One is going to here is a series of photography.
This is a poster of the Duilt who was recorded the right correct.
You can get the poster of a physical medium of this media.
The idea is that they can do certain things with social environment. This means to collect the world -- from collective data, from collective world -- from collective memory, and to interact the Earth -- and to interact them was interconnected to the whole thing that is being connected to the highest risk of the bedlight.
You have a model of what comes out of the entire Earth in the entire Earth
Think of this as a few of the mountain of Stephen Lawler of Stephen Lawler of the Earth Viralle."
And this creates in the complexity as the world use of benefits of benefits of the benefits of the use of how users use it.
The book is the book of metaphors that someone else else else to end.
If someone would be the wrong of all these sfined and says who I would say who they are, then the picture of the NDDs would improve with all these data, and I could use it as a tricky of this kind of social experience to make it a kind of social combination.
And of course, a product product of these are the huge amount of virtual and the virtual model of virtual culture of the Earth is not just from the Earth and collection of the Earth and images of the village of the village and images of the village of a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I have the right answer, what will allow you to do the software of a moment of the next few years, is that all the pictures of someone in the world of someone on the roof someone on the gload to be interrelated to the interrelate to the right interrelate to the right of the right of your right to be the right right answer?
BAA: Yes. What does is really to be the goal.
It creates hyper-connected to the image.
And this is doing this based on the consequence of the image.
And this becomes a quantitary of the signal information that they have those images that have those images.
As you do a picture of the images of the Internet, you look at some of the world of the Internet, and text on the Internet gives you a lot of information about what pose.
Now, what if that poses are the connection of all the pictures of the positions of the positions of the positions of the positions of the pictures of the position of what would be the positive positive. What would be if that position is that the position if that position is that the position if that position is that the position is that the connection of all the pictures of all the pictures of the pictures of all the pictures of the positive.
And then the amount of interconnection and disease that is a huge amount of southern in this is where the country is the classic effect of the country.
CA: Blaise, is really incredible. Felics.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense plants and one of the trial and one of the great research of the method is to live in the end, which they don't look at the old old day in the wrist, they feel the last few days, which I was sitting in the soup of plot, they would be in the roads of the planet.
I don't know that the Jaguman in Jaguary lusually around the Calso, or that the old male of the old old old man who are still resonate with the Himalaia is to the center of the anthropology, is to remember the center of the anthropology, and this is not just a sense of reality that we live in a sense of reality that we live in a way that we live in a sense of reality.
The consequence of a certain set of decisions that we are required to the ancestors of our ancestors and and and successful and with a lot of generations in the next place.
And of course, we all share the same adaptive adaptive adaptive adaptive of the same
We are all born we are born all of the world.
We're going to get through the initial ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual of the inition.
We need to do the separation of the moral desire of morning, so we should not surprising us all the son, with all the players we all have the art.
But what is interesting is the unique of song, the role of songs every culture.

The 50 foundations of mutuals -- they are sent to 10 percent less people engage than if you give you a few people who are just off?
Because 50 founded by 50 founs of the naive of the naive of the way you will decide what you are going to do with your hands.
And then on the poims and then the fit and then the time and the fit of the entraveling and of course, it doesn't come up with the hope.
You get that this means that it doesn't just mean that they will not just take the foundation of the foundation of the pensive, that means that the way it is that the way to put the way to make a decision of a decision of a compensants to the spring of compensation that would be the employees that would be the employees of the compensing.
I was looking at the legs of the legs of the employees of the employees of the employees of the employees of the compensants to the compensation.
So the credit is a consequence of when you have a lot of options.
And I think that makes the world like this.
I really want to take the best decision, if it's for all the way to all the way to the wrong thing, right?
You don't want to choose to choose or not even the same thing that is the wrong thing to say.
So this is a second effect. The second is that we can actually keep the station of the state of the requires and make a choice to make a little bit more satisfied by the way we were doing with the choice than we were to choosing the choice than we want to choose to choice the choice that we are to choice.
And there are some of the reasons for that.
One of the people is that we had a lot of snoss for a number of to bring one of the one and it's not perfect -- and it's not perfect -- and you know, and it's not perfect -- and you know, what?
It's easy to imagine that you could have been able to imagine that there was better choice. And what happens is that the alternative will be a better way you imagine the possibility of choice that you have to imagine that you have to take the way to the election that you have a good decision.
The more opposite of the opposite of the way you can regret with something that is deadly required with the option that you have alit-like the option you have ality;
Secondly, what economists call the cost of opportunity.
Dan Gilber of demonstrated very clearly talking about how we are talking about how we are we engage things that we are engaging with what we compare to us with what we compare to them to what we compare them.
Well, when I'm a lot of alternative tunneling to think about the character of the characteristic characteristic tasks that rejected you the alternative to make it a little bit more satisfy of the alternative that you have a little bit of the alternative that you have a little bit of a huge amount of successful tasking.
Here's an example. I'm not a example. I'm not New Yorker.
But here's how we should be able to raise it.
We have this here from Hampions.
A very expensive property property property property property property property property property property property property property property property property property property property property property property property property property property property property properly.
The superbits of superbit. They have a wonderful day they should be.
What could you want to want to want to be a drug thinking: It's a chance of the pulse.
All of my cartoonist in Manhattan are going.
I could just like in front of the office of the office of the husband and spend a few weeks of the day to have a place of parking and a place that wonderful park for the park of the park that wonderful park to a place that wonderful thing.
The opportunity of opportunity in the village that we have on the village of the election of choices is except if we choose is except for what we choose is except for the way we choice is to be the same thing.
And the more options of the most options of the quarters of these options are going to be a new options of these options will be perceiving as we are perceiving for opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoons says a lot of things.
We should be living in the lack of the and probably we should be able to live the right slow.
But one of the things that says is that anybody says is that you can not do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of lights and this is going to do what you do you do what you do you do what you do you do what you do you do about it.
Third of the third of the expectations.
That was that when I wanted to replace my blugia.
I can get almost all the time.
And there was a epoetry was a single way that you were a single way and you buy them and they were incredibly unable to get them and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you have, and they were sent to the road and the soup of a long time.
So I went to my blind, I was going to get the old day and I said, "Use of the old and I said, "Uh is a chance of fall." And the answer said, "You want to be a chicken wide, and the right thing to be a south?
You want to get the smok? You want to prevent or your shirt?
Do you want to be the same thing.
You want to eventually get them rid to the band at the blaaaaaaaaaah. And not to the end of it.
He painted his face and she said, "I want to come up with me to be the guy who was no one guy who was no idea that the only guy who was never going to have a hurt halls of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the right -- the right -- the worst of all of the way I had the right thing to have been the right of all of the right of the same that I had the right thing to have to me
I have a lot of good. All these options have done to choose to choosing better.
But I was feeling worse.
Why? I wrote a book in which I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt worse is that I felt that we had all these options of my expectations about how my expectations about how they should be a champid of the good enemy.
I had very high expectations. We didn't have any distant expected the same wave of a single way.
Now when I'm 100 feet of the moon, my mother, one of them must be perfect.
And what I got was good, but not perfect.
So I compared what I got to expand what I expect is that I was disappointed in the comparison with what I was hope.
The options of the options in the lives of people can't do something else.
And as a big inition, it will lead to the satisfaction is that if they get good results.
Nobody in the marketing world doesn't know that.
Because if you don't know it, I don't have the idea of what I'm talking about.
The fact is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was worried when it was worse was actually worse was actually possible to expert was actually a source of source to expert in the source of source.
And today, where we live in the world we live -- we live -- of the industrialized and you look at the perfect perfect thing that we expect the best thing to do is that things that will be so much like the good thing that you can be so good to be that they would be so good.
You never have surprised because of the expectations of my expectations and my daughter to the way to the skin.
The happiness -- for this is to all the way to all the happiness -- the secret of happiness is to have expectations.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- that we actually have a logic of a sound-called a wonderful goal.
I couldn't find something better than it. I couldn't really get the time.
But let's just expect to the house not necessarily not necessarily a thing that is so bad to the best.
And finally, a consequence of a bubble of a wall of you don't know when you can buy a single one is that when you can't do it, and you know, why you can't be able to ask you why this is clear and ask the answer is clear why this is clear to the answer is clear of the answer is clear to the end is clear that the answer is cloud.
The world is coming back. What could I have to do it?
When I'm hundreds of different stills of different sample of walls and somewhat you die is a whip of the bees and ask you why why do you do?
It's as a clear that the answer to the question is,
You could have to choose to choose to choose to choose to choice.
With a hundred different types of choice to choose to choose for the house.
So when people are doing decisions, even if the results are good that the results are good to the outside, they feel good disappoint.
The reason for the erupper world in the last generation in the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not the only thing -- but important to this erupper depression of the synthesizes and also have people who are disappointed because they are all disappointed to their arrives are too sold to the arrives are too sold to the real time.
And when they have to explain these experiences I think they are coming out of it.
So the general is that general is that we have a better goal and we feel the worst of going.
So let me remind you remind you.
This is the doctor is that the doctor who all of a real tricky we all think of the factor. It's not true.
Without the discussion that you have a few choices of choice, but here not the results are better than you can do it.
There's a magical number of magic. I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty sure that we went to a lot of that choice is that we have improvement of life improvement.
Now, the idea -- almost I was finally finally finally to think about this thing that is this.
What allows these choices to the whole society is good good for the material.
There are a lot of places in the world and we heard of a few of them where their problem is not a lot of opposite.
The problem is that they have too little to have a little bit of it.
So the thing about talk about me, is a strange problem of the West and rich societies and rich of the West and richer.
And what is frustrating is frustrating is this: Steve Levitt talks about how these machines for children are being a lot of time and so forth, and they were injured to the gain.
What I tell you that these opposite is that these opposite and complicated not only help.
They actually have a painting of pain.
They actually make us feel worse.
If something that allows us to our society to do all the choice that we are transferred in society that we are too little to be a few options that are not only the lives of that people have a lot of the ancient lights and our lives would be improved.
This is what economists call the Pareto.
The crisis is going to do us better all -- not only people are the way -- because of the way that we are in this extension of the choice that extend us to make sure us.
In conclusion. Would you be asking this cartoon? What is you can say, "W! What do you know is the fish of the fish of the fish fish the fish of the fish fish the fish of the fish of the fish of the sky.
You know nothing is possible not in this active acvarious of the world -- this is a migration of the world -- so I read it and I read it and the first place.
But I thought more about the more I thought I was to think that the fish I got to think about it.
Because the truth is that if you are hope, you will not be possible to be more freedom of freedom.
If you are hope, this is that everything that is possible, the scale of the satisfaction.
You create the demand and today are the satisfaction.
Anybody needs a variety.
This is almost almost too limited -- probably even for a fish -- probably for us to us.
But the absence of a metaphor of metaphor of nefortunately, and precisely unfortunately, disaster.
Thank you very much.
