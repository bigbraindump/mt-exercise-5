And the year we arrived these two diameter positive to demonstrate that the entire police that in the main which the main the last three million years ago was the size of the last 30-year nine years ago was a small amount of big 40-percent of the mariths of the second diamong 40 percent of the entire diamps.
But this is the serious problem because this specific issue because it doesn't look at the size of this particular way.
The police is, in a way that the heart system, the global system, the global system.
She extended to the contraction and contracy.
The next next thing I will show you the next will be a quickly fast at what happened in the last 25 years.
The pitch is the marine of the mice.
As you see the blue dozen blue does.
This is the anuity of the night.
And it turns out that in the bottom of it.
Asa: Asa: The guess of the old and a five years or more than you can see is almost as a board of a body.
In 25 years of this was about this one.
This is a problem because the inquality of the deep death of the ocean around the world,
where it is a big amount of carbon carbon oxygen, when it rejected in the field is transformed in the mixture of the organisms.
Compart, with the pollution of the global warming in the atmosphere of global warming the amount of extreme way that we go on if we go to this point point in the extreme way that we take this point of the fear the sample of the pollution of the pollution of the pollution of the pollution of the pollution of the world could be the deep in the atmosph
We already in some ways, in some of the Alaska metal plants is in the end, is the same.
The Professor Katey Walter was on the Alaska was on the Alaska little tech of the Again, the people at the past.
Ano! Well, here's the Gore: OK Gore's question, is if we are going to be --
And a reason is that enormous "sounds like this huge bestsn't.
This is a range that all over the years.
But the volumes are much more like that.
This is the Kangersweet Grusher, the Groenland.
If you want to know how the big it creates the whole ball of the skin that it is where it gets a big place.
These are debate are very quickly.
And at the other end of the planet, Antarctica of the planet on the planet on the planet.
The last people who have reported as the result that they have been the continent is the negative of the continent is the negative of the Antarctica bunch of insult in the end,
This is the equal equipment, as the size of Groensizes in Groenland.
In Himalaya, the mountain of the same way you can see the new sky, you see in the new cycle of the new cycle of the new cycle of the new cycle of it.
40 percent of the population of the world of the world of the water from those toilet in these topirs.
In fact, this guy, this guy, this is the source of the water for this city
They have grown up.
But when it goes to the water and the water water water water and the water water
In California was a 40 percent of the sweater in Sierra.
This affect the water revention.
And predictions, as you read it, as you are serious.
And the whole world has been a dramatic creative credance to the incentives of the incenties.
And the disasters have been on the global landed with a great role of the very great and the fall of the flight and the fall.
four times more in the last 30 years of the 75 years of the 75 years of the 75 years.
This is a completely unusual.
If you look at the context you see what happens.
In the last five years, I added up 700 million tons of dioxide every 24 hours of the carbon dioxide every day every day in every day every day of the ocean.
The problem is to the Paction of the Pacification of the Pacide of America, and every part of the subcontinent where the Aradical subcontinental in the ocean.
The most of the global inquirty of global inquirretile of debate in the world, which is the reportion of the fossil fuels.
The page is a problem and the best careers is the most serious books is the most serious.
The United States is one of the two big emerging applications of China.
And the proposition was to build a lot of factors.
But we start to see a change.
Here are the people who have announced in the last last years with the alternative technique.
Everything is, there was a fighting of our policy.
And the carbon carbon and the oil and the oil was spent a billions of dollars in the last year,
It promotes what is a tool for the hour.
This is impressed by something.
In the COOcle COOs in Tenness, a billions of styles was imprast.
You probably see it in the stiron.
This is, on the road, the second big deal. It happened in the country has happened in the U.S. has been in the Scigarettes.
One of the reclear of the book, like COOctos was this one.
Video: ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫
He is abundance, here in America, and help the economy to create the economy.
Frosty, the book, it becomes the goal is becoming the day when it goes on the same.
He is accessible and the workers of the workers of the workers of the mountain of his baby.
Al Gore: This is the fact that the big West Virginia Virginia --
The most most graphics on the book is the great book, the book is the sey of Massey Coal C.
Video: Yon Blankenn: I want to be clear the clear of the Gore, Nans, and Pelose, and they don't have about what I talk about.
Al Gore: So this is like Alie for the Climestablished the next campaign.
This is one of them, a part of one of them.
Video: The COALergy new climate change as we see the change in our own business.
So our goal is to spend a big money for a lot of money for public forward, for the audience that are going to help us look at the goal.
The fact is the code, in fact, the cars is not did.
We think it's curious, and I have a bunch of them.
So it will not get to the climate change for change.
You get that in our way.
Video: Well, you know, you know, you have heard a mammography about it.
So let's do a chance of this particular case of this poisoned forest of this book.
Wat! Mass! Massist is about the gyphia.
But this is the sound of technology that good.
And as the goals are one of the main the global inquirty of global remarkable technology has the whole technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the whole whole whole change.
The other is going to be with this technology today is the technology to be the goods.
Al Gore: In Gore: In the alternative to the economic challenges and the economy and the problem with the security and the problem of national.
Video: The Nart, America is in America is in the nationality, economy, the security crisis.
The opportunity that they have to do this is that the advertising computation on the bottom of the carbon deep death of the carbon disorder.
But we have a new solution to the nearly unexpected to the incurious ideas.
You can probably have America with electricity to 100-year-old, in 10 years ago.
A plan to put America to get the end of the world, and it makes us more significant to help the end of the global warming.
In the end, a solution that is a big solution to help us solve our problems.
You can probably America. You can see more
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: The Narrator: It's about the re-energy re-energy re-power.
One of the most quickly the most quickly encourage of the old combat our old combat that our planet Barble: The world is here in the Barble: The Life is here in the energy of the energy report.
Barble: We have investment to create good for creating good platform.
Narrator: Remememerging America.
Al Gore: The Gorean an-grab African hour African who says, "You go away, you get it faster,
If you want to get it to get it around.
We need to get it around,
Thank you very much.
And the year I was a TED I did a introduction to LHCHCHC.
And I promised to give you a data about how it works.
So this is the one of the ones that have no idea that the largest experiment that was the largest experimental science -- the Cumber 27 kilometers or is the Street and it's the Street Streatment or is the present to create the universe -- the pressure of a billions of a second to create the universe -- the page of the universe -- the panels.
It's extremely so much of it.
This is the device under the Genevelevation.
We do photos of these minds "Big Bangs" in the decades.
I work at this one. It's called the ATLATLALASS -- Lunged 44 feet photograph here is the 22 meters here is the ArTLATLATLATLATLALASS in the building of the ATLASS in the building is called the TLASS --
On the 10 sedg's last year I started the first year for the first time.
And this picture was the ATLATLATLASS.
It caused a celebration in the room.
It's a picture of the first one of the particle that had been cratched over the entire LHCHC, cross in the LHC dead, and it's a part of the LHC is detector.
In other words, when I was in the seat 10 sediments of the work of the function of what is a huge success.
I don't know if this was the largest oils, or when someone went on the Google and it went on the page, and I see that the first page.
It means that I did a cultural impact on the street of the impact of the evolution.
And after a bit of a same, I had a problem with the device, which actually actually had to do with these songs.
Those are transporting 13 thousand ampers when the device is the power of the moon.
Now, engineers in the road, and he says, "You can't transport the finger."
But I can do that because when they're at the temperatures become what is called the guns.
So as a 271 degree -- and there was more friend of the state, those of state, those days, those days, they can transport the fish can transport the fish of the state.
At one of the laws of the 9,000 magnets in LHC, was a define of facility.
So that the company has been inquote a little bit of the 13,000 ampons have indemanded up the electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impression, and they are about the magnifty of the tone, and they moved to 30 care.
So I had been deeply about 50 magnetic magnetic magnetic
I had to take the road, which I had to do it.
I redered all the way to all the way to me.
And we take magnetic magnetic and then in the subterm.
The end of his village of the marine of the LHC will be like new mostly new on the street.
We will start to start with you -- and we get to you to get data in the unfortunately and we will continue to find out the world to find out that are the tools to find the universe.
Now, of course, that insurance accident accident of the discussion about the important thing about the important thing to do is the extreme to reject the same thing.
I think that it is that the fact that it is so much like we have young people in the fact that we have young people like LHCHCHCHCHCHCHCHCHC.
So I'm going to get the words of a human human human science of a human human scientist Davely, I think when the applications are the income protection, and this is Michael Faraday, and it's not more dangerous progressive progressive progress for our minds to put the re-enemy, and it's not more natural natural natural disaster, and they're not more mysterious to be -- and as our philosophers are not more natural and our farms, as we have no more natural gest."
Thank you.
I want to remind you to remember your childhood, when you play with your kids, when you play with your boat.
And as you invite what you learn to get to the road and get them to the cool and get them to the skills and get to the same intelligence and solve the problems of the hospital.
The point of the hospital is deeply to how we understand a lot of the inconclude of the world of inconclude.
So I think, in the R&amp;quality of this utility with our interactions -- impress with our physical objects, and my collect with the skin Pattery, and my collaborator -- I started to be when we use it -- I started -- I started in this unemployed -- if we use a computer, and if we use a computer, and I could be a computer in this unuser and a mountains that would be so much to the next to the next stage and if we can be so much of the next to the mountain and we have to be so much of this untain to be a bank and we take a base in this untaility with this un-toast-toast-toast-toast, and then we can be a mountaining and then use to be a mountain and then we have a whole digital base in this untained
And he would like to think about how do we want to no?
The question was so excited by the fascinating that I had a research to build Swealth of the Swedish of the Swetable Stable to do it.
In short, a short, a computer computer interaction is a computer interaction of a bism.
They can be manufacturing, they can be perceive the desire can perceive the one of the other, and they have a bunch of radio and radio and radio and radio and radiation.
The most important is that there are palpable, like the games of games, like the game, you can only get it as well as you get the way around.
And Sifting office office of a new ecosystem of the technique of the digital data
And on the table source of this tools become more and the risk of the other, their consists of the other, and the connections of our nutractions of our nutractions and funny new ways we can start to explain the interaction of interaction with interaction to interact with interaction to interact with interactions.
I'm going to start with simple.
This Siftable is confident to the video of you -- and you include a video -- and by the other side, if you include the other side, it is the other part, they get into the other.
These are the interactive interactive and one of the other,
So, if I put one of the other langer, they become interesting.
If they're inconclued, they will be able to get a little confused in confusion.
You can also feel the mission and inclinic.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of interactions is that we can use the skills of the strengthose, as we would be able to make the data like we have a list of a list of the list of a light.
In this case, we have three Swewe'd have been in the skyetches and they can use it in the middle of the center, and they can use the eyes in the middle of the center,
If we can get too much, we can get too much of the back.
There are also interesting to educate education, like this would be a game and logical music, mathematical and logical sensors of that we want to see people as quickly as we see people as quickly as it can see the results as quickly.
So here I have a Fibonacy, the Kbonacy, which is a simple set of equation.
Here we have a game game game of the words of the Westablished and Bogglers and Boggles.
So what actically, every single one of the first one of the Stwed, and the main the main the skin that the way to forget with a dictionary dictionary dictionary.
And then after that, after 30 seconds the resees of the letter, and you have a new set of incities and we can be inccaught by inccities.
Thank you.
These are the children who came in the exhibition in the Media Media and I received them to the confidence and filmmaker.
It would like to have a crazy.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of applications is that you don't have to give them a lot of people who are to have to be able to get to them.
All the thing you need to say is "From the right thing to do.
Here are others of people who are asking them.
This is the most tangible testing in our right right in the way.
It turns out that everything he wanted to do was to do was to do the one over one over the other.
So for him was just a cuber.
This is a animal application of the animal activity.
We wanted to build a tool, for those who invest in the language
And this is French French --
He can introduce new characters in the scene, just the star Switwitzerlands that they can be the persons.
Here is the soil of soil.
Video: The answer.
David Merrill: Now he took a tractor in the scene.
Video: The portrain the portrain
Very.
I mean, when Siftable and ask, and the other langle can make the person of the others to interact -- Video: Ham!
DM: It makes her own nart.
Vide: Oh, yeah.
DM: It's a beginning, and he decided, and he will be deeply the way it will be a debate
Video: Hary, pish, pyyicico!
DM: The last one of the example I have this time to show you today is a device that I built up and interpreted the music that I built the role of soil and the soil of sound, and the soil sounds like the sounds of soil.
Every four different variations of these different variations that you want to use it.
And you can reach the sounds of a successful of the success of the success of the same way.
You get the sounds of the sounds of soil sounds of a successful Stweet of success.
There's the effect you can control control the table, and the filmmaker and filmmaker.
You can see it a certain soil soil and then includes the way to help it to help it out.
It's about general effects like the general effects and volume that the size that you have the sample in the His to see it is.
Video: AM: We start with a second riter-called Swear camera, we have an injured series, we have an extend to the income, except the ritself.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: AM: Now add add a box of the forest.
Video: And I'm going to add the filter of the movie, to control the whole thing to control the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the object.
Video: Oh, I can get inclined the inclined of the inclinical trials in a part or other.
Video: Oh, I will think this movie bought for more expresent.
Video: YM: They do receive the way to do the seat as much as the way.
So I don't have to do the planet, they can improvise, previous or short or short tage or the same.
Now, in the end of the inner of the Siffish that we use the Sif, the end of the volume, inclined in the stagger.
Thank you.
As you see, my passion is the creation of our interfaces that are right with the computer, and the way that functionality and our body can get better with our brain.
And today, I had time to show you a new coordination of this new hospital hospital, and you can put them in the possibilities that I can get out of the law.
The reason that I want to retiny is that we are at this new generation with this new generation of intervention with the interface, which will bring the digital world into our world of our rules in our world of our rules of our rules of our rules
Thank you very much.
And this wisdom to talk to you to all the way to be all of you to all the way to you.
I'm writing.
He wrote the books is my teacher, but it's more attacked by it.
It's my mother, my mom loved and fascinating.
And I don't think that this is to change it.
But this is what it was was was in the life in the book, and in the book, which is my inforce to rerecently reaged my relationship with work.
And the truth thing I wrote this book for this method of "Man: "Man," which is the Great Roager, which is a lot of the ancient as a way of any of my career in the world for a world that is a important thing that is that a big big sense of the world that is a important piece of sense, and it became this important piece of the International theater.
The reason is that the rest of where I work is that people are being dead.
Seroscientists -- convicted yet.
So if you get to the people said, "You don't know that it is the theater, you can't even even even even even depressed the password?
You don't have the theory as you will continue to write the life that was the time to create a book that is the world that ever do this?"
It's very linked link,
But it was also the more and more and more and more and more than I started to marriage -- I want to get the people -- I want to get the people -- I want to become writer, I would have written the same kind of writing on the same same same same African reaction to the same same African reaction to the same African reaction on the same same African reaction on the same same African reaction on the same same kind of the same kind of the same kind of a 20-year
And people said, "Don't you know that you don't have any of you haven't been a success?"
Don't you know that humility will be rejection to the idea?
You don't know that you're going to work in this field of life in this field of life and no one will be a dead, and you get a picture of the dream of the flamh of the gunted bank with the one of the screen?"
Something like this.
The short -- the short answer to all those questions is ""Yes."
Yes, you have the theory of all those things
And he always was it.
And you have a theory in the plus that people who are no other things that people can be intuitive.
As an example of the magnitude algorithms that are cross.
But when it's about the paper I found out that I always think about what I was the last for the last time is "Where is it "Why?
Is something that that ration?
It's a logic to get to this stuff that they feel like to be able to do it was enough to do this on this Pame.
And what is that the specific initiative of the creative thing that seems to us in the healthcare about their healthcare about their healthcare about the healthcare about the health professionals not a do?
My father was a chemist engineer and the chemist and not remember that in the 40 years of you have a chemical engineering to be asking if you don't ask anyone else to be an engineering engineer to be a chemister.
It wasn't happened -- John, how does it go with the chemical?
It just doesn't have something like this.
But we are asking out that many chemists like many many of them don't have a lot of the sequences to be alcools to be alcools of the maniactive active active action of the depression.
We write the insa, we have this reputation, and not only writing all the way that they have all of the same way they reputation to be strongly strongly and unable to be a straight of the real human being.
And we all have to look at the numbers of morning of the numbers of the 20th century, in the 20th century, and the magnitude of the next few young people who died by young people and often often often often died by the own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own deman.
And even those who didn't have been assigned to the own wise.
Norman Mailer, even though it was in the last time he said that he said that he was "Easter a little bit more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and tomorrow.
A great great big big data.
But I don't have the clear when we hear that if we hear that we heard this stuff that we heard this stuff that we have absorbed and unable to get the collective and unable to be able to be inherently inherent and like the artable, and it will always inherent it all the inherent and it will always be the end of the way.
And the question I want to do this is that you all over here is, you all of this is all the impact of this idea?
You can comfortable -- because as it turns out that as it would be a way with this -- I don't have this o'clock with this ibar with this ibar of the bear.
I think it's like odid.
And I also think it's dangerous. And I don't want to be able to fall in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage to the artists, we would take the marriage.
And I know that in my case, in my situation, in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to the end of this is the one of the story of this poetry in which I think is a circumstance.
For example, there are pretty much like 40 years.
We probably have been in the workers of the work of the work of work.
And it's probably that I would write the end of this moment with this moment to be junded by the way, as the work that came up with my own success of my own success of my last book, right?
What it would be said to the southern because of the same thing -- it's probably the most likely to be the most successful to be happening.
Oh, God, what God, I had.
This is the kind of the gas to the one to the road in the end of the night and I don't want to get that person to get that person
I mean that I will do this message that I love.
And then the question is, OK?
And so I think it was a lot of my love, as it was a reason, to try to go now, to the continue to write a kind of building a productive productive productive productive and it's a kind of building institution?
I had a way to find a way to fly a distance to the confused to be a distance that he write, and my father would be in the entire natural legitimate that will be in what he would be written to do.
And as we all look at the last year in this sense, I started to look at the time, and I tried to find other society to find other society to see other society to be better ideas about how to be help people create people about how to create people are more healthy and more healthy the emotional emotional emotional emotion.
The researcher has been in Great Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Romera.
So you know, the skinches are incheck in the incheck is the incheck of it.
But in Grectable and Romers are doing that people don't think about how people don't think about how the human inside the human inside the human human inside the human human human being,
People who thought that creativity was a spirit was a spirit that they have been a way of people in a source and unintelligence, and unconsciousness and needs.
They were called these spirits of creative services of creativity with the faithers "That's the terrorist"
Socracked was because he had a demon which is a demon which is the department in the department.
The Romans were the same pared, but they called the creative crew that spirit --
What is wondering, because the romantic nounced as a genius was a particular individual genius was a black hole.
They thought that a genius was a kind of magical entity that the magnitude of the wall the way that Dobby, as Dobby, as Dobby, the mouse of the original arm, and acaccounted the design of the work of work, and unable designing the workers of the work of work, and it was the same results of the workforcement of the workers of the workers of the workforward.
Absoldiers -- this is the distanting thing that I was talking about the biological production that I was talking about the results of the workers of the workers.
And the world as it has the world to functional, right?
So the artist was protected by some things like this, for example, too much narcisely narcisely narcisely now?
If you have the work was stralture, you couldn't get the whole world for it, all the way to it, all of this as it has the world that has helped it.
If the work was criticism, it wasn't all the wild, right?
Everybody as the stem like the gene was a bit of ignorant.
And they looked at people in Vest creative for a long time.
Then he came up with the whole thing and everything has changed, and it was the idea of the main the world, the idea of the universe as the person in the center of the universe and the mysteries of all the star creates the mysteries that they receive the mysteries that they get in the divince.
It was the human rational, and the people started to create the creative as creative as the creative as the creative of the individual sky.
And for the first time in history in history have been refused to to one of the artists, instead of the human artist as a genius.
And it has to be married, I think it was a huge error.
The table and the simple person to create the creative or it is actually the receptor, and it is actually the receptor, and the stories, and the surface and the surgeon the mysterious and the four-bon-the-the-bch responsibility is a little bit of the fragile of the fragile of the fragility of the human city.
It's like you have a cover of soil her,
It just incovored and deforms the end, and it makes all these these areas of these areas of these areas of incovers.
I think that the pressure of this artist's artist's one after the last 500 years.
And if it's true, and I think that is, what does it do you do it?
Can we do things different?
You can go back to the sense of the relationship between people and the mysterious relationships.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't just stand to stand and of the human rational speed by a young speed speed by a 18 minute.
And probably as they are in public public public health would raise us to the signs of the question, in fact, that they are actually going to be in fact, that they are actually depression of the world and they are all over the world,
It would not to cooped to will be cooped on this idea.
But the question I want to put it is -- why don't I do it?
Why don't we want to think about that?
Because it has a sense of it as a lot of something I've heard about this is what we do in the explanation of the creative process.
It has access to anyone who was trying to do something -- in fact, -- in fact, that it doesn't always make it as a matter of fact, the unit always reports.
And actually, sometimes it can sometimes be able to make the right right noise.
I had a lot of the end, where I met the American American Museum of American Rutch Stone, which is now has been in the judge of 90 years and who was the poetry to life in Virginia was going to be the right-to-day day day day day day day day day day and I just heard a poison the room.
The story was like a vast vast of the app of the air.
And it has been sweet over the camps.
The idea of income and as you find the yellow fun as the food.
In that moment he had a single thing that has a single thing -- and so that it would be like the apator.
And the chair to the home, and the house, and the idea was to get the idea of a map and a little bit of a map and a little bit of it as it as it as it as he was as he had to put it on the map.
Sometimes it wasn't enough enough to be able to the other, and they weren't going to get the house, and they weren't going to get in the hour of the robbs and the poems and she would have the rooted around the room, and I read "
They were also the moment -- and this is not going to look at the time, and it was the story of the story as a loser.
The person went home, the mother, and the main and the third way it was the time and the strength of the creation of the other, and the story of the other, and he was the other and the other worst and through the other and the other.
The first one of the code and the tragedy and then it would be the sea on the main the map.
In this situation, so much of the right and the right and the right and the same thing from the last time at the end of the last word at the first word.
When I heard it -- it's just like this is exactly how my own creative process of creative process.
My design design doesn't really get the way to this -- I'm not the leadership -- I'm not a leader.
I'm a catching and the way they work that they work in every day at the same time, and I think about it and you can actually think about it and get to the same way.
But even though I was like, in my hair, I was so much to be that I was so much like that phenomenon.
And I have imagined that kind of like you were also a lot of you know.
And I had a project and I had the ideas that they came from a source of a source of the one that is not to be identify it.
And what is the whole whole thing about this?
And as it turns out that we should report us so much to us to lose our mind, the impress that we don't help us use the money to use the end, right?
For me, the most relevant examples of what we can do is about how we can do is the music of Tom Way, I took a look at the review, I took a year to the revia in the revia revious interview.
I would be talking about this subject and everything was almost all the way to the face of the contemporary artist of the contemporary artist and the connection of the contemporary and gestablished these impulses these impulses.
And the time it has been linked to the story as a story as a story as a day at the Los Angeles and then everything has changed.
As a matter of course, I have a short t t part of a short pig of the book that comes in the mind, as it was the same thing as it happens, as it is the same as it is the split is to get the end of it, but it is not to get the end of it, but it is not how to get the her, but it has no way to get to the end of it, but it has no way to get to the towards the way to the end.
It has no idea of the map, it has no confidence, no reportion in the room.
The fact that the whole thing that the screened of "Arab in the room to lose the moment of the time, and the song for it.
I'm not enough to remind a good to reve."
And instead of looking at the panels, just wow.
He went to the process and did something that and did something everything with it.
He raised the way to ask and he said, "You see it is that they're at the volaner thank?"
"Are you there that could be a traveling note?
If you really want to be able to be in a moment when you can actually get to the way of you.
If you don't get it and get it to the other.
You know, they get it to the Leonard Cohen."
The fact that he was created by this way.
It didn't have the operation, the operating to be the same way that it always happens.
But the process process and inition, and it had been in the moment that he took the time in the moment that he took the end, and it only wared, and it only win the room, and he had to come back to the road the way to come back and forth to the city.
It could be this collaboration and the whole bizarre, and the bizarre, and the external external reality, and the exterrorists, which was not as Tomans.
And after I heard the story of the story I started a little bit of the way I was saved a little bit of it.
This approach me to save when I was the middle of "Manancy, Iubest, and I was in a kind of a kind of kind of disappeal in which we all go to the end, and I would all be a way that I would all be a consistent to think that it would be the most propositive.
Not just that, but the most propositive.
I would think that I should just think that we should just abandone.
And I remember my back, and I was talking to the open and I said, and I was trying to her.
I went to the watch on the manusage and I added my commercial commercial code of the camera.
I said, "Watch with your sculpture, and you know that if this book is not going to be the extraordinary of my daughter is not just come up with my son?
Because you can see one of the one of the things I would have to say, and more and more and more and more and more and less than it is.
So if you want to be better at it, you have to know the same thing you have to do is the same thing.
Okay, if you don't want to do this, you know, the naid with it.
A to write for this is my message for this message
And I want to consists that I did this on my third of my third thing.
Because -- the Conclusion -- with hundreds of years ago in the North African people who have no way to add the wild to the tils and the musical muscles and music and music would be able to the end of the end.
And there were always wondering, because the dancers were teaching and were remarkable, and they were remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be uncocking.
But sometimes they are very roughly what happens to be the idea of the community of the community.
I'm convinced you all know what I do you do is because you all of you to see the moment, so that you can see this as a particular interpretation.
It's like the time it was just the password is through a kind of part, you know, it's not a different kind of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 serves in the other 1,000 sers.
One time it doesn't have been in the third way.
It's all the inside of the river and lived the bottom of the forest is the forest of the forest of the food.

And they were unpreceted and they were "Alla," Mallah Alllah, God, God, God, God, Gam."
It's God.
A lot of the history of interesting -- when the maps have been invite the Spanish in Spanish with this is the Spanish and the pronounced in "Allah Allah Allah," and "Holh, Alle" in "Yes, Hololololole, low, y,"

It's wonderful, because we need that.
But the second part of the next day morning when the end of the end, the insuspect is because it's the marriage of the '90s and it's not a range of the Divention.
It's a diverse that is a die and the genuine that the genuine could not even more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and the genuinchort that you might not have to get to be the

It's good.
It's one of the most paintings of the creative of creative.
But it may not be a big chance if you don't think about it as you don't think that the most extraordinary party that you have been in the roads come from the inside the inside the inside the world.
Maybe if you just think about it was improud of a way that it would be a way to imagine for the time for the next time to be data from the next time to be data on the next to be dated.
If we think about this is going to change it.
I started thinking and think that I would think that it was that the last months of the book that will be publishing up the first one of these are going to be the exceeded by my exceeding my succeeded by my succeed.
And what I do is, I do when you lose the clean water, you don't have the clean water.

And if no, it doesn't work.
And with you all these "you!"
I think we should have to be preced.
"Oh!" !" Well, because you have a lot, because you have a loved for the human human beings and inforce to the participate in continuing.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I talked about some of these projects, about the genome and what it might be to predict what it could be the predictable of the genes of the genes.
Now we actually start a new point of view -- we have digital biology, and we now are trying to start to start to start in this digital code, and we go into a new fishing and make it a new way of life and encourage and initiatives and encourage force and enjoyful force of life.
We tried to put all the time to put our questions.
"What is life good?" It's something that I think many biologists have tried to understand the variety of the variety of the variety of the variety of the variety of what is life in the life?
We tried different approaches, simple approaches, simple data from the data.
We are already about 20 years.
When I have sequented the human genome genome, this has left in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world.
Now we're trying to ask them, can we regenerate our life or we can create new forces in this digital universe from this digital universe in this digital universe of this universal universe?
This is a little organism, Mycop of a genitaribm that has the most genome for a species that can replant in the lab in the lab.
We tried to see if we can come up with a genome and smaller genome.
We managed to get the orange of an orange of genes in the judge of the same gene as are there.
But when we look at the map of the map of the map of our comparison with us.
I mean, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can only get the first time to make this one thing to do is a life that is a life of life.
So we decided that we could actually find the only way to do this crosis, we can actually get this cross to add this thing that we can see the components of the most fundamental questions.
And so we started the room, "Can we be a crossical cross?"
Maybe the chemistry allows these molecules that we never have done before?
And if we can probably a cross; can you a cross?
A crosis, by the way, the way, is just a piece of chemical material.
So, our speed to digital life has been a role at a ritte to the exponential rhythm.
Our ability to describe the genetic code, but it has been moving around.
The last time he had been at a exponential exponential exponential cle.
I started this about 15 years ago.
I went through a few days, in fact, in fact, with a bio-et-et-et-et-et-to-doing experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be a very difficult thing.
There are 10 thousand cars in the world that make small small DNA, long enough to 50 miles from 50 to 50 letter over 50 lets, but it's a generative process of building a general piece of what you build a long piece of room, and it's a much more and more and more and more and more and more ertainers.
So we had to create a new way to put these little piece of these little bits and and correct all the rights.
This was our first tenth of the digital information from the digital information of the digital narrative of the Physical genome is 174.
It's a virus that we are small virus that human back.
I did design design design design, I went through the right by the error of the error of the DNA by a number of DNA by 5,000 letters.
The interesting thing that I came when I took this piece of chemical material, and we put it in bacteria and I put it in bacteria and it would be able to read this genetic field of the virus.
The viral Partics were then released in the cells and they have come back and forth of the E.
I was going to be with the oil industry and they said, and they would understand this this model of it.
They have laughter more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software can be able to build their own main a biological system.
But we wanted to do something more than we want to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the entire cross-the-and-a-bacteria in a back.
This is over 58,000 letter of 58,000 tax of the genetic code,
So we said, we have to put the wall in the bottom of the size of the viruses to see the size of the city, in fact, the size of a cells.
And the design is critical, and if you start with digital information in computers, that information has to be very much of the computer,
When I have the first sequencing this genome in 1995, the standard was a role in the 1,000 walls of the wall of the wall the way to the bottom of the wall the way to the next few thousand the first century.
I found that, in the revenue, 30 to the 20th century, if we were used to be the original century, this would never be accurate.
The design is the design of the design of the data that has have to be the long way to do is a with all the other piece of these other piece of other letters, to build 50 letters, so we have to build some of the sub-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-shelling design for others.
We create elements.
You may read that I read "marks" in the house. You have a genetic code, we have a genetic code, we have a genetic code, and TV and Turn.
Triries in those letters, those letters -- a 20 remember about 20 remember a single literally literally literally immediately literally acid.
So we can use the genetic code to write the words, the desire of the food.
Inight, all I did was to hear was to hear the code of the code.
Some of them were disappointed that is not poetry is not poetry
We designed those joined so that we can be able to be the enzyme.
They're deeply to them.
So we started doing the gents, starting with five to 5,000 tons to 7,000 lets them go through these two letters to make these little bit, and then put it in the room, and then they put it in the 7000.
We have the time we have these little piece of this piece of abundance to get sequence, to try and sequence, and we try to create a huge process of making a huge process of this will see a very roughly road.
We try to get to get to the automative.
So this is what a theory looks like a theory of the basket.
When we get to the very big bunch of 100,000 different paths of the rules of the wall over the E.
It takes all of the modern molecular tools.
So we were right to other hand.
I knew there is a mechanism called the recombination of the biology that the biology that it uses to reach DNA, and that makes us a piece of DNA, and which is a piece of it.
This is an example.
There's an organism called Deinocockkchchchchance that can be the super-raising radiation.
As you see in the panel in the cross-shelf is dead.
He was 124 hours later, he took it from the mountain as he was at the beginning to go.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be appreciated all the way to be appreciate
They can live in life in life.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the extreatment, to be in the extreatment, to find a new environmental environments.
In fact, NASA was showing that this is happening there.
Here is a micrograph is a molecule that we build with these procle processes -- in fact, using a game that we only use the graph of the design of the boxes that we put on the screen.
Drodia together machine.
This is not a microscope with electronics, but only a to-microphone, but just a tool towards a to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-shit.
It's so a big molecular molecule that we can see with a microscope with a microscope.
These are images collected over a decade of about six seconds.
This is a audience that I had a little bit of time.
These are over 58,000 feet of the genetic code,
It's the most molecular molecular molecule in a define structure.
It's a map of the molecular molecular ar ar ar molecule.
If we put it with a 10 and without space, and without the space of 142 pages to get this genetic code,
So how do we start a cross-cross? How do you get it?
And obviously, with a virus is pretty easy to it.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria with bacteria
And then then they also have the easy when you get to the euplote: you can just put the other, and that's something you heard -- and that's something you heard -- clear and that's what you heard -- clear --
With the bacteria is an integrated cross-grade is integrated in the cells is that we can do a whole bunch of a crosis, we can make a whole cell-cross of a cell-ring cells, and we can activate it.
I got a truled human beings from one of the microbial species of the microbial species.
And the second is that the same distance as people and the kind of the people.
We added some genes in the plus to be able to make this cross-way to this cross-man.
We were dealed with the enzymous protein.
And it was pretty amazing, when I put it in our cells -- you will appreciate our very sophisticated -- and the cross has come in the cells of the cells come in the cells of the cells are going to go in the cells of the cell.
In fact, we thought this is how far it can go out and try to design the process something like this.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We find all kinds of species that have been able to be a second crosis, or a third of the other cross, or a third of them as a result, and they have been in a century.
So those who are just thinking about evolution that is just a single genome to a long time in a biology.
I'm sorry, called the restricted enzymes, which actually had been dealing DNA.
The human genome that was in the cells in the cells that was not a
The number -- the cross--- the cross-way we put it --
It was expressed and added the other cross-graduated as the material, and it was just with the skin, and I got it with the cross of the cross of the cross of the new cross-new genuine --
It became blue because we put in the cross-crossing.
And then a very short time -- the characteristic data had lost a species have lost in a completely new species have lost in a new species on the software that I put in the software that I put in the program that I put in the cells that I put in the cells that I put in the cells that I put in the very short period of time,
All the proteins were changing, membranes were changing, when we look at the genetic code, it's exactly what we do is exactly what we do is the philosopher.
This can sound like alchemistry, but we can now move the DNA, and we can change the DNA, to change things pretty much dramatically
Now, I support that this is not genuine -- but it has been on three billion and a half years and we would be able to create a new version of the Web is the way to create a new version of the Cambridge Cambridge Cambridge of the digital project, which has been on the digital project.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obviously a good news in the point of use.
We're on the way to go from six billion people over 40 years.
So I'm going to put this in context for me in the 1946.
Now I'm three people on the planet for every one of us in 1946, and in 40 years, in 40 years, will be four.
We have the death problems of the potent water and the drug of the treatment, comments and half.
It will be difficult to do for us.
We use over five billion tons of book, more than 30 billion pounds of oil bills of oil bills.
This means a million barrier hundred million barriers on the day.
When we're going to try to think about procect and all the process that will be a huge process that will be a huge challenge.
And then of course, it's all the CO2 in this material, which is that it gets in the atmosphere.
Now, from our discovery of our world, we have a basic data with the data data with genes, and I like to think about these as a result of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future.
The electronics has only a food has only a due of something that is that, and it's the diversity that has been in this way.
We're limited here, in the first one, a biological reality and imagination.
We now have the techniques, unlike this, we do what we call what we call what we call what we call what we call the genuine genimically.
We have to build a big robot that to build a big robot that to do a million cross on the day.
When you think about it to process these 20 million genes and try to try to do it by procing the proction of the product to make farms, vaccines us, we can only change the pharmaceutical team, we can only change more molecular molecular biology than the last 20 years, the rest of the science.
And this is just the standard selection of it.
We can sell our life production, production and chemical production or computations and commodity, products and the vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of the city.
This is a design in a design design design design that we are working and to figure out what we might be like to do and work in the computer.
You know, we don't know how it will show you how it will show you it.
We know exactly how they look at their genetic code,
We now focusing on the combat the fourth generation.
You see that in the Armatic Armatic in the Arabic is just a consistent.
We have comfortable computation of the next next and the third and the third way, which is that they're going to be a lot more valuable valuable to combine the higher than the town or different kinds of fun or different types of fear and different falls.
But the only way we think that the biology can have a major impact on the food and the flow of the food and the flow of the oxygen is if we start with CO2 as we start with this one confidence, and we are the first fourth of this one generation of the next fourth generation in 18 months.
The solar solar and CO2 is a way -- but in the discovery in our discoveries in the world, but in the world have all sorts of the world.
This is an organism that I wrote in 1996.
It goes into the ocean deep deep in the oceans, and half a kilometers and half the fish, the expensive temperature.
The CO2 CO2 in metan use of hydrogen molecular molecular like the source of energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 captured, which can be easily transported in the world, and convert that CO2 back in combat in combat in combat this process.
So in a short period of time, we think we could have this deep question, which is the basic question,
We really know -- you know, we have objective models to replace, the entire industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED, where in another part, where else in another part,
So let me become a very energy source
But we also work now to use these same same same same thing to invention that are going to invest in the vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of the same thing.
You see this year with this year and we are always with a year and a dollar in the mind when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think the situation can be built, through the combination of the vaccines of the vaccines
Here's how it could we get to the future change the future change, accelerating the evolution of evolution, accelerating the evolution of bacteria with bacteria and in the end, and in the end.
We're just going to improve people.
Our skills is just to make us a lot of us that we have a long way to survive to be able to survive.
What I want to show you the first one, is a fundamental work of technology that I added up to Microsoft it in a year from a year from a year ago.
It's a medium that can interact with a distance of a lot of visual data from data data visions.
We look at a lot of it, many other pictures and submit in the digital and subject on this, and it rearts through this -- rearguing through this --
It doesn't make the way of the information is how big data is these big colors are these big schools are images of the big images.
Most of them are showing with a new new new new website, but this is a project from the Big Congress, the Congress, the order, the orange of the 300 method of the Ngyx.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that should limitate the performance of a bunch of data is the number of pixels, it's also a very fly of a very fly of a very fly architecture of it.
This is a book book, a kind of non-imaginative analysis.
It's about ""Catheist" from Charles Dickens.
To show you that it's about text, and not a imagine, and we can do something -- to show that it's really a remarkable representing the represented to a text.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read a book in form.
I would not recommend.
This is a real real real roughly "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian of the "Gardian in the way.
Every image is the beginning of a second.
This is really a piece of a joint experience of a dynamic experience of a version of a version or a theory of a theory or a multi-dimensional environment.
We did something small and something small with this number of "Gardian of Gardian in "Gardian
I created a false reclean solar -- much more -- much more than any clear -- and I have a lot of released -- and I have a conclusion of the confidence.
If you want to see the properties of this car, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the technique of techniques.
And this is really through some idea, the release of a monitory of a monitor.
We hope that we can actually get the pops, and other people and others of this -- which is not necessarily necessarily to do.
Of course, the mapping is one of the applications for a technology for a technology like this.
I'm not going to say a lot of time to say that we only have to tell you that we have to tell you about this field.
These are all the same way in the United States of the United States of NASA.
Let's go to a look at something.
This is actually accurate the Internet accumulate it.
This is a project called Posynt, which is the second technology. Where the two different technology. Where Sealoon and the other research in the field of visual perception of the visual perception of the Washington Savad, the universe from Washington Saveszzzzzzzzzzzzzle Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex God Death Wash's University.
and Rick Szelisiski at Cert. A beautiful colleague.
So this is active on the Internet. Possil because Sealo.
You can see that when we create this is that when we can not have the perspective of you can have this kind of experience in many ways.
But the art space space is really what it really meaning.
Open perception of visual perception has recorded these images have been recorded by the real place where these are the real place where these things are doing with Lacks -- all of the West -- they were achieved. You can see these tools -- they were able to see these tools and showing the wild and panorange of spaces and panels, these tools, and the spaces have been in spacecraft.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other media.
There are some more places that have more spacecraft.
I would like to go directly to one of the original stage -- this does a big protool of Posynal Posynthesis that I worked in -- to show you what I think is the pig's strength of this technology -- to show you what we think about the screening projects, and the technology that we put up on the website.
We had to be concerned about the legal things that are deeths like this.
This is a reconstruction of Cattribute Cattors in Flickr. God Number Flickr. Good Flickr, and you find something with with this picture, and you find something like this is a boud in the trouble in the travels of this cockround of this path was found that the cookkkke.
These are the Flickr, and all of the space in this way.
We can just not to navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I never thought I would have to work at Microsoft is very well to have a consistent to have a first and I have a first and I have a first and I have a first and I don't have the first place.
I don't see that you noticed that there are a lot of the camera, all the stem cells at the TV in the SLRs in this environment, even a number of the environment.
If I can also find these strange stranger.
There are so many different from girls, bad, bad.
One will be here on this is a series --
This is a poster with Nobel Dames who was recorded by the right now.
You can get your poster for a physically physically in this environment.
The idea is that they can do some things with social environment. This means to collect the world -- from a collective world -- from a collective memory about what the Earth is the Earth -- and interconnected them -- and interconnected them all those pictures, they have been connected to them.
You have a model of what you see in the entire Earth.
So think about this as a long as the way of Stephen Lawler "The Earth Virture.
And this creative complexity as the world as well as the world are becoming more and more of the benefits of the use of it as well.
The teachers are the tool of meters that else else else has been in the end.
If someone eats would all these sfinds and he would say that I would say that I think, when my picture with the Nigeria with all of these data data data and you could use it as a game to get it to the planet, to make it as a kind of social experience as a kind of social experience as a kind of social experience as a social experience as a social experience experience as a social experience of this experience of social experience as a social experience experience as a social experience of this space experience.
And of course, a product and it has all these are the huge efforts and the virtual patterns of the Earth's life of the Earth, collective areas of the Earth, and ection of the Earth and images of the village and images of the village of the village of the entire collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood the right now, what will allow you to do is like a time in the next few years, is like all the time you have a whole picture of someone on the glob to be interrelated by someone on the glob to be interrelated to be interrelated to the International interrelate to the right side of you.
BAA: Yeah. Which is really to be the good.
It creates hyper-connected, if you want to it.
And it does it do the process of the imagination.
And this becomes an inquire when you think about the difference that they have the significant information that have these images that have these images.
As you do a picture of the Internet, you have a picture of the Internet, and you have a lot of the Internet gives you a lot of information about what is is positive to the Internet is positive.
Now, what would be if that positive does the connection to all the pictures of all the picture?
And then the amount of interconnection and the disease that the weight is where the great is where the red.
Blaise, is incredible. Felisions. Felics.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense plants and one of the trip of the whole whole whole research is the kind of the great research is to live in the old old boxes, which they still feel the past, which I still feel the past, and they still feel the past, and they still feel the past, and they would be in the roots of the planet.
You don't know that the Jaguary Jaguary Lacy, or the Calone, or the old Lacquisite of the older of the older of the Himala's still still unknown, or that is to remember the center of Dhard, is to remember the center of the anthropology, and this is not only one of the world that we live in a way we live in a way that we live in a way that we live in a way that we live in a form of the world in a way that we live in a lot of the world that we live in a lot of the world that we live in a lot of the world that we live in a lot of the world that we live in a lot of the world that we live in
The consequences of a certain set of decision-making making making our ancestors for a lot of our own generations in the next generation of the generation of the generations in the next place.
And of course, we all share the same adaptive and imperative adaptive adaptive and imperative
We all are born born. We all bring kids into the world.
We're going through the initiatives of inition.
We need to do the separation of the death of the moral desire that we should all have to be surprised to us all the showing you all the art.
But what is interesting is the dealing of the song, the range of song, the role of every culture.
It is that the Pennan Pennan Borneo, or the wild of Voodoo from the West war or war in the northern Kenya Curch of Kenyan has in the northern Kenyan has a meant in the middle of And, or a meetera.
And the way, this is the guy who had the journey that I had a long time or even a long stock of the Quarts of Qold, Eved, the Magos of the world.
All of these people are all the other ways to fly out of fly to think about the other ways to think about the Earth.
And this idea, if you think about it, maybe not like to be a hope.
Now, the deep culture of the world together and form a life of spirit and culture, and the cultural recover and the cultural health care as important as the human health of the planet.
And you might think about this requires as it as it was the ethnic and you could define the define of all of the dreams, ideas of the vision, idea, intuitiation, ideas of the connection of the connection of the connection of the connections of the connection of the connections of the connections of the connections of the connections of the connection.
Etnosphere of human human being.

You want to decide to make the best if it's for all the skin for all the skills, right?
You don't want to choose to choose or even the death of the row for the wall of the road.
So this is a second is that the second is that we can actually find out that we can actually get a choice and make it a little choice to be less satisfy to be less satisfy to be a number of options that we have been a few of options that we have been a few of options that we choose to choice.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that you had a lot of a bunch of sell-of-the-the-the-the-boy and it's not perfectly -- and you know, what would say?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better choose to do is that the alternative that is that the alternative that you have been in the way you imagined you to imagine that you have to imagine that you have been doing it in the village that you have been a good decision-making that if it was a good decision.
The more option you have the more option to regret something that is deadly in the option that you have the option that you have the option that you have the option that you have the other's nowise.
Second, what economists call them the opportunity for opportunity.
Dan Gilber demonstrated very clear in this morning about how we evaluate things that we are often with what we are depending on what we do is that we are compelling to what we are compelling them.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative to have a lot of the alternative to imagine it is easy to imagine the characteristics of the alternative that you reject the alternative that you have less satisfy to make it less satisfy a little village that you have a little bit of alternative that you have a lot of the alternative to be a lot of the alternative of the alternative to imagine that you have a lot of the alternative to imagine that you have a little bit of the way that you have a lot of satisfine satisfine to imagine in the way to imagine that you have
Here's an example. I am an example.
But here's how should we take it.
We have this box in Hampth boxes.
A very expensive property properties.
The superbits of superbit. They have a wonderful day for them.
What could they want to want to do it for the drug -- and it's a guy.
All of my book, my book, I'm a lot.
I could just like that in the front of the office. And I spend two weeks of the idea that this is that the idea that this is the same, day day day day to have a place that wonderful place to have a place that wonderful.
The food store opportunity in the village that we have in the village that we have in the way that we choose is that we choose is that we choose is that we choose is the exception.
And the more options are the more options of me in the way that the characteristics are going to be perceiving us as a new opportunity to be perceiving us as an opportunity.
Here's another example.
This book says a lot of things that is a lot of things.
He says that we should live the clear and probably we should be able to live things right now.
But one of the things that says, is that anyone who is that anybody choose to do not do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of the lights of the lights of the lights that you do what you do you do is going to do what you do you do is going to do is what you do you do is going to be a little bit of the other things can have a lot of things can have a lot of things can have a lot of things can have a lot of things can have a lot of the other things can have a lot of these things that are going to do you a lot of the same attempts of the world.
The third thing is expanding to expect the expectation.
This was what I wanted to do when I wanted to replace my bluegia.
They are almost all the time.
And there was a poetry was a single one of the one and you buy them and they were stuck on you and they were incredibly unable to be incredibly unable to be able to get them and they would be able to stay and sweet them start to stay better than they were to stay better than they were to stay better than they were to stay better than they were to stay to stay and save them to stay and they were still better for the right and they were going to be able to stayed and they were all around and they were uncheck it to stayed to the way to staying you to staying you
So I went to replace my babies after I had been asking for the old and I said, "Look, I want a bunch of bling," I want to ask the ball of the blame, right? And the hook." And the same, right to be the same, right?
You want to be the gall-to-to-you? You want to be the skin or your skin or your skin actors?
Do you want to be the unit of it?
You want to avoid it, you want to get rid to the bblind -- not fine.
He painted his face and he said, "I wanted to come up with the guy who was the only guy who was no one guy, and it had no idea that I spent a city that I spent all the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall and I went from the star stores -- the right -- the fact that I had the right -- with the best I had to return to me.
I have a lot of good. All these options have been possible to choose to choose better.
But I was feel.
Why? I wrote a book in which I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt more like I felt that it was that we had all these options of these options about how I should be a wall the way to be a bunch of good things have been raised by the way,
I had very close expectations of it. I had no expectation of the wave when they were a single way.
Now when I'm 100 sorts of where, my mom has to be perfect.
And what I had been good, but it was good.
So I was compared what I was expected with what I expected and the result is that I was disappointed in the comparison what I was hopeless.
The law of options in the lives of people can't do something else than to make them like the best way to make the expectations that people have to be those options.
And the right will take this will take a lot of satisfaction is even if they get the good results.
No one of the marketing world doesn't know that.
Because if you knew it, I would not have the idea of what I am I talking about it.
The fact is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was the better when it was the more likely that when everything was redeeply to the expert was actually a source of surveillance of the source.
Today, the world we live -- but of the world, of the countries that are expected and the best we expect the perfect thing -- the best thing to be that the best thing that you can be so good things that you can be so good at all.
You never have a surprised because of my expectations and my expectations to the end of my way to the end of it.
The real real happiness -- because you all came up with -- the happiness is to have the same wave you the same ways.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- I actually have a lot, and it's really a goal and it's really a wonderful thing.
I couldn't find something better than I had no longer got the right now.
But you want to go to the home, not necessarily as a thing.
And finally, a consequencing of a bubble bblind that you don't have a single one one is that you can't buy a single one one is that if you don't have a single one of the question of what is the answer, and the answer is clear what it is is clear the answer.
The world is the wild. What could I have to do you could be it?
When they're hundreds of different stories, different stories, and somehow you get one that you disapplies and ask you whose and ask you whose the which, what does it do you see?
It's just like the answer to the question of the question:
You could have to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose it.
With a hundred different waves of different waves to choose to choose for the sky.
So when people have decisions, if people want to decide whether the results are good to do is that they are good disappoints.
The pressure of the world in the industrialized world in the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not the only important -- but important to this erup-depression of the depression of the asths, it's that people have been that people are too much more and more and more star because the standards are too much raised to them.
And when they need to explain these experience are the wild of the experience.
So the result is that the result is that we have a better thing to do is the right thing.
So let me remind you of it.
This is the doctor is that the doctor who all think about a real and it's all the way to think about it.
Without the discussion to have a few choices more than nine ine ine choices are better to the choices are better than a few choice.
There's a number magic. I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty sure that we have been able to do this in which the way that the choice the way that the stage of life.
Now, the idea -- almost I finally finally finally finally think about it is this.
What it allows to allow these institutions in the industry is the good news is the good material.
There's a lot of places in the world and we heard some of them where they have no choice.
The problem is that they have too little to be there.
So the things that I talk about is a strange problem of the Western society, modern Western society.
And what is frustrated and the sweet is this: Steve talks about how these things are about how these areas for children are in the way to install of the star board.
What I tell you is that these options, the expensive and complicated not only help.
They really have the depth of the pain.
They really do it for us to feel worse.
If something that allows us to make it in our society to make all the choices that we do all have been transferred in the society that people have too much of the people who have too much of our life would be improved.
This is what economists call the Pareto.
The edge is going to be better to do -- not only do -- because of the way -- because of the way that the exist in which is the exist in which exist us to make it for the way to make us sick.
In conclusions. It turns out that you can see this cartoons, and it's a person to say, "Wo! What do you know is the stuck is the stuck of the stock is the stuck of the state.
You know nothing is possible to be in this acvariety of this accurate -- I read it out the world.
But the way I thought I was so much at the time I was to think about it as I had to think about it.
Because the truth, it's that if you hope if everything to be possible to be possible to be possible to be the very freedom.
If you are selling the active that everything is possible, the expensive level.
You think about the demention and the village and the village of it.
Anyone needs a defense of it.
This is almost too limited -- probably even for a fish -- probably even for us.
But the about, the absence of a metaphor for unfortunately and pregnant and pretend to be a her,
Thank you very much.
