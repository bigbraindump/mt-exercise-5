And the year I showed these two disorders to demonstrate that the polar polar that the most of the last three million years was the size of the last three million years was a small size of the size of a small small statement.
But this mornity of this specific issue because it doesn't show the grass.
The polar polar is, in a way, the heart of global climate system.
It goes on and the extended and the flaw of the summer.
The next slide that I will show you a quickly going to be a fast-scale of the last 25 years.
The pemancy is the marcaught with smell.
How you see the blue of blue catch.
This is the annual for the bird time on the sea for the time.
And it turns out the summer.
Asad guessed guy, with a dad old old or more than you can see that it's almost almost like the sangs of a body.
In 25 years of the time it came from this to this one.
This is a problem because the quote of the deep of the fish around the ocean.
where it is a massive amount of carbon carbon sweet that when they disgusting the micro-box meters of micro-organisms.
Compartial pollution of global warming in the atmosphere of global warming could take this extreme if we go to this extreme way to this point in the extreme point of view.
Alask-lacking in Alaska metaphors of metaphor is at the water southern of water.
The Katey Walter Katey Walter was on the University of Alaska little tered, a little lady at another lash of the past.
Oo: Oo! Al Gore: Oh, that's the question is if we are going to be here.
And it's a huge reason for this enormous wordless than the Groends in the north of the north.
This is a race that everybody.
But the volumes are much bigger as a long time.
This is Kangerush Kangerussum Groenland.
If you want to know how the creation of the sea level of the roads on the street that is where it gets to the sea.
These fast fast is very fast.
And at the other end of the planet, Antarctica of the planet.
The last few people are reported in the continent that they reported the continent of the Antarctics is negative of the Antarctics on the season of the island of the island of the insult is submarine submarine to.
This is the equal in the street of the sea level like in Groenlands.
In Himalaya, the third of the third way you see the new sex of the new vision, which is going to be a few years ago,
40 percent of the population of the world of the world of the water in these topirs.
Today, this guess is the source of the water-for this city of the city
The distance of the raised.
But when it goes on to the water, you can get the water of the water.
In California was a 40-percent scarding the sea of the sea in Sierra.
This is the water of the water reach.
And predicting, as you read read is serious.
And the whole global tricks that led to a dramatic creative credit of incentives of incentives of incentives of the entire global resistance of the entire global candy of the entire global cause.
And the disasters are growing up with a whole rate with a graduate rate with the precedence.
four times more in the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the 75 years of the 75 years.
This is an absolutely unsustainable.
If you look in context in context you can see what happens.
In the last five years I added 70 million tons of carbon dioxide every 24 million tons every day in the ocean.
Look at the end of the same time of the Pacific area from America, walking to the Western individual subcontinent, where a radical radicals in the ocean of the oceans.
The biggest because the only one of the global warming global global warming that represent 20 percent of the fossil of fossil fuels.
The pole is a problem and the skin is the most serious issue is the most serious one.
The United States is one of the two big empowerment of China.
And the proposing was to build a lot of factory for a good charge.
But we start to see a change all.
This is the ones that have been anused in the last few years with proposal.
Everybody is a fight in our country.
And the carbon and the industry and oil has spent a hundred billions of billions of dollars in the last year --
And I promoted what is an hour.
This image of a mindset of something like this.
In the preparation of Cracial Tenness, a billion, a billion, of the chart was imprast.
You probably see the stirs.
This is, on the whole bunch of the other side of the Cracial Sintent Cracial Cracial Dise.
One of the clock of the good industry of Cracial industries that was happened.
Video: â™« Frosy, the man with the cars, is a happy shape, and you see it.
He is from abundance, here in America, and help to create the economy.
Froy, the way with the car, it becomes the same.
It's accessible and a worker and workers are spring their jobs.
Al Gore: This is the major source of Virginia in Virginia.
The most of the way on the highest degree of Massey is Calley Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship: IGore, Nania Pelosi, Harry Reifhabar habar habar habar don't have what I talk about.
Al Gore: So this is the same as Alic Protect Climate has launched the second campaign.
This is one of them of them, one of the one of them.
Video: Actor: The COALergy us see climate change as a very serious threshold.
That's our main is to spend a big amount of money for the public forces that to help us show us the truth of the good thing about the bedles.
The truth is that the skin is not dirty of the bedwar.
We think it's curious -- and I get rid and good.
So you don't get to the climate change for the climate change for the climate change.
You can see that in our way.
Video: The Carfine -- Carcovering a graduate about it.
So let's make a check of this town of installation of this goal.
Oh, I say, "Masinaria is about noise.
But this is the sound of the coal.
And as the book are the goals that the main global warming technology, the global quiring technology that you see here.
Look at the same time is the technology of the good technology of the goal of the goal.
Al Gore: In the alternative advice of the economic challenges of the economic challenge, the economics and the problem with nation-problem security and the problem of the problem of the Gore:

The answer that I get to all the way to the whole addiction of the carbon of the carbon of the moton, but the dirty of the dirty of the dirty of the way you want.
But now we have a new solution to the notion of the novels to the incurious nocy.
You can get America with 100-percent electricity -- 10 years ago in 10 years ago in 10 years ago ago in 10 years ago.
A plan to put America in the way to go to the wind of global warming and to help us stop global warming.
And the end of the solution that is to help us solve our problems.
You get America. You get America. You get more of it.

If you want to get to the bad.
We need to get it to the way, fast.
Thank you very much of thank you very much of those.
At the TED I did a TED I did an introduction to LHC.
And I promised to come back and give you a data about how this is working.
So here's my mom. And for those who hasn't here the biggest experiment, which was the biggest science that was asked by 27 -- Cumfertilizer -- the Scococover or is to recreate the conscious conditions of a billion times of a fraction from a billion times on the way.
It's extremely quote.
This is the Genevela.
We do photographs of these minds of "Big Bangs" inside the decades.
I work on this one.
On the 10 year I went down the year I started the first time I started to the first time.
And this image was made of ATLAS.
It caused a great celebration in the room.
It's a picture of the first cycle of particle that has been queen through the LHC, crossing with LHC, crossing with a bunch of LC deliberately in detector.
In other words, when I saw that one of the 10 I did know that the apart of the work that the device is a huge successful successful successes.
I don't know if that had the biggest cell, or that, when someone went on Google and this is what he did is that the first page of it.
It means that we did an cultural impact on the skyscraper impact.
And after about a week I had a problem with the device, which actually actually had to do with these songs.
Those are a transport of 13 thousand ample of the maximum of the maximum power to the maximum power of the maximum of the power of the maximum of the sample of the same.
Now, engineers in the room, and we say, "You can't transportation the flaw the box of the bodies."
But I can do this because when they are extended temperatures called the superconductor.
So as a 271 degrees of the steps of the state, those of the steps can transport these bodies.
At one of the layers of the LHC, was a LHC, it was a fund of factories.
So that company was gone into the box of the 13 thousands of ampers were resisting electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressible to those magnetic magnetic magnetic in 20 ton, and they moved about 30 cents.
So I have about 50 magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic
We had to take the outside, what we do.
I reconfidence I residents, I repart.
And now we go through subterance.
He was at the end of the marginal marginal LHC will be like new as a new wave of the LHC will be like new
We're going to start again, and we will get this data in the data or ithraise or ithible research to find out that are the tools of the universe.
Now, of course, those accidents that kind of a very way, those of you know about the important news and engineering the extreme of the extreme to break the down.
I think that it is so hard to be so hard to be so hard to see the fact that we have young people like LHC.
And so I will let the words of a British man of British Davy, Humphrey Davy, which, I think that the details of protection, and this is not the dangerous progress for human minds of human minds are not the feeling of our human minds are finding our human beings, and that are not the natural gas we have not finished, as we are finding our natural displace, and as we are not finding our life."
Thank you.
I want to start with the reminder of the child saying, when you play with the boat.
And as you invent them to get them to go and take them and take them and get them and get them to get it and sold and sold problems, and you can also solve the different spaces.
The hope is profound profoundly about how we understand a big part of the world in the consistent world.
So, as a quality of I.T. intuition of this utility of the physical interactions -- impression with our physical objects, and my colleague Pattissue -- I was starting to go to the third -- I was starting to go to the third -- what would be able to do to use a computer, where we can use a mouse with a mouth with a mouth-screw with a missing digital display with a little information, and we can be able to see if we can just go and see if we can just take a little bit of a computer to the screaming with a computer desire with a bit, and see if we use of this untask, and see if we use of this untassummarrival disrupt with a computer with a computer with a computer with a computer, what we can be able to go to the next to the next to a computer with a computer
Did it as we want to not?
And the question of this fascinating was so much of the research I was hooking Stagges.
On the short of the Siftable is an interactive computer of a biscket.
They can be manufacturing them, they can perceive it, you can perceive the mission of one another, and they have a screen and a wireless radio wireless wireless to the wireless wireless wireless --
The most important is that there are palpable, so you can see the game, you can only get it to the game, you can only get it to them.
And Sifting the example of an examples of an ecosystem of the digital manipulation of digital manipulation.
On the main of what these instruments are getting more palpable and their mission of their mission, and the consistent of our nutraction of some of our nuactive notions and funny new styles and new styles and new style.
I'm going to start with simple examples of simple.
This Sifting is configuring image, and if you include it by a step, and it takes it to the other hand, if you include it in the other hands back.
These are the interactive of the other ones are constelling of each other.
So, if I put them one langer other, they become interesting.
If they are uncontained and that they can be a little bit of confusion.
You can also feel the mission and inclining.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of interaction is that we can use the shadow of the shadows of the shape of how we would be to pick up a liquid liquid in a liquid liquid in a liquid liquid of us as we can use a liquid of interactions of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the way we can use
In this case, we have three Sweet Sweet wise, and they can use them to use the task in the center of the center where they will mix the table.
If we can go too much, we can reach a little bit of the end.
There are also interesting possibility for education, like vision, as a language and logical games and logical things that we want to ask people to try to look at the outcomes.
So here I -- this is a Fibonaces that they do with a simple program that makes a simple program with a simple program.
Here we have a game of the words, a combination of combination of the Scrabs and Boggles.
So you can active you get a letter in the remote every Sweet Sweet you try to formed, and formed, they are green with a dictionary.
Then, after about 30 seconds of the letter of the letter of the letter and we have a new set of letter and we can make it possibility of the incaught of the time.
Thank you.
These are the children who came to the children who came to the Middle Media, and I came to the way and filmed them and filmed them a material.
They liked them to crazy.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of applies of this kind of applied people to give them many people a lot of instructions.
All you have to say is "Find words are like, "From exactly what to do.
This is a few people who are trying to inspire them.
This is the most taneously testing our right hand.
It turns out that everything he wanted to do was to do was to the point of each other.
So for him were just bodies.
This is a applied of animator.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who invent language.
And this is Felix.
He can introduce new characters in the stage, just by the Sweiss that you find the person's person.
This is where the sun is.
Video: The race.
David Merrill: So he introduced a stage in the stage.
Video: The portrayer of the pipe.
Very of course, yeah.
When Sisttttttttable and the other one can make their characters -- Video: Western -- Video: Ham!
DM: It creance.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with open, and he decides how it will be a sense of how it will be a very debt.
Video: Zboard, peak, the pyet!
DM: The last example I would show you today is a time to show you today is a tool that I built the music I built the role of the sounds that we built the sounds of sounds like being role and all bad.
Each of these four various varies, you choose it you want to use it.
And you can inject the sound of a succession you can see when you get the same way you can do.
You get the sound of the sounds of sounds like a Star Stagging Stagging Stap.
There are effects you can control control -- like reverberative and the filter and the filter and the filter and the filtrum.
You look at a certain sounds of sound, and then including it to held it to help it off.
And the effects of general effects like the footprint and the volume of the entire fish.
Video: DM: We're going to start with a Switter in the second Switzerland, I was arriving in a serious place.
Now, I put a basic line.
Video: DM: I add a few of the perceiving perpeace.
Video: DM: And I will hear the filter of the filter to control the whole lights.
Video: DM: I can get the whole sequence of inclining inclined in a part or another.
Video: I will think that I will go on for a lot of expression.
Video: DM: I can require the long time of the long time.
So I don't have to do the plan, you can improvise, or short from the worth of the word.
Now, the end of the killer of the entire Swewedding sequencing of volume Street my stag.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is the creation of new interfaces that are better with the way that you can get better with our brain.
And today, I had time to show you a coordination of this new spatial of design, and some of the possibility that we try to get from the lab to the lab from the lab that I would have a time to take it from the lab to show you a lot of time to show you a whole new way.
The way I would like to retina is like we're at the new generators with this new generation of interaction with the digital interaction with the midden of our digital rules.
Thank you very much.
These are the nervous to talk about you all the way to you.
I'm a writer.
He described the book is my teacher, but it is, of course, more than it is.
It's my whole load of love and fascinating a vibration of a life.
And I don't have this kind of change anything.
But those of us was like, something like strange in my life and in my career and in my career and in my own own content my work with work.
And the strange thing is like I wrote this book self-biography, this self-desire "Manan," which is Iubeste," which is in particularly in my remarkable for any of my career in a world that is important international books in a way that motivated in a way that you can see the international senior international sell.
The result is like anywhere I go now, people go now, people treat me as a confused to be confusion.
Serio: The convicted is convicted."
With the ingrirights, and you say, "You don't have your mind -- you don't be your performance as you can ever be able to be able to the performance of this?
You don't be your entire life as you continue to write your life on the whole world that you can ever make a look at the world that ever go on the world that ever ever ever ever wet?"
It's very linking of it.
But it was even more than I would not remember if you not all 20 years ago, when I started to start from people -- I want to become writer, I want to become writer, I want to become writer, I loved the same kind of Africa's basketball on the same Africa.
And people said "You don't have any more you ever have any more of success?"
You don't know that humiliation will be killed to kill you?
You don't be the fear that your life in this field of the field and nothing will be in here and nothing to see in a dream of dreaming with the hour the flow of the flow?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the short -- the answer to all those questions is "Yes."
Yes, you get the thed of all those things.
And I always hurt.
And you get the theme of the other things that people who are not going to be intuitive.
As an example of the marine algorithms that are crossing.
But when it's about the thing I was always the thing I always wondered in the last time I was "why?"
Is it a ration?
It's the logic to anyone to the work that I feel like that they feel like that they feel like that they were enough to do this Pamp.
And what is that specific initiatives that seems like we really don't really know that you think of our own mental mental mental mental illness that you don't do it?
My father was my father was an engineer and you don't remember as a chemical and you don't remember somebody who was asked to someone if you don't ask someone if you don't have a chemist.
It wasn't happening, John, how does the stuck in the chemical?
It's just not happening.
But to be honest, engineering chemists, that group doesn't really quicked up to the reputation of the reputation of manipulaction to be alcoholes.
We are written by the audience of us -- we have this reputation, but the artists, it turns out that this reputation has been straight for being a mental illness.
And what we do is to look at the number-map reviewed morning only in the 20th century, in the 20th century, which they died by the young people and often died by young people and often died by the way.
And even those who didn't have any chance of your own fun was really remote with your own your own features.
Norman Mailer, even before I did, he said that "Every last of my book, he said that "Every careful."
A great great great great great thing about your work on a living.
But you don't clear when you hear someone said to someone who I heard these things that we heard these things that you can absorbed and somehow I would absorbed and unaccepting the confidence of the collective and the suffered as the creative and the artwork is going to go to the next one of the suffernal sufficient sufficient in a sense of the sure.
And the question I want to do this is that all of you today is you all of the things that you all have this idea?
You are comfortable with it -- because as you see as the eye of the library of the eye of the hypothese.
I think it's stop.
And I also think it's dangerous and I don't want to see it in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage to the margins of the artist's margins to travel to the bodies.
And I know about my case, in my case, my situation -- in my own -- to start to start my career for me to start this meant to my career on the career of the hypothesis now professional.
As for instance, I am pretty tank, I just just about 40 years.
I have probably four decades of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of four decades.
And it's very likely that I described with this moment to be judged by the time that the work that came after my last last few my books that came out of my last book, right?
What would be to say to the men, because of all of us are all the other friends -- it's very likely that my biggest successful of my hair.
Oh, God, what shame.
This is the kind of the way that could make someone to go to the gin to the nine the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I do in the continues that message that I love with it.
And then the question of the question of you?
And so I think it is, after the many, as manipulation as manipulation I have to work now, to continue to create a kind of psychological construction, right?
I had a way to look at a way to look at a safe, between me, and my graduate that write, my graduate from the whole nature that will be in the room.
And as I always seed in the last year I started to look at this sense, and I tried to try to see other society if you could have better ideas to be able to have better ideas of how to be held new risk people create their risk of creative people creative.
This research has been taken me in Greece and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Rome.
So you know, you get the circle of the circle.
But in GDP and the antic Roming Roming Roming the creativity, the people who don't think that the creativity, right?
People thought that creativity was a spirit was a spirit of the people who are helping people in a source and unintelligent and unintelligent and unknown.
The name of these spirits, the consistent of creative creativity, "demonstrators with the term """"Two of the terms.
Socrace, because he thought he had a demon which is a demand the intellectual intelligence in the department.
The Romans were the same peak, but they called the imaterial creative, imaterials.
What is great, because the nobody was actually not that a very special man was a very special individual genius.
They thought a genius was a genius as a magical entity as a way that the traveling of artist's studio as Dobby, the sweet of the artist who would make the artist and the artist of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the wall the way to the works.
Absolid sold -- this is really the distant that is the distant that I talk about the psychological construction that you can protect the result of your work.
And all the world that has done so that this is good?
So the artist was protected by some things, like this, for example, too much narcision, right?
If your work was straluck was the street for the world that you could all this way that you have this genius as you had helped it.
If your work was critical, it wasn't completely completely the wind -- right?
Everybody is the strength as you were kind of ignorance.
That is how people in the West creativity, for a long time.
And then came Renasting and everything that has changed, the idea of the great idea, the idea of the man in the center of the universe, the most of the mysteries and mysteries that get a lot of mysteries that receive from the disrupt creature.
It was the slowing human beings, and people started to create the creative that creativity is all the inside of the individual individual individuals.
And for the first time in history of people started talking to one or other people who are gender, instead of being genius.
And you have to margineers, I think it was a erality.
You can see the simple person, a simple person, and it is actually the receiver or the receiver and the spring and the sea and the entire mystery is a little bit of four-the-foot psychologists, creative, unlike a very few human human being.
It's like you would ask the sun to get sell.
And just as a result and deforms of the hurt and gender gender in the performance.
I think that pressure that our artist killed us one after the last 500 years.
And if it's true, I think that is, the question is, what do you do now?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we can go back to the older send the relationship between people and the creative and myths.
It may not.
Maybe we can't just stand to stand for 500 years of human ancient thinking.
And probably you find out that there would be some of the questions that are grateful lawyers in the field of the sounds of human beings and all their projects and all their projects and all the time.
You probably don't want to cooperate on this idea.
But the question I want to ask is -- why not?
Why don't we think about this?
Because it has a sense of as much as we have heard about what we have heard about the pricious explanation of creative.
It may be that anybody has been trying to create something -- basically -- you know, you know, it's not the behavioral that doesn't always behavioral rational.
And in fact, sometimes you can look at the right paranormal.
I had a look at the end of the American I met the American American people I met in the American Ruth who has been on 90 years and that was the bridge, and that was the bridge, and he told me that when the child was going on on the room, and he just heard a poor and he just heard a bridge, and he just heard a bridge.
The story that was like a vast spring of the air set.
And it turns out the road.
The sense of income because you are galled in the left-hand than the left.
At that point that the point of view, and that is, "will be a hush."
And it goes to the home to the home to the whole idea of the waste of the idea was to a bunch of map and a long way to go through it and go through it and put it in the map.
Sometimes it wasn't enough enough enough to go and running and running and running and running and running the roots and the rob, and the people would lose the rootage and the way he kept his rooms and he kept "another poet on the room, I can go on the road.
They were also the moments in which -- I will never forget -- the moment that the story of that it almost lose.
He runs home, the mother's main and the third and the way it was the credit card the credit card the boy and the story that he was going to the other hand.
The bridge of the cover and the task and then in the body and then in the map of what he would be able to the map of the main the math.
And so in the situations, the poems of perfect and intact and unless and look at the last at the last at the last word.
When I heard it -- it's the suprantum of my own credit process of creative.
My creative processes don't limit the -- I'm not driving at this -- I'm not driving
I'm a catching where I work is the price to go to the same day and translate me and make it very weight and get my tough and get my tough and to go and I think about it as well.
But I even in my house, even I was attacked to sometimes that phenomenon.
And I imagine that the same way of you are the way of you.
I was also my projects or ideas that they came from a source that I don't know what I want to know it.
And what do you do this?
And how do we support to report it to the reported to the mind, you don't lose our right to help us reach the health of the health of the health of the health of the health of the health of the resident?
For me, the most relevant example of our days, which I can do is do the music of Tom Waits, I took a bunch of years ago in the revivivil demands in the revil demanding review.
I was talking about the subject and Tom was almost all the way to the modern artist of the modern Chinese contemporary of modern Chinese contemporary of controlling and stage these creative impulses these creative impulses out of these creative impulses.
With the time it came from the story of the story as a day as a whole day of the Los Angeles and then everything that has changed.
While I was driving from a short living in a short living living in the mind that the head comes in the mind as a magnetic and the inspiration and the inspiration and the inspire of the inspspire of it, but it doesn't look at it a house.
It doesn't have any map, you don't believe in the map, no report.
And I can all feel that old old anxiety into "a lack of a band, and the song for the banker for the banke.
I'm not going to be good enough to reveve."
And instead of the shot in the shot of the show.
He stopped the whole process of the trick and everything else.
He raised the sky and said, "You see that there are no volan?"
"You know, you might be written a channel?
If you really want to be truly in the point of view, when you can do it.
If you don't get the box of someone else's today.
Get and you get out of Leonard Cohen."
He traveling the whole process of this.
Not the operation of the way that it was just as much as it happens.
But the process of it, and the whole process, he took the time around him, he took the time he took the sweet and he was in his room, and he was going to go back and forth and then he got to go back and forth, and then he doesn't have to be something that has to be able to be able to do with the inside and China.
It could be collaboration and the ball and the ball of the way of a conversation between Tom and the external external entity that wasn't like Tom.
When I heard the story I started to change a little way I was trying to rescued me and already rescued me a data.
This approach me when I was at the middle of Manuan Manca, Roages, II, Iubest, Iubest, and I all study when we look at something that I was looking at something that I would all work and think about a lot of it would be a disaster.
Not just that, but the most proposing that he ever written it.
I had to think about it because I should just abandoned the project.
I remember my time I was talking about the opening hospital, and I tried to try and I was trying to get it and me.
I took my head on my hand, and I revealed my commentary in a cold of the room,
I said to the voice ite: "Tw," and I know if you know if this book is not just the extraordinary book is not just going to be my good?
Because you can see that one of the table to the battle I would have no idea of it.
So if you want to be better than you want to do the tall the way you have to do the third part of your time.
OK. And if you don't do this, you know, you all know, you know, you all have to be all of it.
I will give you my message because this is my message.
And I want to consistent today that I did my threshold.
Because the Conclusion is, by hundreds of years ago -- by North African people get to the table to add the tile muscles and the muscles and the sacred musical music and the sacred music, and the sacred music,
And they were always good, because the dancing were teaching and remarkable and remarkable and remarkable?
But sometimes it was happening, and one of the interpret of the sense of the goal.
I'm sure you all know what I mean you all about what you do, because you all know you have a moment of a certain moment, like this is a certain moment, like this interpretation.
It's like time it stops and the dance is as a kind of porting as a kind of ports, often does nothing different than the other 1,000 series -- everything is alien.
It doesn't look at a whole time, it doesn't seem to be in the whole by.
It's light and light and light from the bottom of the divinity of the divinity.
And when they were going to happen when they were the named and they were saying,
They were the hands and they were to fly and they called "Allah, Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, Game, Gamneither God."
It's God.
A interesting among announced -- when the maps have learned the South Spanish, they went with this user and the pronounce in the Milky of Allah Olah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and the welevated -- and the mother."
and they hear the fights of the battle and dancing and dancing and dancing the soul.
In Span, when a interpret has been able to something impossible and massive "Allah "Allah yer, your magnew, you know, your magnew, you know, your brain."
The unintelligent -- a God of God of God of God dad.
It's great, because we need to need this.
But the second steps of the second day when the dancing is that the dancing is that it's a big time and it is not a sclight-wild of Divention.
It's a diver that you get the gender that you can't never come from the gender and it could not be able to be a way of a house.
Can anymore, no longer to anymore, when he was wanted to do it when he was supposed to be able to do with the rest of his life with his life of his life.
It's hard.
It's one of the most painful of the creative of creative view.
But it may not be a very big chord if you don't think about the beginning of your song as you can be in the end,
Maybe if you think about it was improud of a source of time a few moments of your life on the next time you can be data from your life when the moments were to be a database.
If we think about it as we are going to change.
I started thinking and this is what I thought I was sure the last months of the last months of the book, which will be published by asteating that dangerous and crossing my unit and crossing my succeeding strange of my success.
And what I do is -- by repetual when you lose the cloud of the task, you don't be thethethe.
It doesn't be a sell. And you just go and you get the Continuer your park, anyone else would be it.
If you are dying dancing at the dancing of the dancing.
If the gene come and the center of what you want to leave it by the remote to the return to the receive your insects through your efforts -- then "Oh!"
And if no, they dancing anyway.
And with all of these "Oh!" for you.
I think in these things and I think we should pretend them.
"""Wo!" for you, because you have a love for humanity and the end of humanity and the end of the participation of the participation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I talked about some of these projects, about human genome and what it might be -- and what it might be a new gene.
Now in fact, in fact, from one new point: we digitize biology, and we try to start start to start to start to start in this digital code and go into a new flowing force and asshaping and asshaping forces and asshaping and assets of life.
We tried to ask ourselves to ask questions about the important question.
"What is life?" It's something I think that many biologists tried to understand the different level.
I tried different approaches, simple approaching the life of the basic components.
We are already about 20 years.
When I sequenced the human genome of the human genome of the analogical world in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world.
Now we're trying to ask question: Can we regenerated, or can we create new forms of life, in this digital university in this digital university in this digital university in this digital university of the digital university of it?
This is the map of a little organism Mycoplasma genomitalium, which is the smallest genome that can replicate in the lab.
We tried to see if we can come with a genomomer and smaller genome.
We managed to support the order, a hundred genes in the judgment of 500 that are there.
But when we look at his metabolic map is pretty simple in comparing comparison with our comparison.
I think it is, that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can see the first one time, it's a little bit of the life that is a living cell.
So I decided that the only way before it is that we actually stand synthesizing this croms so that we can get to the most fundamental components to reach questions.
And so I started the way to the catches "Can we synthesizer crom?"
Can the chemistry allows these molecules that we ever haven't done anymore.
And if we can action a cross of a cromos?
A cross of the way, is a very very very chemical material.
So, our digital speed of digital life grew up to a exponential rhythm.
Our gene code by describes that are very slowly slowly slowly down.
The last time he came to a exponential curve to the exponential curve.
I started this on a 15-year-old.
I went through a few of the water, actually, with a bio-ethic examination, before you do the first experiment.
But it turns out that the DNA synthesizing of DNA is very difficult to it.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make small DNA of DNA by 50 lets of DNA -- but it's a generative process, so why you build a longer, so why you build a long piece of ertails more than the ertains of the window.
So we had to create a new way to put these little pieces together and the right way and the right thing and the right of the error.
This was our first tentative information from the digital information from the theory of the synthesis of the Netal Ph.174.
It's a little virus that killer kill.
I did design the end, I took the design of the error of the error of DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA
The interesting thing that I took this piece of chemical materials that we could reach it in bacteria, and I put it in bacteria, and bacteria started to read this genetic code, and to produce the virus.
The viral partics were then released from cells and released back and they have come back.
I was talking to the oil industry and the oil industry and they understand that this model.
They have laughing more than you are.
And so we think that's a situation where the software can build their own map can build their own a biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the whole cross of a bacteria.
This is about 580,000 kitchens.
So I said to put the letter of the letter of the size of the virus to can actually understand what the size of the size of a living cellular stem cells that are the stem cells.
The design is critical, and if you start with digital information in the computer, that information has to be very active information has to be very active information.
When I sequenced this genome in 1995, the precision of the precision of a 10,000 spring hurt of a sample of the bases of the basis of the basis of the baskets.
I found it, in the remote revenue, 30 error. If we were used to be used to be activated, this may never be activated.
The design is in design of enjoy of enjoying 50 lets the long way to have to be a 50 letter with all the other letter to build some of the other letter to build so that we have to design some little so that we have to design some of the other television with each other.
We are actually designing tools.
You may read that we put it in the waters' house. Give you in the kitchen code, you can have a genetic code, and T.
Triples of those letter -- those letter of the letter of 20 recently notice -- a single letter a single remote from a very remind.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, sentence, sentence,
Inified all I did was to be mapped on the code.
Some of them were disappointed that it is not poetry and remote it out.
I designed those pieces so that we can see them as the desire with enzymes.
I'm aszime that they repart, and they are hurt them.
So we started doing the end, starting with five to 7,000 lets up with 7,000 lets them to make them join them by 24,000 lets them take the stage of these roads, and then putting up to 72,000 other 2,000 miles and then by 72,000 to 7.
Every time we traveling these pieces of abundant to sequences them to sequence them to make a very robust process, and we try to create a very red process.
We're trying to get to that point of automatization.
So, this is what a basket.
When you get to the big stone of the hundred million paths of the basis of the bottom of the E.
It turns out all the tools of modern molecular molecular molecular biology.
So we went to other hanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the recombination of the biology that biology uses DNA, and that somehow to reach it looks like DNA and that is a joint.
This is an example.
There's a organism called Deincoccucucustomer of radiorows, millions of radiation.
As you can see in the shot of the sea of the sea is fun in the kitchen in the end.
12 hours to 24 hours later, he put it back in his hands as he was at the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be on the total.
They can live in living.
I am absolutely sure that life can be in the exhibition of exhibition space to go through a new environmental environment.
In fact, NASA shot showed that this is happening.
This is a micrograph of a molecule that we built using these processes -- actually using these proposes that only using the today's disrupted design that we put on the pieces that we put in the bodies.
Dround it put it together to put them together in the machine.
This is not a little bit of a microscope with electrons, but only a to-micrograph food.
It's so a big molecule that we can see it with a microscooptic.
These are images collected over a five-second period.
This is a public that I had a little bit of time.
These are over 5,000 little little little genetic code,
It's the biggest molecule made by people, with a definition structure structure of the definition of definition.
It has a molecular molecular molecular ar ar ar as a million as well.
If we can print it with a 10-to-time space space space for 142 pages to get this genetic code.
So, how do we start a cromos? How do you active it?
And obviously, with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's a lot more complicated to work with bacteria.
And also, even easily when you get to the eucker: you can just take the nuclear nucleus and put it in the cloud and that is something you all heard -- cloning.
With the chair, the cross is is integrated in the cell, but I showed you that we can make a completely transplant a completely completely completely completely transplant to the other people at the other time, and we can activate it.
I had a checked of microbial species,
These are about the same way as people and the same.
We put a few genes in the full of genes to select this cromoss for this crome.
I deeply with enzym to killer all proteins
And it was pretty amazing when we put in the cell -- you will appreciate our very sophisticated -- and the cross has gone into the cell.
In fact, I thought this is how far it can go and go through the process of something more and more than the process of the processing process.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We see all kinds of species that have been embarrassed a second crossed crossed or a third of the third of the other part, by the other way that you have a second.
So those of us who think about evolution just as one gene change in the biology.
I'm called enzymous of restriction, which actually actually had DNA.
The noise that was in the cell that was not a
The -- the cromozope that we put us --
It was exposed and recognized the other cromozom as the material, as the material, and so it was just with the crossed with the cross of the cross of the cross of the cross of the crossed and the new cromoss of the other cromoss of the other cromoss of the other cromoss of the other crossed crossing cross as well.
It became blue because of genes we put in the gene cromoss.
And after a very short period of time of the characteristics of a species of lost a new species, and it was a new species, and it was put in the cell that we put in the cell.
All the proteins were changing, the membranes were changed, when we ask the genetic code, it's exactly what I transfated.
This may sound like alchemistry of genome, but we can move the DNA, to change the pretty dramatic.
Now, I supported that this is not genesis -- but it has been on three billion years and half years and we supported that we can be on a new version of explosion, in which which has a new version of maving, in which which has a massive new digital design.
Why do we do this?
I think it's pretty obviously obviously about supporting the need of new.
We're on the way to go from six and a half to six and a half years of the age of 40 years.
So to put this in context for me to the consistent in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each of us there in 1946, in 40 years, will be four.
We have a hind, providing the problems of potable, medicine water, drug water and a half billion and a half billion and a half and a half and a half of the house.
It will be difficult to do it for us.
We use over five billion tons of book, more than 30 billion bars of obeaches of oil.
This is a hundred million bars a day.
When we try to think about biological or any process that will replace to replace that, will be a huge challenge.
Then, of course, is all CO2 from this material, which is that we get in the atmosphere.
Now, from our discoveries of our world, we have a data that we have a data on 20 million genes, and I like to think about these designers in the future.
The plastic of the electronics has only doubt, or something, and this is the diversity that came out of this.
We're limited here, first of all, biological reality and our imagination and imagination.
We now have the techniques of these ways of synthesizing meeting with gender, combinattractive gender.
We have the ability to build a big robot that to make a million cross a day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of these 20 million genes or try to optimize the opportunity to produce the occupells, or products and the pharmaceutical products, we can change the mic, we can change a little more biology than the last 20 years, we can do more biological science.
And this is just standard.
We can select for vistable, production of chemical substance or fuel, production production, the citizens.
This is an ecrandom capture of a design software that we work in order to wait and work on these species in the computer.
You know, we don't know how it will show you how it will show you how it will show you how it will show it out.
We know exactly what the genetic code,
Now we focus on the fuel of fourth generation.
You see that in the middle of the wind of the ethanol of the disaster.
We have fuels of the generation of the second and the third and the third of the third and the welevent that are going to be larger than the occurring or different types of buttons or different buttons of butterflies.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without a major impact without the cost of food and the fall of their disability and the fly is if we start with CO2 as a math match to design the cell phone, and we think that we will have the first goal of the generation of the fourth generation of about 18 months.
Low and CO2 is a way -- but in our discoveries of our world around the world around the world we have all kinds of ways of the world we have all kinds of ways of other ways of the world we have a way of the world we have a way of CO2 is a way of CO2 is a method and our discoveries -- but in our discoveries of the world we have all kinds of stuff.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It goes into the deep oceans, about two kilometers and half the deep, to half the deep temperature.
Transform CO2 in metan use of molecular hydrogen molecular as a source of energy.
We're trying to see if we can take CO2 captured CO2 is transportation that can be transported in the O2 back in the fuel and go to the buster in the compound to lead this process.
So in a short period of time we think we could die of what is the basic question, "What is life?"
And indeed, you know -- we have the patterns of replacing the entire oil industry.
Yeah. If you don't do this at TED, where another park of the other park?
It's a major source of energy.
But also we work now to use these same same way to invent these same sources to invent vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of immediately vaccines of the same way.
You saw this year with the bird, we're always with a year ago, and a dollar in the right childhood is the right vaccine.
I think that situation can be changing by building vaccines combined vaccines of combining vaccines of any of the time.
Here's how it could start to show the future of changing the future of evolution, accelerating the evolution of the evolution with bacteria, and finally, income and finally, infinally, infinally, and finally, finally, infinite, and finally, finally,
We're almost to improve people.
Our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive to survive to survive. Thank you very much.
What I want to do is show you the very quickly, a new technology that I added up to Microsoft as part of a little bit of a little bit about a year. This is a year. This is a year.
It's an average that can interact with a large amount of visual data with a big amount of data visual data.
We now look at many of them, many different different pictures and sweating the digital and it is almost perfect, pandemic, showing it by this way, rearranging it anyway.
It doesn't matter how much information we are these big information and how big images are these collies or how big images.
Most of the people are taken with a common digital camera digital camp, but this is a quarter of the Bible Congress, the law of 300 megap.
It's not important because the only thing that we should limit the performance of a system of your monitoring system is the number of your monitoring architecture of very flexible.
This is a whole book of the whole bunch of non-imaginative example.
It's about "Charles Dicken."
To demonstrate that it's about text, and not a imagine, and not to look at this, to look at this point is a recover of a text; it's not a pose.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read a book in electronics.
I would not be command.
This is a more real. It's a "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian of "Gardian of a sailt.
Each image is the beginning of a sequence.
This is really the enjoy of a plate experience of reading a revivid of a revivil of a resident, which is a multi-dimensional environment.
We did something little little little bit of this number in "Gardianule,"
I created a false reclaim to a very larger -- much bigger than any claming -- and I have a common content.
If you want to see the properties of this machine -- you can see it here.
Or other models, or even the techniques of technical specifications.
And this really through ideas, the trouble by the limits of a monitor.
We hope that this is to be able to look at pop-up and other people like this -- which is not necessarily.
Of course, the mapping is one of the applications of the kind of like this.
I won't say a lot of time on this stuff, but only to tell you that we have to tell you that we have to do this field.
These are all the way in the United States of the United States of NASA fish.
Let's go to now on something else.
This is actually active on the Internet; you can see verifire.
This is a project called Photosynth, which is the two different technologies. One of them is Sealot, and the other Seal in the field visual perception of the visual perception of the University of Washington Snack of the University of Washington, he reached Steve Sex See See See See See See See See See at the U.S.
and Rick Szeliski at Certian Microsoft. A beautiful colleague.
So this is active on the Internet. It's because Sealot.
You can see that when we create these kinds of perspective, when we can navigate through images we can have this kind of experience in many of the resolution.
But the space of these images of these images of the truth of the image.
The other visual al-visual perception of these images, so that they can recover the real space where these pictures are -- all the way to the Grasses, in the Stage of Canenes of the Canenes of a projection of a projection of a projection of showing or shows, and these tools were related spaces.
I don't sure if I want time to show you other environments.
There are some of the other that they have much more space ality.
I want to go to one of the original set of Noah -- this is a part of the Photosynthetic prototype that I worked in the summer -- to show you what I think is the pig's Photosynth. It's not just as vision, the technology of this technology, just not just vision, not just visiting projecting on the website.
We had to have care about the law of the law of the law of the legal aspects of it.
This is a reconstruction of Cated, Cated, Dame of Dame of Flickr. Does Nothing on Flickr, and you find something like Flickr, and you find something like a little byard, and every single one of these conclusions that was found that he was found that he would be found that he was a cool.
These are the photographs on Flickr, and all of the space in this way.
We can just not be to navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I would go to work on Microsoft is very eating to have a part of a first here.
I guess you see that I'm a lot of the cameras a byware from the roof: the whole range of the SLs in this environment.
If you can see it more weird.
There are so many master of fear, and so forth.
One of the one is a series of photography -- okay.
This is a Nothing with Nothing was recorded correct.
You can be remove to a physical medium to a physical media.
The idea is that I can do some things with social environmental environment. This is to collective data from a collective memory of what the Earth looks like the Earth -- and to interconnected them -- and to interconnected them all those pictures have been interconnected to the shot that is more emergent than the summer than the summer of the parts.
You have a model of what comes out of the entire Earth.
Think about this as the long as you can see Stephen Lawler Mr. Ten Lawler "Earth."
And this is growing in complexity as the world as we use the people that benefits as users become more more of using the users as users.
The pictures are the practice of meters that somebody else else has gone that else else else has gone that you have.
If someone would all these sfined village and say who I are, then my photography with Cated, you know, Dame would improve it with all these data, and I could use it as a point of a way to track it through that space, and I could just like that kind of social experience.
And of course, a second product and all of these are the huge sea and the virtual models of the Earth, collecting the interesting world, collective not only from the ground and images of the streets of the village and images of the collective and images of a collective memory and a collective memory and a memory of collective and in the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood correct your software to allow your software to a moment of your first few years of the shape of someone on someone on a glob to be interrelation?
BAA: Yeah. What does is really to look at is to look at it.
It creates hyperconnectivity, if you want to do.
And it turns out that by the content of the images.
And this becoming a quote when you think about the significant information that they have those images.
As you do a picture of image, you look at the Internet, how you get a lot of the Internet is a lot of information on a bunch of information about what represents the picture.
Now, what would it be the connection to all the pictures of your picture?
And the amount of signal interconnection and wealth of this is a huge amount of remote in this country.
CA: Blaise, it's quite incredible. Felics.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of the intense traveling research and one of the night is the chance of living in the old man who don't look the last in their old welevated room, who feel the last of the raising room, and you could get it in the raising roots in the room, and you can get it into the planet.
You don't know that Jaguary Jaguary wish. With the Lace, or that the lady of the old lady of the people you still have a wide, or that in Himalaia continues to Dhard, is to tell the center of Dhard, and this is to be the center of anthropology, and this is not just a sense of the world that we live in a sense of reality, but it's just a sense of a sense of reality.
The consequence of a certain set of decision-making decision-making sure that our ancestors of their own generations, even with a lot of generations.
And of course, we all share the same imperative adaptive adaptive of adaptive action.
All of us are born. We all bring children on the world.
We're going to go through the initiatives of initiative.
We need to do separate separate from the dead of mortal -- so we should all play that we all singing -- dancing we all have art.
But what is interesting is the unique of the songs of the dancing every culture.
Whether is the Penphan Penor Borneo, or the Voodoo in Haiti, or the Western of Kaut in the wall of the Kaut in the northern Kaut in the middle of the Kaw of Sared.
By the way, this is the kind of the way I traveling through a long time, or even a bird of the Qold, Everest, Everest, Everest, the big wzzzle of the world.
Everybody knows that there are other ways to be other ways to think about other ways to think about other ways to think about other ways to the Earth.
And this idea, if you think about it, not can be humiliation of hope.
Now, the miridgs of the world with a spirit of spirit and cultural life that cover and cultural health and is as important for the human health of the planet, and the biological remote of life, life, known as biosphorus.
And you might think about this network as being the whole life as being ethank's ethnic and you could define, and you could definitely be the suffering of the intuitions of the consistent of the consistence.
Etnosphere of human beings.
It's the sense of what we are and everything we can be as a surprising specific specific species,
And as the biosphere was the seero-diverse -- and it can be a much bigger scale.
For example, no matter what the tough would not be happy to suggest that half of all the species of all the species was or more of the extension, because it just is not true, and yet this -- the most -- the most stage in the field of biological diversity -- the abuse of what we know the stage of what we know the stage of cultural diversity.
And the biggest indicator of this is the limb of the limber.
When you were born you, those in this room, there were 6,000 languages talking on the planet.
Now, a language is not only a layer or a set of rules or a set of rules.
A language is a sea of human spirit of human spirits.
It's the vehicle that the souls of the particle of particle flowing world.
Each the language is a old old lady of mind, a basic receiving ecosystem as a spiritual possibilities.
And from those 6,000 language, as we sit here in Monterey, half of them are not the way that the children are not the way in the earth of the kids.
I'm not learning babies in the baby, which means that if you don't change something, that if you don't change something, they are already diamonds.
What can the only one of the most of you are the last of your own -- you know, the last in your own language, you don't have the way to presence the wisdom of the mountains or to anticipate the mountain of the children?
And yet that sounds like a little bit of a little somewhere on Earth, about about each other two weeks because every two weeks ago, one old old old and it takes in the hands and it takes in the last night-hand language.
And I know that some of you will say, "Well, you know, you wouldn't be better?
Wouldn't it be a better place if I all talk about a single language of a single language that I said, "Grozive or Cant." Or that the language of being Cants.
Or it is Kogi."
And then you find out how you might not be able to talk about your own language.
So, what I want to do today with you is a kind of traveling through the heat -- a short journey to try to give you a sense of what it is losing you a sense of what it is losing with you some of the fact.
Now, there are many of us who seem to look at how many different ways to the bon," I understand ways of flaws.
So let's take this baby in the Barrian Amazon of the northern Amazon that belief that -- mythological midst that I think -- mythological rights, in the room, the frogs of the sea sweet of the rights of the sacred of the rips.
This is a bridge that by near the blue of the blue of the sky because the leader of the sky is equivalent of the forest.
I have a curious language and rules that called the linguistic exogames you have to be able to travel with someone who talks about a different language.
And all of these are rooted in the last mythological past, yet it's a strange thing that is a strange thing that I talk about six or seven languages because of the interface, you never hear a language.
They just listening to and then start talking to the street.
Or, one of the most fascinating tribes that I ever lived with the Waorn of the Equadorum, a popor in the northeast of the Equadorum, a remarkable in 1958.
In 1957, five missionarian missioned missioned and they did a critical mistake.
They arrived from the air photographs of them and what he wanted to be a friend, when they wanted to be a friendly frogest, they don't see in their life have no dimensional.
They took those photos on the solar of the solar behind the girl to find the form of the girl or figured out that they traveling that these are books of visiting diolder, so they have the five missions.
But Waans don't kill.
They were killed between them.
Fifty percent of their mortality is about the roads of the length of the road.
I watched the genealotic boards back with eight generations, and we found two cases of natural more, and when I was a little bit about them, they get a little bit of the guys reached that one of the guy who died with a champid that died with a church of the same time they were amazing.
The trees can smell of the animal from 40 steps and tell you what species is going to go on the next one.
At the beginning of the '80s, I had a surprising mission when I was asked by my teacher when I was interested in Haiti in Haiti in Haiti, to me in Haiti, I was the secret of Daatheists, and Tonton Macoutes, and to make sure to create a kill and Tonton to create a knee to use the snows.
To understand what it is asking the senation, I had to understand something about this remarkable to understand something about this remarkable credit, and Voodoo is not a grasp of a grass.
The impression, it's a complex method of complex leverage on the world.
It's interesting.
If I asked you what the great religions of the world, what would you say?
I think of Islamism, Budism, Iudiam, anything else.
It always was a continent of the continent, the previous Africa of the sub-Shidoo credn't, of course, there was a very simple distant distillance of these religious ideas that they had the very profound that the ocean on the tragic robb.
But what Voodoo is this relationship between the living and the worth of life and the dead.
So the life gives you a near at the spirit of the bodies.
The skin can be invoted by the Ape, as the Day response to the dancing of the soul, so that for the soul, so that for that for that in the short moment of the goal.
That's what I say is the practicing of Voodoo that "Voices, you go to the God.
We dancing in the theater and we become God."
And because you are positive, are the dominant of spirit, how can you be the previous of you that can be the previous of you are the positive?
So you see these demonstrations of these demonstrations of Voodoo requires in the perfect expression of the bodies of the right hand, a profound profound profound that the capability of the minds that the body is actually catalyzed in the standard, when it's catalyzing in the extreme strength of the extreme strength.
Now, from all the poor I met the most extraordinary Kogi in Sierra Nevada Santa Mark in the northern Colombia.
You have the old civilization of Tairona Tairona whip of the coastal of Columbia of Columbia spans, this popor restricted in a massive massive massive massive map that raised the pet.
In a sea continent of blood flow is the unique that wasn't the unique of the Spanish that was not a spans.
And they are contended by a price of a presence of the previous preparation of being a very extraordinary printer.
The young people are broken by their families at 3-year-old families in a dark world in a dark world of the wild of the sea bonds from the guilty of the guilty of the guilty of the guilty of their guilty in 18-year-old families are reporting families in the last time.
Two of nine years of nine years of the new months of the new gestation of the natural gestinian of natural earlier in the uteric uter-term method in the uter-sweet period of new nature.
And the whole bunch of them are introduced in their values of their society, the value that the range of their own and their own struggles, and only only their lights and their own balance -- or we could say the balance equilibrium.
At the end of this amazing inition, one day in a day and for the first time in their life and for the first time they see a remain her life that curious moment of consciousness as the first light, as the Sun starts to sea fishery as beautiful as the fishery of the fish of the fish of them in a glord of the resident, and they learn from a glorous
And he says, "Can you really say it is how I say.
It's really beautiful. It's your to protect here."
They call the older fishing and they tell us that we are the more young people who are responsible for the world.
Now, this level of intuition is really important.
And the way we think about the box and the fish and the landscape of the Rouse. And the old noble of his noble noble noble idea, which is a racist in the simplicity, or alternative, we innobility and we tell people that these people are almost almost the same thing as we are almost done.
Well, the box are not the feeling of the nostalyle.
It's not for any of the slaws, in the waste of malaria in Asmen or in the wind of Tibet, but they created a traditional mystery that is based on the idea of being based on the idea of being based on the idea of being on the idea of being a way of nearly subtle can be in a way of the Earth can only be in a way of humanity.
Now, what does this mean?
It means that a boy in And, who is grew up to think that that that the Apu that will be a human spirit will be a different human beings and will be a different human beings and will have a different relationship with that resource than a boy in Montana grew up to think that a mountain in Montana life-worth life-worth liked.
It's the place of a spirit or a quarter of mindful is irrelevant.
Interesting is the metaphor that defines between individual individuals and natural world.
I grew up in the Colombias to think that the forests of the forest.
That made me a different human beings than my friend of Kwagious, who think that those forests were the lock of Hux's local and the Ciocle and the Ciocle and the spirit of the Cibbbbs that have lived in the north of the world, spirit with their own in the world, the spirit with the Hamatsent Hame.
If you start to look at the idea that these culture could create different realities, you will start to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries of their extraordinary discoveries that plan.
It's a picture of me in the Amazon of the northern Amazing in the app.
This is ayahuasca, which many of you heard of you heard about the psychopathletes.
Ayahuasing is not just for the pharmacy, but for the previous rehabilitation of his precise two.
The first is this time that it has a series of a disease of a disease, modern mayor maybe, modern mainstream mains of a mayor mayor of the rehair.
It only consumes the time is it was more like the blue of the citizens that you have, but the time the jewels of a ball of the leads to a ball in the cafetnowice called Psychotic Psyridis.
This plant contains very powerful trypamine very strong to the brain, the brain, the dimethylame, 5-meypties, 5-meypts.
If you ever saw you ever saw the Yanomami of the Yanomami lived in their nose, that substance is made of different species that contains are made of different species that contains and my fathermal treats.
He sent that break through the nose of the nose, and how you are exposed from a painting with painting with painting with a very large electricity. It doesn't create a distortion of reality.
In fact, I was talking to my teacher Richard Evan Shult Shult who was the man who declared was psychopathletes, the strange of magic in Mexico in the 1930s.
I used to be arguing that you can't classified these trypth trypamine hallucinogens, because when you are under their own inner home is not one of their trypts is that they can't be oral orders anywhere in a blind blind ord, because they are called ormonooogue in the human human human being called in the human human human anown.
They can be taken order, only with other computations that reveals the MAO.
Now, the fascinating thing is that the meat that time in that time that would, the MA's inhibitors are necessary to tryptiles, so you ask you the question: How many of the 80,000 species of the 80,000 species of dead, they found these two disorders of dead, they created a version that combined in this particular kind of diamonethic provides that the whole bunch of did?
Well, we use that mistake the myths, trying to heroe, which is unscared that it is that no sense.
But the questions and they say, "Plants" talk."
Well, what does this mean?
This trib Cofan has 17 variety of ayahuasca, and I recognize all of the forest, and we see all as a species.
And then you ask them how they stable their feeding feeding and they said, "You know something about the planet.
I mean, you don't know anything?" And I say, "No."
Well, we find that it takes every one of the 17th of the 17th grade, and you can get in a different note in a different note not.
Now, that's not going to bring a Ph.D. but it's a lot more interesting than the number of stamps.
Now, the problem is that even the problem in which we feel the hard to feel like the hard waste of the box, you see that the bizarre and the side of the history of the history of the world, which is our world, which is our world, our developing world, which is our developing world, and the developing world, it is our world.
The truth is that the 20th century, over 300 years will not be held minds or technology, but more like in which we have been assisted or we encouraged or we encouraged or we encouraged the massive biological and cultural cultural diversity and cultural cultural issues on the planet.
All the cultures in all the time, they were employed in a distant dance with our own possibilities of life.
And the problem is not the technology of the world.
The Sioux were not slowed up to Sioux when they gave them to the arts and more than the American people who were Americans and lived in the horse and lives.
Not changing the ethnose, the ethnose. It's power.
The crude crude of the dominance.
Where you look at the world, you find that these are not remote culture of the world,
These are people living from the dynamic forces that are all the way of the formation that are all their way to adapt their adaptation.
Whether it's farming in the remote of Penbor Penbor Dake in the South Asia and in Sarawak Asia, in Sarawak -- a popor and now lights and now a generation, and now they all live in a generation, and now in the slaws, where you can see the rights, where you can see the right-hand didirty diroute and remote to see the dishaming of the Born of China that seems to be red, and you can see the deeply to the red.
where the Japanese you get to the orizon the orizon their clock with the bugs of the forest.
Or in the case of Yanomames are the diseases that come from the exterior of the discovery in the zypt.
Or if you go to the Tibet, where they do a lot of research in the last time you will see the face of the political domination.
You know, genocide -- the physical physical physical physical bridge, the physical convicted is the universe, but the whole of the way of a poor the destruction, not only that it's not only a single bunch of developing -- in many areas -- in many areas -- in many areas -- in many ways.
And you can't understand the painting of Tibet, until you see the level of the solar level.
I had been driven 9.600 kilometers in Chengd in the Western China's US to Lhad by a little bit, and only when I got in Lhad with a young bodies that are behind the statistics that are behind the statistics.
6,000 sacred monuments transformed in the road and your head.
1.2 million people killed with the commandments of Cultural Revolution.
Taten this young man was devoted to Panchen Lama.
That was the way he was in his immediately when the Chinese have learned Tibet.
The one of the eye of Panchen Lama in Nepal.
My mother was released for crime, for the crime.
He was stuck in the prison in the prison of two years to get the age of the most, because she couldn't sufficient it.
So's actually made that encourage was throwing in a reeducation camp.
One day he traveling the near-attention to Mao with Mao and for this craction has seven years of the craction of the crack.
The Tibet, the Tibet, you can be impossible to be impossible for human human being.
And finally, actually, it turns out that it is a choice.
Do we want to live in a monocromer world of monotonies or we want to accept a different policy world policy world.
Margaret Mead, the great anthropologist, he said before her her her most most flew was that as the biggest generic and mirror on this generation and mirror on the world of the imagination of the world that we will not only see the entire human imagination in a long time of thinking of the thoughtful and other possibilities.
And it's humiliation to remember that our species, our exists, about 600,000 years.
The Neolitical Revolution -- which we gave us agricultural culture, where we gave the champians, the check of the flaws, we created a source of specializing specialized with a 10,000 years ago.
modern industrial industrial industrial industry as we only have 300 years.
Now, this superficial history not suggesting that we would have all the answers that we will confront in the next few millennia.
When this whole bunch of culture of the world are questioning about the meaning humanity response to 10,000 different voices.
And in that song we're going to rediscover new possibility to be what they call a completely conscious species, in fact, the fact that everyone and all the people and all the very many people and all of the other people who are very wonderful.
This is a photograph I did at the top of the Baffin the north of Baffin the wind of the Inuent CEukkky and this man in the Inuel and this man told me the fantastic story of his grandmother's great story of his grandmother's goal.
The canadian government was not always the way that the Inuplot, and in the 1950, to stable suveranity in our school, we forced in the colonies of our colons.
His this man refused to meet.
The damage for his life and his life took all of the arms and all of them and all of them and everything.
Now, you have to understand that inputs are not framework is the refrigerator.
The Ghidden of their own were made of the caves of the caves of the board.
So the grandfather was not the good night of the arco of the arco that the soul.
He just swallowed outside, he traveling his pants, and he flew it in his hands and his hands started to travel in his hands started to frozen out of him shaped it in a lame.
He put the salive in the excredit of the excrediting and when he finally frozen a dog of a dog with him.
He had jailed the dogs and improvised a map main and he took the dog and improvised a dog and improvised a same, and he had a same, and he had gone through the ice of the sea and frogs in the excredusted the road, and he was in the excrediture in the excreation in the excreation of the southern excreated the dot of the dogs and improvisit of the door of the doton.
And we talk about it, and in this kind of a lot of ways of the way of the people of Industrial and all of the people of Inlook and all the world.
In the airline 1999, 1999, the canadian ended back of a big waste of a bigger than California, and the Texas the Texas a
It's our new payd. It's called Nunavels.
It's an independent territory of the mineral resources controlling all the mineral resources.
A amazing example of how a national store strength can look at the reparation of his poport.
And finally, at the end of it, I think that it is obviously the least for us that journey in these remote places that are not going to be fit that they are not distress.
They are the patterns of people.
They are the sprawl, the human imagination of the time of the human beings, and for us all of our children, like our children, and their dreams of the geography of the flood.
What we tried to do is doing at National Geographic is, we think that politicians will never realize anything.
We think that pollines -- we think that policy is not confidence, but we think that the story can change the world, and we are probably the world's the best we are probably the best we probably the best we are probably the best we can do.
We have 35 million visit our web on our page every month.
156 to 156 to our television of our television of our television of the damage.
Our Raise are reading of millions of people.
And what we do is doing is a series of journey in our own own own cultural mindful space that they can't even be able to remain cultural place, and we hope that they can't accept what they seem to be able to acknowledge that would accept the world to be able to be in a way to live in a way to live in a way to live in a world of life: that we can find a way to live in a world in a way to live in a world in a world in a world of many ways.
where the wisdom of all poverty can help us to our collective prosperity
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some of the things that I hope that they hope that they will be able to reach other things that you already heard about all the links you have some connections in the case you have a ratic.
I want to start with what I call """Ph.D.
The official reefs of what?
The official of all the Western societies of the Western societies.
And this doctrine sounds like this: if we are interested in the way we are interested in our citizens of our citizenships, the way to make it is the individual level of individual freedom is the individual level of individual freedom of individual freedom of individual so.
The reason for this is that freedom is that frequency is the good word, the essential to be humans, the essential to be human.
And because if people are free then people can act with individual and make things that massive and make things that our maximum and anyone has to decide the place.
The way to maximize the freedom is the maximizing of choices.
The more people have choices, the more people have freedom of freedom and the more freedom of freedom of the more freedom of the more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more people have a lot of the choice, the more people have to have the more freedom of the way of people have to have the more freedom of freedom of freedom have a lot of freedom of freedom and more freedom of freedom of the more of the more freedom of the more freedom of freedom of the way to the wilary.
Then, I think, that it's so good at our system that would not go through our head and it doesn't go through the headline.
And it's deeply to our lives.
I'll give you some examples of what made for us for the last few of us for the last time.
This is a supermarket.
I want to tell you two words about the soses for saving.
175 snaps for my supermarket, that if you don't cover and the 10 types of waste water, and the 12 different hits and the 12 different hours, and the 12 obbbbyards that you can buy your own in a very large numbers that no longer any of the 175 people who are no matter in a very large number of the 175 that no matter that no matter how much of the store that gains.
So this is the supermarket.
And then you go to the store of electronic components to make a stereo system system -- CD -- the housin CD player, the shape, the mark, the magic.
And in this room of electronic components of electronic components of stereo.
We can configuring out of millions and half million different systems in the components that are in the office of a single show.
You have to recognize that this means a lot of options.
In other domains -- in the other communities.
There was a while, when I was a child, where you could get any kind of your phone services, you know, as much time it was offered as Ma Bell.
Take the phones. You don't buy it.
By the way, one of the consequences of this is not the phone that never the street.
And those days are a lot of apuse.
Now, we have a almost immediately nelse's almost immediately not in the world of mobile phones.
These are the furniture of the future.
My previous is the one in the middle -- with MP3 player, they have a bunit from the nas and a chamber of the southern and cooke.
And if you haven't seen it still in the store, you can stay in the shot you can see it because in the curious it.
And the result is that it makes people to go out in the store, and to put this question.
And you know what the answer is the answer to the question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to buy a phone that you don't know that you don't know it too much,
And in other domains of the lives that are more important than bugs, there are this growth of the number of options.
The health system -- in the United States -- in the United States is not the case you are going to do what to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor and say, well, we have the various various of B.
It has these advantages and these risks.
By these advantages and these risks and these risks. What do you want to do?
And you say, "Doctor," what the doctor says, "Your doctor's has these advantages, and these advantages and the risks and the risk of these risks and the risks and the risks and the risks and the risk of these today."
What do you want to do?
And you say, "What if you do you do you do?" And the doctor says, "But I'm not the place you know, the head is the place of your patient." And the result is -- I tell you what a lot of a same.
But what is actually a transient transition and decision-making responsibility from someone who knows something -- in this case -- someone who knows something -- at any point that you don't know about the best form of a shape, and so not in the best form to make decisions -- in this case -- in this patient -- in this patient -- in this patient and the best way.
There's a huge level of advertising for the reeting medicine as you can think of people as you think a little bit of you, if you think a little bit of a lot, because we can't buy it.
Why is it all new audience is that if we can't buy it?
The answer is that those who are doing this wave as we expect our doctors in the morning and ask them to change our own country, and ask them to change our network.
Something that our identity has become a problem of choice, and this transion, and this transition of the role of show that this is to look at this.
That we don't really change a identity but we have the possibility of the invention.
And we can reinvent our reinvention we have a chef.
And that means that every day you would say you have to decide what you want to be to be able to be able to be able to be done.
With the whole thing for the traveling and family that when the people who were just starting to start to be that the beginning, you have to travel you as you get to the children as long as you get to the children as quickly.
The only option was with dinner, not when you do that with you will do after that one.
In our days, we all is very much about the remote of us.
I give you incredibly smart students and give them a 20 percent of the people who are about doing it as I do.
And this is not because it would be less than the deep and not because it would be a little bit of map.
What do you think I'm concerned with all kinds of questions "What should I guess you want? Should I do it? Should I be doing it? Should I be doing it?
I should be able to fall the ly? You should have my kids, or a meet?" All of these are questions that consumption that consumption you have.
And they will answer these questions, whether it doesn't mean if that is not to do all the other people that I will not take a good note at my curses.
And that's what you do. These are the questions that you have to answer that you have to answer it.
The same -- we're blessed as the South Carl and Carl with technology that allows us to work every mind, every minute in every single mind in every single time on the planet -- less than Hotel Randphrase in the Randolphans.
By the way, there's a region in a core of which I haven't revealing anybody in which it works the wife.
I won't tell you about it because I want to use it.
So this is that incredible freedom of choosing that we have to choose with work, is that we need to make a decision, and by the way, and if we should not work and if we should not work with.
We can go to see how our football and to have the mobile bile phone-buzzzzuntary and the other side and laptop, probably that on the other side of the genes.
And even though all of the mind, you know, in which you look at how the dog is that the box is that you can answer this water?
Should you answer this email of the letter? You should write this letter this letter is that the question is, "no" is that the sense of your song is that the bybus of your sweet the byards will be very different from what it would be without them.
So everywhere where we look at the small and the things that you see the style of life, life is a little bit of options.
And the world I was living like this.
To say that, I had some choices to do this, but it wasn't all the choices of option.
And the world we live here is what this is looks like.
And the question is, is this: right?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what I think about what I am going to talk about what I do.
All these choices are two negative effects on people's faces.
One of the effective paradox, is that produces paralyzy, more than release.
And so many options that can choose the choice, people who can choose to ope, people are very difficult to opathletes for something.
You offer a very significant example of the investment of privacy.
A cold of my team had access to the Vancient investment in Vander, the huge companies that almost a million of engaging and almost 2,000 of the sedies.
And what you find is that for every 10 funds that the employees that offer the employees of the participation of two percent.
You have 50 mutually motion -- they are just by 10 percent of the people you engage than if you give you a dinner person. Why?
Because 50 times the motion of mutual that you choose is the naid to decide what you want to choose what you want to choose it.
And then then on the poor and then the cloud and then the cloud and of course, the cloud that this is that this lot.
You understand that this doesn't just mean that those people will consume people to eat the dog for dogs because they don't have enough money to put a sense that stability to put a decision-making decision-making decision-making decision-foot compensation of compensation that would give the employees of compensation that would offer the employees that would be able to engage in the way that you would have the employees that you would have the employees of the employees of the engagement of the way to the engagement of the way to the
We are starting to look at the bottom of 5,000 dollars a year from the employees of the employees that would pay their compenses.
So the consequence is a consequence when you have too much options.
And I think that it makes the world look like this.
You really want to take the best of the eernity if it's for all the eernity, right?
You don't want to choose the flaw or even the snose, or even the flaw the wrong thing to say.
So this is a second is that the effect. And if we can actually come up with the station of the requires and make a choice until the end of the choice than we would be if we had a little choice than we would choose with option between what we choose to choose the choice that we choose to choose the choice.
And there are some reasons for this.
One of them is that you have a lot of soses for the people who want to choose if you look at one and it's not perfectly -- and it's not a good -- you know, but it's not -- you know, you know, whatsoe?
It's easily imagine that you could have a different choice that you could have a different choice that happens is that alternatives that is that alternative that you have done your choice that you made you imagine that you did and these regreen regret from the satisfaction that you actually have a good decision-making choice on the choice on the choice on the choice on the choice.
The more option you have options, the more you want to regret something that is disappointed with the option you have a now.
Second, what economists call the opportunity of opportunity.
Dan Gilber showed very clear in this morning talking about how we are talking about how we lose things that we compare that we compare to what you compare to the way we compare them.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative alternative to take in the thought of the alternative characteristics of the alternative attacks that break you the alternative of the alternative that break you the alternative that makes you less satisfy the alternative that you have a little bit of alternative that you have a little bit of alternative that you have a little bit of alternative to you have a little bit of alternative
Here's an example. I ask for the people who are not New Yorki of the people who are not New Yorkers.
But here's how you should be able to reasons.
We have this box in Hampts.
A very expensive properties.
You get the superbonds. They have gotten a day.
What could you want more and more of it? "Well it thinks "It's august.
Everybody in Manhattan in Manhattan are going.
I could actually park in front of the office of two weeks of the idea that the idea that the opportunity that you can get a little bit of the goal of had a very wonderful parking parking parking parking of it could be a very wonderful thing.
The food strength of the satisfaction that we have to go from the choice is even what choice is exceptional.
And the more options of the options of these options are the attacks of these options of these options will be perceived as we are perceiving opportunity.
Here's another example.
This chartool says a lot of things.
It tells us that we should live the lack and probably we should be doing the slow.
But one of the things that I tell you is that anybody who are choose a choice to make other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of the things that you do what you do you do what you do you do what you do you do what you do you do what you do you do is it.
Third the third route of expectations.
That was my husband when I wanted to replace my blue.
I just get the time of the time.
And there was a way that the law that you were one and you buy them and you buy them as you as the drug as you can get incredibly unable and if you take a lot of time and if you take a long time and you get them to stand up to the better.
So I went to my late my hands after I had gotten a few years and I said, "Look, I want a wall of the laws, this meal of the girl said, "You want to be straight?" And the window of the box of the bodies of the box, bads, right?
You want to be with farmers or with farmers or you want to prevent or heat or heat or heat or heat and you want to be with it?
Do you want to be gone to the unit of the unit of the unit of the unit of the unit you want to be a gone?
You want to avoid, you want to rip the blaaaah. And you don't fine.
He painted me and he was finished to me, and I said, "I want to be the guy who were the only one kind of the kind of the kind of wasting so I spent a city of required all the tale -- with the roads of the roads of my road, with the truth -- with the best of the ones that have had the right thing I had.
I have a lot of the options that made possible to choose a better choice to choose better.
But I was feeling more worse.
Why? I wrote a book I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt worse that I felt worse that we had all these options of my expectations of my expectations of my expectations of my goal.
I had very fast expectancy. I had no idea of when they were very distinctive expected when they were one way to one single way.
And when they are 100 sisters, his mother, one of them has to be perfect.
And what I got was good, but not perfect.
So I compared what I did was with what I expected with what I expected in the comparison with what I hope is that I hope I hope hope to hope what I hope is that I hope hope to the hope of what I hope is that I was hot.
The option of options in the lives of people can't do something else. The people who have to do the expectations that people have to be those options.
And it will take this into the less satisfaction if you get a good result if you get good results.
Nobody in the marketing world,
Because if you know, you don't have the idea of what I talk about.
The truth is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was all the better when it was that when everything was the people to experience the same way that people to experience the surprise.
Today, the world we live -- we live -- we live -- we are industrialized and you look at the perfect thing that you can expect the best thing you can hope that things that you can be so good to be that things that you can be so good to be.
You never never have surprised because your expectations, and my expectations and my hand.
The happiness of the happiness -- the secret of happiness is to have expectations to have expectations to have expectations.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- that I actually have a short soon and it's really cool and it's really wonderful good.
I couldn't find something better. I couldn't find anything. I didn't stand something.
But you can expect your home is not necessarily necessarily as well.
And finally, a consequence of buying a wall of you don't know when you can't buy a single one one one way you can't buy your thank you when you don't get your question, and you ask you why that is that the answer is clear the answer.
The world is going. Where could you be able to do it?
When are hundreds of different styles of lay and somehow you disappointed one that you disappointed and you ask you what?
It's the same clear that the answer to the question:
You could have the better choice.
With a hundred different ways of bringing to choose no excuse for ever.
So when people get decisions, even if people take the choices of choices are good to get these choices of them, they are good to come in.
The deep of the erupper world of the last generation of the last generation.
I think a big contribution -- not the only thing -- but the important thing to do is that people are also the things that are disappointed with synthetic experiences that are disappointed because the standards are too high to be very high on the ground.
And when you have to explain these experiences I think they are the wild.
So the general result is that the result of the more good, and we feel the word.
So let me remind you remind you.
This is the doctrines, which is that we all think is really true and it's all the false and it's not true.
Without the discussion that you have a few choices better than any of the choices are better than the choices are better than a few people are better than a few people are better than a few of the choices of it.
There's a magic. I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty sure that we went through that point in the point where the choice our choice our lifestyle.
Now, the idea -- almost finally I was finished -- the idea that you think is this.
What it allows these choices in industrialized societies is the good good at all.
There are a lot of places and we heard about some of them where the problem their problem is not that many options.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the thing about talking about is a strange issue of Western societies, modern societies.
And what is frustrating and suffering is this: Steve Levitt talk, how these are the chairs for these smoke, and it's gone that we don't help it.
What I tell you is that these options, expensive and complicated not only help.
