And the year we showed these two disorders to prove that the polar polar polar that was the polyymer that was the size of the last three million states were smelled by 48 states of marine marine maybe, was tiny by 40, percent of the big dirty of a little did.
But this morning, this is serious because it doesn't look like the black hole.
The police is in a way that the heart of the climate system.
She extens the falls and contracy.
The next slide that I'm going to show you is a big big going on on what happened to do about about 25 years old.
The peak is the marine sea is the marine of the mice.
As you can see the blue of the blue of incheckyet.
This is the anuity of the year on the time of the same.
And it goes to the sea.
Asad guided the guy, with a year or more than five or more than you can see is almost as a little girls.
In 25 years of doing this, at this one.
This is a problem because the inquote deeply of the deep of the ocean around the ocean's ocean.

This affect the water redge of water.
And predictable, as you can read it, they're serious.
And on the entire global global traveling the dramatic credit incentires.
And the disasters are all the world grew up with a great great role and the birth of precedence.
For four times more in the last 30 years of the 75 years of the 75 years of the 75 years of the year.
This is a absolutely unusual model.
If you look at the history of you can see what happens.
In the last five years we add of 70 million tons of carbon dioxide every 24 hours of 25 million tons in every day every day in the ocean every day in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean oceans.
Look at the same time in the way of the Pacific area of the Pacific and every part of the Indian where the subcontinent of the Indian oxygen in the ocean ocean in the oceans.
The biggest because the only one of the global inquiry of deforests of deforests of the fossil of the fossil fuels.
The Petric is a problem and the cars is the most serious thing is the most serious
The United States is one of the two big emitties of China.
And the proposing was to build more factors.
But we start to see a all the way to see a change.
Here are the people who have been angry in the last few years with propositions.
All right, there was a policy in our political country.
And the carbon industrial industry and the oil, a farm in the last year of the last year --
The good foot is what is a range of an ox.
This is a reminded of something like this.
In the Cracial Cracial Tenness, a billion-stylers was impatient was prastiii-to-mahed cartoon.
You've probably seen to style the style.
This is all the way you get the two big deals in America was made in the preparation of COOOOOOlen in America

We believe that it's curved -- and I loved -- and we go,
So you don't have to be the climate change for the climate change.
And you know that we are.
Video: The good new: You know, you heard a map about it.
So let's do a chance of this cupy of the forest of this poem on the cartoons.

But this is the sound of technology of the technology of the food.
And as the good cars is one of the main inquiry of global remarkable technology, the global technology of technology that you can see here the whole whole thing you can see here.
Look with this is this technology today is the technology of the book.

But we now have a new solution to the noise in the southern incuriosity.
You probably Americans with electricity electricity with electricity in 10 years ago, in 10 years ago,
A plan to put America in the third of the third and help us to stop and help us to stop in the fish, and to make global warming global in warming.
In the end, a solution that is to help us solve our problems.
You probably America. You have America.

If you want to get back to the waste.
We need to get it back and forth.
Thank you very much.
And the year at TED I did a introduction to LHC.
And I promised to give you a data about how this works.
So here is it. And so that they haven't been here, LHC is the largest scientific experiment that was the largest scientist -- the 27 kilometers in the 27 kilometers of recreate the contives of a billion feet of a billion secondary fraction of a billion a secondary fear.
It's extremely of both sides.
This is the Genevelop.
We do photographs these minds of the Big Bang" in the decades.
I work on this one. It's called ATLATLATLATL, Lunged 22 meters of a 22 feet photographer here of ATLATLS here in the construction of the ATLS --
And at 10 seat last year we went to the first time on the first time.
And this picture was the ATLAS.
It caused a great celebration in the room.
It's a picture of the first particle of particle that has gone through the LHCHCHCHC system system system in LHC deliberate from LHC deliberate in the free of the frearom.
In other words, when I got that picture 10 seals that picture 10 seat 10 sediments of a huge successful of a huge success.
I don't know if that was the largest est oils, or that when he went to Google and see that the first page that the first page of the first page of the sea art.
It means that I did a cultural impact on the left of the impact of the intelligence of the impact of the intelligence of the impact of the enough.
And after a little bit of a snape, we had a problem with the device, which actually had to do with these songs.
Those fight of transportation 13 thousand ampers the power function of the massive power of the massive.
Now, engineers in the wind of these days, and I said, "I'm not able to do the spot of the ank."
But I can do that because when they're living temperatures become a superconducted with the superconductor.
So at 271 degrees of the housing of the hospital, that can transport the hospitals can transport this box can transport this one.
At one of the layers of the layers in LHC, was a define of factory was a factory of factories.
So the company was enzymous and the 13 ameers have intaled the electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressive to the magnets that are being spending over 20 tons and they moved almost 30 pounds of a tone of the table,
So I deeply about 50 magnetic magnetic about 50 magnetic
We had to take it out of the things that we have.
I reconcusion, we repair to all the way to do it.
And we go to the magnetic and then we go into subteran.
And the end of the end of the marriage of the LHC will be as new as we are as new as we are.
We're going to start with you again, and we get to get the data in the husband and we will continue to find out of the universe.
Now, of course, that in a way, that those accidents of discuss and engineers about the important scientists and engineers and engineers have been able to rejection.
I think that it is that the fact that we have is so difficult to have a young people like LHCHCHCHCHCCHCHC.
And so I'm going to leave the words of a man a man scientist Humphilosphorus -- who I think when the experiments of the rehasn't been Michael Faraday, he said, "Nimic is not worse for human mind to presence our human beings are being red, as we are not worthy about our bodies are not finding to prevent the natural displaying in the world are not as well.
Thank you.
I want to remind you to remember the child you want to remember when you play with board.
And as you invite what you invent them to get them and get them and get them and get them and you learn how to get and sold and sold and sold and manipulate relationships.
The spot of the spot is about how we understand a lot of how we understand a big part of the world in conjection.
So, in the quality of IT inspired by this meant with this kind of new interaction with our own objects -- impression with my consultant and my collaborator and my collaborator and my collaborator, and I was going to start -- I would be able to use a computer, in this unemployment -- if we use a computer, in this un-endance with a month of a month of a month.
And he wish what we want to do with it?
And this question was so fascinating that we had a chance to research, we had the answer to Swealth of Swealth who was doing Stable Stagging this question of Stagging this question was so much about the question of the fascinating this was so fascinating to be so fascinated by the fascinating to the fascinating thing that we had been attacked to the research.
And in short, Siftable is a computer interactive computer a little bit of a bism.
They can be a dozen -- they can perceive the food, they can perceive the food, and they have a screen and a radio of a wireless of a wireless of a wireless wired.
The most important is that they're palpitches like the game, you can just take them to the game for only water.
And Siftwitches of a new ecosystem of an instrument of the digital manipulation of the digital manian information.
In the survey of the tools become more palpitches of their missions of other, and the consists of the nutritions of our nutritions and fun to explore their own new styles.
I'm going to start with simple.
This Siftable is configuring imagery, and if you include the video -- and you include the movie the other part, if you include the other part, they get back to the other.
These portraits are the interactive of one of the other side of the other side.
So, if I put them one langer on other, they become interested.
If they're unconclusion, they will see it, and they can become a little confussion.
And I can also feel the mission and inclining.
We realized that we can actually have a interesting implication of interaction is that we can use the bees of the obese, how to manipulate the data, how we would be able to a liquid liquid a liquid liquid of a liquid of a liquid of us in a liquid involved.
In this case, we have three Sifwitwitzerlands and the voice of voice and they can use to the town in the center of the center, where they want to be fit in the center of the center of the center, where they are they going to fall of the way to be the refined of three Sifwrap Sifwrap of the wall of the wall
If we can get too much, we can get too mud back.
There are also interesting to educate interestingly interested in education, how they might be a mathematical game, mathematical and logical things that we want to see the possibility to see the results in the right now.
So here I -- this is a Fibonacy, which is doing with a simple program that makes a simple program with a simple program of equation.
And here we have a game game of words -- a kind of combining of Scrabs and Bogging and Boggles.
So every one of the first one of the first one of the Siftag, and the main every Siftag, and the main words, they're grew with a dictionarily dictionary.
Then, after 30 seconds of a secondary seconds of letting a new set of letting a new set of letting a new set of blindness.
Thank you.
Those are the kids who came to the cure of the Media Laborator, and I went to try and go to the way and filter a material.
He just like crazy.
And one of the interesting aspect of this kind of application is that you don't have to give them a lot of people who are not to know them.
All you have to say is "From the words of the words I know exactly what to do.
Here are other people who are asking people to get them.
This is the most tantaneously testing in our right, right in the right,
It seems like everything that wanted to do was to do was to be a Siftable to do one over one of the other.
So for him was only box.
This is a very smart animal.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who invest language.
And this is Felix.
And he can introduce new persons in the stage of the Sweb that they are flowing the person.
And that's where the sun is.
Video: The race.
David Merrill: Now he has a stage in the stage of the stage.
Video: The task for the piror.
Very of ourselves!
When Siftable and the snapping of one langer and the way to interact -- Video: Wideo: Ham!
DM: I create it and your own nart.
Video: H!
DM: It's a finished story with how it is a story of how it will be a deeply of how it will be a deeply of the moon.
Video: Sboy, the pism.
DM: The last example that we have time to show you today is a device of created and interpretation and interpretation and interpretation and the role of the sound of the sound of sounds like the role and all the role of the sound of the role and all the way to the rhythm that we would have to look at the way to show you today is a rhythm that we have been
Each of these four different variations of various variations that you want to use it.
And you can inject the sound of a succession that you can have all the way you can have.
The sound of the sound of the sound of sounds of a sounds of successful Siftable of success.
There are effects that you can control the lives, like the reverberary, and the filter and the filter of the film.
You can see a certain sound of a certain sound and then they include it to help it off.
The next general effects like the general effects and the volume that application is applied to see it.
Video: The man starts with a riting in the second Siftl, we were arriving, we were in a serious extend to a serious one.
Now I now put a basic line.
Video: DM: Now I add a hopefully add of the dangerous.
Video: And now I'm going to add the filter to the top, to control the effect effect effect effect effect effect effect.
Video: DM: You can get inclined the inclining inclining in a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a bunch of inclinic.
Video: I will think that the motion of the baggas for a long expression.
Video: YM: They can do it in time in time --
So I don't have to do the plan, you can get your short or short or short too.
Now, finally, I can find out the third of the Sifwall the way to the Sifwitwitzerland, the inclinical trials in the sea of the sea of the sea sea in the sun in the enss,"
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is the creation is the creation of new interfaces that are better with our brain.
And today, we had time to show you a coordination of this new spatial of design, and how we do it in the labor that we try to get out of the labor that we had to go out of the laboratory of the laboratory of the laboratory of the laboratory of the lab.
The Ganda who wants is like we are at this new generators with this new generators with the midst of interacting with the midst of the world of our rules in our world of our rules in our rules.
Thank you very much.
And these eps with nervous nervous to you all of you to all of you know.
I'm writing it.
He wrote the books is my teacher, but it is, of course, more than that.
It's all my time and fascinating my father and fascinating a liquid life.
And I don't think that is that to change that we ever do it.
But this is what it was said in the life was going to happen in my career and my career who was worth my intreated me with the worker with the worker with work.
And the stranger is that I wrote this book, this self-desire "Manana, Ragest, Iubest."
The result is that they go now, where people go now, people have been tremendous amount of as being dead.
Serios -- confusion.
Will you the ingriridging and you say, "You're not going to be a theme that you can't be able to be able to be able to be able to the performance of this?
You don't think it's going to continue to go to the life that I think about the time to create a little bit of a book that ever ever ever ever ever have?"
It's very linear --
But it was also worse if they didn't remember if you were not worth to 20 years ago, when I was a teenager -- I want to get a writer -- I want to become write, I was a writer in the same African reaction to the same African reaction to the same African reaction of the same African reaction of the same African reaction to the same African reaction of the same African reaction of the same thing as a term of the same way I was a studying of the people -- I want to get to get to get
And people said to me, "Don't you have no longer been you going to have no longer a success?"
Do you don't know that the humility will reject your ideas?
You don't think that you're going to work in this field, and nothing will be in this field, and nothing will be going to be a picture of a dream of a dream of a dream of the spending of the endyname?
Something like this.
The answer -- the short -- the short thing is "Da."
Yes, you feel about all of these things.
And I always got.
And you have a theme in the enough, and you can't get them and die that people can't intuitive.
As an example of the marine algorithms that are cross.
But when it's about the work I was all thinking about the last I was still worth and this is "Where is "Where is "What?
Is that something rational?
It's the logic to be that they are gonna be able to do it as they feel like that they feel like Pamanic.
And what is so specific initiatives that seems like we have nelinists are really true of the health of a kind of health health in a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a way that other teachers?
My father was a chemical engineer and you don't remember as a chemical and you don't remember as a chemical engineering of chemical engineering to be asking him for a chemical engineer to be a chemical engineer to be a chemister.
It didn't happen -- John, how does the stuck in the engineer?
It's just not happening.
But we are able to be honestly income, we don't have too much of the sequences of being alcools of being alcools of being alcools of the previous reasons.
We write that insity, we have this reputation, and not only writing all the way of all the way that they do have this reputation to be powerful as this reputation to be powerful to be strong.
And all we have to do is to look at the numbers of morning the number of morning in the 20th century, in the 20th century, which have died by the list of your own young and often died by the way,
And they actually haven't been able to their own bee beeked, and they really fun of their own talens.
Norman Mailer, even before I go to my last interview, he said that she said, "Each me a little bit more of my card."
A great great great thing about the work of a living.
But we don't have to be when we hear that anybody said that we hear this because I heard this stuff that I heard of a lot of things like this, and we have absorbed and unaccepted to the collective idea that the creative and the idea of the creative and the art, the idea of the desire always infinite in a confidence of the sufficient that we were in a confidence of the word.
And the question I want to adredress today today is you all of this is you have a impact with this idea?
You can comfortable with her -- because as the library of the library -- I don't feel the one with this ideasal idea,
I think it's like that.
And I also think it's dangerous. And I don't want to see it in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage the marriage to travel to travel the way to try.
And I know that I was in my case, in my situation -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to my own magic of this one cause of the cause of this circumstance.
For example, there are pretty tanker, we just have a 40 years of them as 40 years.
I have probably four decades of the work of work for the work of work.
And it's very likely to write the innocent with this moment to be judged by the end of my last few years of my last few years of my father who came up with my last career this: right?
What would be to say the summer for a kind of a kind of a kind of friendly -- it's probably very likely to be happening.
Oh, God, what gand!
This is the kind of the kind of the way to look at the end of the year at the age of 9//1111.
I mean, I do this message this message that I love.
And then, then, the question is: what?
And so I think I was slowly my father was -- like mania was in which I have to try to try and create a kind of psychological construction, it's the kind of a kind of psychological construction?
I had to do that, to find a way to go to a distant distant distant confidence that write, and my father and my father who was going to be now before I write what I'm going to do with what I write.
And as we all went to the last year in this sense, we started to go through this time, and we tried to find other society and we could have a better ideas about how to be able to be better and healthy to be held to be helping people create emotional risk of how to be smart emotional risk of how to create.
This is the Research and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma was the Greece.
So you have the circle, you know the circle.
But in Grection and Roms and Rome, the antitself is that people don't think of the human being being being in the human gene?
People thought that creativity was a spirit was a spirit that they were to get people on a surgery and unintelligence and unknown, and ununderstands and unknown.
The solutions were called these spirits of creatures of creativity, the term of the term of the "proce."
Socracked to be a faight because he has a department that the intelligence of department.
Romans had the same pitch, but they called that crew crew that spirit, imated by creative way,
What is great, because they don't think that they have no way that a genius was a very long way of destiny.
They thought that a genius was a kind of magnitude in a kind of a wise, which is what the Dobby, a kind of artist's wildlife and unable to do the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of workers of the work of the workers of the working of the work of the way that the workfor.
Absolutely -- this is really the distant thing that I was talking about -- that I was talking about -- that the result of the result of the workforce.
And all the world as it is good, right?
So the artist was protected by some of the things that are protected by some of the same narcise, right?
If you had the work was stralucracy, you couldn't get the worst for her, all the world as you had this genius as a genius that has helped us to the tricks.
If you had the work was critical, it wasn't completely the wind -- nobody was not it?
Everybody as the gene as the gene was about ignoring.
And so they looked at the people in the Vest creativity.
Then he came to the Renasting and everything has changed, with a certain idea of mareaway, the idea of the great deal for the individual universe, and the mystery of the universe and mysteries and mysteries that get to the disrupt of the desire to the wisdom of the wrist.
It was the human slowly innocent and people started creating the creative except of the creative excise of the individual person.
And for the first time in history in history and they started to rejection in one or the genius of artistic in place to get a genius.
And you have to married, I think that it was a huge error.
Permittee a simple person, a simple person, and it's actually the receptor is actually the receptor and the snape, and the mysterious mysterious of mysterious emotion is too much more responsibility is too much more responsible for your own psychological psychology.
It's like how you can do it to get the wire of the sun.
It's just a confidence and deforms and deforms all these things that are all these things that are all these things that are over.
I think that the pressure of the artist's one of the last 500 years of the last 500 years of the past 500 years
And, if it's true, I think that is, what do we think is the question is: What are we doing?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we go back to the relationship between people and the relationship between people and the myself.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't just stand to stand and for 500 years of a rational talk.
And you probably find out of the public people who have absolutely lived in the world of the theme of the theme in fact, the people present people press the presentation of the OK and everything.
I probably not to get a town to this idea.
But the question I want to ask is -- why don't I do it -- why not?
Why don't we think about this?
Because it has a long way that I heard about anything I heard about how much we heard about the innosity of the whole bymnant process.
And the reason anyone else who was trying to create something -- in fact, the whole thing -- in fact, as it doesn't always get behavior.
And in fact, sometimes you can actually fit can fit to the right paranormal.
I had a chance where I met in a great American American American Middle of American Ruth Stone, who was now in the 90-year-old man who was going to tell me when she told me when she told me when she told me when she was going to work on the wise, and I just feel and I feel a poisoned and I just hearing a poison and I just heard a pop of the cameras we just heard a pop of a poison and he just as a poet of a poetry and he had a poetry to work on the wison the way to work on the road.
The story as a vast vast and.
And it was the price of the road.
The feeling income in because you have the sample under the leg.
In that moment he has a single thing that has a single thing -- and I read it as a muck of a snape."
And the way that the application to the houses of the stage was to get to a piece of a little bit of a little bit of a fast fast fast time when he went to go through his map.
Sometimes it wasn't enough enough to be enough and the running and the running and the husband and and the poem and the poems and the poem and the poem and the poem and the poem and the poem on the room, and I read it out of the road, I read the poetry and "another poetry and a poetry and get a poetry and get a poetry and tag.
They were also time in the way -- and this is not going to look at -- moments where the story is that the story as almost loss.
And the whole thing that was the main and the main and the truth and water, and the credit card the way to the other hang the story of his other man, and the story with the other man, and he had the other man's sticker and through the other hand.
And the way the code and the road and then it was the sea on the surface of the main of the map.
And so in the situation, the poem on the top of the motion of the last year and unless than the last time at the first worst worse.
When I was hearing -- it's just the supranistic was exactly how my own creative process of creative process.
My creative process doesn't really get to this -- I'm not limited to this -- they're not driving yet.
I'm a catching where I work I work in every day at the same day and go to the same and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go out and go out and truly with the wrong with it.
But I even even even even myself, I was so much like that I was so worth --
And I feel like that as I was also as you can have many of you are.
And I had the projects of the ideas that were able to a source that I don't know a source of a source I don't know it.
And what do you do this?
And how do we should report us to report that we shouldn't lose our minds and the right thing to help us with the disappeal to reach the disease of the blood vessels in the disappeal to reach out that we should have to report us to report us to report that we should have to report us to report that we should have to report that we should be in the way that we should not lose we lose to get to the report the report our minded to help us
For me, the most relevant to the most of our daughter that we can do is the music we can do a musician that I took a piece of a few years to the revivil with the revil of the revil of the revia re-relevant example.
I was going to talk about this subject and all the way to the end of his inner artist contemporary artistic artist who switch the contemporary of the inner and gestablished and gold the creative of the creative and the creative effective inside the creative and the creative of this subject and the creative of this subject of the subject of the human artists.
With the time it was lined linear and immediately the story as a day as a day as a destruction to Los Angeles and then everything has changed.
While I was a short time of a short fragmented a little piece of the piece that comes in minds and magical and magical applied and a little bit of inspiring and a little bit of a wise, and it's not as a little as it is.
It doesn't have any map of map, it doesn't have any creative of the debt.
The experience that I think that the anxiety of rainforest and the Middle of the moment to the money for all time.
I'm not sure to redddying.
And instead of the panical, it was just stop.
He stopped the process and he did something with something like everything with with all of us.
He raised the way and he said, "You don't see that I'm not seeing that they're at volan?"
"Do you think that could write a little note a theory of the accumulation?
If you really want to exist, you get in a moment when I can go to a little bit more right when I can do it.
If you don't get it and you get it of someone else.
Get and you get to the Leone."
He was creative processing this creative process has changed this with this.
Not the operating surgery continues to be as much unexpected to be all of the unit all over the one.
But the process process and the process of the road, and he got around his time he took the sea moment and he was going to win his own wood's going to come back to the way to come back to where the way to come back and then where it doesn't have to come up and Chinese and Chinese and Chinese food.
It could be this union, and the great collaboration and the shapes of a conversation under a conversation and the external external reality, which was not too as Toman-in-term and so that it wasn't too much like Tomomomomanicate that was collaborating collaboration and the whole bizarre and the bizarre of the beautiful and the sea and the shapes of the whole world.
And after I heard the story I started to change a little way I did and already rescued me a little bit of a time.
This approach me when I was in the mid-ror of the "Manan," Iubest, Iubest, and I have a kind of disappearing with a kind of disaster and you all know when we were working on something that we haven't really think about a disaster to be the most subject that it will be the most subject that he never was the most famous to be the most famous to be the most propositioning of the most subcle of the Ragest,
Not just that, but the most profound this book by writing it.
And I was going to think that I should just abandoned the project.
And I remember my hospitals and I was going to go and I tried and I tried and I find.
I went to my head and I got my food, and I got the comment of the roads of a road of the camera.
I said to him: "Asculpture, and I know that if we know that if this is not going to be not only the great thing to be just the same.
Because you can see that I put one on the battle on the battery I had, and more than that.
So if you want to be better and do you have to do the third of you have to do the third of your password.
Okay. And if you don't do that, you don't do this, at the naid too.
And you go to write because this is my message.
And I want to consensus that I did this for my third siz."
Because -- the Conclusion -- -- with hundreds of years ago, in North African people get to the North Africa, and the poorest of the disorder and music to the dirty and music in the end,
And they were always wondering, because dancers were teaching and they were remarkable and they were remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be all wonderful, right?
But sometimes you know, it was happening, and one of the presented of the community of the common in the community.
I'm convinced you all know what I do is about what I mean you all of you know a certain moment of the interpretation of the interpretation of the interpretation.
It's like the time it stops and the dancers is through a kind of a kind of a kind of a lot of different than 1,000 eliness in the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 sers.
And in a time seems to be in the third of the day.
It's the list and the bottom of the bottom is the foundation.
And then when they were going to happen to people who have been saying that they were called to the number.
And even though they were the hands and they were able to scanning the "Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, he ws, God God, God, God, Game, God and yame."
It's God.
A interesting historical historical historical -- when the Turns have invent the Spanish in Spanish and the pronounced in "All, the Humh, Allah, Allahhh."
and they hear the time with the bats and dancers and dancers and dancers
In Spanish when a presented and a massive and magic and magic and magic is a "Allah, magical arm -- magical argu."
The unintelligence -- a God -- a God of God dress.
It's wonderful, because we need to have something like this.
But the head comes up to the second day when the dancers are still going to be slow is the marine and it's not a big scale, and it's not a scale.
It's a dirty that chances are and the genyes, and maybe not worse and maybe not worse to be inalone.
Would you like to do not get the name of Domnor when he was supposed to do with his rest of his life.
It's wrong.
It's one of the most vulnerable to do this in creative life.
But maybe it wasn't a big chance of if you don't have a big if you don't think about the most extraordinary party of your sons come from the most extraordinary parts.
Maybe if you just think about it was impaid by a source of a source of a few years of life on your life and being a lot more than the time when the momentous time when the momentous one-to-day when moments.
If we think about it, it all the way to change.
And so I started thinking and I thought and I was sure that the last months of the last months of the book that will be published by the way, and the danger of my dance and cross-framework of my unit was a stranger and crisis.
And what I do, I do -- I think when you lose the clear -- you don't be a lot.
It doesn't be the safe and just faithy the Continy Continy the Contintiny to do it.
If you give your dance, then dancing.
If the gene comes and the gene of what you do is repair to go to the extraordinary choice, and even for a short range of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the disorders and the repair of disorder,
And if you haven't worry.
And with all of this "th."
I think in these things and I think we should have to pretend them.
"Oh!" for you, all of you have a loaded for the kening and incaping and indoor and capital in continuing to keep the participation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I talked about some of these projectomor what the human genome and what could be able to predict the discover of the genome onto the gene.
Now we start with a new point of viewer: we have digital biology, and now we're trying to start to start to start to go to a new biology, and to go into a new biological and dance for, modeling force and dable force force and dable force force and dable force of life.
We tried to do all the time to ask us questions.
"What is like?"
We tried different approaches, simple ways of thinking about the basic components.
We already already are about 20 years old.
When we sequenced the man man man man man took from the analogical world of biology in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world.
Now we try to ask the question: Can we regenerate new force of life, or we can create new forces in this digital universe, in this digital universe, in this digital universal universe.
This is a little bit of a little organism Mycoplasma genome that has the smallest genome that can replicate in the labor of a specific layer in the lab.
We tried to see if we can come up with a genome and smaller genome and smaller one.
We have been able to receive the ordering of a gene of a hundred of the age of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the metabolic maps, it's pretty simple, it's pretty simple, it's pretty simple.
So I think it's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can get the first time is probably a little bit like that is probably a little bit like this is probably going to be a living.
So we decided that we had the only way to be able to be the chose, we can actually get the components to the party components to bring some of the most fundamental components of questions.
And so we started on the road, "Can we get a cross-cross-cross?"
Can you chemistry allows these molecules that we haven't done more than we ever haven't ever done before?
And if we can actually a cross-cross-cross-rhythosom?
A crosis, by the way, by the way, it's just a piece of chemical material.
So, our speed of digital life grew up at a time to a exponentially.
Our ability to write code code and motion is moving too slowly slowly slowly up.
And the last time he got to a exponential curve on a conclusion.
I started this about 15 years old.
I went through a few days, and in fact, with a biomic examination before we do the first experiments.
But it turns out that the Association is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make little DNA of DNA and a long way of 30 to 50 letter 30 lets, but it's a very degenerative process of doing a long piece of paper with a long piece of taps of the car.
So we had to create a new way to put these little little little bits together, and the right of the right of the error.
This was our first tentative, from the first stage of the digital nose of the Nature of Ph.D.
It's a little virus that killed the bacteria.
I did a little bit of the piece of goods, and I got a molecule and I got a molecule of DNA by about 5,000 letters of a little bit about 5,000 letters.
The interesting thing that when I took this piece of chemical material, and we put it in bacterial material and we put it in bacterial bacterium and the bacterial and produces this code of the virus and produces the virus and produces the virus.
The viral park were then released from the cells, and they came back and they were killed and they killed the E.D.
I was going to see the oil industry and they said that I understand that I understand that this pattern.
They have laughed more than you are.
And so we think this is a situation where the software can actually build their own main a biological system.
But we wanted to do something more bigger than that.
We wanted to build the entire cross-bacteria.
This is over 580,000 kille-letter of genetic code.
So we said, let's put the road of the letters in the sea of the virus to could be able to able the size of the size of the sea level of a life cells.
And the conclusion is critically, and if you start with the digital information has to be very precisely as a very precision.
When I sequenced this genome in 1995, the first stage of the precision was a chance of a wider to 10,000 tallons of the walls of the basic waste.
I found it in the resolution of 30 error 30 errors. If we were used to be able to be activated.
Pirt in design is designed by the piece of food, which has to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a piece of letting the sub-unit is to build some of the small one-to-to-day design so so that we have to design some of the other ways.
We create unitable elements.
You may read that I put "the waters" in the house. Get a drug of this: We have a genetic code, C, and T.
Triving those letters -- those letters of the red of about 20 remember a table -- a single literally literally acired literally acid.
So we can use the genetic words, to write words, sentences.
And the idea that we did was to hear the code.
Some of them were disappointed that it's not poetry is not the poetry.
We designed those little little so that we can define was with enzyme.
I'm sure that they repair and they are them.
So we started to do the piece of the gaps of five to 7,000 lets them go to 7,000 lets them do with them in the 24,000 lets the toilet of these toys in this 2,000.
Every time we get these little piece of these pieces of abundant to sequences them can sequencing them to create a very range of a very range -- as you can see a very roughly the way you can see in a mind.
We try to get to that point that point point point of automative.
So, this is what a basketball of the baskets.
When we get to the very big pieces of the basic pipeled, they don't grow as much as they are not going to E.
It is all the modern biology of biology molecular biology.
So we went to other hang to other hand.
I knew that there is a mechanism called recombination of the biology that biology is -- that biology is ADNA and that is useful DNA and which is a lot.
This is an example.
There's a organism called Deinocockroaching millions of radio rehas' radiation.
As you can see in the same, the cross-shelf is fun in the lot.
A half hours of a new hours later, he took us back to the one of the way that was at the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be deeply all of the styles.
I can live in life in your life.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the space can be in the exhibitions, to go to find a new environment a new environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is where this is the dark there.
This is a micrograph of a molecule that we build these procle -- in fact, using these procle little structure with only the design of the bodies that we put the skin that we put the skin that we put on the both.
Dround it together,
This is not a picture from a microscope with electrons, but only a to-micrographic to-hypothese.
It's so a big molecule that we can see a microscope with a microscope of a microscope.
These are images collected over a secondary of about six seconds.
This is a public that we've had a little bit of time ago.
These are over 580,000 kille-letter coding the genetic code.
It's the largest molecule made by a definition, with a definition.
It has a molecular molecular molecular molecular over 300 million.
If we take a little bit of 10 and no space for 10 to the space of 142 pages to fly into the genetic code.
So, how do we start a cross-cross-cross-gray cross-it?
Evivil with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to the bacteria.
And I also also think about when you get to eug eers: you can only get to the nucleus and put the nucleus and do something you heard -- and that's something you heard --
With the archa, the cross-gray is integrated in the cells, but we showed you that we can do a split transplant to a completely completely filled by a completely crosis, from a cell to annount:
I got a check of a microbial species,
These are about as as as people and the way that people and the same.
We added a few genes in payway to get to the crosis.
I had desperate to the enzymes to the whole protein.
And it was pretty amazingly when we put in the cellphilosophical gray -- and cross-bloss -- and cross-graded into the cell.
In fact, we thought that this is how far it can go out and go and we tried to design the process something that is something that is more than that.
This is a major mechanism mechanism mechanism of evolution.
We get all kinds of species that have been embarrassed a second crosis, or a third of the third of the third of the third of the other new specific fic fic fic and new characters in a second.
So those who think about evolution just as a single gene is just a moment of biological moment they have lost a lot of biological than biology.
I'm sorry, called restriction of restriction that actually had been dealing in DNA
The romosome that was in the cell that was not a one.
The way we put -- the cross-old --
It was expressed and he was expressed and the other cross-material, and he was desperately with the cross-free to the cross-free to the new cross-new skill.
It became blue because of genes that we put in crosis.
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristics of a species have lost a completely new species have lost in a new species, and it was a new specific piece of the software that we put in the cell.
All the proteins were changing, membranes were changing, the membranes -- when we focus on the genetic code, is exactly what we transferred out.
This can sound like alchemistry, but we can move through the DNA in DNA, and we can change things very dramatic.
Now, we rescued that this is not genesis -- but it has been building three and half years and a half of evolutionary evolutionary to create a new version of a new version of a new version of a new specific in which it has a new specific specific in which he has a new specific design for the digital mammals.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obviously obviously of needle for us.
We're on the way to go from six and a half of the nine billion people over 40 years of the years of people.
To try to give that in context for me in the context I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the plane for every one of us in 1946, in 40 years, will be four years old.
We have a snapping of the poor water water water supplied water to six billion and a half of the six billion and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half of the food.
It will be difficult to do it for us.
We use over five billion tons of books, more than 30 billion tons of oil bars of oil bumps
This is a hundred million bars a day.
When we try to think about procle or any process that will replace that to replace that, it will be a challenge.
Then, of course, is all that CO2 from this material, which is that it gets to the atmosphere.
Now, from our discoveries of our world, we have a basic data with a gene, and I like to think about these as the components of the design of the design of the future.
The electronics is only a double double doubt, or so -- or the diversity that came out of the various thing that came out of this.
We're limited here, first of all, biological reality and our imagination.
We have now techniques of these kinds of things like we call what we call what we call what we call what we call the genymical genimically.
We have the ability to build a big robot that make a big robot that do a million a day.
When you think about it to process these 20 million genes of different genes or try to do it by making the chance of procccosmic proctic, or producing our phones we can change the phones, we can just change more biological than the last 20 years, we can do more biological than the last 20 years,
And that's just a standard.
We can select for viable viable to vil fuels or or bbbbbbbbbyard.
This is a capture of the screen of a design that we work in order to wake and work to work and work on these species in computers.
You know, we don't know how it will show you how it will show you how it will look like this.
We know exactly how their genetic code.
Now we focus on the box of the copy.
You saw that from the mirror is only one experiment is a needle
We have the whole of the next generation of the next generation, and the third of the way they are not, which are the air flow of the forest or various forest or different types of butterrain.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact on the food and the food and the fall of the way to CO2 as the limited of CO2 as a math to design the stem to design is to design the way to design is to design the way to design for the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the next fourth of the fourth of the Ts.
Loin solar and CO2 is a way -- but in our discoveries of our world have all kinds of other ways of our world have all kinds of ways of the world have all kinds of ways of the world in the world of the world and the way to the solar and CO2 and CO2 and CO2 is a solar and CO2 is a way of the WO2 is a way of the world -- but in our world is a lot of different ways of our world.
This is a organism that we had been described in 1996.
It goes into the deep oceans, about two kilometers and half a half of the deep temperature, at temperature.
Transform CO2 metan use of hydrogen as a survey as a survey of energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 captured, which can be easily transported in the country, and convert that CO2 back to the base of the sun to the base in the base in the road, to the way that we can actually get this one.
So in a short period of time, we think we could stay what is the basic question, "What is the life?"
We know -- we know -- we have a little patterns of replacing the entire oil industry.
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where another paradigm where another paradigm in the other part?
So let me become a major source of energy.
But we also work to use these same same same source to invention in the same vacuum.
You saw this year with a near and a year later, we're always a year and a living, and a little bit of the right vaccine.
I think that situation can be changing vaccines that are building vaccines with any dinosaur than before.
And here's how to get the future of the future of changing the future of evolution now is the evolution of the evolution with bacterial bacteria, and finding the theater, and finally, infinally, infinite of the end.
We're almost to improve people.
Our base is only to make sure that we have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of able to be able to do this. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you you next to you first, is a new technology, a new technology that we've added to Microsoft it as a part of a year about a year at the year ago -- this is the lot. This is the lot.
It's a environment that can be locked to distance with a big amount of visual data.
We're looking at a lot of new photographs and marriage and marriage in continuing almost perfectly by by the way, rearancy by this rearannounced by it.
It doesn't matter how much information we are looking at the big information is these collies are these collies or how big images are images.
Most are the photographs are a common digital cameras, but this is a regular scanner, for example, is a Congress, a Congress,
It's not important because the only thing that we should limited the performance of a system of your monitoring is the number of your skin on a very fly of your monitoring architecture. It's also a very fly architecture.
This is a book that is a bit of a non-imaginative example of a nonimaginative example of it.
It's about "the Sputy Charles Dickens. Every coloan is a chapter is a chapter is a chapter of a chapter in a chapter of the "Cs is about a chapter of "C" --
To demonstrate that it's about textbook, and not a imagine, we can do this, to look at this is a real represent a real represent a real position of a textbook.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read a book in formed electronics.
I wouldn't give you a recommend.
This is a word. It's a more real. It's a "Gardian "Gardian of "Gardian of a saving.
Each picture is the beginning of a second.
This is really allowed you a piece of joke, a paradigm of a revil of a revil of a newspaper environment.
We did something little bit of us with this number of the Wardian of Gardian of the Gardian of the Gardian in."
I created a false reclaim to a very larger -- much larger than any clear -- and I was a common conclusion -- and I was a conclusion.
If you want to see the properties of this car, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the techniques.
And this is actually by some ideas, the release of a monitor.
We hope that this is to be the pop-up and other mizes and other mizes of the kind of -- which are not necessary.
Of course, the mapping is one of the same technology for a technology of this kind of technology like this.
I'm not going to see a lot of time on this stuff, but just to tell you that we have to tell you that in the field.
These are all the road in the United States of the United States of a gold geek of NASA CASA --
We're going to go to a little bit more.
This is actually active on the Internet accomplish.
This is a project called Phope, which is the second two different technologies of them is Sealoon and the other beautiful research in the other beautiful research in the visual perception of the visual universe, and the other computer computer computer -- absolutely absolutely doned by the University of Washington, the British Steve See Steve See See Steve See Life of See See Life technologies.
and Rick Szeliski at Cersus.
So this is active on the Internet because Sealoop.
You can see that when we create that when we create this kind of perspective, we can have this kind of experience in a lot of solving experience.
But the space of the space of these images of these images that matter.
Algerian unit visions have recorded these images have these images that they can require the real space where these photos of the Grases of the Grases of Schools -- they were achieved. They were facing these elements here and these elements here were the related or panterrorists in a space of space.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you another environment.
There are some that have much more space space of the space of other space.
I want to go to one of the original stage of Noah -- this is a big prototool of Photosynical prototool -- to show you what I think is the pioneering of this technology, and it's also a bit of this technology, just by vision, and it's not necessarily only vision.
We had to have a concert aspect of the legal aspect of the legal aspect of it.
This is a reconstruction of Cateur Dams in images of the images of Flickr. Down, and you find a None of the Denhr, and you find something like a chicken in the room, from the trouble images of these conporters are found that would be found that they were found that they were found that cool.
These are a photographs of Flickr, and all of the space in this place, and all of the space.
We can just snavigate in this motion.
You know, I never thought I would have to work at Microsoft is is very etheless, it's very great to have a part of a first here.
I don't see that I am a lot of the road of the room, the whole range of the cell phones at SLRs Rs and a very big number of environment.
If you can find out that strange.
There are so many trouble with the face, box.
Some of this is a series of photographs --
This is a poster with Nothing that was recorded the right now.
You can get you to a poster environment to a physicist for this environment.
The idea is that I can do some things with the social environment. This is to collect all the world -- from the whole world -- from collective world -- and to be connected to the Earth -- and to interact with them all these pictures have been connected to them -- all these photographs that is more than the one of the focus that is more than the focus of the citizens.
You've got a model of what the entire Earth is the entire planet.
Think about this as a long as the long as you can go to the next Virtual Syler "Western Earth."
And this creation is how the world uses it as the world as much as it is getting bigger as they are getting bigger as users as they use it.
The teachers are all the pictures of meters that somebody else has enough.
If someone else's finding these sfines and say who I am and say who I am a NGDs would improve the Dame, and I could use all these data to get the way to go to the airplane to go through that space, to make it as a social experience.
And of course, a product product and rich is the huge sea of the biass of the entire life of the Earth is not only in the Earth, collection of the earth and images of the village of the village and images of the village and images of a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood going? What will it be as a moment in a moment in the next few years, is that is that all the pictures of the pictures of somebody who is that all the pictures of the right picture?
BAA: Yeah. What does is really look at is to understand is to understand it.
It creates hyper-lining creatures, between images of images.
And it does that based on the conclusion.
And this is becoming a quick of the difference of the meaning of the meaning of the image.
As you do a little bit of imaging on the Internet, and you hear the word on the Internet and the text on the Internet gives a lot of information on a lot of information about what the pose.
Now, what if that poses the connection of all the pictures of all the picture?
And then the amount of connection and the box that is also the box that is where the huge effect is where the classroom.
CA: Blawyer, is incredible. Felicists.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the traveling pain and one of the great researchers and a night-of-the-the-the-the-old bodies that don't really look at their past, which I still feel the last sun switches in the sea roads of plants.
I don't know that Jaguary Jaguary Jaguary Lacuiss, or that the myths of the old old lesses of the old lady of the Himalay, or that in Himalay, it's just to remember the center of anthropology, and this is not a sense of anthropology, but this idea that we live in a sense that there is no idea that we are not really really uncomfortable model, but this is a model of reality.
The consequences of a certain set of choices that we have to do it with a lot of our generations and success, and success, with a lot of generations in the next generation.
And of course, we all share the same imperative adapties.
We all are born. We all bring kids on the world.
We go through the initial rituals.
We need to do the separation of morning, so we should not be surprised that we should not surprised that we all have to have a little art.
But what is interesting is the dealing of songs of song, the rhythm in every culture.
Whether the Penor Penor Penor Borneo, or the welcome from the wind of Vooo in Haiti, or the war in the northern of Kenya Raisan Davander, or a meant from the middle of the Saharan Iraqerahara in the middle of the Sahard's football in the middle of Borneiby the middle of Bordan is in the middle of the Borrouo of Haitdoo from the Sahardoo of Haao, or of the Bor-Hish, or of
And by the way, this is the guy who I traveling a long time or even a month, or even a forest of Qomold, Everest, the Everest, the earth of the world --
All of these people are learning that there are other ways to be a different ways of thinking about the other ways to think of your planet.
And this idea, if you think about it, you can't kill your hope.
Now, miridges of the world with a spiral of spiral life and culture, and culture, and the cultural life that cooker and it's the same important for the human health of life -- known as the biological requires of life, known life, and we know about the biological red.
And you might think about this redance of life as being a dose, and you could define the nosphere of all my dreams, ideas, inspiring the myth of advertising the human imagination of the human imagination of the conscience.
Etnosphere is the human beings.
It's the symbol of what we can be like a surprising specific spectrum.
And as the biosphere has been seen, and so the nosphere -- and maybe a much bigger scale.
For example, no matter how the biomats that would not be able to suggest that half of all the species, because it was in the expensive, because it is not true, and yet this is not true, and yet, this is the most spread of biological -- -- -- the most optimistic biological stage -- the most optimistic in diversity.
And the largest indicator is the most of this is available to the limit of the limb --
When you were born with you with this room, there were 6,000 languages, there were 6,000 languages.
Now, a language is not only a lawyer or a frequency of frequencies.
A language is a spinning of human spiriting to human spirit is.
It's the vehicle that the slow of the slow of particle particle flows the world.

And the world I was living like this.
To say that, we had some choices that we had some choices to have some choices of option.
And the world we live now looks like this.
And the question is, is good or or bad news?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what we know about this, so I will talk about what I'm going to talk about what I do.

Plose a superbit. They have a wonderful day day. They have all right.
What could you want to want more and more and less than the drug is thinking about the drug --
Everyone in my card caryou are gone.
I could think about the desert of the office." And what I was two weeks of the idea that the snapping of the idea that this is a place to have a place to have a place to have a place that great parking for the parking thing to do is that in the front of the office.
The food stage of satisfaction that we have in the satisfaction that we have to choose is right now.
And the more options are the more options of these options are the same characteristics are going to be perceived for us as we are perceiving the opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartooner says a lot of things.
He says that we should live with the mission and we should be able to do things at the beginning.
But one of the things that tell you is that everyone choose a choice a choice to do not do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things that are living and that will do what you do you do what you do about what you do you do about what you do you do about it.
Third of waiting for ways.
This was when I wanted to replace my blueprints.
I think about all the time.
And there was a poetry that blugs were a single one and you buy them and you buy you and you buy them and they were incredibly uncomfortable to get them and if you give them a long time and they were getting to the way and the safety of time and safe.
So I went to replace my blankly, after I had a good at the old and I said, "Look, I want a wall of the blug, and the windows, and the windows, and the windows, saying, "Would you like to be smile, snapping to the snapping of my bluse?"
Do you want to have the farmer or with farmer? Do you want to preper or your finger?
Do you want to be the gone?
You want to eventually get rid to the blind -- and not the far.
He painted my face and after I said, "I want to be saying, "I want to be a guy who was the only one guy who was the only one of the idea that I had spent a check of the walls of the walls of the walls -- and I went to go and I went out of the right -- the way I had.
I have gone do the little bit better, these options have done better for a better choice.
But I was feeling worse.
Why? I wrote a book in which I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt worse is that I felt that we had all these options of my expectations about how I should be a wall the way to be a wall has grown a good wild of the good enemy.
I had very fun expectancy expectancy expectation of when they were a single wave when they were a single way.
Now when there are 100 sisters, my mom and one of them has to be perfect.
And what we got was good, but I didn't get it.
So I compared what I got with what I expected and what I expected and the result is that I was disappointed in a compared to what I hope I was hopefully in the same.
The option of options in the lives of people can't do something else.
And the right will go to a little bit less satisfaction even if they get good results.
Nobody in the marketing world doesn't know that.
Because if you know that, I won't have the idea about what I am I going to talk about what I am I going to talk about it.
The real thing is more like this.
The reason that was all better when it was worse is that when it was worse that when people were actually more likely to expert was actually possible to expert to be a very much more likely to be paying the sources.
Today, in the world we live -- we live -- we have industrialized in the world, we have the best thing to expect the perfect thing -- the best thing you can say that things will be so good that you can be so good to be so good as you expect to be so much as you expect to be so far.
You never have a surprised because the expectation of my expectations and my own wave to the sky.
The happiness of happiness -- because you all came up with -- the happiness is to have expectancy waiting for reduse.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- that I actually have a little wide -- that I actually have a beautiful goal and it's really a beautiful right to the right right now.
I couldn't find something better than that. I didn't have any more. I didn't stand up.
But let's look at the home, you don't necessarily not necessarily
And finally, a consequence of a buying wind of a wall you can't buy a little bit of when you can buy a single one one is that when you can't do it, and you ask yourself why is it and ask you why that is the answer is to the answer.
The world is saving. What would you have to do this?
When are hundreds of different styles, different style and buy one that you disappoints of the base and you ask yourself, what?
It's just as a clear that answer:
You could have to choose better.
With a hundred different ways of choose to choose to choose any scale.
So when people get decisions, even when people get decisions are good to the choices are good to the choices are good disappointed to the other people are getting out of the bees are getting up.
The Depression in the operating world in the last generation.
I think a big contribution -- not the only thing to do is not the only thing to do is the depression of synchrors, it's that people have experienced in the standing thing because the standards are too high in the remained --
And then when we need to explain these experiences believe they are the waste.
So the result of the general is that we do better better, and we feel like that.
So let me remind you remind it.
This is the doctor, which is what we all believe in a real and it's not true, and it's not true.
Without the discussion that you have a few choices better than none of the choices are better than the one of the choices are better than the otherwise you have.
There's a magical number of magic. I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty sure we have been doing so much about that point where the choices we choose our own lives.
Now, the idea -- almost we almost finally finally -- the idea that I think is this.
What it allows these all these choices in the society is good at the materials.
There's a lot of places in the world and we heard of a few of them where their problem is not that much options.
The problem is that they have too little bit of it.
So the thing about talk about is a strange of Western society and richer.
And what is frustrating is this: Steve Levitt talks about how these chair of cars about how these sees and hard to be held to not help.
What I say is that these options, expensive, expensive, and complicated not only help.
They actually actually really quote pairs.
They are really doing to feel more worse.
If something that allows us to our society society that we do all the choices that we do all be transferred in society that people have too little that people have too little to be improved in the same way that we have improved our lives.
This is what economists call the Pareto.
The reefs of the income is going to be better -- not just poor -- because of the way that we are in this excess of choices that exist us to the choice.
In conclusion. It precles that you can do this cartooner and a sophisticated person you say, "Wow.
You know that nothing is possible in this acvarious about the poor quoility on the world -- so I read it out of the world -- so I read it and I read it and the first time to the first time.
But the way I thought I was so at the way I got to think that the fish knows why.
Because the real is that if you hope that everything to be possible, you don't have a freedom of freedom of the resident.
If you slow the acvarious wave that everything is possible, the multiple level.
You create the desire and the truth and today are born.
Anyone needs a wave acvarious ways.
This is almost too limited -- probably for a fish -- probably for us to be safety for us.
But the absence of a metaphor is a reeter-reeting red, disaster and prevent a lot.
Thank you very much.
