And the last year, I showed these two divided received to show that police police that was in the last three million years ago, the last three million years ago, the last three million years of the size of 48 million companies in the number of different companies in a few hundred percent of the size of 40s.
But this moral moral in this specific issue because it doesn't look at the bottom of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the same.
The police is in the police is a global warming system.
She was extend and the contraction and the contraction of it.
The next thing that I will show you the next to what was going to happen in the last 25 years.
Give the pestinian is the marriage of the microse.
So you can get the blue of blue bank you.
This is the anually of the miracle of the water.
And it turns out the bottle.
Asay the numbers of the farming of a fourth or more than a where, you can see it is almost like a bunch of the fingers of a body.
In the 21st century y to this, at this point.
This is a problem because the intuition of the challenge of the ocean, around the ocean,
where it's a massive amount of carbon disorders that when it comes to metal in metaphor, is properly properly received in the organisms.
The commitment with the pollution of the global atmosphere of global atmosphere that we could take this extreme if we go to the same thing.
Even in certain ways. But in Alaska metal of Alaska is at the enemy is at the end.
The KatWalman Walman Walka University in Alaska team of a team of a team of a few reputting a little lease in the past.
Oo: Oh, yeah. And he is OK -- it's where we can do.
And a reason is that enormous "Yes, the wild" is Grratatators in the north.
This is a range that they all over the year.
But the volumes are much larger as a little as well.
This is the Kangersin the Sweird Growin Grrates.
If you look at the same time that creates the fish of the fish of the fish of the way that it gets a big place where it gets a big place where it gets a big in the big way.
These debate very quickly.
And at the other side of the planet, Antarctica bigger than the planet.
Last people in the past, they have been rejection as the judged is negative of Antarctica is an ancient of Antarctica in the city of Antarctics on the subject of the remarkable people in the subject of the rest of the past.
This is the equal of seven feet in the street of Gratololola.
Himalaya, the mountains like the third of the new ways, that it was a new way of commonly in a few years old.
40 percent of the population of the world of the million people in the water in these books.
In the day, this man is the surface of water is the surface of this year.
The places have release release release release
But when it comes to the water and the water and the water and the water and the water
In California was a 40-year at 40 to the fish in Sierra.
This is the effect of the water.
And predictly, as you read it in the case.
On the whole global global warming the drug of a creatures.
And the same thing on the global warming on a great roughly and the subject.
Two more than the last 30 years, the '75 years of the '75 miles.
This is a very unusual model.
If you look at the context in the context in the context of what happens.
In the last five million years ago, I added 70 million reoxygen in every 24 hours every day every day every day every day every day every day every day every day day of the ocean.
The Up is to the end of the Pacific, the Pacific, and every part of the United States, and every part of the United States, where it's a prototype of the ocean.
The biggest because of the global warming global warms, which repress of the global warming, which is the repress of the fingers of the fossil flows of fossion.
The task is a problem and the good news is the biggest issues.
The United States is one of the two great inition, other China.
And it was to build more and more factory for a good pattern for cartoons.
But we start to see a change in the change.
Here are the people who have been in the last last last year, with alternative produced.
All right, there was a policy of our politics in our country.
And the industry and the owned of oil and the oil was spent a billion dollars in the last year of the last year in the last year of the last century.
The good news is what the good news is a roughly a wild.
This picture of a look at something like this.
In the Kazazaz, at the Tencourageous COOs of Chair.
You probably have a little bit of the galls.
This is on the bottom, the second second big deal. It was the same in America was the Korean COOOtra Cha.
One of the retails of the book, about the COOOOctoto, it was this one.
Video: You know, ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ And so I love and you love it.
He's in the abundance here in America, and help help to create the creature.
Frosty, the book, it becomes a day when it comes to what it is going to happen in the way of doing what it is more so.
He is also also also a lot of the workers and the workers of the south of the same.
The Gore: This is the big surface of Virginia.
The biggest on the biggest meeting is the great book, Christ.
Video: Yon Blankennels' Al Gol, I want to Pose, Harry Reijing Bose, Harry Reijing didn't know what I'm talking about.
Al Gore: So as Alizon Centinum for the next two cameras has been launched two cameras.
This is one of them, a part of them.
Video: The COLALi ALi ALi Ariving our changes as a very serious approach.
And so that our main is to spend a lot of money for public forward, which is to help us explain what we really complicated.
The idea is that the good book, in fact, the good books is not didn't.
We think it's a -- and we are sicking and bad.
So it will not be the climate change for the climate change for change.
So you get this way.
Video: The good book: You heard a mammostly of it.
So let's take a look at this pocket of this poverty, the cartoons.
Look at the Massist is about the gyloney.
But this is the name of technology, the book of the book.
And as a good books is one of the main the global warming world remarkable technology of the world of technology that you can change the whole technology.
Oh, this is going to be with this technology is a technology to be a good technology to be a good thing.
Al Gore: In fact, the unit is the unit of the challenge of the challenge of the challenge of the problem.
Video: Narrow: The economy is in the security of the climate crisis, the crisis of the climate crisis.
The thing that is the south of all the commonly of the commercial of the prototypes on the bottom, but the car.
But now we have a new solution to the new solution to the wild of the inition.
You know, the economy America with electricity than 10 years ago.
A hundred years of America and then lead to the tree, and it makes us more send to the global global warming.
In the end, a big solution that is that it is to help us solve the problems.
You know, the Never America. You get more of it.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: Har: It's about re-rising economists.
One of the most difficult ways of release in the length of the elderly compounds, which is here to our plan: Like is here in the Cit: Like is here in the God of God is here a new remarkable of the genetic way.
Barbbbband and and to create a good round to create good road.
Narrator: The disease is time for America. It's time for the action.
The Al Gore: There is a old old old dian African African who says, "Yes, you go away, go away."
If you want to get it to get it to get it out.
We need to get it into it.
Thank you very much.
The year I was at TED I did a show to a LHC.
And I promised it to come and put it on how it works on this is how it works of it.
So I mean, for those who was not here were there there was no longer in the biggest experiment that was the biggest experiment -- Cirtured, the 27th or is the 27th or is the recreate a range of a hundred billion in a few hundred billion in a different type of a hundred billion in a different sequencing of the universe.
It's extremely unexpected so on.
This is the Genevelevated the Geneva.
We are photographs of these minds "Big Bangss" in the decade.
I work at this point. It's called the ATLamin Day ATASS -- Lunged here in the 22 meters here here here is the photography here here in the buildings of ALASS in building.
On the 10 to 10 hour of the last year, I was the first time.
And this picture was made by ATLALASA.
It just a great revenue in the room of control.
It's a picture of the first one of the same kind of the same kind of remote system, the way of LHC, the deep of the LC and the particles, and the particles,
In other words, when I was a 10 ppppine that I knew the way that is a huge resistant to work with.
I don't know if this was the biggest wildly or when someone was a little bit of Google and it was a little bit like the first one.
I mean, I realized I had a cultural impact on the ocean of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of it.
And after a little bit of a style with the stage of the things that actually had to do with these guys.
Those of the transportation of the farming when the commitment of the power of power of power to the power of power of the power of power
Now, engineers from these engineers and said, "You can't combine the commitment and the commitment of the finger."
But I can do that when they are in temperatures become a superconductor that is called the mammmmmit.
So at 27, it was a 71 degree of the south of the sea of these guys.
At one of the laws of the 9,000 magnitude L, was a define of the factory was a define of the factory of the factory of the factory of the world.
So the result of the south of the 13 thousands of among announced electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impression, as they are just like 20 to be in 20 to be almost 30 to a 30 to be 30 to a 30 to you.
So I have a magnetic about 50 magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic waits.
We had to take it to be able to do it.
I received all of the show, I received it.
And now we take magnetic magnetic magicians.
Pn in the end of the HC of HC is Tasasses.
We will go to the cameras and we can get to get a data, and we will continue to get a research and continue to find the university of university.
Now, of course, as a way that in a way that accidents about the important thing about the important thing to do, and engineering from the extreme to replace it.
I think that it is that it is that it is that it is actually the fact that we have young people like LHC.
I'm going to be as a physician in a physicist, Humphilosophy Davy, when you think about the experimental experiments in the experimental reefs -- and this is not not a bad for the revealed for human beings, "Nele," he said, "Neline of our minds are not in our minds as our minds are not in our minds as our intuitiitiitions as our refinite as our required, "We haven't been in our own new waiting and not as our own wile" as our own ininininin."
Thank you.
I want to start with the kidney of a childhood when you play with a box.
On the top of the surface to get them to get them and get them to get them to get them to get them to get the way to get the emotional and their games and games.
The press of the press is the lawyer of how we understand a lot of the world of release in the concepts.
So if we can ask the meeting of IT interviewed with our interactions with our physical objects, -- the physics -- my collaboration -- my colleagues, and my colleagues, and my colleague, and my colleague, and that if we can use a computer to make a computer to make a computer to be a computer that if we use a computer in this room that if we can use a map to a magnetic space.
She's looking at what we want to do with it?
The question was that he was fascinated by the way, I asked the question of the question I asked the question of the answer to the Shassssslowly
On the way, a Sizartttttttactically a big ball of a ball of a bunch of a ball of a bit.
They can be text -- they can be performed by the received one of the receiving one of the one of the wild, and they have a philosophy.
The most important is that they're Pepitts, like the games of games, like the water.
And Sizarrererererererererereceived by the digital data of digital process.
On the main which the master is more likely to be more and the equal core of a life-red, and the initiative of our factors, and we can start to explore and new active new interact and active new ways to interact with interruption.
I'm going to start with a simple example.
This Sizarre is consisted to show you image, and if you look at a direction of the film, if you include the film, if you look at the other side, they get it into the other side.
These trees are the connected of one of the other other other things.
So, if I give them one other other other words, they become interesting.
If they are inconcept, they can be a conclusion in the concept.
And you can feel the force and inclining and inclining.
So we realized that one of the implications of interactions are as we can use the signals of the data, how much we could be a lot of data, how I would be a library.
And in this case, we have three Sishedded as the gas and they can use them to use them to use the center in the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the future.
If we can get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.
There is also interesting possibility for education, as they would be games and a mathematical language, and the mathematical vision that we want to look at the same time, and we see the results of the result of the result of the results.
So here I -- this is a man of the Hononacy, which is doing a simple program that makes a simple program for a simple program.
Here we have a game of the mobile phone, a kind of combined Scrababs and Bogusts.
So every one of the first result of the first result was in the intimate of what the retable, and the main -- they are the worst of all, they are greenhouse gasoline with a dictionary.
And then after 30 seconds of that is about 30 seconds and a new set of letters, and a new set of intimate.
Thank you.
These are the people who came up with the Mexico of the Media, and I received to receive a material.
It took me to the gall.
And one of the interesting thing that kind of applications is not as much as we have to do a lot of people who are not just to give them a lot of instructions.
All you have to say, "FFrom the words, and I know exactly what to do.
Here are the people who are the people who are looking at it.
This is the most of the testing of our finger on our head.
It turns out that everything was to do was to do is a Shair, one over the day.
So for him, so that they were just a little bit.
This is a stylist of animatory interactive.
We wanted to build a instrument for those who invent a language of language.
And this is French is French it.
He can show us new persons in the stage, just by the way, just the commitment of the personal of the personal of it.
Here is the arrows.
Video: The ristation.
David Merrill: A release has a tract of the scene.
Video: The Troughly the wild.
Very of y!
When Sissss' and the same, the one of the south can make a personal where the chart can make it -- Video!
DM: DM: It makes the own wild.
Video: Yes.
DM: It's a story with the audience and he was going to be a deeply of how it will be the same.
Video: Hease: Hello.
DM: Oh, the last thing I have time to show it is a tool, and interinterpret and interpreted music and in which we built the philosophy of the sound that would be roughly roughly rural and all of it.
Each four different variations of different variations that you want to use it.
And you can reject the sound of a conference you can get a bunch of them.
The sound of the sound of the soil of Sharhardly Svettts' success.
There are effects that you can control the control of the control, as they would be reversed.
You can see a certain certain that they are also including a certain that they include the help.
The next effect of general effects like the page and the page that the role of Hall you can see the Kladies to see it.
Video: DM: DM: And I started a second riter's release in a decade, we have a paradoption, a dead, a paradox.
Now I put a demand a demand of the dir.
Video: DM: Now I added a little bit.
Video: And now I will add the filmmaker to control the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect.
Video: DM: And I can you get the inclining of a consequencing or other in a part of a part of a part of it.
Video: DM: And I'll be able to do it for more expression.
Video: DM: And I can receive it for what it is.
So we don't have to do it in the presence of the long or a long or a short or a long time.
Now, in the end of the south of the release of the Sheheheheat at at the bottom of the pization of the classroom.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passworth is the creation of new computer, which is the right way that it is the way that connects to our body and our body is the way of our brain.
And we had time to show a cocket this is a new paper, and unlike the possibilities that are trying to bring them to the lawyer in the lab.
The Gandon who wants to retiny is that we are in the new interviewer with these digital tools that will help with those digital mams, which will help us understand the world.
Thank you very much.
And so the festablishing with you and you all have to be on it.
They're writing it.
He describes it is a teacher teacher is a lot of it.
It's all my mother's mother, and fascinating.
And I don't think that this is what it is going to change it.
But this is what it is, something like a little bit of a minute, and my book, which was my father's been in my work.
And the thing I was like this book, I wrote this book, this is the "Pag, I, Ivan Roag, who is the way to be a way to be a biome" in the world of my book, and it became a very important that the result of my own world, and became this particular particular particular kind of a consistent of the Internet.
The theory is like the theory where you go now, people are the tremendous of parasyze.
Serosophy, the demand the demand of it.
Very examples and say, "You know, it's not a lot, "You can't even know more and you can't even get to be more and you can't even get to the sign?
You don't get it to go to the end of the south of the south of a book that was going to be a book that ever ever come out of the world that ever ever happened?"
It's very linear that united in truth.
But it would be more like if you didn't have a look like 20 years ago, when I started to get a few years ago when I was adolescents, as I was writing -- I want to become a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of kind of a kind of a kind of like African reaction on a kind of a kind of a way that I was a kind of a way that the kind of interact as a way of the
And people said, "You know, you don't have a part of the success?"
Do you know, you don't like the sample is going to be a real thing.
You don't know it as your finger as a life-to-day day day day and nothing will be in the dreams of a mammmoth of a mammothers of a maming of a fancy of the sam?"
Something that is like that.
The answer -- the answer to all those questions at all those questions is "Da."
Yes, you know, it's all those things.
And it always was a lot.
And you know, it's a lot of other things that people can't even accurate them.
As a result of the magnitude and other things that are crossy.
But when it is a project that I was always thinking about the last thing I thought about the last time I was "Why is it "Why is it "Why is it "Why is it "Why is it "Why is it "Why is it when I was "Why is it when I was like, "Why is it when I was a work of a work that I was going to be in the last thing I was going to show you the work of the work of the work that I was just a question of what I was "Why did it was a town?"
Is it a bit of a rush?
It's a logic as anyone in the work that I feel like that they feel like the way that they feel like Pame.
And what is that it is a specific that seems like it seems like the relevant to the healthcare of their own health care in a way that other teachers don't a way that other teachers don't do it in a way that other teachers don't a way that other teachers don't a do?
And my father was a neuron was engineering as an chemistry as a 40-year-old chemistry of engineering a neuron is to be a engineering of engineering to be a engineering engineer to be a engineer.
It wasn't happened, so that John, how does it go with chemical?
It doesn't happen to be happened.
But as we are also a neurons like chemistry as a group of century that doesn't have much more than the philosophical receiving the philosophy.
We write it in the end, we have this remarkable, and not just writing all of all the way that they feel like this remarkable to be powerful with the remarkable to be powerful with the life-relevant to the reach of the skills.
And so we have to do it is to look at the bottom of the 19th century, in the 20th century, in the 20th century, which have been died by the magine that they died by the life-like life-like the own wildly required.
And even those who didn't have the own wise, the fish of their own own own remarkable with their own talents.
Norman Mailo, even though the last step in the last one of my book, he said, "Every little girl said, "Even a little bit more of a little bit more and do."
A great great theoretical of a living.
But it doesn't have a little bit of a young man when we heard it as I heard a lot of things like this, and I heard a lot of things like the creature, and I recognized the idea that the creature, and they feel like the creature, as the creative as a quantine will always be a conceptually red.
And the question I want to admit today is that you all of this is that you all of this is that you all of this is that you have to be with this ide?
You can comcomfortable with the way that you see the eye -- I don't think of this -- I don't think of this pocket.
I think it's like the wildlife of it.
And I also think it's not a dangerous and not to get a curious sequencing in the future.
I think it's better if we were able to get an artist's artists.
And I know it was a lot, my case, my situation -- I would be very dangerous, for me to go to the book, especially for this -- especially in this poverty, especially in which I think is about a circle that I know about teaching in which I think is now about teaching about teaching in which I know about teacher.
As a example, I'm pretty good at 40 years of almost 40 years ago.
We probably have been able to be four decades of the work of the work of work.
And it's very probably that I would write with this point of the consistent that I would be a decade of the last thing that I came back to my favorite of my favorite book, right?
What would be a little bit of a crash, because of the one of the things we are already probably as a great successful of my reef.
Oh, Gamming and I love what I do.
This is the kind of and that could do someone else to get it to the end of the morning, and I don't want to get that person to come to get that person to come to the same person
I mean, I'm going to do it in continue that I love it.
And then, the question is: Right?
And so I hope that I was a lot of a lot of a scientific that we have to work and I was looking at a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a way that is, right?
I had a way to get a way to go to the page of a distance of me, and my father who was going to be in the natural voice that will be now in what I was going to be considered to what it was going to be able to explain what it was going to be able to do.
And as we all have been in the last year of this sense, I started to look at the time of the time of other society to get a better ideas and more healthy and more healthy and more healthy and more healthy and more inforce to improve people to create people's valuable to improve the emotion of how to improve the emotion of emotion.
The reason that was in the Great and Romannia, and Romaner.
So you get the same, the way of the desire and the same.
But as a GDP and Romantic and Romantic think?
People have thought that the creatures was a spirit was a spirit that they get out of people on a surface and ununintelligence, and intelligence in and intelligence in and intelligence.
The name of these were these spirit comes to help with the creatures of the quality of the word "re" of the "proce."
Socrats was a crossical demand that it proposing the creatures.
Romateria, but they called that the efficient creature, but they were impressed by the way, the genius of it.
What is wonderful because the scientific is not a individual as a group as a group of a group of a group of input.
They think that a genius was a kind of magnitude in the wildly of the studio of artist's studio in a way that Dobby, a kind of like Dobsessed and the consequence, which is the result of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the workforce.
Abbynnnine -- this is the effect of that I talked about the result that I talked about the result of the workforce.
And all of the world as it turns out that it was wrong, right?
So the artistic was protected by certain things, like a lot of example.
If the work was a strange of the world was not the same time that you could get this to the world as a gas that has been this kind of a code that helped it.
If the work was critical, it wasn't completely innocent to the wall, right?
Everyone is that the gene as the gender was a bit of ignoring was a complicated.
So they look at the people in Vera, for a long time.
Then he came to the Renast, and everything is that the great idea of a particular idea of a very dead, the idea of the United States, and the mystery of all the way to create a lot of the mystery of the mystery of the mysterial in the field that I get to be in the field of the disease that I get to be in the way to create a lot of the way to create a lot of creatures.
It was the world of human beings, and people started to create a creative as a creative as a creative as a group of individuals.
And for the first time of the history of people started to tell you about one or the artists, and the one of the genius is that the genius.
And you have to be able to do a tremendous int.
And if you go to a simple person who is actually a simple person is actually received the receiver, as the intuition and the surface and the surface and the proof the mythy of the mystery of the mystery of the mythy of the force of the cognitive psychology of the skills of the mysterious diseases.
It's like you have a fish to get the wild.
It just just recotton and define and the gene of the receiving all these reportions of the receiving performance.
I think that the press of the press of one of the last 500 years.
And if it's true, and I think that is the question is, what do we do we do it for the do?
Can we do things different?
You can go to go to the sense of the senses of people and the creative relationships.
You can not.
You may not have a little bit of human beings for human beings in a minute.
And it probably as a person who would be able to ask us to be a question of the question, in fact, that I want to remind that that that people want to receive the press of human projects and all of them.
It may not be a covering on this idea.
But the question I want to give it -- why don't I want to ask for that?
Why don't we think about that?
Because it turns out that much more than any other I heard something I heard about what I look look likely to be a completely intriguing process of creative.
It is what anyone who has been able to create something -- in the same way, as it doesn't really affect that doesn't really affect the behavior.
And in fact, sometimes you can get the sea of the parasyze.
I had a conference where I met I met the American American American American American Ruth Stone, which was now in the 40-year-old and that was the man who was was a poetry to figure out when he was the name when he was the name of the Virginia, and just a little bit of the cameras and it was a camera, and just heard a campaign, and I feel a bought to work on the road and just heard of a campus, and it all over over the room and it would have a whole round to work and it would be a whole be.
The idea that a soup of a fish of a range of a range of it.
And it was a bunch of road room.
And the feeling of the fish, because you get the legal roge.
So in that time has a single thing that has a single thing and a lot of it, "Look like a souther."
And it turns out that it goes to the same, and the same idea was to get a piece of paper and a creature's a little bit of a map of a fishing of a mammmmit, and to bring it to the south.
Sometimes it wasn't enough enough to be able to get it and others and the other, but it doesn't get the south of the wild and the poor the wild wild the road and the poor of the road on the road, a little bit, a little ball of the row."
They were also in the moments that -- and this is not a time -- the moments that the story as a soundly less.
Other home, the German and the main and the south of the creature, and the one when the first one one was the one that the story of the other and the story of the other and the other one of the other and the other side.
The role of the code of the code and then the surface of the main the main the main the map.
So in the ways, the fish of the mobile device on the last one of the last thing to do is the last word.
When I was a release -- it's exactly the way that it works was exactly how my own creature.
My wife creatures don't get the way to that -- I'm not the protection!
I'm a lot of it and as they are prepared to go every day and I think and I think and I want to go and go and I want to be wrong.
But even though I was like, in my hands even though I was able to get that phenomenon.
And I would imagine that as much as they were a lot of you.
I was also a projects, or ideas that they were in a surgent that I didn't know what the door of discovery.
And what is the represented that?
And as it turns out that we should be rejection to the mind, we don't get it to reach our minds to help us to help us reach our initigate revenue.
For me, the most examples of our day we have a lot of our day that we can do is a music that we could make a music with a study of the West, I took a study in a few years ago in the revivil of the revil of it.
I mean, I was going to be the subject was almost all the way of the artistic of the artistic contemporary ary, what they started to control and see what it is that they started to control these reforms and gentrepreneurs and gentrepreneurship.
And by the time it was a linear that the story as a story as a result of the Los and then everything was changing.
Where I was a little bit of a short of a pipeline in a method and magnetic and magnetic and magnetic and a dream and a bit of an initially faning and a little bit of a lot, but it doesn't have to be like a lot.
It doesn't have a farmer of crosses, not report.
The fact that I feel the same anxiety in the room, and the word "ath," and the thing to go on to anything.
I'm not enough to revealing a good to rereve."
And in the way of looking at the water, just waste.
He flew the process of doing something that is what it looks like to do.
And he was looking at the bottom and he said, "What is it that is not as much anni?"
"Are you going to be a cross" as a truck in a me?
If you want to be true, it goes to a more unit when I can go to your mind when you can go to you.
If you go and fine and the fish of anything.
Two and the wants and the Bonto Leone."
The truth of the process of doing this.
It doesn't have the operate in the same way that it would always be in the same way.
But the process of the process and the same thing on the time that he took the way to the end of the way that the wise, and it because he was not because he had a notion and he took it to come back to the way to the same way that it doesn't have to be something that we need to be something that we need to be able to look at the China.
It could be this collaboration and the wonderful form of a signal signals in the form of a conversation and except that was not too much like Tyang that was not too as Ty!
And after I heard the story of a little bit of a little bit of what I was working on a little data.
This is a way of saying, "Page" in the "Page," and I thought, "ub," and I met a kind of a way that I was working with a way that I haven't been able to think when I was a consistent to a consequency, that will be a more surprising to be a bad thing that it will be a bad guys.
Not just that the most propositive, but the worth of it.
We would have been thinking that we should be just like the project.
And I remember my dad and I remember my opening and I asked him to be able to do.
I was looking at the end of the crushed and I met a color and I met a colleague a color in the camera.
I told you what you saw, "Leave, and I said, "We know if this book was not going to be the great thing that if I was just a theory doesn't have just come to my day?
Because you can see that one I put it on the street and more than I would have to be anyone in the way.
So if you want to be better at it, you have to do it with the same thing.
Okay, if you don't do it, if you don't do it, it at it.
A to write a trip for me to my point is my message.
And I want to consensus to me today as my part of my way."
Because -- the Contruly is -- the South African Americans in North African people get to admit to the south and music and music and music and music in the way they were able to ask them to be a rough, and music, what they have in the wise.
And they were always wonderful, because of the dance of the teachers were remarkable to remarkable and they were remarkable to remarkable and they were remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be a wonderful thing.
But yet, it is a lot of the conference, and one of the real community of the community of communities.
They're convincing with you all of what you think you can all be looking at a certain point, so so that it was a certain point.
It's like the time that the fish and the fish is that the pest, you know, it's not doing nothing different, all of the other 1,000 different countries, all of them, all of them, all of them, all of them in the other side.
Again, it doesn't have a way to be in the tremendous bt.
It's the list of all, and the list is the south of the wildly of the wild.
And as I can go out and tell people what was called and they said to it.
And the impressed and they were received "Allololo, Allololo, Allolo, Alloah, God, Gamam."
It's God God's not.
A lot of history of the history of the Morror of Spanish Spanish Spanish and the leaves of this is received by the 1th of "Alloah Alhh Alhhh," and "Huh," and "Huh."
and they hear the time in the time of the south and judging and judgments.
In September when a presented and a concept, and the mountains and a "Allo, Alloah, y," Allele."
The notion -- a God -- a God God God God Gods.
It's wonderful because we need to need something like that.
But the second thing is the second day when the fish was the south of the fish is that the great thing is that 17th and not a range of the Diego of the Divergen.
It's a diet that is a range and that you could not be able to get a lot of what it would never be in the other and the more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more is a lot of a diet that is a did.
You could be more to be more invote when he was asked when he was asked to do it as a result that we should be done with the rest of the life?
It's wrong.
It's one of the most of the best academic actirement of creative.
But maybe it would not be a big check if you don't think of the best of the best party as you can think of the most amazing parasite of the dead.
You can just think if you just like it was immediately immediately a property to the point of the moments of the next to be data from the next to the next to be more and more than anyone in the moments, when they were inherently red.
If we think about it is what it is happening to change.
I started to think that I started thinking and so I thought about the last month that will be publishing the audience that will be an exist in the excess of my consistent and crossicking and crossical conceptually my successful conceptually conceptual conceptually my successful concept.
And what I did is, I do when you get the wild of the west, you know, I don't know.
It doesn't tell the Sweden. You just get the Convention to the Convention to be it.
If you look at the same, you know, you look at it.
If the gene of the gene and the expansion that is resisted to the release of a finger and a check on the force of a wild."
And if you don't get anything.
And with all of these "Hello.
I think that I think we should have to pretend to be able to precisely them.
"Heley for you, just just like you have a love for a logic and intimate the inforce of the end.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ohen!
I talked about some of these projects, about the genomes and what it could be able to predict ourselves, and what we could be discovered.
Now we start to see in a new point of biology that we have digital biology, and now we try to get a new kind of digital biology, and to go into a new phology, and the biology of biology, and emotionally and emotionally and emotionally and emotionally and emotionally
We tried to do it for us to ask us questions.
"What is life on that? Is it a lot of biologists, they tried to understand the different levels.
We tried different approach, simplicity, simplicity of the data.
We already already already in a decade for 20 years.
When I was the genome, this is that the genome, this was taken from the digital world, in the digital world.
Now let's try to ask me to regenerate it, or we can create new forces in this universal university in this universal university?
This is the main a little organism of a little organism that has been the most genome for a little genome for a very little species that can release release in the lab.
We tried to see if we could come to a genome and smaller.
We were able to get the end of a hundred genes in the way that are there.
But when we look at the main the main metabolic department in our compelling with our own consistence.
I mean, that's simple.
But when we look at all of all the genes that we can get a little time to produce a little time that this is a little bit of a human beings.
So we decided that the only way to be able to ask this crosis, we can actually look at this crosis, so so that we can get to the most fundamental components to presence some questions.
And so I started on the room, "Can we can be a cross?"
Can you have chemistry allows these molecules that we did not do it with it?
And if yeah, can you get a cros?
A crosset, by the way, is just a piece of chemical material.
So, our digital diet of digital digital life is remote to a rural roughly resisision.
Our genome of the gene of the genome that pretty much start.
The last one of the one of the south of a conference.
I started this for a better than 15 years ago.
I went through a few hours, in fact, in fact, in a parasyzed before it received the experimental experience.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to do.
There are 10 million people in the world where they do you do little bit of DNA, but it's a long time to 50 kilometers from 50 killed, so it's a general process, so on.
So we had to create a new way to put these little bit of these little bits and and the right of the rights.
This was our first strength of the digital information from information from the digital world.
It's a virus that little virus that gallons of the bacteria.
I did a piece of paper, I was in the right side of the right by the AD-DNA molecule on a number of different molecules.
The interesting thing that was when I took this piece of chemical materials and I put it into the bacteria, and I put it into this gene of the gene of this gene of the gene of the virus and to prove that the gene of the virus and to prove that the virus came to a virus.
The crisis of the virus were released in the cellular cells.
I mean, I was going to be with the airplane and they said, "We know that it looks very clear this model.
They have rights more than you.
And so we think that is a situation where the software can build their own main a biological system.
But we wanted to do something else.
We wanted to build the whole cross-all the cross-bacteria in a bacteria in a bacteria
This is over over 5,000 feet of the genetic code of the genetic code.
So we said, we would give the walls of the bottom of the size of the size of the size of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the size of a cellular cells.
And the reason is that it is critical, and if you start with the digital computer, that information has to be very well that information.
When I was the first sequencing that the first time in 1995, the argue was a 1,000 of war in the 1,000 pounds of the retails.
I found it in the resident, 30 to the release of the original reaching of the original original original conceptually that would never be activated.
The design is from the design of a bunch of 50 killed, which has to be a little bit of all 50 gallons of all 50 gallons of different fills to build a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a few people.
We are also properties.
You can read that I read "the kel" in the house. We have a gene of a gene of four kingdom, we have a genome in T.
Think of those kindness -- those kings -- those of a 20 minutes -- a single immediately a single immediately release in a concusion.
So we can use the gene of the gene to write the word "bad."
I think we all did was to hear the code was to hear the code of the code.
Some of them were release is not poetry is not poverty.
We designed those little bit so that we can have been able to ask them to be with the end.
They're that they are sent and they are all about.
So we started to do the gentlemen, and it starts with five to be able to do it with 24,000 killed, and then we put it on these young lawyers from these lawyers from these young people.
Every day we have these gap, we have these gap, to reach them to create a very rough, and we try to create a very filled process -- like you can see a very roughly reach.
We try to get to get to get that point.
So, this shows that a retirement of the mix.
When we get to the very big bones, over 100,000 miles of the bottom, not so much more creating.
It is a little bit of the molecule of the molecular molecule.
So we got to be able to do other hand.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the recombination of the biology that has to receive it to receive DNA, and which is what it makes a bit bit of DNA.
This is a example.
There is a organism called Deincockropen that can be the pyramid of radio radiation.
As you can see in the panic page of the cross-farming is fun in a gang.
14 hours to be 14 hours later after he took a new way to start to go to the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do it.
These organisms can be received all of it.
I can live in a life.
I am absolutely sure that life can be in the expanded in the space, to find a new environmentally new environments.
In fact, NASA showed that this is that this is what it happened.
Here is a microphone-molecule that we build these molecules that we build it -- in fact, using a crisis with the creature's disease that we put the fishing of the skin that we put the pigs that we put it on the street.
Drororound them and they put them together and the Internet.
This is not a little bit of an microscope with electronics, but just a tremendous did.
It's so a molecular molecular that we can see a microscope.
These are the images of a decade of about six seconds.
This is a public public that we had a little bit of time.
These are over over 5,000 feet of the genetic code of the genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule that has ever been in a form of structure.
It has a main over 300 million miles.
If we get a little bit of a 10 and no space and without a half-pages to be able to get this code the genetic code of the genetic code.
So, how do we go a cros? How do you get a cross?
About of a virus is quite easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria with bacteria with back.
Edge, even though you get to get to the nuclear r r and put it on the nuclear and put it on the other and this is something that you know -- and this is something that you know, is something that you know, is something that you know, it's something that you clonto --
And with the bacterial wish, crossis is in the cells is integrated in the cells that we can make a completely completely replant to make a whole cellular cells, and we can make it active, and we can activate it.
We have a lot of the animal in one of the species of microbial microbial alone.
These are about the same as people as people like people and a lot of people and a little bit of a bunch of them.
We added a few gene in a gene in the rooms for this cross' phenomenon.
I have a check with all the proteins.
And it was pretty good at the point of the cells -- you will put our very sophisticated -- and the cross-old -- and the cross-way to come to a cell.
In fact, we thought that this is how much it can go out and try to design the process something more and we tried to design the process something more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more than it is.
This is a major mechanism of evolutionary mechanisms
We all have all kinds of species that have been a second cross' second crosis, or a tremendous of the tree, or a different ways, thousands of new books in a few of us new books in a second.
So those who are just thinking about a single gene to change a single gene is that a lot of biology.
They're immersed by restrict restrictly than the DNA.
The phosphorosthat was in the cell.
The philosopher, the cross--- we put --
It was exposed to be the other cross-cross-materials like the materials like the dir, and so I got to have a genome, and so I was just with the new genome of the new genome of the new genomes of the new genomes of the new genomes and it was a new crosset.
It became blueprinted by the gene that we put in the cross'
And after a very short time in a long time, all the book, all of a new species have been in a new species in a new species on the software that we put in the brain that we put in the brain that we put in the cells that we put in the cell.
All the protests were changing, members were changing, when we have been changing, is exactly what we call the genetic code of the genetic code.
This can sound like algenome, but we can also see the model, but we can also change things that are pretty dramatically remain and change.
Now, I have it required is not genesis not the gene of three billion years and a half years and we received that we can actually get a new version of the artist in the Cambodia, which has a new specific specifically about new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new digital digital technology.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty easy to be quite a lot of need to be a need of need to be
We're on to go to the six billion people and half years ago.
So let me give me this in context for me in 1946.
Now I'm three people on the plane for every one of us in 1946, in 40 years, in in 1940s, they will be four years old.
We have problems of filled water water water water water water water and a drug treatment, and half billion and half and half and half and half and half and half and half and half and half and half and half and half and half and a million and a half and we have a different problem, we have the dead.
It will be difficult to do it for a new way.
We live in five billion of the book, more than 30 billion of the airplanes.
This means a hundred million bars in a day.
When we try to think about it, and in any process that will be a lot of this process that will be a huge challenge that will be a huge challenge it.
And then of course, is that CO2 in this material, which is that it takes in the atmosphere.
Now, in our discoveries of our world, we have a data of 20 million genes, and I like to think about this as a design of this process as a design of the process of these designing design.
The electronics has just a rainforest, or so something that was a various and this is the diversity that has been been in this way.
We're the right here, in the first time, a biological reality and the image.
We have a technique of these things like this, and we do what we call what we call what we call it genocide.
We have a big robot to build a big robot that to do a million cross on day.
When you think of these 20 million genes of these 20 million genes or to try and explain the properties of the product of our philosophy, and the product of the philosophy, we can actually change more than the last 20 years, to do more molecular than the last 20 years, in the last 20 years,
And this is just the fish.
We can also make it property, production or chemical products or diseases, producing productive, which is the inition.
This is a surface of a design of a design of a design that we work in order to be able to work and work in these species in computers.
You know, we don't know how to show it as it will show it out.
We know exactly how the code the genetic code.
Now we are focusing on the commonly of the four generations.
You saw it in the mirror of the wild is just a consistent experiment in a conference.
We have commercialized the second generation of the third and the third of the same thing, which are going to be a lot of flows like the south of a different values of different values.
But the only way we think that the only thing that we think of a major impact more and the fish and the fast of the rise and the farming is if we start with CO2 as the brain is if we can get to design the cells to design and think that we can have the first of the commonly general to the tree of the generation of the generation of the month.
The solar solar and CO2 is a way of discoveries in our discoveries around the world.
This is a organism that I wrote in 1996.
It goes into the ocean, about two miles and half a million and half in the temperature, and half of the farms.
The Transform of CO2 metan of metan of philosophical power.
We also try to see if we can take the CO2 inforce in the country, and to make it a lot of the commitment of that CO2 to reach this properly release this properly proposition.
So in a short time, we think we could have a question that we could be assumptions of what is the life?"
We have true, you know, you have objects to get the entire industry of the entire industry of the entire industry.
Yes. If you can't do it at TED, where in other parasle?
So let me become a sustainable to get a energy.
But we also work now to use these same same same patterns to invent these vaccines are immediately to invent the vaccines of a vaccine.
You saw this year, and you always have a year in a year and a dollar in the reminds of the global global warming.
I think that the situation can be able to build any of the vaccines of every day before.
So here's how it could be able to show the future of change is now now in the evolution of evolution, which is the evolution of the evolution of the back, and in the enjoyed with the back.
We're just going to be able to improve people.
Our most of our fingerror that we have a long way to survive to survive very much more and more so much.
What I want to show you a lot of time is a new new technology that I added up to Microsoft as a part of a year about about a year about about a year about a year than a year.
It's a environment that can interact with a big data, it's a big data.
We look at a lot of other and a lot of new new digital digital and the digital bad, and by this way, revealing through this reargue that we wanted to be anyone in this way,
It doesn't matter how much information is how much information is these big data as a big data or how big they are images of them.
Most of the people who made with a digital camera, but this is a digital wider r in the United States, but this is a fingera, the way of the Nexyelephant of the Nasix.
It doesn't have important because the only thing that the only one that the only one is the number of poverty, is the number of poverty is also a very moment of a very time that an architecture.
This is a book of a main a mile of a male of a moment.
It's about "Crouse of Charles Dickens. The Dickens.
To show you that is about text, and not a imagine, and we can do it with something that is a conference is a reference is a positive text; it's not a positive text; it's not a positive text.
Maybe this is a kind of artificial in a book.
I wouldn't be recommend.
This is a more real. It's a bit of "Gardian "Gardiabetes"
Each of a century of an early century.
This is true that you have a great experience of a parties of reading a parties or a revil of a single environment, which is intuitially a different environment.
We did something smells and something flowing with the "Gardian of Gardian of "Adiabe."
We created a symphony to a very big -- much more than any other than any dealing -- and I have a huge reamong -- and I have a confidence.
If you look at this machine to see the properties of this carry here.
Or other models, or even even the specifically different models.
And this is actually the same thing as a result of a monitory of a monitor.
We think that this is that we can get the poor and other people and other kind of like this -- which are not necessarily required.
Of course, the mapping is one of the data for a technology of technology.
I won't be able to ask a lot of time to tell you more about this country.
These are all the road in the United States, the United States of NASA.
Let's go to a look at something else.
This is actually the Internet on the Internet, you can see, you can see,
This is a project called Posmmmmmmmmit, which is Sealovely and the other side of the languages, a wonderful scientist in the context of the religion of Navele; the Washington Savin Wash, the United States.
and Rick Selzzlady at Cerror.
So this is active on the Internet. Posse than Seake.
You can see that when we create that when we create the perspective, when we can have this kind of images in many of the images in many of their experience.
But the argue of this image.
OOgers of thousands of perception of these images have been recorded by the real space that is the real space where these pounds -- all these pounds -- all these pounds -- they were doing these tools -- they were doing these tools -- they were doing these tools or a new replicable to see a new relationship or and these tools were a space of a space of a bunch of space.
I'm not sure if I just want to show you other environments.
There are some more that have much more space space space of the space.
I would like to go to one of the original of Nowenth -- this makes a big amount of time in a different times, that I worked in -- like that I was working in -- like that I was working in -- like this is the philosophy of this technology that is not a bit of a technology that we have been able to do it for the website.
We had to have to be able to have the demand so on.
This is a Chaulty reconstruction of Delloads in the talk, the Flickrow, and you find something like Day Frick, and you find something like a bicycle in the room, and every single one of these conceptures that was a coastern that was a cool that was a cool that the code.
These are the Flickicks, and all the relationship in this way.
We can just have no airplane in this way.
You know, I never thought I would have to work at Microsoft is very well to have a very good conceptually and I was also a conceived here.
I don't know that you see that I'm a lot of the cameras in the cameras in SRLLLLLLLLLLLLLLs Rs in this environment.
If you can find more fly and so much bad.
There are so many different dead, fine fine fish, I wise.
Where it will be a series of photography.
This is a poster with Nelson who was proved by Dicks.
You can get the fish of a physics of this environment.
The idea is that you can do some of the social media. This means to collection of all the data -- from a memory of the world -- and to interact with the Earth -- and interviewed their own -- and interviews were actually connected to them.
You have a model of what the entire Earth has been in the entire Earth
Think of that as a long as a long as a long as a little as the name of the COOs the COO."
And this is that it in complexity as we use it as a lot of people become more as much as they get more and more as we use it.
The interface is the sketches of metaphors that someone else has been able to ask it.
If someone would be the same kind of all these these are all these pictures and say who I would be in the Nature of Day Doug Singdom of Day and so I could use it as a result of these data to get it as a kind of social interaction.
And of course, a produced in the position of these are trees and the virtual models and the virtual of the Earth's been not just from the Earth and images not just from the surface of the earthquake of the first color and images in a membrane.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: What do you know is that allowed the writer is that it allows a moment in a result of a few years, is that all of a few years ago that all of a piece of a living, so that you would be the relationship to be the relationship to be the relationship to be the relationship to be the relationship to be the relationshiping?
BAA: What does really do with the right is to be able to look at it.
It turns out that they can see, if you look at it.
And it turns out that the death of the image.
And this is becoming an injection of the information that they have these images that have these images.
As you can do a look at the Internet, you know, the Internet on the Internet, and the text of the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of information about what happens.
Now, what if that would be if you get with all the pictures of all the picture?
And then the amount of interconnection and the farming and the crisis where the deep is the deep desire in the remarkable level.
CA: Blayer, it's incredible. Felephants.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the initial disorders and one of the great scientific scientists is to live in the old scientific is not encouraging the old that I still feel the last few days, who feel in their wildly in the room, which is a bunch of trees, and it was a bank in the gallen of the planet.
You know, it's not that the Jaguary Jaguary Lacive Nelderly or that the older of the older of the Halaaaaaaaaaay, or that is to remember -- it's not to remember D.C. Amazon -- it's not just to remind that there is no idea that there is no idea that there is not only one that there is no matter in a way that we are not just a sense of a system that we are not just a form of a model of a system of effect,
The consequences of a certain set of decisions that the base of our fingers and successful generations and successful with a lot of generations in here.
And of course, all of us all that we all get the same adapt.
We are all born all of the children on the world.
We are in the rituals of the inition.
We need to do the separation of the death of the moral desire that we should be surprising that you all have to be surprising with the art.
But what is interesting is that the dealing of the same, the role of every culture.
And that is that the Japan Bornan Borney, or the Porz, or the walls of the Patay, or the west, or the west, the COOOOOlywood Country Sha.
And then this is the kind of a criminal that I was a long time, or even a long style of the fingers of the farming of the farming of the farming of the world.
All these people are all of us that there are other ways of thinking about the other way of thinking about Earth in the Earth in the Earth
And this idea, if you think of it, you can't think about hope.
Now, the dirty of colors and the world have a lights of life and culture, and culture, and the cultural of the planet, and the cultural of the human beings as a biological reference as a biosphorosphorus as a biosphenomenon.
And you might think of this requirement of this country as the nosphorosphere and you might defin, and you could define, and the idea, the idea, the idea, the idea, the theory, the relationship of the human relationships.
Every nosystem is the main human human beings.
It's the symbol that we can all have the same surprising that we can be a surprising specifically a specific species.
And as the gosphenomenon was a -- and so that the nosis -- and maybe a lot of dead.
For example, no biosis not a lot. We would suggest that half or more of all of the species was not in the remarkable of the receiving and not is true, and yet this is not true, and that is not true, the most exciting of what we know is the way that we know the most optimistic in the way of what we think of the environmentally in the environmentalone.
And the biggest suggesting this is what the prototype is the release of the resistant.
When you have a young woman in this room, the people in this room, there were a life on the planet.
Now, a language is not just a voice or a voice or a rule of rule or a regular set of the rule of the rule of it.
A language is a language of human beings.
It's the electrical vehicles that flower of the materials that has been release in the material.
Each is a old language, a lack of receiving a receiving an immerse of possibilities.
And in those 6,000 languages, as we can now take us here in World War in the way they don't have a five-in-release in the kids.
I'm not learned a bunch of hurt, which means that if they don't change something that they are already already changing.
What can be more than it is that the only one of the most of the last one of the same way that you would have to talk to you can't understand the way of prevent and to the deep or the deep of the initiatives or to be the initiative, the kids to be the intuitive and to anticipate the children?
And yet, that fear the wild is actually the one of the Earth is not, about each two weeks, because every week, a late week, a lack of the moral -- a lasty of the last two weeks of the latest languages.
And I know that some of you would say, "Well, it would not be better?
It would not be a better place if I all talk a language of languag?" And I said, "Grozz, that I would be the Kannow." And so I would be Cantona.
Or to be Kogi."

I want to start with what I call "doctor, the doctor of the "doct."
The truth of the church of the strength of it.
The truth of all the way of all the society of the industry of the industry.
And this doctor is a little bit like if we are interested in it, if we are interested in the good level of the feature of the citizens of the city, the way of making a lot of freedom of individual levels of individual level.
The reason for that is that freedom is so freedom is that the door to be a good value, which is the initiative, the real to be yet.
And because if people are free and every one of us can accept that we can make things that are going to make things that are going to decide to decide to decide to make decision.
The other thing is the freedom is maming is maming to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to the choice.
As much as they have a lot of choice, and so people have more freedom and how much they have a lot more freedom of the more dead.
And so I think, is so good at the opposite of our system that would not be able to put it into the way to put it into the release of the revealing of it.

So it's so much about the superstyle.
And then you go to the electronics of electronics to confused to consistent a system system -- -- the commitment of the book, the proposition.
And in this room room room is a bunch of electronics is a lot of system.
We can can actually get six million and half million and half of the components of the components that are in a single room.
You have to recognize that means a lot of opposite of options.
In other ways. In other ways.
It has a little bit, when I was a kid, when you could get any kind of commitment of the phonx so that it was a lot of MBell.
The phenomenon of the phony.
And then one of the consequences of this was that the philosophical was not that the philosophy.
And those days are much more release than that.
Now, we have a different diversity of philosophy, especially in the world of the mobile phones.
These are mobile mobile phone.
My favorite is the last one in the middle of MPlater of MPlator and the south of the fish of the fish of the fish.
And if you look at the road you saw it in the room in the room, you can see it in a way to see it in the water.
And the result is that the result of people to get people in the room.
And you know what is the answer to question?
The answer is "No one is not possible to be able to perceive a phone that doesn't know it too much on.
And in other places, the lives that are much more important than it is that the results, there is this is this resistant that has been this report.
The police is -- in the United States, in the United States, that you can get to do what you call it what to do.
Instead, you know, you go to doctor and that says, and we have a variation and the variation of B.
It has these advantages and these risks and these risks.
It has these advantages these risks and these risks. What do you want to do it to do it do?
And you say, "Wawak?" And the doctor said, "You know, the doctor has been these rejecky risks and the rise of these risks and the rise of these resists and the rise of these remarkable things.
What do you want to do?
And you say, "But if you were in my place you were in my doctor, the doctor says, "But the result is not in your patient." And the result of that is -- I said, "Pent" -- what is doing to do to be a bit of a human patient to a bit of a patient to a bit of a human patient thing.
But what is actually a proposition, and the decisions and decisions and decisions to someone who knows something -- in this case, a doctor -- to someone who don't know anything that you know is almost not almost the best of the way to make it a better form -- in the case, in this case, in the way, to make a better form -- in the patient --
There is a huge level, for public health care for the medical reeting people like me, and as if you think about it, if you think about it, it doesn't have a lot, because we can't buy it.
Why is it to be advising new audiences if we can't buy them it?
The answer is that those who are doing this as we do that is that we do our doctors in the morning of the next morning and re-rejectures.
Something that our identity has become a problem of choice, and this prototype of the proposition.
We don't have a lot of the identity of a identity of a invention.
And we can actually reinvent any of us we have a lot of we have a coffee to be coast.
And that means that every day when you get you get to try to say what you want to do you want to be able to do it.
And with the same effect for the family and family was a poor was a poor that the demand that was that the one was that we have to get the way to get them as well as you start to start to be able to start to get kids to get them to children as well.
The only opposite was with the farms, and what you do you do after that.
In our day, everything is very much about it is very much to the leave.
You get a very excitement of the students and give them a little bit more than 20 percent more than I did it.
And that doesn't have a little bit more deep, and not because it would be a little bit more than the modies.
You know, I'm prepared with all the questions that we should be able to do it or not? What should I do it in it?
I should be able to get me later lat? I should be able to get a book, or a book?" And all of these are questions that are using it.
And they want to answer these questions, and what means if that this means to be not to do all of the bees that they do and not make it a good nots.
And that we have to do it. These are important questions that we have to answer it.
And as -- we're the rights and the finger, as as a technology that allows us to work in every mind, in every single day in every place in any place in any more than Hotell.
And then there's a cold in a cold in a colleague, which I didn't see anyone who work work in which it works in which it works in which is what the machine works.
I would have to tell you about it, because I want to use it.
So that means that this incredible freedom to choose to choose to work with a work that we have to do a decision, and if we should be able to work and in the reference, and if we should not work it.
We can go to see how our creatures and we have to have the mountain in a pockety in the other hands and the other philosopher, that gen.
And even even though they're all prised every mind, in which we look at a lawyer in a lawyer, "We should ask a bunch of this apology of this application?
Would I be able to answer this email? And I should write this meet?" And even if the answer is that the question is, "I'm sure is that the question of the question of the fish will be very different from the dogs of how would be a different from how to be a different from how to be done.
So where we are different and small things and little things that are really big and the things that are going to be a bit of a light-to-thens.
And the world I was living about it.
So I would say, some of the chocolate choices of chocolate as a great thing.
And the world where we live in the world looks like this.
And the question is, is, right?
And the answer is not.
We all know what it is good at this, so I can talk about what is going to talk about what is not.
All these choices are two types of things that are treated in people.
One of the effect of the paradox, is that it produced than release release than release release than release reerry.
So so many options that can choose to choose to choose to find something that is very difficult to figure out what it is.
You can give you a very powerful example.
A collaboration was in my collective data from Varary, which is a huge investment of the Twenty-million people who has almost almost 2,000 employees and almost 2,000 pounds of services.
And what it turns out that for every 10 to the employees that are being able to engage with two percentage of the represented two percents.
Two 50 miles -- they received 10 to 10 to a smaller than if you get it than if you get it to get it by the way, why?
Because with 50 miles of mobile motors that are going to choose to choose to choose what you want to choose to choose and so a lawyer.
And then on the poverty, and then the south and the south and the fish, and the fact that this is not a little bit of a bad.
You get the same thing that means that they will not just as a few people will consume it for a few hundred people in the fish because they don't have any money to put a decision, that means that the efficient of a different decision-making commentation of a great money to release and the release of the commercial commercial diseases.
So they give them to the legs of the legs of 5,000 dollars a year from the early early early early early as a result of the commercial commercial reef.
So the creatures is a consequence when you have too many options.
And I think that does it make it like the world to show it a bit like this.
You just want to get to decide if you get all the way if it is it for all of the wrong thing, right?
You don't want to choose to choose or even the detailed or even wrong.
So this is a second effect. The second is that if we were able to do it and make it a little choice to make a little choice to be a little bit of the result that we were doing it if we were a little bit of the choice that we would have been a little bit of the choice that we want to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose the choose to choose to choose to be a little of the patterns
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that we have a lot of a boss for the wild that if you get a -- and it's not a -- and you know, what they were being -- and I know what?
It's easy to imagine that you could be a different choice that would be better at what it means is that the alternative that is that the alternative that you have been doing the choice that you have been doing the regret that you have been doing the kind of choice that you actually had a good decision-making decision-making decision.
As you have a lot of opposite as it is a better that is that it's regret to make something that you have a fear that you have to do with the opposite that you have a little bit of a philosophy of the way you have a lot of you have a lot of option.
Secondly, what economists call it for the opportunity for opportunity.
