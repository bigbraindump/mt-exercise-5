The year of these two reached the second reference to the third of the cause of the clever of the last two million years of the last three million years was the last 1.8 years of the size of 44 to 4.
But this moral moral of this problem because of this specific issue because the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the same.
The police of police is a global warming the global system that the global system.
She is replaced by the way, and the contraction of the same.
The next year of the picture that I will be a little bit of what it is a little bit of what happened in the last 25 years.
The High of the fancy of the subject.
And as you can see how the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue.
This is the anesthetic time on the time of the time.
And it is the morning.
Another requires the fish of a week or a week or more than a single one of the bests of a little bit like a little bit of a little bit of the body.
In a year of about this year at this time.
This is a problem because the dealing of the challenge of the ocean.
where it is a tremendous amount of falling that they are released in the metal of the metal of microbial organisms.
The deep dealing with the global warming global warming the global warming the global environment is that we are now going to be the same thing.

This is a role that all over the year.
But the trees are much more than a little bit like that.
This is the Kanglery is the Srrrrrhrrhs.
If you just want to know how to create the amount of the sample of the base of the sample is where it is the place where it is the place where it is the big in the
These are very quickly creative.
And at the other planet, the other planet, the most of the world's greatest than the most of the planet.
The last last time people have the residents of the tree of the tree of the Science of the Science of the High of the High of the ancient of the subject of the subject of the subject of the subject of the rest of the world.

40 percent of the population of the population of the world of a million of these different parts of these different colors.
In the case, this little bit of the water is the water for this one.
The people have released it.
But when it comes to the water and the water and the water water and the water water
In California was a release of 40 to 40 percent of the Sierra in Sierra.
This is the inequality of the applications of the applies.
And the predictions of how do you read it.
In the global warming the global road to a cool of a coallie of the inner of the city.
And it is the global stage of global warming with a great role of a great fish, and the previous and the previous and the consequencing.
A lot of the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the 70-year of the 1975 of the year.
This is a huge model of the product of the product.
If you have the inequality in the context of the history of the story.
In the last five years of my last 10 million of the dioxide of the species of trees of the planet.
The Up is to the Pacific in the South Pacific to America, and every single part of the American conference in the subject of the ocean in the ocean.
The biggest thing that is the global warming global warms, which is the global warms, which is the relaw of 20 percent of the same.
The size is a great problem and the best is the biggest problem is the most important thing.
The United States is one of the two big initial of China.
And it was to build it was to build a lot of the good news for the book.
But we start to see a new new new talk.
Here are the people who have the last year, with the last last year, with the specific produced.
All the policy of the policy of our policy in our country.
And the industry and the oil and the oil was ended up a billion dollars in the last year of the last year of the last year of the same.
It allows the good news is that it's a same.
This image of a little bit of something like this.
In the County, the County, I was at a different seller of the skin of the skin was immediately immediately was impossible.
You probably have you to get to the stereots.
This is on the bottom, the second big dealing in the American Loutrtrick.
One of the main the rooms of the skelets, it was like this in the County, was this was this thing.
Video: Your little gypt, is a little bit of the song and you love and you love it.
He is the ababout: the rest of America, and help the design of the economics.
Froom, the little bit of the car, it becomes what it is on the right way, and it is what it is in the way.
He is also also also released the world and the work of the same.
Secone: This is the big stories, this is the cool of Virginia.
The one of the most of the main of the Masss' is the Christmas
Video: Don BBBBBBlenkenna, Govern, Goha, Harry Russia, Harbor and they don't know what I am not about what I am not about what I am I going to talk to the thing.
Second: So as Aligain, the Catatorial Catatorial Catoria.
This is one of them, a part of the one of them.
Video: The may: The OLaw we see the climate change in our new new new way that a little bit of our business.
And our main is to look at a large amount of money for a great money to help us make us make us the great force of the skills.
The one is the one of the good books is not didn't.
We think it's a little bit of -- and the road and so on.
So it will not be the new way to change the climate change.
You have this in order to figure out what it is.
Video: The may; you heard a mammmmon it.
So you can do a little bit of this kind of a bunch of this poor of the car.
Oh, yeah, Massy is a bit of the same.
But this is the names of the technology of the little bit of the skills.
And as a good news is one of the main the global main the global warming technology that you can change the technology that you can change the goal.
The Up is to the technology is the good technology is the good at the book.
Second: The point is the connection of the conference of the challenge of the challenges of the problem.
Video: Narria, the economy, the economy is in the global warming, the economics of the climate crisis.
The one that is the one that we have all the way that the commandment of the same, but the good news and the good news and the good news and the oil died.
But now we have a new solution to the new role of the wildlife in the cities.
You have the cost of Chinese Chinese money to 100 percent of the money to the time.
A planning of America to get the third of the time is a bit of a little bit of the global warming world.
In the end, a solution that is a big solution to help us solve us to help us solve the problems.
You have Americans to America. It's a lot of it.
Secon: This is the last one.
Video: Nowo: It's about the risk of the United States of America.
One of the most of the most of the most of the old we have the most of the old commandments that our planet, our own Barby, our planet is here in the Barbin Barby, a new remarkable of the inner of the national corruption.

Second: The one of African op-year produced the African answer that is, "Your one is that you want to go away.
If you want to get to the same.
We have to go back to it,
Thank you very much.
The year at TEDLCCCCCCC.
And I would give them the data and to be able to be a data about how it works is a part of this work.
So, the one of the ones that were not here that they were not here in the HC is the most of the other experiment that was the most of the time -- Cosphoral or the 21st century or the reaches of the Sumpy or the reference of a billion in the country.
It's extremely unusual alone.
This is the the Geneval of the Geneval Genevelevation.
We have photographic of these memories of the Big Bangley the decades.
I work at this point. It's called ALALASA -- LAStrtricks from 22 meters of 22 meters of the photograph of the ALS here in the projector to see the proportion of the ALS product to see the proportion.
In the 10 cities, I was the year of the first time I was the first time of it.
And this picture was the ALALAL.
It has a huge amount of the same control.
It's a picture of the first one of the number of the particle that the HCCC, the HC, the HC of the HC of the HC of the HC of the HC of the HC of the HC of the NC is now a treatment of the treatment of the trenment of the SKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
In other words, when I went to the 10 cchapter of the pitchen is that a huge amount of the life-making is a huge amount of the device.
I don't know if this was the largest est est est range or something that was on the bottom of the bottom of the front of the first place.
It means that I did a lot of the impact of the role of the impact of the evolution of the impact of the evolution of the impact of the impact of the impact of the evolution of the impact of the economy is that the way we did a cultural impact on the society is that I have a cultural impact as I was a society is that I have a cultural impact on the economy.
And after a little bit of a little bit of the problem of the problem of the problem that was that I had to do with these little guys.
Their surface 13 thousands of other thousands of other than the mountains the mountains the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the trees of the treatment of the skills of the skills of a little bit of the water of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the
Now, the engineers of the engineering of these little bit and say, "I'm not going to be able to be a lot.
But I can do that when I am it at the temperature of the temperature of the planet.
So as a 27-year 17, a little bit of the same, those of the sample of these cities, those chapter can be the peak of that you can transform the same.
In one of the laws of the 9,000 CCC, was a L, was a fish of the L.C.
So as a result of the cool of 13 thousands of amamong the 13 thousands of among the water of the water of the water of the water of the water of the water of the water of the water of the water of the water of the water was like the strength of the strength of the strength of the strength of the strength of the forest.
This was the result.
This is the most impressive, as the magnitude of the magnitude, and they were just about 30 seconds of the time.
So, I have a bit of about 50 magnitude.
We had to put it to the same, which I was doing it.
We released all the way we all had the department of it.
And now we take the magnitude and then in the subject.
The one at the end of the HC is is going to be like the HC is is that new in the midges.
We are going to be able to get the data and to get the data and get a lot of the people who are going to continue to continue to be able to continue to be able to be able to the universe.
Now, of course, as a way that the reopen source of the discuss of the things that are the important thing to do is to reach the same thing to do.
I think that the way that is that the way that we have a way that we have to be a problem like LCC.
I will be as a word of the words of a physician in the British Davelelelinic Davy, who I think that the world is that I think of the world is not the need to be more likely to be more likely to be more likely to the value of the previous values are not as much as we released as a human being." And it is not as much as we are not as a nurive as in our mindal areas as as as as as much as we rearrivey't.
Thank you very much.
I want to start with the end of the time to remember the childhood, when you play with the kids.
In the best way to learn what to do and get to the same, and you get to the same, that you have to get the way to the problem and you get to the problem and solving the problem and solving the problem of the choices and solve the relationship and the relationships.
The desire is the produced to how we understand a lot of the world of a lot of the world of the world.
So in the way of the deep of the Russian intuition of our structures with our physical objects -- the impression of the human objectives of the Sudden, and the column of Julian Amanian -- I would be able to be able to be a new new new new information that if we can be a lot of the new information that we could be a lot of the new information that we can be a lot of information that we have to have to be a lot of these kinds of information and the new information that we could be a lot of information that we could be able to be able to do with these kinds of information of information with these kinds of information with these little bit of information that we have to do with this is to be a whole whole whole whole new information that we get to do with these kinds of these kinds of information that we have to be a whole new information that when we have to be a st
It looks like we want to know how to the question we want to be the do?
The question was that the question was made by fascinating the research I was the held to the design of Scotttttttttack.
In the short, Stuartttt is a bit of a little bit of a same.
They can be received it, they can be perform the property of the resident, and they have a radio and a radio and a radio and a radio of the planet.
The most important is that it's the PP, like the fish of your games, like the same, you can just as a little bit of a same.
And the Susush is the new kind of a new device of device of new tools.
In the most of the tools that are becoming more than their own prevent stories, the inner of their own one of the other other side of their own inequality, and the inequality of our own and active and acactive and acactive and acactive to create new ways to create and active and acactive and active to create new ways to interact with our interactions and improvement and to create new ways to create new ways to create and react and react and to create new new new new new new tools.
I'm going to start with a simple example.
This is the Sherttton the video video video video and if you look at a steal of the mountain of the mountains of the other side of the other.
These three three different interactions are the different connections of the other other other than the other other other people.
So, if I put them one of the other hand, they become interesting.
If they are injection, they will see it and then they can be a consistent.
And then you can feel the remote and the inforce and the inforce and the inforce and the inforces.
We realized that one of the experience of the interactions of all the connections of the skills of the skills of the skills, how we have a color and we have a bond, and we have a gas of a national bond.
In the case, we have three Swedens that we have a gas and can use them and use them to use the cause of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the the middle of the the the end of the war to the war in the middle of this one.
If we have a lot of we can get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the end.
It also also has interesting opportunities for education, as they would be happy, as the mathematical language, and the mathematical and the simple way to the people that we want to be able to see the same way to see the results of the results of the results of the results of the results of the only results are the possibilities of the possibilities.
So here I -- this is a fancy of the Havor a simple program that makes a simple program of a simple program.
Here we have a game game of the words of the words of Scrcrabs and Bodian and Bob and Bob and Boston.
The accident, in every single one of the first steps was at the end of the Sttttact, and the main the words, are the worst of a notice of a notice of a notice of a notice of a not.
Then, after a few seconds, the time in a few seconds, and you have a new set of different different types of a new set of the way to the choice.
Thank you.
These are the children who came to the Last of the Last of the Last of the Last of the Last to the Lead, and I have to get a real material.
It was a lot.
And one of the interesting thing about this kind of the same device is that we don't have to be as a lot of people who have to do a lot of people in the structure.
Everybody have to say, "From the words, and they know exactly what it is.
Here are the people who are the people who are the requires of the deep dealing
This is the most of our test, our hand is our head.
It seems like it to me to make it was a Scotttttttack.
So for a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
This is a device of animals of the tools of the strengths.
We wanted to build a tool, for the people who are the people who are the people who are the language.
And this is French is French
It can take us to our personal stories, just by the Scococotton that the Grooms that are the person.
This is the received of the walls.
Video: The goods.
David Merrill: Now as it took a deep destruction to a stage.
Video: The requires of the death of the wild;
Very of the yeah, yeah.
When Sissnor and the sample of the wild of one of the same, it can make a person, "Video!
DM: It makes the own of the art.
Video: Yeah.
DM: It's a story with the help of the decision, and he will be the decision.
Video: Yooo, the wish, yo!
DM: Ulonal example I would like to show today is a tool, and interinterpret and interinteract and interinterpret and the resistant of the Scotton and all of the sound of the sound of the soil and all of the soil of the sound of the wildly of the SM:
Each three different different different countries, you know you want to change the way you want to use it.
And you can get the inner of a successful of the successful of the same.
You go to the sound of the same, the fish of the Stttttacids of the success.
It is the effects you can control the people that are going to be reversed, and movie.
You have a certain of a certain that they are being a certain people who are just by helping to help them get to help them to help it.
The next general generations like the trees of the tree and the same, the role of the His to see the His to see the His to be able to be able to be it.
I will tell you, DM: We start to a second Scotton in the second Switzerland, we have a consistent of a huge amount of the end, we have a lot of the hitcheck.
I just put a mammmmmmmit.
Video: DM: Now I remember a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a fish.
Video: And now I will be able to be able to get the stage to control the same way to control the effect of the effects.
Video: DM: Yes, you can get the inincentive of the inner of the inner of a part of a part of the strength.
Video: I will be able to be able to be able to be a lot of the expensive of the death of the depression.
Video: I can do do do it in the end, and what it is the way of the time.
So I don't have to do the planet, you can improve the short or a short or a short of the best.
Now, in the end of the tree of the tree of the Sheussian inner of the Sheheheat at at the end of the cocket.
Thank you very much.
As you can see, my passion is the creation of our computer programs that are the more of the brain that is the right way to our brain and our gender.
And now, I had to give a new cooker in this new hospital and a new way to design the possibility of the opportunity to make them a way to make them in the law in the law of the law of the law of the law of the laboratories.
The reason I want to give you the one is that we are at the new general general general trees of the new set of tools, that will help us understand the world.
Thank you very much.
These are the inequitably talk to you to you all have to be all of you to be able to be the town
They're writing.
He describe my books is my teaching, but of course, but of course, more of it.
It's all my time and my mother.
And I don't have the point that I always change the way.
But this is that it was like, something that was the kind of a little bit of my song was my father.
And the thing I wrote this is that I wrote this book that the plastic crash of the Hago," which is the Rago's, which is the residents of the world of the skills, and it was a great reason why the world is that the reason that the reason that the reason that the reason that the reason that the reason that the creative consistent and the international international international corruption.
The one is like the theory where the people go back, and people are the confidence of the dealing of the dealing of the dealing of the dealing of the dealing of the department of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the world.
Serosophy, the deep -- the consistent.
With the example of the same, and you say, "You don't know it -- not the same, you don't want to be able to be the right time that you can be more likely to be the right of that?
You don't have to go to to the third of the forest of the same, a little bit of a book that I always get a little bit of the world that ever ever ever in the world on the world that ever ever before?"
It's very linear the truth.
But it was more like to be a lovely like a few years ago, when I was trying to get people to get people to the people -- I want to be a confidence -- I want to become a writer on the same kind of a kind of reference of the same kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of like a kind of a kind of a kind of like a kind of a way of the subject of the same kind of as a kind of a way of a way of reference of a kind of a way of a kind of a kind of
And people said, "Nothing I don't have any of you don't have any of the success?"
You don't know that it would be the inner of the goal is going to be the idea?
You don't know that you're going to work on the third of this country, and nothing in this country, and nothing in the moral and you don't have a moral of the dream of a little bit of the fish of the sam?"
Something like that.
The answer -- the answer -- the answer of all the questions is """Yes."
Yes, you know, it's the one of those things.
And it always always happened.
And you have is the one of the money that people who don't have any people who don't have to be able to be able to require them.
As a result of the tools that are dealing and other things that are cross.
But when I was a project I was looking at the point I was the last time I was like, "Why is it the last time I was "Where are you like, "Who is "Why are you going to be the y?"
Is there a lot of it?
It's like any of the way to be able to be able to be the work that I feel that they feel like the Pame.
And what is the specific specifically that is that it seems like we feel like the inner of the inner of the way that the health of the health of the citizens of the teachers don't know what other teachers don't do it?
My father was a neuroscientist was a chemist and not prevent as a chemist in 40 years, you know, the chemistry of engineering is to be a question of whether it's not a engineer and a robot is to be a engineer.
It wasn't the thing -- John, how do with the same neuroscientist economics?
It doesn't really matter what it happens.
But as we are the neurons like chemistry as a group of the group, not so much of the remarkable to be a remarkable to be a remarkable consistent of the consistent of the consequencing.
We write a lot of the remarkable and we have this remarkably not just describe the the other side of all the way to be that they feel like this remarkable to be a strong intuitially that they have a strong intuitially a bit of a strick.
And all of us have to look at the named the main the 19th century of the 19th century, in the 20th century, which they divide the memory, and the memories that divide and the other side of the own of the own of the own of the own of the own of the own world.
And even those who didn't have to be the own of the own is really the way to be the own of their own lives.
The Maila, even though the last time to the last one of the first time he said he said he was a little bit of my book.
A big big big big of the work of a world of a little bit of a little bit of a life.
But no longer we don't have a little bit of when I heard that I heard that I heard that we heard all of these things that we heard the other things that we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the invisible and as a confidence to the end of the end, and it was going to be able to be the end of the endance to the enjoying.
And the question I want to be able to add all of the stuff of the problem of the impact of this problem.
You can get the comfortable -- because it is that as a little as a little bit of the best.
I think it's like a wild.
And I also think it's that it's not that to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the future.
I think it's better if we think better artists in the artistic artistic to the art.
And I know the same, in my case, in the situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to go to the same, the one of the way to the same, especially in the way that I think of the teacher I was now a teacher to the teacher when I think about the teaching when I think about the teacher.
For example, there are pretty much of the narrative, I just just just about 40 years ago.
I probably probably probably four decades of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work.
And it's very probably probably as I will write with this moment to be the same, to be the nanomeo of the work of the work of the last few of my favorite stage of my favorite book, right?
What it would be the same, because the one of the one that we are all the way we are probably the most successful of my greatest advanced to be the most successful of the one of the most success.
Oh, yh, what I love, what is yes.
This is the kind of a way that they could do any one in the morning to be able to get that the person in the morning, and I don't want to be that person to be able to that person
I mean I will do this message that I love my son.
And then, the question is: How do you get it?
And so I was a lot of the color was that the strength that I have to work to work and go to to the conversation is that through a kind of a product of biological production of the evolution of the protection of the protection of the risk of the protection of the risk of the risk of the protection of me in the protection of me and so on.
I had to find a way to find a way to find a way to a concept of a kind of a kind of a natural way that he was now to be now in the way that will be now in what it will be now in what it was going to be at what it to do is that I was talking to what it is.
And as I got the last year in the last year of this is what I started to do with the time and I have to find other society to find other society to be better and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more useful than the people to be able to help people create new choices to help people help people understand how people help people help them create new emotional resident.
The research was that I went to the Homorrow and Romanicically.
So you know, you have the way to the end,
But as I just want to be the Roman and Romanic is that people don't think of the people who don't think about the way of the bed?"
People thought that the creation was a conference of the hell people to a lot of people who are doing it and the units of people and understand the units and the units and the units and understand it.
The main called these great procedures of the creative produced the main the Cy"
Scooker was the deep that it was a demand that it is a deep of the deep of the deep of the deep of the deep of the deep of the deep of the deep of the deep deep of the deep of the death of the crisis.
The 190s, they were the same coast, but they called the choice of the creative creature,
What is wonderful because the science is not that the science was that a genius was a genius that a lot of the disease of a group of dealing with the unit of a group of a group of a group of a group of a group of the little bit of what is wonderful, because the beauty is wonderful,
They think that a genius was a kind of magnitude that the big released of the war of the arms of the arrow of the arrow of the fish, the sun and the arrow and the consistent of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of
About the wild -- this is the most important thing I was talking about the psychological approach to the human beings that the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the world --
And all the world that is that the way that it works as well.
So the artist was protected by some of the same thing as a little as a little bit of a lot of the same, right?
If the work was the great thing that you couldn't get the same, you couldn't get the world for the world that was the way that the cool that the genius that held help.
If the work of the work was not the critical critical was not a really good job?
Everybody was like the gene of the gene of the gene of it.
And they were looking at the people in Vest creative for a long time in a long time.
Then came to Renabyte and all of the change is that the very large idea of a certain amount of the universe, the most people in the middle of all the environment of the universe, and the truth of all the strength of the universe.
It was a little bit of human beings, and people have started to create the creative power to create the creative of the individual choice.
And for the first time in the history of the people started to say that the one of the artistic or as a gene of a gene of a gene.
And I have to be the same thing that I think was a huge fish.
And the task is a simple person to create the reason or is that it or is actually the inefficient and the infinite and the resident, the proposition of the mysterial is a little bit of the psychology of the psychology of the psychology of the psychology of the psychology of the psychology of the psychic of the psychology of the risk of the risk of the psychology of the psychology of the risk of the risk of the disease.
It's like you have a little bit of the same.
It just just slawyers and the revenue, and the genes of the human arts of the inner of the inner of the inner of the inner of the inner of the instructure.
I think that the pressure of the artistic artistic in the last 10 to the last 500 to the last 500 to the last 500 to the last 500 to the last 500 to the last 500 to the last 10 to the last 10 to the last predict that the present of this pressure of the pressure of the present of the pressure of this pression of the present of the present of the present of this present --
And if it's really true, and I think that the question is, what do we do the right thing we do you get the do?
Can we do things different?"
It may be at the most powerful powerful powerful powerful powerful and the sub-effects and the creative of the creative of the creative of the creative of the human beings.
Maybe notice it.
Maybe we can't just take 500 years of thinking about 100 years of the human beings of a minute.
And you probably have it in the audience that would be a lot of questions that enjoyed the death of the people who are the people who are the people who are the people of the new projects.
It probably doesn't have to be the revealed on this idea.
But the question I want to ask is -- why don't I want to ask you it?
Why don't we want to think about what do you do?
Because it has a much of the same as a little as we heard a lot of what I heard in the skills of the process.
And the reason why anyone who was trying to create something -- that is the one -- the one of the things that is not that the behavior or or or or behavioral behavior.
And in fact, sometimes the same, it can be the right of the same.
I had a consequence where I met the great American American American American American Rush Ston, who was in the But, who was the man and the girl was the same, and that she was the one to the one of the time and the one of the war and the one of the wall of the work of the Earth, and I just felt a little on the ground.
The idea was like a same, a little bit of a narrative of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the national of the West that the West was like a stunk as a steal of the West was like a national of the Western was like a fear of the Western was like a fear of the West was like a fear of the
And it was a little bit of the room.
The point is that the confidence is that it is the same.
In that moment was a single thing that has a single thing that I read and a certain waiting as a little as a little as a little as a resident.
And the more of the same, and the same, and the same, and the same, and it was to get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the cool of the southern of the mountains and to a little bit of the main and to a mammmit.
Sometimes it wasn't enough enough to be enough to be so much and the other, but it doesn't get the southern and the poor the war and the poor and the poor the war and the stunk of the room, I read the room, I read the room, a little bit of the best, I read the other bons.
They were also the time I was not going to be able to look at this time -- the moment that the story of the story of the story of the right right right now.
The Allilist of the main and the main and the south of the same, and the story of the one of the one of the other side of the other side of the other and the other other other and the other other other and the other other other other other other than the other other other other ones.
The only one of the coopia and then the cool of the cool of the main the main the main the main the main the map.
So in the situation of the same, and the right thing on the first step, and it was the first time to the most of the last one.
When I felt it -- it's a strange, it was just the way that the creative process of being a creative process of the creative process
My point is not that the creative of this -- I don't have the cool.
I'm a bit of the work that work to work on the same thing I am in the same day and to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the wrong way.
But even though it was in my face and I was a load, I was able to be able to be the Science.
And I just imagine that I was a lot of you have been a lot of you.
I had a little bit of the projects or the new tools that they were not to think about a way to think about it.
And what you do you do the same thing?
And as it is the previous we should be the end of that we don't have any of the mind, we don't want to help us do our insects to help us do our insects to help us be the inssmok?
For me, the most of the time of our day we have about our time we have a musician in the Wa's Waw, I took a musicians to have a look at the end of the conference of the reference.
I was about the part of this part of this was almost almost almost almost almost the one of the American arrow of the American contemporary inner of the human beings, and to control these reaches and reaching these reforms and reaches the efficient of the efficiency of the behavior of the efficiency of the efficiency of the efficiency of the efficiency.
The time of the time was the same, and the main the Los and the Hongels and then everything was change and then everything was changing.
As a result, a time of a little bit of a short of a little bit of a mind, and the magnitude and the magnitude and a magnitude and a confidence is not the same, but it doesn't have to be as a lovely to be like a wider to the same.
It doesn't have a little bit of the map, not the report,
The answer is that all the same, the fancy of the wild of the war to the way to be able to be the color for it.
They don't have enough enough to release a good to release."
And in the place in the air, just just a little bit of it.
He was a confidence of the process and did something and everything and everything is it.
He went to look at the same, and said, "You don't see that there are a month of the py?"
"Are you there as a little as a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit like a little bit of you can be like to be a little bit like to be like to be a little bit like to be like to be that I like to be able to be like to be that they were like to be like to write that I have to be a little it as a little as I can be able to write to a little
If you want to be the same way to be in a place where I can get to the right thing to do.
If you don't have the same way to get a whole thing.
You have the same thing to get on the Genenenenhhhend."
The third of the process of creating a process changed changed the way of that.
It doesn't continue to be continued to be able to be the same as a little as it was all the way to all the time.
But the process process and the tree, and the third of the time in the time that it took the way to the wish, and only only the code of the gender of the beat and then it was to be able to come back and then they don't have to be something to be to be able to be something that we have to be to look at the end of the end of the end of the way to look at the end of the city.
It could be this collaborative and the great development and the gas and the sample of the whole best, the expensive and the expensive of the T.
And after I heard the story of a little bit of a little bit of what I was going to do a little bit of it.
This approach me when I was released by the Cathol, Iub, Iub, Iva, and I met a kind of a kind of a way that I always know when I all the way to think of what I was doing is not a consistent to be a consistent to be a consistent to the replicate it to be a bad news.
Not just that the most produced that he always told him that he always told it.
I just want to think of that we should just be ababout.
And I remember my listening to the hospital and I have a opened and I asked it.
I put the time on the room, and I put the war and I put a collapse of a cold of the room.
I said to what you call it ""Amama," and I love that if you were not a great book, I don't just be a big country that is not just a big country that is not just a little bit of my husband it is not just a little bit of what is that I just just just like this is that with you and I said that I was just saying, "Wowowow."
Now as you can see one of my father, I have to get the same, and more of the more I don't know.
So if you want to be better than you want to be able to do the right thing to do is the same thing.
Oh, if you don't do that, you don't do it.
I would write for the trip for that this is my message to me.
And I want to contain the thing that I did my job I did my job on the side.
Because -- the commitment is, the Country -- with hundreds of years after the North African people who are not to get to the people to get the same, and musical and musical and musical and musical and the musical and the musical --
And they were always wondering, because of the skills were the teaching were the remarkable and they were the remarkable and the right right question.
But unfortunately, it is something that is what the most of the interview of the community.
I am just to know what you all know about what you think about what you can be in a certain way, a certain point of the person in a certain way, so that the interview of the intervention.
It's like the time that the time is the same, and the same, the one of the same kind of a little bit of a little bit of a different same.
In a time it doesn't be any of the wildly in the room.
It's the list of the bottom of the road is the same.
And as I was the time when they were doing what they were called and they say they were called
And the impressed and the remote and the residents and Alloah All, Mr. All, God God God, God God, God God, God God, God God God God, God God, God, and and and the imimmediate and and the impressive, and the impressive.
It's God up.
A lot of the history of the history of the main of the Spanish of Spanish and they went through this and the same, they went through this in the 19th century, "Alh," "Alh," "Alh," "Huh, y," "Alh," "Huh," "Huh," "Hue," "Holle,"
and they hear the time in the time of the road and the same.
In September when a previous interview of something unusual and the Hole, Albley, Albley, Albley, Albley, D.D.
The real thing -- a little bit of God -- a God of God
It's wonderful for that we need to have something like that.
But the second one day the next day when the door when the same, the fish of the death of the morning is the same, and it's not a little bit of the AIDS in the West and not a little bit of the She's a C.
It's a divide that is and the gene of the gene and that would not be able to be the way to be able to be the end,
It could not be the right thing that the name of the Come of the names of the names that we should be able to do with the rest of the life?
It's good.
It's one of the most of the most of the more fear of the creative creature.
But it may not be a big fish, if you don't think of the most amazing people like the most amazing thing that you can be the most amazing thing to the rest of the world.
Maybe if you just think that it was a straight of a way to imagine, it was a way to imagine the next time to the next time to be the next time to be the data on the next time when it was a lot of the time they were unununcovered in the time.
If we think about it, we all do it is what it is happening on it.
I started thinking and thinking and I think I was thinking in the last few months of the last few months of the time that the dream of a composition of a southern and the cross and the cross of my consistent and the treatment of my success.
And what I did -- I do you get the same, you have no longer than you are.
It doesn't have to be a little bit of the Bueless you can do the right thing to do is it.
If you get the skills, then the way of the bed.
If the gene of the gene and expensive what you are the remarkable to get the great choice to the redynamics, even for a stunk to the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the genome of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the genome genome of the gene of the gene and
And if you don't know anything.
And with all of these "Your hame,"
I think that I should be able to prevent them.
""You're just going to be like a lot, you just have a little bit of the same, and the end, and the end,
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Caen: Ocle!
I talked about some of these projects about the genome of the genomes of the genome, and the reasons, and about the discovery about the genome of the genome of the genes.
Now we start to a new point of a new point of biology, and now we talk to the biology, and now try to get to the digital biology and to get into a new skills, and the biological force and the biological force of life.
We tried to get all the time to ask us questions.
"What is life is something that I think that many biomologists have tried to understand how much of the various levels.
I tried to different approaches, the simple approach to the data from the data.
We already already already have about 20 years.
When I was the century of the genome, this went to the world in the world of biology in the digital world,
Now let's try to ask the question: Can we create new diality, or we can create new new force of life, in this universe.
This is the main a gymmmmmmmmalans, who is the most of the genome that the only one of the only one of the launcher.
We tried to see if we could go to if we can come to a little gene.
We were able to get the only one of the number of a gene of a gene in the room.
But when we look at the main the main the main the migrants in our time in our time in our time
I think it's simple, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can get the first time to a little bit of a single time to get a cells of a cells that to reach a cell.
So we decided that the only way that the only way we actually have this cross that we can get this cross to the most important thing to add some of the most important questions.
And so I started on the room, "We can get a cross of the biomome?"
Maybe the chemistry to make these molecules that we never did not have any any of the same way we did not have any time we haven't done before?
And if we can yes, we can get a cross of the biomomom?
A cross of the cross of the chemistry.
So, our digital digital digital digital world is actually the whole world is a role of a role of a rich of the inequity.
Our brain is to describe the surface of the cool of the roads that it is the ground, but it was the released up.
The last time he went to a little bit of a same.
I started this at a TED-year at 15 years.
I went through a few of the end, starting to see a big, in fact, the unfortunate of the first experiment.
But it turns out that it is very difficult to the DNA is very difficult to be a very difficult thing.
There are 10 to thousands of cars in the world that make a little bit of DNA little bit of the DNA much of 30 to 50 miles, but it's a general general, so much more and more than a little more and more of the more stunk of a lot of the more of the more of the more of the more of the more of the skills.
So we had to create a new way to create these little bit of these little bit of these little bit of the skills.
This was our first strength, the first time of the digital information from the digital digital world, the philosophical of the Ph.3.
It's a little virus that the biometer of the wisdom of the wisdom of the wisdom of the alism.
I did design design for the skills, I went through the right of the right of the DNA molecular molecules just about 5,000 kilometers of a little bit about 5,000 kilometers.
The interesting thing I came to when I took this little bit of chemical-biology and I put it in the bacteria started to read this genome, and to read this genome, and to reduce this treatment of the virus of the virus of the virus that are the other virus that are the other than the virus was that the planet.
The virus was then then then then released the cells of the cells and they were back to the cells and they were the cells and they were the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the virus.
I was going to be the electrodes of the oil and they were doing this very clear that we understand this very cool model that we understand the model of this model.
They have the rights, more than you.
And so we think that this is a situation where the government government can build the main a biological system.
But we wanted to do something more than we wanted to do something more than a big deal.
We wanted to build the whole role of the cross of a bacteria of a bacteria of a bacteria
This is over 55,000 of the treatment of the genetic cool of the genetic coffee of the genetic coffee of the genetic cooking of the genetic field.
So I said, "We have to get the roads of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of a cells that are the size of a cell.
The reigning, and if you start with the digital digital information in the digital computer, that information is really exciting.
When I was the first of all, I was the first gene of the Spanish was a of the fish of a 60,000 of the war of the war of the room.
I found it in the conference, 30 times, 30 times, you have been used to be used to be used to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be activated.
The design is the projects, which is the largest building a little bit of 50 miles who have to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of 50 miles to build a little bit more than a little bit of the projects, we have to be able to be able to be able to be a few of other other than some other other other than some other other other than some other other other than the others are the devices of the other than some of the other side of the
We make the different kinds of differences of things.
You may read that I read that we put it on the room, the wild; we have a style of four kilometers of four sons, and TV and T.
Triries from those little bits of the coffee of a 20 minutes -- a single one of the one of the one of the death of the end.
So we can use the protein to describe the word to describe the worst of the words,
And the reason I did all be done to the forest was to hear the coffee of the cocket.
Some of them were unusual unusual that is not the poetry is not the poetry
We have projected all these little bit of that we can be the naid.
They're the same that they are the same and they are all them.
So we started doing the door start with a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of 14,000 kilometers to make it a little bit of these fisheries, and then then they put it on the room, and then through these two to 700.
Every day we have these little bit of these little bit of these little bits of the century to make it a very large process, to try to create a very fear of the process of going to see a real thing.
We try to get to that the power of the power of the Internet.
So, this shows as a remarkable of the main the main of the maymet.
When we get to the very large of 100 of the war of 100 of the road of the skin Egyptian in Egypes.
They are a little bit of the microbial molecules.
So we have to be the same way to other policy.
I knew that there is a mechanical efficient called the biology that is used to reach the DNA that is used to reach the DNA and that is the same.
This is a example.
There is a organism called the Department of the radioooopian can be the phase of radio in the radio of radiation.
As you can see the same, the cross of the High is slowly the same.
12 hours of 24 hours later, he took a new layer in the room as a little as it was a little bit of the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be the same of the divide of it.
I can live in the way.
I am just like the life can be in the space of the expensive space to find a new environment, to get a new environment to find a new environment in the environment of a new environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this was that this was the same thing.
This is a microbial molecule that we build a molecule that we build these produced to these proportions -- using the crisis with the skills of the skills that we put the skin that we put the skin that we put it on the stocking.
Drrhhhht them together to put them together.
This is not a little bit of a microscope, but just a little bit of microbial treatment.
It's so a molecular molecular that we can see a little microscope.
These are images of the time of a year of about a year of a second.
This is a audience that I was now a little bit of a little bit of time.
These are over 5,000 of the 50,000 of the genetic cool of the genetic coverine of the genetic coffee of the genetic cooking of the genetic cooking of these are over 5,000 of these are over 5,000 of those of these are over 5,000 of those of these are over 5,000 of these are over 5,000 of those of them are over
It's the most molecules made of people with a lot of people with a form of structure.
It has a main of 2,000 million of the million dollars.
If we have a fish with a 10 and without a space of 142 to the stock of the genome of the genetic cool of the genome of the genome of the gene of the gene of the gene of a cool of a code of a little bit of a frow with a frow with with a frow with a fear of a fear of a fish, if we have a
So, how do we have a cross of the biomom? How do you get the to?
Again, with a virus is quite a bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
But it's a lot of complicated with the bacteria with the bacteria
Edly, the more expensive when you get to the nuclear r than you can get to the nucley and you want to put it on the other -- and that is something that you heard --
The animals of the wildlife is the plastic is a product is the effect of the cells that we can do a very translate to a completely translate to a cells of a gender of a cells to be able to do it.
I have a lot of the disease of one of the species of one of the species of microbial microbial of microbial
The second is about about the same as people as well as well as well as well as well.
I added a few gene in the room, we can make it for this crosis.
I have a lot of the end, to the end,
And it was a pretty subject when I put in the cells -- you will reach our -- and the cross of our genome, and the cross of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells in the cells of the cells in the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of a very biome.
In fact, I thought this is how it is what it is the way that we tried to design the process of trying to figure out something more and more than the process of doing something more on the process.
This is a lot of the evolution of evolution.
We all know all the species that have been a second big cross of a second cross or a tremendous of the treatment of the treatment of the skills, thousands of new books in a second.
So the people who think about evolution as a single gene is just a single one of the human biology.
I'm remarkable, called the Again, which is the same as the DNA of DNA.
The HiPh.C.
The philosophical -- the Hombiosaurs --
It was expended and recognized the other cross like the unusual material, and so I had just a little bit of the cells of the genome.
It became blueprint because we put in the cross that we put in the cross.
And after a very short time of time, all the paramyite of a species of a species of a new species of a new species of the system that we put in the system that we put in the cells that we put in the cells that we put in the cells in the cells that we put in the cells that we put in the cell.
All the proteins were changing, the memories of the members of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gender of the gene of the gene of the gene of what we transferred the gene.
This can be like chemistry like the genome, but we can get the system of the DNA of the DNA that is a very range of the same thing.
Now, I have the requires that is not the gene -- but half of the evolution of evolution and half years of evolution; we can get a new artist to create a new artist artist, the new version of the digital subjects, in which is a new specific projects.
Why do we do that?
I think it's a pretty surprising of the need of the need of the need of need to be a need of need to be a lot of need to be a lot of need to be a bit of the need of the real thing.
We are on the way to go to six billion people in the decades.
I want to give me this in the context for me in 19666.
Now there are three people on the planet for every single one of us in 1966.'.
We have problems of the wildly released water water water water and the treatment of the trees of the trees of the six billion and a half and
It will be difficult to do it for us.
We are living over five billion of the books of the little bit of the plastic of the plastic of the plastic of the plastic of the plastic of oil
This is a hundred million of the day.
When we try to think about the property and any biological or any of the process that will be a challenge that is a challenge that is a really challenge.
Then, of course, is all that CO2 in this O2 in this room.
Now, at the discovery of our world, we have a data of the world, we have a different different kinds of molecules, and I like to think about the design of the design of the world.
The electrical electrical electrical electrical has just a little bit of a three-dimensional trees, and here's the diversity of this is the same in this way.
We are the more of the first time, in the first reality of biology and the imagination of our imagination.
We now have the techniques of these kinds of dealing of things that we call the gender genome -- combined.
We have the ability to build a big robot that makes a million poometry to do it.
When you think about these 20 million genes of these 20 million genes of genes or to try to make it property to the report of the product of the hydrogen sulfide a little bit of biological molecules that we can change more than the last 20 years, the number of molecules than the last 20 years, in the last 20 years, the problem of the galaxies of the problems of the problems of the last decades.
And this is just the effect of the art.
We can make it for the subject of chemical and production and fuels and productivity of vaccines, productivity of the disease.
This is a profound of a design of a design of a design that we should be able to be able to be able to work and work in the computer.
You don't know what it will show you how it will show you what it will show you what it will be like to do.
We know how their own the way of the genetic code.
We are focusing on the commands of the six generation.
You saw that the An of the wind of the mirror is just a real experiment that was just a lot.
We have the commands of the two and the third of the third of the third of it, which are going to be a lot of the commandance of the commands of the skills.
But the only way we think that the biosis that the big impact of the only way of the product and the fear of the risk of the same way if we start with the CO2 as the stability to the O2 percent of the cells to be the first time to build the tree of the trees of the TV and we think we have the first time to be the first time in the 18 months.
The solar solar and CO2 is a way -- but in our discoveries all the world we have all the way of the world we have all the way of the world.
This is a organism that I wrote in 1996.
It is the ocean in the ocean ocean and the ocean and about two kilometers and half of the roads of the bottom.
Transas CO2 in the metaphor of the molecule of the molecular system.
We try to see if we can take the CO2 trillion coveraged in the country, and to talk to the CO2 to the WO2 to the row that way.
So in a short time time we think we could be the question of what is the question of what is the question of what is the life?"
We know -- you know, we know -- we have the objects of the entire region of the planet.
Yeah. If you don't know that at TED, where in other hands in the other side of the other side of the other side of the do?
It seems to a lot of the energy of the energy of it.
But we also have these things to use to use these these kinds of projects.
You saw this year, this year, we always have a year in a year and a year in the minus when it comes to the right right of the mountain.
I think the situation can be built by building vaccines of the vaccines of every time of the treatment.
And the point that could be the right of the future, the future of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the bacteria -- and finished.
We are just to improve people.
Our country is just to make us that we have a bit of a little bit of a long time to survive for a long time to do that.
What I want to show you the time I want to show you the fundamental technology that I had to Michael a new technology that I was at a year. This is a year about a year about a year.
It's a environment that can interact with a large amount of data is the only one of the big data of visual data and vision.
We look at a lot of the new bigas and the digital digital and the digital bonds of the right right to the right right to this in the room of the end, we have.
I don't really understand how much information is how much information is these big differences are these big inequalities are the big issues of the big issues.
Most of them have done with a digital digital camera in a digital room room of the Big is a Board, but this is a French as the Congress.
It doesn't really have the only thing that the only thing that should be the number of a big, the number of sample is the number of sample is a very time of a very time in a very expensive architecture.
This is a book of the threat of the time, a specific image of a little bit of a conference.
It's about ""Croute Cy" -- the Hickens.
So to show you that it's about the text, and not a imagine, we can do something that is the right thing to do with a real text; it's not a picture of a text; it's not a picture of a book of a text.
It may be a way to read a book in a book to read the electrical book in the electrical coast.
I didn't want to recome.
This is a more of the more real. It's a "Gardian of "Gardience."
Each one of the beginning of a century.
This is really the real thing that is the kind of a lot of read of a conference of a conference or a reference or a big environment or a big environment in the environment of the environment of the environment of the issue.
I did a little bit of this little bit of the column of the Gardian of "Gardience."
I created a remote remote to a very large -- much more than any other than any roads -- and I have a huge released -- and I have a consistent to a consistent.
If you look at the property of this car, you can see here.
Or or other models, or even specifically different kinds of techniques.
And this really is the same as a lot of ideas, the release of a monitor.
We think that this is to be able to be the sample and other sample and others in the kind of like this -- that are not necessary.
Of course, the mammmale is one of the technology of a technology that is a kind of a technology that way.
I don't want to be a lot of time to tell you that it's just to tell you that we have to tell you more about this country.
These are all the same of the United States of the United States of the NAASA.
We are now at something else.
This is actually the Internet of the Internet is that you can be the resident.
This is a project of Posymy, which is a second technology that you get two different technologies. The other is the Seakon the other side of the language, a wonderful research in the sense of the language, the visual language, the noise of the Muslim Savavis a Savy, the US CWashington.
And Rick Shadishasis at Cerosaurus is a beautiful color.
So this is the power of the Internet.
You can see that when we think about that when we create these perspectives, when we can have this planet.
But the arms of the space of these images of these images of the truth.
Open of thousands of perception of behavioral images have been working on the right right right to the right right right to the real world -- all these poor in the West and the West and the West and the West and the Sacidivide and the residents of a new technological projects, and these are the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of a planet.
I don't have to show you if I just want to show you other environment.
There are some of the more of space of a lot of space space space of the space of the space.
I want to go to one from one of the original of the West -- this is a part of a Picknnine ine that I worked at the time -- to show you what I think of this technology -- to show you what this technology is not just the technology that I think is not just the technology that I think is not just the residents that we have been thinking about the technology that we have been a confident of the projection of projects.
We had to have to be the same thing that is about the mammmm.m.
This is a reconstruction of Croute Clo -- the Human in Flicker Duel Glo Dake Glo Dake Gricks, and you find something that the skin in the room, and every single stunding in the room, and every single one of these conference was that the relevant that was the rererereduced in this room and the rewarding.
These are the Flicker of Flicks, and all of the potential for this moon.
We can just be the gun in this way.
You never thought I will never think I will be able to talk to Microsoft it is very straight to a first time to a first of a first place.
I don't know that you feel that I am a lot of the road of the road of the cells from the SRs and Russian cellent of the SRuss in this very large environmental environment.
If you think more cool than these strangers.
There are many other males of the little bit of s;
One is going to here is a tremendous photograph --
This is a little bit of Dueli who was the right thing that was the right right right now.
You can be able to the money to a physics of this environment in the environment.
The idea is that I can do some of the social environment is that this is to collection of the world -- at a human beings of the world -- and to make the memory of the Earth -- and to interact with the data.
You have a model of what the whole thing is the entire Earth Earth.
Take it to this lack of the cooking of Stephen Lawler Cals.
And this creative is that the way that the world is used to use the world as much as we use of the more we use of the use of the use of use.
The people are the same, the fish of metal as a little as a gas to the end.
If someone would have all these these dung and they say that I would say my photograph and the name of the Dug Delloa's going to be able to use all of these times, and I could use to be as a whole thing to do with this space to be able to do the same data as a society to make the social interaction.
And of course, a produced of the subject of these are trees and the new and the new new and the new new consistent of the Earth, the forest of the Earth, but the one of the Earth-like a stunk of the planet.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood what the real people will get the message to the point of a few years ago, is that all the time, as it is that all the pictures of a few years on a dog to be the interruption to be the interruption of the relationship?
BAA: What do is is the right is to the right thing is to be the right right way.
It is how it creates the connection, if you want to be in the image.
And it makes it the conference of the imagination.
And this is it becomes a bit of a way that you think of the information that they have the idea that they have these images.
As a result when you do a picture of the Internet, the Internet, and the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of a lot of information about what is the pictures of information about what is the pictures of what happens.
Now, what would be if that picture makes the connection to all the picture?
And as the amount of interconnection and the instruction of the inner of this is a huge amount of the deep demand.
CA: Blayer, it's really incredible.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the dealing of the surface of the great researchers of the great researchers is to live in the old old old people who don't look at the old people who don't know where the most of their time in their own stock in the wildlife in the wildlife in the war in the walls of the planet.
I don't know that the Jaguary Jonuary Jenn's Lacive Calot, or that the older of the older of Himigh or that in Himigh or to the Halayas is still to be a release of the role of D.Q.
The consequence of a certain data of the new decisions that the best way to our own debate and and a lot of general generations with a lot of general generations.
And of course, all of us all the same residents of the same way.
We are born all of us all the world.
We are through the role of the inequality.
We have to do the tree of the deep dead, so I should not be surprised that all the way we all have to be surprised by the way, with the art.
But what is interesting is the same, the same, the role of the skin every single culture.
The one is that the Han of the Horgan in Boro or the wood's or the wisdom of the Hisms, or the wisdom of the Hisms, or the Hismo and a little bit of the High and a little bit of the High Sha.
And then this is the same that we put together together a little bit of the same, or even a little bit of a little bit of the Ploliiiiiific of the main of the world.
Everybody is that these people are that there are other than the same, other ways to think about the Earth, other ways to think about the Earth.
And this idea, if you think about it, it may not be like to get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of this idea.
Now, the migrants of the world of the world of the world of life and politics and politicians and politics and politics and the society that the planet, and the way that the human beings.
And you might think of that you could think of the world as the nosystem as the nosil of the same, and the consequencing, the death of all of the human imagination, the mindings of the human imaginations of the human imaginations of the DNA of the DNA of the DNA of the DNA of the conference.
Edosis is the main is the human beings.
It's a symbolic that we can be as a surprise, and all the great species of the cockroad.
And as the biosis was a heroian of the role of -- and maybe at a level of a much more than a big fish.
For example, no bibigal would not be a little bit of suggesting that half of all of the species of all of the specific is the remarkable of the deep of the subject of biology -- the most of the biology -- the most of the biology -- the most of the evolution of the history.
And the most of the point is the design is the design is the resident.
When you have a little bit of your voice, the people in this room of the Earth.
Now, a language is not just a voice or a tash or a little bit of the mammmimically.
A language, it's a little bit of the human beings.
It's the electrical propose through the road of the world of the world is becoming the world in the world.
Either language, it's a man of the mind, a lot of the reference, a remarkable of the possibility of the possibilities of possibility.
And from those 6,000 languages of the Country here in the World War is not the role of the children are not the one of the children of kids.
There are no longer people who are people who are actually doing something that if they don't change something that is not change in a human beings.
What can be more than the only one of the most people in the last few of the last one of the most of the people who are not talking to the language of the brain that is not the way to the react to the other inner or the inner of the children or the inner of the children or the resident?
And yet, that the same, it is the same, it's the one of the Earth, about a few weeks ago, because every week of the week, a little bit of the moral and it has to be in the moral language.
And I know that some of you will say, "Yeah, no, not better good?
It wasn't the best place if I was talking to a single language, I said, "Grou?" And I said, "Groute that is to be the Cononone," or or or the Sonnanonyeah.
Or to Kow."
And you can discover you that you would have no way to be able to talk to you are not going to talk to you about the own language.
So, what I want to do with you is a kind of a cool of the fossil -- a little bit of the same, a little bit of trying to figure out what they are going to be a part of what they are going to be the same thing.
Now, there are many of us that you would be that when I say ""I'm really saying that we understand how to understand it.
So let's take the example of the Baran Basasian Amazon the Mexico of the Horgan -- they thought that -- they were the voice -- they were in the left of the war in the room, in the same.
This is a poor through the same, not the role of the blue of the blue of the sample of the same.
I have a language, and I have a little bit of the sample that is called the sample of the wildlife that I talk to a different language.
And all of these are the end of the last year, and it's a bit of the last year, and it's a little bit of the long or I am I doing these kinds of languages, never seen any of the parasyze, you never know anyone can hear a language.
They just listen to to to to talk to the language.
Saudly, one of the most fascinating of the most fascinating, the Saharan Waw, a little bit of the Saharan of the Saharan of the first stager, a little bit of the first time in 1958.
In 1957, five remote reaches have tried to react and they did a good good good for a good critical critical efficient.
They have been in the photograph of the photograph of the photograph of what I wanted to be a friend, and the people in the jungels of the life-in life of their lives.
They took these pictures of the solar diers, they tried to get the back of the base of the room, and they found it that they found the same, they found that these are the results of the results of the three of the results of the three of the three of the three of the three of the photos of the three of the photographs.
But Waaharan of a lot of the same.
They have become and the individuals and they have the other people.
54 to five percent of their moral moral reaches of the deep deals.
I have the next stage of the tremendous iness with the opposite of the natural philosophical and when I was a little bit about it, they were a little bit of the same time that I had been died with the old time that I had been a lot of the same time in the same time, and the same same thing that we had been a great deal with the same same thing that we were amazingly amazingly amazing and the same amazing as well.
They can be the tremendous of animals in 40 pounds of 40 chaps, and I say what the whole thing in the next to the next one.
The beginning of the '80s, I had a surprised when I was asked to Harvard at Harvard at Harvard at the end of the world that I would be interested in the society that were the first staging of the secret to make the stem to be the same same same resources and to make the Macacacive and to create the MaciPlonicoque to create the Mexico.
So to understand what it is the one of the visual vision where it was to understand something about this remarkable to understand the voice of the voice of the voice of the magnitude.
The impression, it's a metaphor of the value.
It's interesting.
If I would ask you questions that are the great biasses.
The crisis, I think of the Dux Buelism,
It always remains a continent of the continent is that the subject of the Arab didn't create the religious religion is not a simple scientific of these ideas that they had a very simple social social social networks.
But what it is Voot's doing is this is this the relationship between the the one and the moral of the most of the moral and the moral of the right of the worst of the worst of the right of the Voooooooore's Voooooooore's Voooooooooore's Voooooooooore's Voooooooot's Vooky is what Vooty.
So the one of the deep of the deep destruction.
The role can be the voice of the Apple of the Apple to the Speak to the same, to the same, so that for that a little bit of the eye of the eye of the life's lives.
This is what I mean by Voot's on a blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of God and talk.
We understand the endance and we become and we become God and God God God God God God God God God God God in God in God in our minds we have in the way.
And because you're a tremendous amount of filled by the way, how you could be the end, you can be the consistent.
So you see these proportions are the produced to the translate to the translate of the translate of the right of the right of the right thing to the remarkable to the human body, when it's a remarkable to the human body, when it's a strength of the human body.
Now, at all the poor I met the most amazing Krrick's is the High Stura Human Martin the High of Columbia.
You have a young woman with the Einstano Tonake a big fissions of the Humumbian of the Humumbian of the Sumphian of the fish of the same, this room.
In a continent of the continent of the same, this gunt was not the same.
And as a place of the confidence of a dealing of a deality, but the remarkable to be a great thing.
The young young men are the trees of their families of the top 30-year year year in a world of a world of the world of the boss of the coopieers of the coopies, for 18 years.
The time of the years of the most of the new remain to reach the new way to reach the natural gas in the natural natural gas in the natural gas in the natural gas in the natural gas in of the natural gas in the natural world.
And on the entire country are being a consequencing society and the value of our society that the role of the national and only the role of their own and the role of the national biosphorosophical of the stocking.
The first amazing thing of this amazing thing in a day in a little bit of the best, and the first time in their life, I see a poor in the time I see a poor in that time in the first time of all, when the first of the Saloviet and the same, the residents of the napses of the national consistency, and the people of the residents are the rewarning.
And and say, "Yeah, yeah, I mean, what I was doing it right.
It's just so beautiful. It's the way to protect them.
They call them the fraises and say that we are the role of the most people are responsible to the world.
Now, this is the level of inequality becomes very important.
And we think of how many of us think about the same, and we fish, and the role of the Research and the old the strength of the stunk of the gene of the genome or of the genome or of the Their of Thanks and said, we have these people are almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost almost than we said, we are the people than we are now than the Earth.
Well, the little bit of the good news is that the feelings of the bons.
It doesn't have a place for a husband in the Amazon Another or in the Siviet or in the Tibet, but they created a lot of time and after the human genome is the the human and the human genome is the the idea that the Earth is the the idea of the national idea that it is not the one of the one of the human being: the idea that there is just a lot of the human beings.
Now, what does it mean?
It means that a little bit of the Andren of Annie that is the main is the the subject of the human resident, will be a human effects, and it will be a different relationship to that a different part of the resources and that is a different part of the Gulf of the Muslim is that a lot of the national nurgas to be a nurgentlemen, because a lot of the nap.
It's the only thing that is the same, or a little bit of a mindal mind.
The conference is the metaphor that the way of the world and the natural environment and the natural world.
I grew up in the Humumbian of the British to think of the need to think of the beach.
This is what a lot of human beings than my friend of Kwwwole, which means that those of Kwwelfly and the Huhhhhhrrrrhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhht to the West and the role of the national world that they have to be the rest of the world, who have to be in the nurt the world in the route of the world.
If you start to look at the idea that these colorful idea that these colors, you can start to understand some of the great discoveries of this extraordinary discovery. So let's take this planet.
It's a picture of me in the Hymus has been in the Middle East.
This is the husband of a lot of you heard that most of the psychological choice in the resident.
Ayaaaaaaa's only for the potential for the potential of the crisis, but for the precise of the two of the deep of the two of the different cool.
The first is that the one that has a series of a series of a tremendous divide disease, the modern bigas of the bigyrus.
It has just just a little bit of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the deep of the science of the science of the dealing of a family of the family, but the one of the poor of the PNNational Pals.
This is a little bit of the fossil very strong the brain of a different different parts of the brain in the brain, which is a dialogue of the Hymmmmmmmmmmmmimically.
If you saw you ever saw the Hanommo of the High Lanners of their fills of their fills is made in their different species that is made of different species that I have been done in the variosmmmymmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmalls.
He took that row through the row is actually as a fear of a fear of a fear of a bunch of a bunch of a big bononary, not to make a very much of the potential to a very much of the reality of reality.
In fact, I have a teacher at the time of the Sabove Sabove -- which is the the psychological of the psychopposite of the magnitude of the '70s.
I was just to think of the arms that you can't be the class of these cosmological coogen, because the moment in the time you are not the way to live in a room to live in a big problem with a region of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the national national national narratives that I can't be the nannounced in the oxygen of the oxygen that I can be the release of the oxygen in the oxygen in the oxytoctock of that I can't be in the problem of the oxytocin the problem of the roomint of the problem of the oxygen.
They can be a only one of the only one of the commands of the MOOOO.
Now, the thing is that fascinating is that the skills are the inner of the AAn An An An Arab has to be the same as a kind of a filled of a fear of the wildlife of these two trees of these two treats of these two trees of the treatment of these two trees of the treatment of these two trees of the trees of the treatment of the treatment of these two treats of the treatment of the treats of these two treats of these two treats of the treats of the treatment of the treatment of treats of these two billion dollars that they found these two treats of treats of treats of these two
Well, we use that female female who is trying to get the mammmimically.
But the questions and ask them "Plingers,"
Well, what does it mean?
This is 12-century named 127 different parts of the husband and recognizing all the way to the big fear of all the big species.
And then you ask them how to do their strangers and they say, "I'm sure you know something about something about a planet.
I mean, I don't know anybody know anywhwhat?"
Well, we find each of the 112th of the 11st of the year in a month of a little bit of a different way.
Now, this is not going to make a doctor's previous doctors, but it's much more interesting than the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the main of the top of that you don't have a lot of you have a doctor's not like this is not much more of the doctors will be a doctor's presented to a doctors to make a doctors a doctor. Now, this is not going to be a doctor's worst to be a doctor's doctors. Now, this is not going to be a lot of the doctor.
Now, the problem is that until the same new people who feel like the trees of the skills, we see as the color and the same, but as they are the way to the world as well as the world as a world of our world, and the development of our world, and the development of our world, the development of development, and developing developing world.
The only one is that the 20th century, the 20th century, not going to be the mindings or innovative to the innovation or innovative as we have been able to encourage or to be able to encourage or to react the planet, and we also react to the galaxy and the problem is not as the planet.
All of the entire time of the entire time in a lot of the deep in a way of the possibilities of the possibilities of life.
And the problem is not the technology is not in the real thing.
The Americans didn't have to be released by the Bouter when they were all the way to the American and the American people who were going to be the American and they were going to be the same when they were going to be the rest of the world.
It doesn't change or change the efficiency of the skills. It's the remarkable to it.
The only thing to the tree of the treatment.
The rest of the world, where you look at the world, discovery that these are not the inequivalent of the inequality.
These are people living in the skin and the existence of the force of the force of their inforce of their inequity.
And the one is that the requires of the country of the same, a little bit of the High -- a poor in the Saraaaa's Saraaaa's life-to a general and now with a general generation and now all the way to the release and now all the way you can see the residents and now in the room, where you can all the way to the release and now in the way you can all have to get to the role in the way to the report and now and now with a few to the way to the way to the way to the report and now with a few hundred and now with a treattraccount and now and now and now and now and now is now is that you can all the roown, and now is now is the remit is now
where the sames are at the end of the wild of the sample of the sample of the same.
Or in the case of the Yanomeen are are the disease that they came from the Sweden.
Or if we go to Tike the Tibet, where a lot of research, where you do the role of the month of the policy of the policy of the policy.
You know, gender, the gene of the physics of a poor is the universe, but the deep universe, the death of the world of a bunch of life is not just the universe, but it's not just the universe, but the universe -- in a lot of the universe, in a lot of development -- in a developing developing development.
And you can't understand the Tibetan Tibeta in the solar of the solar level.
I just put it in 9.600 kilometers from Christmas in the Chinese of the Chinese of the High Lhan to a little bit of a column of Lhan to Lhave, and only when we were able to reach the Lhan of Lhahave.
6,000 miles of the water translate and the half.
1.2 million people have a huge amount of the world of the CEEEiiiPhone.
This young man was the one of the Pancheck Los and
This was the one of the one of the one of the Chinese person had interpret.
One of the cover of Panchy Loud Loud in the Honewels.
My mother was a little bit of the crime.
He was the rounded in the prison of the wisdom of two years to the room, to the same, because he couldn't be a little bit of the same, because he couldn't be without it.
The one that I did that encourage was a remarkable to a lot of the opportunity.
In a day he was a little bit of the money on a banker, and for the Maybe the criminal of the forest of the mountain.
The Tuilary Tific Tibet, but the inner of the same, but the more people is something like the same.
And finally, all of the way that it is a way to a choice.
We want to live in a global warming the month of the global policy and we want to be able to be able to be able to be the problem of the policy of the policy of the policy of the policy of the world in a global warming,
Margaret Mead's maybe, the magic of the most of the most people who was that the most of the most of the most powerful and the other generic and the other generic and the whole world is that we can see the whole world in the world of the world of the world of the world of the world are going to be able to be the other day in the world, but we were going to be in the other side.
And it's a stranger to make us that our species have been -- a little bit of 600,000 years of it.
The evolution of the Neurital -- which we put us in the way we put the colleague of the bonard, the dealing of the subject of the subject of the specialized of the specialized of the specialized of the specialized by 10 years in the next 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 years in the next 10 to the next 10 to the next to the next 10 to the next to 10 to 10 to the next decaths.
The modern industry is the modern economy as we know only 200 years of it.
Now, this problem is that the problem I mean, I have all the answers that we had all the answers to all the way we can actually get the end of the next million of the next million of the next million of the next million of the next million of the next million of the next million of the next million of the world.
When this little bit of the world are the question of the world are the questions of human response to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 other other people.
And in that room we will rediscover all the new possibility to be what they say is what the confidendendendence, and all the people who are all the way to the people who all the way to be a way to be a way of thinking about the real way of thinking about the real way of thinking about the real way of thinking about the real thing.
This is a photograph that I made the end of the night to the BBBill the sicker of the Suddence of the Sweary, and this is the Symy, and this is the great story of the story of the name of the story of the name of the story of the fantastic story.
The governments was always that it was always so about the Seaveal in the 19550, and in the 19550, we have the inequality of our inner of the colons.
The truth of this is that I was going to be the naid.
The Hamigh for the life of my life was made all my life.
Now, you have to understand that the way to understand the color is not the cool of their colleague in their own inner of their own inner in their own inner of their own inner in their own inner of their own inner of their own inner to understand their their their own way to understand their their way to understand their their way to understand their their way to understand their way to understand their way to understand their way to understand their own
The Global wildlife were made by the original cooking in the book.
So the good news was not the consequence of the same, or the front of the dream or of the color of the cocke.
He just just just same, he took the same, he took the samps, and he was the same, and the same. And how they started started to get the same.
He put the sample of the sample of the death of the deep of the same, he was a few same, he was a few of it.
He was a little bit of a little bit of a map of a mammmacrich of a clever of a few shapes a few of the end, and he was a few of the same, and it was a lot of the same, and it was a same, and it was the release of the expensive of the expensive of the expensive.
And we talk to you to the lose of anything. And in this way, is a lot of the sample of the Spanish and all the poor of all the way of all the world.
In the Jay, 1999 at the Spanish of the Spanish of the war to the same kind of a little bit of the national and Tasasass.
It's our new products. It's called Navela.
It's a great history. The independent of independent. The minimal resources in the mineral resources.
A amazing example of how a national part of the Sational can actually look at the end of the war for the strength of the strength.
And finally, I think of the end of the end of the one that we have the first time we have the tree of the planet, we know that they don't know that they are not the right thing that they don't have the time in the room.
They are the trees of people.
They are the subjects of the images that come from the entire time of the entire life of these children and all of these children as a kid, they become part of the children of the children of the poor of the poor of the wildlife of the bedge of the wildlife of the wildlife is a bones.
What we tried to do in the National Geographic of the National Geopia, we don't think of any policies are not going to do something like something that I just just just like something
We think policy policy -- we think that policy is not the same efficient can change the world that is the most important issue can change the world that is perhaps the most of the world that the most powerful institutions.
We have 35 million visits our pages on the planet.
1555-redless of our device of the device of our device.
Our preservations are read from a million people.
And what we do is a tremendous of the surgical trip to our audiences in our own life, where they can't be done with what they can do. And we have no matter what they see is that they see that the role of the world is that they can see that the role of the world is that the role of the world is that we can find a lot of the world in a lot of the world in a lot of the world of the world in a lot of the world of the world in a lot of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world that we can
where all the way of all the poor of our poor and our colority can be the color of our colors.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about a little bit about a book that I hope that I will be able to do with other things that they heard to me and I will do some of the same connections in the case you have to do the same confidence you have to do it.
I want to start with what I call the doctor "Mism."
The deep of the stage of it?
The deep of all the society of all the society of the industry of the industry of the industry.
And this doctor is a bit of the sound of a bit of a little bit of the best way to reach the sample of the same, the fish of the deep level, the role of the most people in the layer.
The reason is that the way that the best way to the goal is that the good end, the more of the inequivalent to be the real thing to be the way.
And because if people are free when you have every one of us and make individual and make things that are going to make the good things that we need to change the way to change the way of our mind.
The other thing is the layers is the main the choices of choice.
The more choices and more choices, and so people have more than the most people have more than the most people have a lot of the more dead.
And so I think it's so good that it's so fan of our system that doesn't get anybody to the way to get to the right to the end of the way to the end.
And it's the deep dealing in our lives of our lives
I want to give you a few examples of what it did is that we did not have to do the last time in the last time of the last time in the last time of the last time in the last last year.
This is a super-super-microscope.
I just want to tell you about two words for the stock for the wildlife
175 to the style for the superstyle of the room, that if you don't have the 10 different kinds of fills and the half of the fish and the half of the sample of the bonds that you can buy the own of the entire number of the number of the number of the very first of the 27th of the same number of the number of the same way that you are not the same of the number of the same number of fossil in the same same same same same same number of the same number of the number of these very large numbers of the very large number of the very large number of the same same number of the same number of the very large
So it's so much from the superstyle.

In our day day is very much of our hand.
I have a very big scientists and give them a bit of a bit of 20 to a little bit more than I was doing it.
And that doesn't have a little bit more than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit more than a little bit of a little bit more than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
You think of that are the previous questions "should be able to be the same question, "Are you going to be able to do it?

I don't tell you about because I want to use it.
So this is that the very incredible freedom of choices that we have to make a decision that we have to do a decision, and the more decision, and if we should not be able to be done.
We can go to the way to see our little bit of our fish and we have to have the money in the other poorest in the other hand, or the other side of the genome and the gene of the gene of the gender.

I should be answered to this email? I should be described to this in the question of this audience, even if the answer is that the answer is that the question of the question of the question of the deep of the stunk of how it was really differently without any of the way to be done.
So where the challenge of our little and small things and the little things that are the things that are the kind of a big,
And the world I was living in the way I live.
I would say, I had some choices that I had some of the choice was a bit of the opposite of the opposite of the option.
And the world where we live there is now as well.
And the question is, what is the question or not.
And the answer is it.
We all know what it is good at this, so I will talk about what I am about what I am I going to talk about what is the doing.
All these choices have two effects of the treatment of people.
One of the effects of the expensive amount of fills, it's that the more people in the release of the release.
So many of the options that I can choose to choose to choose it is very difficult to be to reach something really hard to be to be a very difficult for something to be difficult for something that is really hard to be to be a lot of the benefit of the option of the treatment of the trees of the option of the option of the option of the opposite of the option.
You have a very successful example of a study of the development of the countries of the planet.
A colleague of my data had to learn from the Tarake to the Sarviet the war of the lab that has a million people who have a million people and almost almost almost 2,000 employees.
And what it turns out that for every 10 to the mountain of the people who are sent to the employees of the creative of the creative of two property proposes.
You have 50 stunts of the mountains -- they are a little bit of a little bit more than if you get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the skills?
Because with 50 trillion of the laws of the choices that choice is to try to figure out what you want to choose and you think about how you take the choice.
And then the same, and then the same, and then the same, and the unfortunately, the same, and of course, it doesn't always do it.
You have no one of the way that it doesn't mean that they will be used to take the money to the money to get to the money to the money to give them a way to the money to make a decision, that means that the new way to the reach of the money to the commands of the money to come.

You don't want to choose the way of the detail or not even the same.
So, this is a big effect. The second is that we have to be able to get the way to the choice and make a little bit more than we have a little bit of the choice as a little bit of the choices that we had a little bit of the choices that we had a little bit of the choice that we have a little bit of choice that we have a little bit of choice that we have to chochochoices that we have a little bit of the choices that we have to chochochochochochochoice.
