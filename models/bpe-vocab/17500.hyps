And the year we got these two divided to demonstrate that the second to show that the most of the most of the most of the last three million years of the last three million years ago, the last two million years of the largest rate of 40-dollar spin the 21.
But this moral theory of this species because the most specific issues because the role of the most of the same.
The police police is a way of the global global world system.
She was the expensive and the contraction of the south of the south of the south of the south of the south of the south of the south of the same.
The next picture of the next picture that I'm going to be a lot of about what happened, at the last 25 years.
Give the same.
And as you can see the blue blue blue.
This is the anesthesis on the streaming of the south of the time.
And it turns out the picture.

And a reason for this incredible "Yaes" is Grozzzlings' worth of the north.
This is a range of anesthesis.
But the volumes are much larger than it is.
This is the Kanga Kanger Sweden, the Grows.
If you want to see how the other people are the most of the other side of the sample is where it is the place where it is the place where it is the place in the same.
These are very much fast.
And the other side of the planet, Antarctica larger than the most most of the planet.
Last ast people in the past, the people have been the same role as the Sweden, the Hallies is the negative of the Antarctica of ancient in the end, the sub-effects of the sub-effects of the Olympic of the past.
This is the equivalent in the big level, as Grows.
The Himalaya, the third of the third of the whole new ways, on the new new new new new new new new new forces, who were born and the hamps.
40 percent of the population of the world's population in the water of the water of these other people in these other miles.
In this case this housing is the surface of the water for this orchest.
The people have been reached by it.
But when it comes to the water and the water and the water water and the water water and the water water up.
In California was a 40-percent of the south of Sir Sanslack of Sierra.
This is the ended, the appropriate.
And the predictions of the predictable.
And the whole world has been a proportion of the dramatically remain the report.
And the same thing that has been a very great role to a great role and the precision of the precision.
four times more of the last 30 years of the '70s of the '70s of the '70s.
This is a huge model of the very unusual model
If you can get in the context of the context of what happens.
In the last five million years we have a 70 million dioxide, in every 24 million of the ocean 24 million of the oceans in the ocean.
The other is going to be with the Pacific Sacidies from the U.S., and every part of the Arab where it is a completely completely completely completely completely new species of the oceans of the ocean.
The biggest because the world of the global world of the global world of global warmings, who repress about 20 percent of the Sardies of the same.
The size is a problem and the best is the most serious issues of the most serious issues.
The United States is one of the other other other other than the United States.
And it was going to build it for more steps for the book.
But we start a change.
Here are the people who have the last years with the same specific specific produced.
Everybody has been a lot of our political to our country.
And the Scientists and the oil and the oil spills of the last billion dollars in the last year, the most of the phenomenon of the most ancient ence.
Remember the dogs is a dozen of what is a rich of ors.
This picture of a picture of something like this.
The COOOver Tencouraging in Tencouraging a billion gall-up planet.
You can be able to see the galls.
This is the one of the two tasks in the precision of the Spanish of Country Country Country Country Country Country
One of the reclimbers of the COOOctober Country to Country was this.
Video: You know, the man with the book, is a shape, and you see you and you see it.
It's from the abundance, and help the economy of the creation of the creation of the creation of the creation of the creation of the creation of the creator.
Frosty, the man with the book, it becomes more seem than the more time.
It's also a lot of the workers and the workers of the workers of the wildlife
The second is the insurance of the Virginia Virginial Vestinistry.
The most of the most of the main Massessed Massessed of Massy of the Massy of the south of the same.
Video: Don Blan: I want to be cloud. I want to be the Pose, Sanny Possy Reijing Reijing.
The Gore: So as Aliza CEthiopia CEastern campus.
This is one of them from one of them in one of them.
Video: The COLALi we see our climate change, we see a very serious amount of business.
And that really really really our main is to spend a lot of money for the public public forward, we have the real way to help us understand our good charge.
The point is the south of the books don't die is not did.
We think it's a -- and the mixed and lasty and so on.
So you don't get the climate change.
You know, we find that in our work.
Video: I mean, you know, you heard a map of it.
So you can do a lot of this kind of a crisis of a customer of the cartoons.
Dasically, Masasia is about the gypt.
But this is the name of technology is the same.
And as a little bit of the main the global global warming global warming-world world world of technology that you see the good technology that you see the technology that you see here.
About is to be with this technology to be a little bit of the technology of the book.
The second one is the end, the extensive, the more of the challenge of the challenge of the problem.
Video: Narzen in the U.S., the economic economic economic growth of climate change.
The thing that is the end, the price of the common, the commons on the sub-proper metapon: the good one:
But now we have a new solution to the new solution to the receiver to the initial hour of the inition.
Rechanical economy with the 100 percent of the money now in 10 years ago.
A hundred years to put it into the third of the narratives and help us to help the world to get to the global global global global warming.
In the end, a solution to help us understand the big solution to help us solve us to get the problem.
Rechanical disease. You get more of the more of it.
Secon: This is the last one.
Video: Yar: It's about the re-risk of the Americans.
One of the most most of the most most of the most of the old committees that the old commandments that we died by our plank: The God is here to our new new new new revealing new revealing new revealing new revealing of the new rings.

Narrator: Rechnology for the action of the action of the action.
The second one of the African is the old size of the African which says, "Yet you go away, go away, go away!"
If you want to go away, you go to the wise.
We need to go ahead and fast.
Thank you very much.
The year I was a TED B.
And I started to go and go to the data about how it works to make this applied this.
So the other than the people who have been here for the other scientists who have been the most of the other scientific experiment that was the most of the 21st century of the 27 kilometers -- Cironic recreation of the universes of the universal reefs of a billion in a century of a half a billion of the country.
It's very very very very exciting.
This is the one of the Geneval Genevis.
I do photograph these meets of the Big Bangs' in the decade.
I work at this name. It is called the ATLATL, Lungeled 400 meters of 22 meters of a 22 meters of ATLATLS projects on the projection of the proportion of the proportion of the proportion of it.
On the 10 hour houses we went to the first time.
And this picture was doing was a picture of ATLAS TLAS TLAS
It caused a whole day to control the room.
It's a picture of the first one of the same species that has been the same kind of the L.C. L, the L.C.
Anyway, when I got to see that 10 hour of the 10 hour of the narrative of what is a huge successful of the earlier.
I don't know if this was the largest est policy went on on the screen and you go on the front of the first page.
I mean, I realized that I had a cultural impact on the street.
And after a little bit of a stage with a problem with the same thing that was actually done with these days.
Those are a 13 thousands of other thousands of other thousands of people are going to get the power of the power of the power of the power of the mountain.
Now, engineers from these days, and we can be improvement and improvement and improvement of the endemand of the mix."
But I can do that when I'm in the temperatures become the temperatures and what they call the super-stage of the superstic state.
So as 27, a 27-year-old degree of the people can be transported by these people can be comfortable to the pattern.
In one of the most of the people in the 9,000 magnitude of the L.C.
So the Sweden, and the people have a few thousands of among thousands of other thousands of other thousands of miles of electricity.
This was the result of the results.
This is the more unprecedented as a magnetic amount of than 20 to 20 tour and have been able to be 30 accounted to 30 act.
So we have the same thing I have about 50 magnetic magnetic magnetic than 50 magic.
I had to go to the hit and I did it.
I reconted all of the way we receive.
And we go to the magnetic ender.
The one of the SA of the LLLLCCCs will be as new as new as a new new new new eats.
We're going to take a lot of us and we can get to get a data or to get the data and we will continue to go to the universal for the universal talent to the universe.
Now, of course, the actors of those actors of the concrete of the important things about the important thing to do is the efficient to the high-effect. It's been able to reach it.
I think that the fact that the fact that we have a way of the fact that we have a important thing.
I will go to the word a words of the Britanic scientific scientific methanic, I think when I think about the experiments of the experiments of the experiments of the revealed to the revealed for the revealed of the red, "No more unexpected, they are not more unexpected to our minds are not the end of our narrangements as we don't have the inequality, and as our refinite of our reference and the world as our revealing and the world are not as we don't even more of our own income.
Thank you.
I want to go with the ladied to remember my childhood, when you play you play with the dogs of the same.
And you can invite what you invite to get to the south and get them to the state, you actually know how to get the problems of the other people who are to be able to be able to get the problem.
The action of the deep is the layer of how we understand a lot of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world is the retire's desire of the desire of the desire of the deep-generation of the desire of the detailed the world of the way we understand
So in the way of reading the RIT of the consisted by our interacting with our physical objects -- impressed with our physical objects -- my Patatan Arab Sevapy Kalani -- I started to go to a -- what I would get to a very very much more and more of the more of the narrative to a very very very very uncomfortable to make a lot of the magnetic place, if we can make a mass a little bit of the magnitude and a little bit of the magical information that we can we can actually take a whole new information that we get to be a whole new information of this new information of information that we can we can we can we use to do this kind of this is a whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole
She's a load of what we want to do we want to do it?
The question was the question of the fascinated by the testing we asked the question of the Shave's red,
And the short Shavet Srenttttttttttttle.
They can be received to be able to be performing the properties, and they have a radio of the space and have a radio of a national relationship to a version of a device.
The most important is that I'm a rich of the games of your games of games you can just get the water.
And Shey reveals we have a new new device of devices,
And the main the main is more of their own initial values of their own national nations. The other other inequality, and the other inequality, and we can start to explore our own and we can start to explore the interaction of our interaction and acact.
I will start with a simple example.
This Sheel is conclusion, and if you include the image, and if you include the mountains a filter of the other words, if you include the other hand.
These trees are the connected to one other other other other other other people are a other other people
So if I give them one more interesting to the other places.
If I think they're going to be able to see it, and I can get a little conclusion.
I can also feel the inclining and the inclinic.
We realized that one of the different kinds of interactions of interacting is like we can use the games of the games of the data, how we would be a color and we would be a colony and a gonna a and a solar a library and a hydrogen and a solar of the people we have a collapse.
In this case, we have three of the Shey of your guns and can use them and make them bon-the-inner in the center of the center, where they will be revealing the center of the center.
If we can get too much more and we can get a little bit of the end.
There are also a possibility for education, like the mathematical possibilities and mathematical mathematical language, and the mathematical way we want to have the possibility of the same things that are very much and see the same results.
So this is a ronic ronic of the Kanga simple program that make a simple program of equality.
Here we have a game game is a kind of a very combined by Scrabababs and Bob Scrabs and Boston.
So every single one of the first steps was in the intimate of Shair, and the mountains of the worst of the worst of the worst of the worst of the worst of the mysterial revolution.
And then after 30 seconds of the 30 seconds of the reveals and a new new data and we have a new new new set of new new ways of resisting new ways of recovering and reintuition,
Thank you.
This is the nest, the people who came to the Laboratory of the Laboratory and I asked them to go to the mountains to the mountain.
It was a lot.
And one of the things that kind of interesting things is that the applied people to have a lot of people who are not to get a lot of people who are not going to be able to do with a lot of people
I all need to be "From the words, and they know exactly what I want to do it.
Here are people who are the people who are trying to get it.
This is the most of our ancient -- the right right right right right now.
It turns out that everything else wanted to do was to do was a Sheel in one of the other hands of the other hands of the other.
So for him was only a little bit of a house.
This is a device of animated animal.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who invest in the neuron.
And this is French is French
He can show us new person, just by the mountains of those Street Swey who are a personal person.
Here it is the replication.
Video: The Western income
David Merrill: Now I just put a traction in the space.
Video: Tring: Tringly the wast.
Very of of course yeah.
When Sheussian and the same, the wind and the same, the can make a personal can make a personal charge.
DM: DM: I think the narrative.
Video: Yeah.
DM: DIt's a story with the explain, and he will decide how to be the same.
Video: Yes, the war --
DM: DM: Ul, the example I would take a instrument and interpretation and interinterpretation that we built the museum that we built the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the rich and all the range of the other example of the other example of the other example of the other example of the other people would
Each two different species of different variations that you want to use them to use it.
And you can get the other successful of the success of the success of the south of the same thing.
The sounds like the people are the Sheush Sheel Sington of a successful of success.
There are the effects you can see the war can be reverse-reverse-reversed.
You see it in a certain point of them and then including the people to help them get to help them get to help them out.
The next general effects like the south and the volumes that are the High-hour Hall of the His to see the Hall you see it.
Tide: DM: DM: DP's started a second Swey the two of the successful of the successful of a serious serious serious serious seriously.
Now I now put a line.
Video: DM: Now I add a little bit.
Video: And now I'm going to add the whole of the mountains to control the effect of the same.
Video: DM: DPS can be the inclinical trial to a part of a or other or something.
Video: DM: Now I'm going to be able to be more expensive for more expression.
Video: DM: DPS can do it in the time of time when it comes to the time
So I don't have to do the planet, the pre-time or improvisation, the prevent or a short or a short of house.
Now, the end of the dogs can be able to use the Sheush of Sheheheheat at at the bottles.
Thank you.
As you see the passion is the creation of new interfaces that are the right way that they are the right way to our brain.
And we had to show you a covered cooker of this new new new idea, and of course the possibility of the possibility that I try to get out of the layer in the lawyer of the layer.
The guy who wants to retiny is like we're in the lab is as a new new interactions of the new interaction with the most of the world's world's world's layer in our world of our own own rules in our world of our own rules in our world of our rules of our rules of our rules of our own rules.
Thank you very much.
This is the emergency of you are all going to be all of you to all of you are all going to be all of you to be all of you with you.
I am writing it.
He describes it is my teacher -- but of course, more exciting.
It's all my mother, and I was really fascinated with a position.
And I don't don't think that this is going to be able to change it.
But this is what I was like, something like this is my favorite and my career and my career who was doing me to go to the workforce and the workers and the workfor.
And the thing I was like this book, this phenomenon of biography, the Roag, I, I, Iraq, Ivent-Ragement, the way to the world of the world of the world of the world of the world that kind of a world that kind of a very important thing, and it became this kind of a very important position, and the international concrete of the international international international concrete to a very important that the crete of the international conference of the international consistent of the international consistent of the international park.
The theater is like the theater where people are the conclusions of the part,
Seranic -- the congest, the convicted of it.
Very of example, and you say, "You don't you know what you do? You don't want to be more of the more you can be more of the passwords, you can be more of the password?
You don't look at the same time you will go to the south of the south of the world that you ever get a book that goes on the world that always go to the world this world is the world that always do?"
It's very very line.
But it was more like to be a lot of you haven't been able to get the same time when I was a lot of people -- like I was a load, like I want to become a confronted by the same kind of a kind of like the African response of the African reaction of the size of a kind of a kind of like the African response of the African response of the Africa.
And people say, "No one of the one of you don't have any of the success?"
I don't know that the door you get the points of the idea,
You don't know that you're going to work in this field of the field of this country, and nothing will be in here and a morning here and a picture of a Dab is the end, and the endemic of the same, and the south of the same,
Something that is the kind of like this.
The answer -- the answer to all those questions is """Yes."
Yes, you know, it's the other things.
And I always always hit me.
And you think it's the one of the other things that people are not able to get the other things that we can't be intuitive.
As a great example of the great design, and other things that are crossing.
But when I was talking about the work I was all the other question, and I said, "Why is we do is "Why is the last time of the last on?"
Is this something like a ration?
It's a lot, as anyone to be able to be able to be able to do this as a little as a Pame.
And what is the specific of the specific approximately we have the truths of the inner of the health of the health of the health of the health of the more teaching in a kind of a teacher who don't do a a lot of the teaching of the more teachers in a human being?
I was a very example, for example, was a engineer and not the immune of engineering as a chemical engineer of engineering a chemical engineer of a neural engineer is a engineer of a engineer and a engineer of a engineer chemists.
It doesn't happen, how John, how does it go to the chemicals?
It's not just happened.
But as we are the more of the chemical engineers like the group of not too much of the remarkable to be the other inner of being alcocools of the presentation of the presentation.
We write the income -- we have this remarkably received to the other people who have been a good kind of like this remarkable to be very powerful as it was a strong strange of the remarkable to be very powerful and the more unable to be a strange of the remarkable to be better at the end.
And we all have to look at the numbers of the named the morning in the 20th century in the 20th century of the magnitude of the magnitude and the reveals that have died and revealed the own of the own corner.
And even those who don't have the own wide, the whole wild of the right right of their own lives.
Every Norman in the last night, in the last time that the first interview, he said, "Eastern one of my book, he said, "You get a little more of the do."
A great great great great thing about a whole thing.
But not the acactive when we hear anyone in the case because we heard this things like this, because I heard about all of things that we have been able to encouraged and accountless and the action of the cold and the inequality of the consequences of the ence, the confidence of the enemy of the end.
And the question I want to do that I want to be all of this is here with this kind of a perspective, you can see this ide?
You can get the comfortable -- because because as you see the eyes of the eyes of the eyes of this pocket -- I don't see this pocket.
I think it's like okay.
And I also think it's like it is the persuasion of the future of the future of the future of the future.
I think it's better if we encourage to the artistic artistic to the artistic to the state.
And I know that in my case, in my case, in my situation -- would be very dangerous for me to go to my career in the book, the sweating, especially in the book, especially in the case of this is a serious and in the case of the circumstances.
As a little bit of a 4-year-old men, we just have a decade of 40 years.
I would probably be able to be four decades.
And it's very very likely that I will write with this moment of the nine of the work that work that work as the work that I came up with the last few days, right?
What would be a little bit of a crack of the most of the people here are very likely that is that the largest successful of being happened.
Oh, God God, what I am yeah.
This is the kind of a way that could do anybody in the end of the lack of the lack of the time that the person person to go to that person
I mean, I will go to the right message that you love it.
And then, the question is, "Look at it?
And so I go to a lot of my daughter that you need to work now, to go back now, to go to the conversation, is through the product of the productive, is the way to make a produced biodiversity of the protection of the protection of the protection of the protection of the protection of the protection of me and so on.
I had a way to find a way to get a very important way to be a very distant concept that my father and my father who written up to what I'm going to be now in what it will be able to explain what I was going to write what it is.
And as we all have a year in the last year we started to go to the time, and I asked them to find other society, and I could have to be better and more and more and more inhabit more and more insects of our people to be better and more health care about how to make people like the more emotional wisdom of our emotional reference.
The reason I went to the Great Romer and Romana.
So you know, the action of the details.
But I was the way to Romantic and Romantic and I thought that the creation of the people who have the creative of the way of the human being?
People thought that the creative of the creative common, and people who are hurt on a way of people and the unintelligence and the unintelligence and the unintelligence and the unintelligence and the unintelligence and the intelligence.
The numbers called these "the deeply of the dealing of the death of the term of the term of ""proce."
Scrypes was the very deep that has a demand that it has a demand the deep of the department of the department of the department.
Romers were the same pattern, but they called the active accountless actical creature,
What is wonderful because the HHer has not a genius thought a genius was a individual individual academic.
They think that a genius was a kind of a magnetic gene of the divide of the red, a kind of a journey of artistic in a kind of like Dobbley, which is the remarkable and the re-ended conted confidence of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the workers of the work of the work of the work of the workers
Absoldiers -- this is the important thing about the effect of the effect of the evolution that building -- that building the same thing that has the same results.
And all the world as it turns out that it is right.
So the artistic was protected by certain things like this, for example, so much more narrative, right?
If the work was the very strange of the whole thing you could be the right right to me, all the way that the world as the way that the genius that genius has helped us to make it.
If the work was critical critical trianger, it was completely completely uncomfortable to be completely wrong, right?
All the world as the genes were something about it.
And they were looking at the TV for a long time.
And then I came up with the same change, and everything is a very big idea, the idea of the idea of the most people are going to take the environment in the center of all the way to all the way to be the most of the new places.
It was the human beings, and people have started to create the credit as the creates of the creation of the individual growth in the individual house.
And the first one of the people have been trying to tell you to make one of the artistic or the genes of the human beings.
And I have to have a huge spinal of the error of the error of the error of it.
If you get a simple person to create a simple person or the received or the receptor is actually the received and the insurance of the mysterial and the inner of the myth of the myth of the disease of the psychic responsibility is a little more responsibility of the psychic possibility of the disease of the psychic of the disease.
It's like you you would have to be able to get the tunning.
It's just the indoor and the reforms of the reforms of these reported all these reported requiring insecure.
I think that the press of the last 500 years of the last 500 years.
And if I really think that is the truth, I think of the question is, what we do we make it acts do?
Can we do things different?
You can go to the most old people are the most old people and the creative of the creative relationship of the creative of the creative relationship of the creative of the creative relationship.
You can not.
Maybe we can't just take the 100 years of human human being-the-the-minute talked a year of 18 minutes.
And you probably have the public public of people who would be able to ask us to ask us to be the layer that are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are all the projects of the projects of the projects of the projects and all the projects and all the whole projects and all the other projects.
I mean, you don't want to be covered to the cover this idea.
But the question I want to give you a -- why don't I want to ask you it?
Why don't we think we don't think about that?
Because it has a lot of the kind of a kind of more than anyone in the way of looking at the same time, the remarkable process.
And the reason why anyone who was trying to create something -- the same kind of like -- you know, as you know, as it doesn't really make it behavior.
And so it turns out that sometimes can fit the right right right of the narrative.
I had a lot of the endless we know the American American American Rutch Mr. Stone, who has been in the jails that was in the hurt of the East and that was the story and that when he was a story when he was the one one one who was going to work and I just feel a little bit of the road and I feel a little bit of the roof the roof the roof the road and I feel a little bit of the road and I feel a little bit of the roof the roof the road and I have a little road to work and I have a little road to work and I have a little bit of the road to work and I
The West as a south of the near of the near of the narrative.
And it was the south of the road room.
I think the symphony to you get the blaming on the legs.
And that moment is the one thing that has been doing is a single one of the other words, "bad."
And you go to the housing to the housing of the houses of the star idea, and a little bit of a map of the map of the map of the south of the cross and a little bit of the south of the map.
Sometimes it was not enough enough to be a lot of the people and the other, but they don't get the house, but the poor the poor the wild and the poor the poor the war and the other road and the other road up to the other road on the other roads of the other lamong the other poorest of the other pounds of the other lampones.
They were also the time -- and this is not a one of the one -- the moment that the story of the one more likely to be the right right right now.
Also, the man at the main the main and the south of the treatment and the south of the south of the other hand, and the story of the other other hands and the other other other other than the other other other other other than the other other other other other other other other than the other other other than the other other other her.
The cover of the code and the cover the cooking and then the coral proposes what you can be a map of the main the maybe,
So in this situation, the more of the mountain and the last one of the last time of the last word.
When I was a revanced -- it's exactly how it works the way that works is exactly how my creative process.
And my favorite creatures not the reducing -- I'm not the do."
I am a lot of the work that work and I get to the same day and I want to get the same and you can see and see it and look at the same time.
But even though I was in my hand, even I was able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be even worth of the phenomenon.
And I am a lot of you have been in a lot of you know.
I had been a project or the ideas that were the new way of the design of a survey of the way we don't know it.
And what is the beginning, right?
And how we should be able to require us to be able to go to the mind, we don't want to help us do not make us want?
For me, the most of our species of our day we have about how we can do is the musicians have a musician in the Wab -- the Wab and the re-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-relevant example of the most of the rest of us of us of me,
I was going to be about this and all of the way we were all the way of the private of the artistic artistic contemporary artistic and and see it and the ended, and they would be able to see these immune reducing require the very range of effects of the reducing of the resion.
And the time the south of the time, and the immediately the story of the Los Angeles and then everything happened.
As a result of a short of a short of a short housing and the magnetic and the magnetic and the magnetic and the magnetic and a little bit of a consequence, but it doesn't have a little bit like a lovely like a lot.
It doesn't have no champions, not the report, not report.
The concept that all the anxiety of the anxiety in the moment and the same, and the south of a money.
I'm not good enough to revealing a good to reve."
And in the place in the water, just like it was just like a husbe.
He was the same path and the same thing with everything with everything with everything with it.
He was the south and said, ""You don't see it is the volan?"
"You see it as a little as a trick of the dog?
If you want to be true, you go to a moment in a moment when I can get a little bit of your youth.
If you go and see it and the same.
You can get the blue of Leonardo Khens."
The process of the process has changed the way it changed this back to this.
It doesn't actually reduce the end of the way that it was all the way to be unexpected.
But the process of being able to be the same and the end, it was the time in the moment that the way that the rush of the genuine and just because he was just the same unknown as a as a as a as I finished to go to the China.
It could be this collaborative and the colleagues and the south of a conversation in the external external external and the Ted.
And after I heard the story of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
This approach me to be the most of the voice of the voice of the Antarctica, Iventh and I have a kind of -- and I had been in a way that I was not a concept when I was not a consequencing and a consequencing to think that it will be a conclusion of this is a proposing one of the key to be a concrete to be a conclusion of the end of this is a conclusion of a writer to be a consequencent to be a concept of the most of the sub-like this is a
Not just not just this is the most proceeded it.
I think we should be just like we should just be able to reach the project.
And then I remember my GDP I am and I asked the open, and I asked it.
I went to the way to go and I add and I add a collection of the cameras a cameras a campaign in the cameras
I told you what I said, "You know, I love and I love and you can see if this guy who is not going to be really very very very easily to be just like my husband and my one?
Because you can see one of the people I have to see one of the things I have to be a more of a not a lot of not to be not.
So if you want to be better at it, you need to do you get the same thing.
Oh, if you don't do that, you know, to do this with the naid and all of it.
A whole continent to me because this is what I think is the message of it.
And I want to consensus to me today I did my point of the third of the hous."
Because the Doug is -- the hundreds of years ago, with the North Africans and the North Africans are not going to be able to get the south and the music, and the music, and the musical and the music, and the same, and the war to the waste.
And they were all very beautiful to the Western intrigues and were remarkable and they were the right correctable, right?
But sometimes it is a very rate, and one of the interview, and one of the real community.
I am sure you all know what you think about what you think about the time you all like this in a certain point, so much of the interpretation of the interpretation.
It's like the time that the time and the same, the more convicted in a kind of a different kind of a different shaped by the other 1,000 of the other 1,000 of the other 1,000 of the other two of the other two of the other two of them are being in the other two of them are like the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time is the time of the time.
Again, it doesn't be in the same way.
It's the list of the south of the south of the south of the south of the nation.
And as I was going to be able to be what they were called the "and they say,
And the impressed and they were received and they said, "Allinglessons Allam," Allames, YYYYYes, God, God, God, God Gam."
It's God up.
A lot of the history of the history of the Spanish of Spanish Spanish Spanish has been translated with this and the same, they took the way to the Anlayyy; Huh, yloa."
and I hear the time in the time and the south of the south and the south of the south of the soup.
In September of a pre-intervented interface, and the mountains and All, Allayer, Allayer, Allayer, Allayer Anlayyy."
The other is -- a little bit of God God God God God's Gody.
It's wonderful for us to do something like this.
But the second day is the second day when the end of the end of the same, and discovered that is the great and the conclusion is not a little bit more and it's not a range of the Arab St.
It's a diet that is a ganging and that can be more and more and more can be more and more and more and more and more and more inalone.
Can you want to be more to the voice the name of the Domas you can do it be the same as we should be able to do with the rest of the rest of the list of life.
It's hard.
It's one of the most of the most deeper in the parties of creative creature.
But maybe not a big chance to be a big filled by the beginning, like the most amazing part, as the most amazing interests of the most amazing thing to go to the south of the south of the south of the south of the south of the door.
If you just think if you just like it was immense of a conclusion of the points of the points of the next to the next next to the next to the next day when it was a whole bunch of other words, when when they were sadly.
If we think about it, it all is what it is happening to change.
I started thinking about it, and I thought and I was really the last month of the last month is going to be the very unexpected of the expensive, unless than my reputation and cross the same, and the cross of my success of my success.
And what I was doing is what I do is the south of the tape, you don't know you know, you don't know.
It doesn't be a lot. You know, just look at the right of the Contin, you can do it.
If you look at the skin the way of not.
If the gene of the human genuine and the expensive, and the ended, even for a very deep and a very unfor, even for a south of the force of the force of the forces of the force of the force of the gen.
And if you don't know anyone else to anything.
And with all of these these guys for you.
I think that we should be able to prevent them.
"Oh yeah, you just like you have a love for a love, and the infinite of the endemic and the end.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I talked about some of these projects of these projects of the genomes of the human genome, and the discoveries of new new new genes.
Now we start a new new new idea, we designed the biological perspective, and now we're trying to get to the new new theory of the digital disorders and to go into a new phenomenon of life.
We tried to put all the questions of us questions.
"What is life life is something I think I think that many biologists tried to understand the variety of different levels.
We tried to take different approaches to the different kinds of data from the process.
We are already about 20 years.
When I was the genomine of the genomic of the world of the world in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world.
Now let's try to ask you to ask the regeneration, or can we create new forces of life, this really digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital dial?
This is the main an organ, Mycohams that the most genes that has the most genes that can replug the only one that can replant in the layer in the layer layer in the layer of this is the layer of a crisis.
We tried to see if we can go to a genic genome.
We were able to get the number of genes in the way of the genes in the roof the way that are there.
But when we look at the main the main the main is pretty simple, it's pretty simple.
I think that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can get the first time to a little bit of a time that to be a little bit of a cell.
So we decided that the only way we actually actually want to be able to look at this cross-grade so that we can actually get the same thing that we can be the most fundamental questions to the most fundamental questions.
And so I started on the road the cross of the cross of the cross of the cross of the cross of the cross of the cross of the cross of the room?
Maybe the chemical allows these molecules that we never done before?
And if we can actually a cross a cross of the cros?
A range of the cross is just a chemical trial.
So our approach to the digital life is the rich of the ritual rate.
Our ability to write the cover the road is the beginning, but it was very beginning.
The last one of the end of the consequence.
I started this about 15 years ago.
I went through a few of the end, in fact, in fact, with a terrorism before it makes the first experiments that I was the first experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to it.
There are a million cars of the world that make little DNA little DNA, much more than 50 miles to 50 miles a little bit of a generation process, but it's a generation of a generation of a more generic general disease more than the more people are more than the more active of the more of the world --
So we had to create a new way to make these little bit new ways of making these little tour and the right right right to the right of the tasks.
This was our first step, the first of the digital information from information to the digital human genomes of the Ph.D.
It's a virus that genome.
I did this design, we went through the right right right to the right right now with a molecular molecular molecular ar molecular ar ar ar ar molecular ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar systems.
The interesting thing I did when I took this amazing chemical materials and I got to go into the bacteria and bacteria started looking at this code cover the genetic code, and the back.
The virus were able to release in the cells and they were replaced and they were going to go to El.
I would have to be the oil of the oil and say, they were very cloud and say,
They have the rights more than you vote.
And so we think this is a situation where the GGGod can build the mazed system.
But we wanted to do something more bigger.
We wanted to build the whole cross of a bacteria of a bacteria of a bacteria
This is over 5,000 feet of the code of the cover covered by the cooking of the code.
So we got to put the war in the road of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the cells that are the same patterns that are the treatment of a cells.
And the reason is critical critical and if you start with the digital computer, that information has to be very uncomfortable to be very uncomfortable.
When I was the first century of this gender gene in 1995, the arrow was a 10,000 of the reported of a 10,000 of the steps of the war to the bottles of the tom-up the first century of it.
I found out in the reference, 30 to the rors. If we had to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be effected.
The design is the projection of the 50 miles of the 50 kilometers that we need to take all the other other things that we have to build 50 gall-up to build a little bit more than we are the very small of the other people are able to be a lot of the other people are being able to be a lot of the other people are being a lot of other people with a few other people are being able to be a lot of the other people are going to be a few more
We are reach to be a lot of resistance.
You can read that we put it on the streaming of the wild; we have a cover cover the dogs of four kings, and T.
Tries from those people -- those people are about 20 minutes of a 20 minutes -- one one one of the one of the endemic accountless actired accountless acidid.
So we can use the cover to write the word word "theaty, propositive.
I had been able to do was to hear the cover the cocking.
Some of them were unrevealed that it's not the poetry is not the poorest of them.
We designed those things that we can be the same as we can be with the enzles.
I am assumed that they reached them.
So we started doing the gentlemen, start with five of them to 7,000 feet tape, the right to do these two miles of a 24,000 miles of these miles of these lawyers from these layers to 700 miles from 700s.
Each of the migration of these things that are the abundant to get the second to make them a very range of a very range of the process of trying to make a very minimum of a very mind.
We try to get to get to the automobile of the automobile
So this shows that a re-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-
When we go to the very big from 100,000 pounds of the war not so much more creative than Egypes.
They are all the other molecules of the molecular molecular biology.
So we got to other hang in other hand.
I knew that there's a mechanical mechanisms that has the combined of biology using DNA that DNA that is called DNA, and which is the DNA and which is the same thing.
This is a example.
There are a called the the Sincockrogs that can be the oil spills of radiation.
As you see in the air, cross is the deep is the deep is the same.
12 hours to 24 hours later, he took us to the new lawyer as a little as a little as it was a little bit like the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be applied all of it.
I can live in the light.
I am really sure that life can be able to be in the expensive space, to go to the right environment to get a new environment in a new environment.
In fact, the ASA showed that this is the right there.
Here is a micro-divide micro-called the molecules that we actually use it to make these intrigues using the drug diet with the skydies that we put the skin that we put the skin.
Drrog reached the automatically automatically automatically
This is not a little picture of a microscope with electronic devastating microphones, but a microphone-hydrogen disorder.
It's so a kind of a molecular molecular that we can see with a microscope.
These are the collects of a year about six seconds.
This is a public public that we had a little time.
These are over 5,000 of the elephant cover the genetic code.
It's the most molecular molecules that we ever have a structure.
It has a number of miles from the 300 million dollars.
If we take a 10 and a 10 and no space and without any any any other pages to be able to be a lot of the genetic cover of the genetic code.
So how do we get a cross of the cross of the cros?
Again, with a very good virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated than the bacteria with back.
Estate, you also see when you get to the nuclear r like the nuclear and you can put it on the nuclear and give you a something that you all heard about -- it's a something you all heard --
And the bacteria is the cross is built in the cells is built in the cells of the cells that we can make a completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely different from a whole cellular cells, and we can make a whole cells, and we can activate it.
I got a lot of the species of a species of the species of the microbial microbial ality.
Those are about the same as people as people and the people and the people and the people and the people and the people
We added a few genes in the gangs we can get to the pattern.
I have to go to the enzing of all the protein.
And it was pretty amazing, when we put in the cells -- you will reach our very star -- and the cross -- and the cross -- and the cross of the cells in the cells and the cells in the cells of the cells in the cell.
In fact, we thought that this is how much we had to go and we tried to design the process of something more and we tried to design the process.
This is a huge amount of evolution of evolution.
We are all the species that have been a second species that have a second second cross-mile, or a third of the other things in the other new new new new disorders, thousands of new new new new characteristics of new book, thousands of new books in a second.
So the people who are just a single gene of evolution is a moment in a moment of biological moment in biology.
I am assumed the restrict of restrict DNA.
The CHHH: The genomes not a cell.
The philosopher, the cross we put --
It was the exposed and the other cross like the other cross like the other materials like the new material like the new genome, and so we got the new genomes of the new genuine of the new genes of the new phosphere,
It became blue because we put in the genuine that we put in the cross-cross-genuis.
And after a very short time of time, all the characteristics of a species have been trying to do with a new species have been a new new species that we put in the world in the world that we put in the cells that we put in the cells that we put in the cells that we put in the cell.
All the proteins have been changing, the members -- when we have been changing, is exactly what we transform the genetic cover is exactly what we transfertilized.
This can sound like the chemistry of the genome, but we can actually change the same thing to change things that really really is the same thing.
Now, I have no one of the genes of the projects of three billion years and a half years and we reach that can be able to create a new version of the new version of the World Bank is a new version of the World Bank is a new specific specific resisted new specific resisted a new species of project.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obvious about the opportunity of the need of the need of the need of the need of the need of the need of the need of the need of the need of the need of the need of a very obvious thing.
We're going to go to the seven billion people in the new species of people in 40 years.
And I give this in the context for me to me in 1946.
Now I'm three people are three of us in the 1946, in 40 years of the years will be four, they will be four.
We have the problems of the disease of the water and the drug dramatically a billion and half billion and a half billion and a half and a half billion and a half and a billion and a half a billion and a half and a half a billion and a half a billion and we have the problems of the wild problem,
It will be difficult to do it for us.
We are in five billion of the book, more than 30 billion of the airplane.
This is a hundred million steps on the day.
When we try to think about the proper biological processes or any of the process that will be a challenge.
And then of course, the O2 in this material that's the atmosphere, which is the atmosphere.
Now, in our discoveries of our world, we have a data of the world, and I love to think about 20 million genes, and I love to think about this process of designing designing the process of the future.
The electronic electronic has just a drink, or this is so something like this, or this evolution of the diversity that has been in this kind of a thing.
We are the first here, in the first time, and our imagination of our imagination and imagination.
We now have a techniques of these kinds of things that we call what we call what we call what we call the genimiconic genocide genocide.
We have the ability to build a big robot that will make a million cross on the street.
When you think of the 20-gene 20 million genes or try to optimize the proper proposing to produce the properties of the hyplant diseases, and the product of the last 20 years of the last 20 years, we can actually change more molecular than the last 20 years of the world's world's world's problems in the last 20 years of the other years of the other countries of the problems of the world's world's problems than the last 20 years,
And this is just the equivalent.
We can measure the production of chemical products or disease or commercial diseases, producing the disease of the citizens.
This is a way of an design of a design design design that we work in order to work and work and work to work and work in the computers in the computers in the computer.
You know, we don't know how to show you what it will show you what it will happen.
We know exactly how their genetic code.
Now we go on the commons to the fourth generation.
You saw the Swedens of the mirror is just a real experiment that was a real experiment
We have the generation of the generation of the two and the third of the third of the common, which are the more valuable to commercial value of the variety of the variety of different tape.
But the only way we think that the biology can have a huge impact of the product of the product and the flight is if we start with the CO2 is the CO2 is the CO2 is the first steps to design this point, and we think that we can have the first two percent of the generation of the 18 months of the generation of the generation of the 18 months of the generation of the age of the 18 months of the generation of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the 1850-
The solar and CO2 is a way of our discoveries of our world, but in the world have all kinds of other ways we have all the different ways of the world of the world have all the way of the world have all the way of our world have all the way of our solar and the wild the solar and the CO2 is a world of the O2 is a way of the O2 is a way of our O2 is a number of the way we have all the way we have all the way of our own
This is a organism that I had to go to 1996.
It goes into the ocean ocean in the ocean and a half a metaphor and a half of the temperatures of the temperature.
Transform the CO2 use molecular molecular disorders like the surface of energy as a energy as a energy of energy.
We try to see if we can take the CO2 inner spire of the O2 insects that CO2 and conversations in the WO2 to come, to reach this CO2 to reach this properties to this reach this stuff.
So one very short time we think we could be able to do what is the question, "What is life life on the right life?"
We know -- you know, we have the objects of the same chemical process.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED, where in the other parasyze?
And you can get a whole energy to be a energy of energy.
But we also find these things to use to invest these things to invent the same way to invent the whole of the vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of the same thing.
You saw this year with this year and we are always a year and a dollar in the minus when it comes to the right right right now.
I think the situation can be built by the building vaccines of every single ism.
Here's how it could be able to look at the future of change the future of evolution of evolution, the evolution of evolution of evolution with the bacteria with the bacteria and finite the endangerous of the waste.
We are almost to improve people.
Our most of our extend to make us a lot of us that we have a long way to do this. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you the last time is a new new new technology that we had been working on a new technology that we've got to Microsoft about a year about a year about a year about a year ago.
It's a environmental environment that can interact with a lot of data that is the very large data of the data of vision.
We look at a lot of other other people, and the new new new new new new and the right right right right now, receiving the right right now, rescued by this way, rescued anyone else to do it.
I don't really understand how much information is how much information is these big data is about how much the big or how much the big are imagined.
Most of them are doing a digital digital digital campaign on the Bible project is a project of the Bible ACongress has been a Texaggeration of the Congress of the 300 feet methods of the earthquake.
It's not important because the only thing that the only thing that should be the number of biges is the number of biges of the key to a very time a very important thing to be a very very range of an architect. It's a very range of an inflexible architecture.
This is a book of a book of a non-imagination.
It's about "Crushing Steve Dickens. Egypes.
To show you the point is about the text, and I can't do something like something that is a real real real real is a reference of a text is not a picture of a text is not a picture of a positive.
Maybe this is a artificial way to read a electronic book in the form.
I don't want to recome.
This is a more real. It's a more real.
Each of the beginning of a century.
This is really the real real experience of a light-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-average environment.
We did something small and we did something very small with the color of the Sardian of "Gardiante."
We created a very big remain a very larger than any other than any other than any more than any of the recloud -- and I have a confidence.
If you look at this path of this cartoons, you can see here.
Or or other models, or even the specific tech.
And this really is the same kind of a whole range of a monitory of a monitor.
We think that this is the sample of the poor and other other things that -- which is not necessarily necessary to do it.
Of course, the main is one of the applications of the technology of this kind of technology as this.
I won't be a lot of time to tell you a lot of time to tell you the more of this country.
These are all the United States of the United States of the NASA of NASA of NASA of ASA.
Let's go to a whole thing.
This is actually the idea of the Internet acts of the accurate.
This is a project of Posine project that you get two different different technologies. Where is the other different technology. The other other is a wonderful research of a wonderful research of a wonderful research in the field of the Washington Sava I, the I, the US Savagota in Washington of the U.S., the wild of Sex Sava University of Washington Sava C.
And Rick Szzzym-Resl at Certainty.
So this is the active of the Internet, because Seahin Seaby.
You can see that when we create that when we create these perspective, when we can not have this kind of experience in many other places.
But the spending the space of these images of the problem.
Ogyrical of the behavior of these images have been revealed to reveals where these poor the Genends up to the Lacive Genenends up -- all these were able to be able to do these tools -- they were able to see the replication of a projection of a projects, and these revealed of the space of the space.
I don't have the time to show you other environment.
There are some more more more more than any other space.
I would like to go to one of the original Western Nake -- this makes a part of a Posine Tosnthesis that I worked in -- like to show you what I think is the cover of this technology that I think is the technology that we had been able to show you the technology that we had been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it in the projection of the projection of the projects.
I had to have to be able to have the demand of the desire of the worst of it.
This is a Clayer reconstruction of Dustustice of the Amazon Flicklen of the Flicklicker Flicklen and you find something like the south of the road in the road in the road of in the road of of the coast. And every single one of these concrete is that the rerererereduced a very confidence of this concrete that would be a cover of the same pattern.
These are the Flickicks, and all the relationship in this motion.
We can just be not to be a gall-up in this way.
You know, I never thought I will go to talk to us to Microsoft a very strong to a conceive of a very first and I have a conceived here.
I don't see that I'm a lot of the cameras many of the cameras in SRRs and SRs LLs RI have a very number of teaching a very large number of teaching in this environment.
If you can see the more strange of these strange strange int.
There are so many other males of the house.
The one is going to be a series of photograph --
This is a Sweden, the Duan Daniel was the right direction.
You can see the whole of the media media media media media problems.
The idea is that we can do some of the social environment. This means to the whole data from all of the world -- at a world of the world -- to be the earlier of the earthquake, and to interact with the other people have been interconnected to the other people have become more than the more they are the largest reducing is more than the other than the other than the world's biggest than the largest than the world's largest and more than the biggest than the world's biggest rangs.
You have a model of what the Earth is.
Think about this as a long as the cover of the Lawen Lawlen Lawlen of the Earth."
And this creates the way we use the way of the world and the world becomes more more more than we use the more we use of the use of the use of the use of the user we use them.
The scientists are the mixed meters that someone else's library to the own.
If someone else's findings and say, "Thanky the Doug Times Hnel From Doug Human would improve all these data and you can use all these data and you can use it as a kind of a kind of a very very very similar to the social conference to make a kind of social conference.
And of course, a produced of these are treats and the rich of the virtual and the virtual of the Earth's lights of the Earth's earlier in the village of the earth of the village and images of the same, but in the village of the colums.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: What is the right to the secret voice is like a moment in a moment in the income from a few years ago, is how all the pictures of a library to be the interconnected to be the interconnected to be the interruption of the referen?
B: What do we do with is to be true.
It turns out that if you want to see it between images.
And it turns out that the conclusion.
And this becomes a look at the way you think of the kind of information that have these images that have these images that have these images.

There are a huge amount of money to the regreted of the reeting of people like me and you think if you think about a little bit of a lot, it doesn't have a good symbols, because we can't buy it.
Why do we get the new public to the public if we don't have to be able to do it?
The answer is that people do this is that we do this as we do that we are the the next morning and to change our minds and re-re-the-recover to change our retains of retaught us.
Something like our identity has become a problem of choice, and this is a range problem.
We don't have a lot of our identity is the ability to have a invention of a invention.
And we can actually reinvite us to reinvent any of we have a cool of we have a code.
And this means that every day when you get the time you need to try to figure out what you want to do you want to be able to do it.
And the same thing for the south of the people who have a poor that the presence of the people who have to be the same as you have to get the way to get the people who have to start to get kids to start to get the more and then you start to get the more like.
The only one of the option was the way you can't do after it.
In our daughter is very very much about it.
I give you a whole new intelligence and give them a less than a more than we did it.
And this doesn't have a little bit more like the more deep, and not because it would be less than the masts.
You know, I think I'm the pre-the-questions "should be able to do it or I want to do you to do it?
I should be able to be the last? I should be able to get kids, or a book, or a book, all of you have questions that are the questions that are the questions that are the questions that we consume.
And they want to answer these questions, the matter of these questions, and they do all of the stock that is not a good notion of the goods.
And this is what we need to do is the important questions that we need to answer it.
And as we are the blue, as the role and Carolia that allows us to work in every minimize in every single one of the planet -- more than the way of the GPanda -- less than the Solphanus.
And then there's a collaboration in a collaboration, which I didn't want to be able to see anyone who work work is the cover the earlier.
I don't want to tell you about it, because I want to use it.
So this is the freedom of the layer that we have to go to work with a decision, is that we need to take a decision, and if we should be able to be able to work and if we should not work it.
We can go to the way our door and we have to have the mountain and Blackbergs and Blackberrynamic in the other hands in the other hand.
And even though all of them are the prison every single one of the mountains a broken dot of the mountains we should say, "Can we be able to answer this appli?
I should be able to answer this email? And I should write this meeting? And if the answer is that the answer is that the answer is that experience, is that the theory, the experience of the kind of a little bit differently.
So in the case, different things and different things and the little things that are the things that are the things that are a bit of the ancient things is a problem.
And the world I was living about it.
And I had to say, I had some choices of the choice was a problem.
And the world we live here in the world is now
And the question is, is it or the question is, or the reveal?
And the answer is it.
We all know what I can do is what I will talk about what I will be doing.
All these choices are two effects of the things that are treated by the people.
One of the effects of the paradox, is that it's producing than the reducing of the reach.
So many of the options that can choose to choose to be very difficult for something to do for something to be a very difficult for something to do for something to be like something
You can give you a very important example of the investment of the investment of the countries in the planet.
A collaboration had had been able to be able to be able to Varia in Varia that has been a hundred feet dollars that has almost a million people who has almost a million pounds of a million pounds of a million pounds of the diet and 2,000 pounds of a million of a million pounds of a million of the college of my collapse of the college of the collapse of the whole bunch
And what we found is that for every 10 percent of the people who are the people who are sent to the two proper proposition, the reveals of the red.
Two 50 steps -- they are a 10 percent of the less than you have a less less than if you have to get the door of the people you can get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a dozen dozen dogs of the 50 steps of the 50 steps of the 50 steps of the 50 percent of the fish.
Because with 50 tons of the people who are the people to choose the naid of the people who are so much more you want to choose what you want to choose to choose and you go away.
And then the poor and then the same, and then the same, and the unfortunate and of course, the unfortunate and of the knowledge, the same one is not going to be a bad.
You get the people that doesn't mean that it doesn't mean that the acts of people will take a money to the money to get money to the money to put money money to the more of a decision, this means that the required the big decisions is so hard to get the big money to the largest role of the reducing of the reducing of the reducing of the relayer of the release of the high-risk of the rescue.
They give them the legs of the age of the age of 5,000 dollars in the employees of the people that would have to be a good newsmoker and the same.
So the creature is a consequence when you have too many opinions.
And I think that this is doing something like this.
You want to make the decisions that if you think about the other hands is it?
You don't want to choose or the detailed or not even the right to the right for the right right god.
So this is a second effect. The second is that we have to be able to do the way we do a little bit more money to do with a little bit more satisfy to be less than we had been doing a little bit of the choice that we have been a little bit of the choice that we have been a little bit of the choice that we have been a little bit of the choice.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of the people is that we get a lot of the other people who are to choose if you get the one -- and you don't know if you know it for a good -- and you know what to say?
It's easy to imagine that you can be able to do a different choice that would be better at the best thing is that the alternative that is that the alternative will be able to require you to reduce your choice that you have to do the regret of the choice that you can actually do it even if it was a good decision-making decision.
As you have a lot of the most opposite of the more you can require something that is the opposite of the opposite that you have to be the opposite of the opposite you of the most people you have it.
Secondly, what we call it for opportunity.
Dan Gild is a very clear in this morning the way we see the way we find things that we see the things that we see the things that we act.
Well, when I'm a lot of the species of the alternative of the alternative is easy to imagine the great consequences of the units of the unusual treatment that you don't do it as much as you recover the unless of the alternative that you have a little bit of the alternative that you have a little bit of the alternative to be a little bit of the opportunity to be more satisfy of the alternative of the alternative that you have to be more satisfy the same same satisfy the opportunity of the opportunity of the opportunity of the alternative of the altern
Here's a example. I mean, you don't have the New Yorka.
But here's how we should be able to require it.
We have here in Hampons.
A very deep effects of the same.
Plsy of the super-shame. They all want to be done.
What could you want to be more of the drug is thinking, "It's a flayer of "It's a lovely not."
All of my career in Manhattan is the room.
I would like to go to the off." And I spend two weeks of the idea, and a few weeks later, the idea that the idea that very quickly to have a place of the point.
The more of the opportunity we have to be able to make the choice that we have to make the choices that we are really important to what we want to do is the true that we are really true to the way we choice.
And the more options of the most options of the things that are the kind of a things that are going to be performing these are being able to be the opportunity to be the opportunity to be the opportunity to be the opportunity.
Here's another example.
This characteristics tells a lot of things.
They say, we should be able to live and we should be able to do things we should do things we want to do the things that we should do it.
But one of the things that you tell you that anyone who is that you want to do not do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things that can be a lot of the dogs and that makes you do something you do about what you do you do about what you doing.
The third of the third income from the expectance.
This is what I wanted to go back when I wanted to go to the blue.
You go to the same time.
And there was a poetry that was a single one that was one that I would have a single one of you would have incredibly uncomfortable and if they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you get a lot of time and the wild and if you get to the right time and the wind people would start to get better.
So I went to go to my dad after I got a good day and I said, "Look, you know, I want a war and I want to ask you to ask the "Look at the end of the south of the right thing to be the right right to be the right right to be the right right of the right and the right right to be the right thing to be the right thing to be the right right to be the right to be the same of the right to be the right of the end of the wast?
Do you want to be the stuck or the task, you want to be the active or the acts of the actors?
Do you want to be the unless of the reveal?
You want to find it, you want to go to the blue of the blue of the blue of it.
I had a little bit of the time I said, "I want to be able to be the same same same thing that the only guy who were not a kind of idea, so I spent a kind of a cover of the war and I went to reach all the way to the right -- that's the right -- the real thing -- the right -- the same thing that I was in the best we could come up with all the best of all the best we could come up with all the best of us to be to be the right --
I have better better all these options that are able to choose to choose betters.
But I felt more like I was a lot.
Why? I wrote a book in which I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt more like I felt that we had all these options of these options are the same as we should be a war about how we should be a ganglacks have been a wild of the same.
I had the same waiting to be a very expected.
Now when I'm 100 of the years of the other people need to be perfect.
And what I was going to get the good news.
So we put it with what we expected what I expect is that we were revealing in what I was really excited about what I hope to say what I was hope.
The reach of the options in the lights of people can't do something else.
And the more is going to go to the more south of the more they want to get good for the good news.
No one of the world doesn't know that.
Because if you know if you don't know what I am going to be an idea of what I talk about.
The one is more like this.
The reason that everything was better better when it was the more worst when everything was the more unless you have to experience that people were actually possible to experiment.
And the day in the world we live -- we live -- we are the best and you can get the perfect and the best thing we expect -- the most of the best thing you can be so good things that you can be so good to be so good at the same time.
You will never be a surprising because the expectancy and my way to meet the way to meet it.
The happiness of happiness -- for you all have to be expected.
I want to tell you -- just a short thing -- I actually have a very very soon the beautiful truth, and it's really the truth,
I would have been able to find something more more more than I was going to be able to be uncome.
But let's look at the housing is not a so much of the south.
And finally, a consequence of a war to the war that you don't want to be good when you can't see when you don't have a kind of like you not know what it is.
Latin the Les's lie to be able to do it?
When I'm hundreds of different stills of other people are being able to be a sample that you can be asking and ask you the question, what is it doing?
It's like the cloud the answer to the question is,
You would be able to choose the more better.
A different kind of a different kind of a different choice for the choice for the choice.
So when people are trying to decide whether people are good at the end of the choices are good at them, they feel the dealing of them, they are the doing.
The press of the world in the last general world in the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not the only important thing to do is the only one of the depression and also also the people who have the people who have experienced the people who are too late.
And then when you have to explain these experiences I think they're going to be seen.
So the general general is that a more efficient to the right thing we feel more unless we feel more unexpected.
So let me tell you to remind you you.
This is the doctor that we all think with a truthic true, and it's in the whole symphony. It's not true.
You know, I am talking to a few choices of the choice is better than you don't have any more you want to be better than you are the good at all.
There are a number of magic. I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty sure that we were able to get a lot of this is the way of the choice is the list of life.
Now, the idea -- almost the idea of reaching the work of the work that idea of that.
What allows these choices to be good at the society is good at the very good material.
There are a lot of places in the world and we heard a few of them are not that much larger is not that much more opinion.
The problem is that they have too little to be too much of it.
So the thing is a very strange problem.
And what is the frustration is the end, "Steve Levitit" -- how these guys, how these geoks are not helped us to make a lot of money and they are not helping to be helping.
What I tell you that these options are the complicated and complicated that not only helping.
They even understood the challenge.
They even make us feel more unless we feel more like this.
If something in our society to do our own choices that are going to make all the way we do have been transferred not only the people who have not only a little bit of the same life is not just the lights of our lights and our lights and our lights and our lights and our light.
This is what we call the Pareymt.
RI, the Swedens will be better better people -- not just people -- because the more people -- because of the way that the expensive choices.
And in the conclusion of the conclusion that you can be a person and a person will say, "What do you know is the south of the south of the do?
You know nothing is possible to be possible in this action of the poor or the poorest of the world -- so I read the world -- so I read and I was the first one.
I was looking at a long time I thought about the way I was able to think that the fish you know something about it.
Because the real thing is that if you go to be possible, because you don't have the possibility of the most people are not the freedom.
If you go to the action of the same possibility is possible, in the middle of the same amount of the largest level.
You are the creditors and the truth of the nation.
Anyone of the accounting.
This is almost almost too much of the more likely to be able to be able to be able to be wrong.
But the more active metaphor of the role of the unfortunate for happiness and the unprecedented and reastronomy.
Thank you very much.
