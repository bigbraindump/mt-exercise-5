LHast year, I did a TED I did introduce a LHC.
And I promised to come back and give you a data on how they work on the device.
So here I haven't been here, the LHC is not the largest scientific experiment that was the largest scientific experiment -- the Cumphincient Street or is to recreate the present of the Scocotton is to create the presents of a billion times of a fraction -- the spinal of a billion times on the seconds -- the way to create the universe -- the shocking of the sequence.
It's extremely quote.
This is the orasyan is the order.
We make photographs of these minds "Big Bangs" in the decades.
I work on this one. It's called ATLunger ATLunger -- Lunneline a 22 feet photographs of ATLunt's detectorture here is a proportion of the ATLALAS in construction.
On the decades of the year we went on the first year.
And this picture was done by ATLAS facility.
It caused a huge celebrity in the room.
It's a picture of the first particle of particle that quote in the LHCHC, crats in LHC system, clearly in the LHC deliberately in the detector.
In other words, when we saw that 10 seven-seven-the--day image devices that is a huge success.
I don't know if this has got the greatest poor, or this, when someone did a Google and this is the first page that the first page of the same way.
I did a way I did a cultural impact on the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the human impact.
And then then about a week I had a problem with the machine, which actually actually had to do with these days.
Those fire transportation 13 ampers when the machine works at the maximum of the maximum power of the maximum of the maximum of the power of the maximum of a flower of a 13 thousand fire 13 though,
Now, engineers in the window and says, "You can't transport the ampers. They're the fun of the ampers.
But I can do this because when they are at the temperature temperatures called superconducting.
So as a 271 degree of the class of the hospital between the state of the state of the state, those of steps.
And one of the laws of the laws of the LHCHCHCH, was a factory define of factory --
So the company has been inquoted a little bit of ampers have innate revealed electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressive that the magnetic acquire of the ton, and they moved about 30 cents, and they moved about 30 cents.
So we have been deeply about 50 magnetic math.
We had to take the outside, what we did and don't.
I reconconconvicted to all of it, I repair it.
And now we go into the subterrain and then in subteran.
It was at the end of the marvelous marvelous LHC will be like it as new as it will be like it again.
We're going to start from again, and we are going to get data in the or ione or iulation, and we're going to continue to find the empty the basic of the universe.
Now, of course, that in a way, those accidents of the important accidents and engineering about the extreme engineering and engineering it to break down to the extreme rejection.
I think that it is so much of it is so much of the fact that we have young people like LHC.
I'm going to leave the words of a scientist of the Britanic Humphrey Davy, who I think that I think that the earlier or Michael Faraday, he said, "Nimicic the progress for human minds are not dangerous to previous human rights are not in our minds of our science and are not in the natural natural natural natural natural natural natural natural natural weapons, as they have no longer convey and that are not over."
Thank you.
I want to start with the rate of the child, when you were playing with board.
And then you invent them to watch them and get them to the claims and get them to the colored and sold them in the way you really invent and solving the spars.
The spot of the spot is profoundly law a lot of the world in the inconconception.
So in the quality of this demanding IT ininspiration of this uselity -- impressive interventions -- impression of my physical objects, and my color of the Pattian -- we would start to injealent -- we would start to go to the computer in this unlike when we use a computer, where we can use a computer disappoint, and a digital display with a mouth of a moumouth of a moumouth of a bunch of inner and that we could have both of the trees and put and then we could be both of the maymate and to the mains of this ung and to the maillustrategiant and to do with a computer and to go to the digital content with a whole digital die on a whole base of this ungains of this ungungungloadly with a computer and reach, and
Did it for how do we want to now?
And this question was so much of the fascinating as we hot the research that we had the answer to build Sistable.
In a short, the Siftable is a computer interactive of a biscal bism.
They can be manufactured by the way, they can perceive can perceive the food one screen, and they have a screen and a radio screen and a radio wireless of the wireless of the wireless of the wife.
The most important is that it's palpable, so you can see the game, like the game, you can just take it as just appeared by them.
And the Sifwwitness for a new ecosystem by the digital manipulation of the digital manipulation.
On the main which these instruments become more palpable, more constantly constantly of the other's miserable to explore the nutritions of our nutritions and destroy new styles.
I'm going to start with simple example.
This Siftable is configuring out image, and if you include it by a direction, and if it is a step, or if it is in the other part, they get into the other part, they get into the other part,
These are the interactive interrupt is constitutes one of the other.
So, if I put one to the other thing, they are interested.
If they are unconcepted by it, and this can be a little confussion.
You can also feel the misering.
We realized that one of our interesting implications of interactions that we can use the shadow and manipulate the data, how we would be a color how we would be a color how we would have a color like we wow.
In this case, we have three Sifwwelfare like the paintings and they can use them to use the color in the center, where they will die in the center,
If we can get a lot of the wind we can till the wood.
There are also interesting possible possible possible for education, such as education, as a language and mathematical games, mathematical and the possibility of people who want to want to try to figure out the outcomes.
So here I -- this is a Fibonaces that make a simple program that makes a simple program for equations.
Here is a little bit of forming words, a kind of combination of the Scrabs and Boggles.
Basically, every one of the first one letter of the Siftable, and on the Sif, and on the mother, they are grew with a dictionary dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds return the letters are reseverely new set of letters, and you have a new set of letters.
Thank you.
These are nistic people who came to the Media Laborator Laborator and we returned them to convey and showing them a material.
They liked them to crazy.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of applied people is that you don't have to give them a lot of people in the structure.
All you have to say is "From words and they know exactly what to do.
Here are other people who are inking to people who are innocent them.
This is the most taneously testing in our right right in the right in the right in the right here.
It seems like everything that wanted to do was to do to do was a Siftagging on one over the other.
So for him was just cubs.
This is a animal applied with animal animal animal
We wanted to build a instrument for those who invent language.
And this is Felix.
He can introduce new characters in the scene, just lifestyle that they find the personalities.
Here is the sounds of the sound.
Video: The race.

DM: It makes your narrative.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a story with the end of the open, and he decides how to debate.
Video: Sboary, the peak.
DM: The last example that we have time to show you today is a team of created and interpretation and interpretation and interpretation and the role of the Switzerlands like the role and all the role and everything.
Each of these two variations of these different variations you choose to use it.
And you can inject the sounds of a succession that you can see the guy that you can do.
You get the sound of the sounds of sounds of a Sweet Sweet Sweet Stweet Stable of success.
There's effects that you can see poor control, like reverberal and the filter.
You can see it from one particular sound and then including it to help it to help it to help it it.
It works like the general effects like the phumph and the volume that applied the His to see the His to see it.
Video: DM: We will start with a second Swemit in the second Switzerlands in a serious spinal of success, we were arrived.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: DM: Now add a few dangerous.
Video: DM: And now I will add the top, to control the top, to control the side effect of the lives.
Video: DM: I can see the third inclining in the clining in a part or or something.
Video: DM: Now I will put this on the bill of a bunch of extent extent.
Video: DM: I can resect in the long time they do it.
So you don't have to do to make the prealable plant, printer, or shorter or shorter of the word.
Now, the end, I can get to the whole range of the Sive of the volume of the volume of the volume in the stangle.
Thank you.
And as you see, my passion is my passion is the creation of new interfaces that are working better with how the brain and our body in the brain and our body in our brain.
And today, we had time to show you a coordination of this new spatial spark of design, and some of the possibilities that we try to get out of the lab that we were trying to get out of the lab in the lab in the lab to show you from the lab to show you a coordinate coordination to show you a coordinate coordination of this new spatial spatial of this new spatial of the lab.
The thing that I want to retiny is that we are at the new general of interaction with this new general interaction with the middle of the world that will bring information into our world.
Thank you very much.
These episode to the nervous of you all of you are going to be all of you in the way.
I'm a writer.
He described books to my career, but it's more than it is.
It's all my mother, my loads and fascinating a via living.
And I don't have this to change that is to change that.
But this is a saying, something like a weird in the career and in the career and in the neighborhood with the worker.
And the weird is that I wrote this book called "Manca, the title "Manca, the Roagure, Iubest-like cart's career in the world for any of my career in the world for a snapped in the world for a selling that international book is so seller that the International Sha's talk.
The result is that they go now, people treat me now, people treat me -- people treat me as a convicted to be convicted to the nested.
Serio: Serio, convicamate!
Do you have the ingrights, and you say, "Don't you know -- you don't have any of you who don't have to be able to be more deeping with the performance of that?
Don't you go to the whole thing to write your life more than you can do the time to create a book that will ever be on the world that they ever have to go a?"
It's really linking --
But it was more rich if they didn't have any time when I didn't have 20 years ago, when I was trying to get people -- I want to become write, I want to become write, and I had to be writing, I lovely on the same side.
And people were saying, "You don't have any more of you who haven't been a lot of success?"
Don't you know that humility is going to kill you kill it?
Don't you do not have your entire life in this field in this field and nothing will be here and not going to be a dead on a boy on a boy with the mouth of the mouth of the gas with the screen?"
Something like that.
The answer -- the short answer to all those questions is """"""""""""""""""""""
Yes, you have the theme is the theme of all of those things.
And I always did.
And you have a lot of other things that people don't have to go through the macrs.
As an example of the marine algorithms that are crying.
But when it's about the work that I thought I was in the last time I was like, "Why?"
Is it a rational?
It's logic to anyone to be like to be the friend of the work that I feel like the Pament.
And what is so that the specific is that it seems like we don't really know that we don't really do it in a way that other teachers don't do it in a way that other teachers?
My father was my father was an engineer and you don't have remember in the 40 years of reminds of the engineering is not a question of someone who is asked someone if you don't have a chemist.
It didn't happen -- John, how does the block the block in the engineer?
It's just not going to happen.
But to be honestly, the chemists, engineers like a group of not that group of reputation in the century to be alcools of the reasons.
We are insects like this reputation and not only writing -- but the artists, but the artists, it seems like this reputation to be powerful in the mental mental mental reputation to be powerful mental mental mental illness.
And all we have to look at the number of death the number of morning in the 20th century, in the 20th century, in the 20th century, which have died by young people who died with their own man.
And even those who didn't have their own one page of the destruction of your own destruction of your own talk.
Norman Mailer, even before the last time to met, the last one of my carton said, "Each me a little bit more than "Each me a little bit more than I want to me."
A great great great great about your work of a living in a living.
But not the time we don't have to be customer when I hear that I heard these things like these things like we have absorbed and somehow we have absorbed and the unacceptable idea that creativity and suffering, the idea of the creative and the art's always leaves to the insuit will always lead to a hurt, to the suffer.
And the question I want to advertising all of this is you all of here is you all the idea?
You are comfortable with it -- so that as the library of the liber -- I don't have to do with this ipothe.
I think it's stop.
And I also think it's dangerous, and I don't want to see it in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage to the great artist's to train to the waste of the boy to the board.
And I know that I was in my case -- in my situation -- I would be very dangerous for me to go to the carry of this ipoverty, especially to the one of the one of the circumstances I find a circumstance.
For example, there are pretty tank, just about 40 years.
I have probably four decades of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of four of the work of the work of four people who are probably four of the workers of the work of four decades.
And it's very likely to write the whole thing to write with this moment to be judged by the work that the work that came up with my last few of my career, right?
What would be to say to the mention of the mention of people here are already here are friends -- it's very likely to be the largest successful of my revenue.
Oh, God, what God!
This is the kind of the gas that could be able to do someone in the nine in the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I do in the continuing this message that I love.
And then, the question is what, the question is,
And so I can go and put a lot of meditation, like mania that I have to work right now, to try to make a kind of a psychological construction, right?
I had to do it, I had a way to go to a safe, and I would find my absolutely natural and my graduate who would write the natural legs that will be in the way before I write the answer to what I write to the point of what I write to the point of what I write in the way to what I write a way to what I write a way to the way to look at what I was in a distantution of a safe, and the theme that I was going to do at what I write a distant and the one of the nature of the one
And as we all look in the last year in this sense, we started to look around the time, and I asked them to see other society to see if they could have better ideas to see if they could have better ideas about how to be helping people to be helping people credit to be helping people create.
This is what this has been in Greece, and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma Roma and Roma Roma and Roma Resear's research in Greece.
So I have the sky is the sky is inchitable.
But in the Grection and the Romers and the anti-Romers don't think that the human creativity came from the inside the human being?
People thought that creativity was a spirit was a spirit of the helping people in a source of people in a source and unintelligence and unintelligence, in the unintelligence and unintelligent reasons.
The answer was that these spirited deep death comes helping to the term "proce" "proce."
It was famous to was famous because he thought he had a demon which is a department in the department in the department in the department of the department of the department.
The human were the same pared, but they called that spiral spirit of creative nervous, attacking attack.
What is great, because the nows, they didn't think they really thought a very practice as a remarkable individual in the destiny.
They thought a genius was a kind of magical entity in the magnitude in the wall-of-the-the-the-art walls, like Dobby, the spirit of the work of the work of artist's work, and the result in the workplace, the model of the works, the workworkplace of the workplace of the works, the decision.
Absolutely -- this is really the distant thing that I talked -- that I talked -- that I was talking about the workplace that you protect you from the works.
And all the world is the step, right?
So artist was protected by some of the things that are protected by some narcise, right?
If your work was stralucalyza, you couldn't keep the world the same worth as the world as you have this genius that helped the tricky that helped off.
If your work was critical, it was not completely the health, right?
Everybody is the star as your genius was kind of ignorance.
And so they looked at the West people in the West for a long time for a long time.
And then came to Renthusiastic and everything has changed, the idea of the main that the human universe as a person in the center of the universe that the person is the one of the corner of the state and mysterious and mysterious truly that I get from the deep demand.
It was the beginning of the rational, and people started to create the credit credit creativity in the individual in the individual inside of the individual in the individual people.
And for the first time in history in the history of people started to refer to one or the other artists, instead of the genius.
And you have to marry to the big error of a huge error error.
You can see the table, a simple person, to create the receptor is actually the received receptor and the task and the task and the surrounding and the surgical source, create, create, the uncle, of the fragile is a little bit of psychic to the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the human fragile psychic to the human fragile
It's like you would ask you to get the socket the sound.
It just incotton and deforms and it gends up all these astonishes all these astonishes on the performance.
I think that the pressure of the artist killed us one after the last 500 years.
And, if it's true, and I think it's the question is, what do we do?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we are back to the higher senses, the creative relationship between people and the mystery of people and myself.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't just run 500 years of a human thinking about the role of the rate of 18 minutes.
And probably that is that there is a public that would raise the scientific matter-the--the-the--the-the-present people around the world press and they still divide people and everything.
It probably doesn't go to this one will be on this idea.
But the question I want to ask is -- why don't I want to do it -- why not?
Why don't we think about that?
Because it has a sense of how much we heard about anything else we've heard about the innate definitiosity of the credit process.
It has access to the reason anyone -- basically to create something -- basically all the here -- you know, the behavioral behavior.
And, in fact, sometimes the peak can go to the right paranormal in the right paranormal.
I had a range where I knew the great American American Rutch Stone, the Stone, who now has now in the '90s and that was now the poet that he told me that when my childhood and just when the childhood is when the child was going on on the room, and I just felt and I felt and feeling a poet and it feels and just hearing the waste over the room, and I just hearing the stage.
The story as a waste of the sea was like a wood.
And it was the catches over the roads.
The point of the income because it's gallery falleries under the leg.
At that point, the point of view has one thing to do, and that is, "away."
And the running of the water-shelter home and the whole idea was to get to a piece of map and a credit card and a credit card enough for that when she went through her double-driven it and put it on a map.
Sometimes it was not enough enough to go and run, so running and run, but they didn't go to the home and the poems and the poems and the poems and the poems the roof, and I read it and the poet the waste of "another poet of the room, I read it "another poet of the poet --
They were also the moments where -- and this is not going to look -- moments where the story is that almost losing the story that almost lose.
Her running home, the main and the main and the world the next and the one and the credit card the stage of the people who were going to go through the other person and the other and the tourist and the clothe.
And the same thing that the poems and the tragedy and then in the body on the map.
In the situation, the poems of the perfect poems on the nose of the nose of the worst word.
When I heard it -- it's just like -- it was just how my own creative process of creative process.
My creative process doesn't really limit to this -- I'm not drive!
I'm a catching and the way they work to go to the same day and translate me and transparent and go and play with the wrong and you can sit in the wrong with the wrong and I can sit in the wrong with the wrong thing.
But even in me, in my hindtingly, I was so enough, I was so worth of that phenomenon.
And I imagine that they were also imagined many of you are also a lot of you.
I was and I had projects or ideas that they came from a source that I don't know that I don't know a novel to find a novel in a identify of it.
And what do you do with that?
And how do we have to report us to report the way that we don't lose our minds, you don't lose the right thing to help us reach to the health of the health of the health of the health of the health of the health of the health of the health of the deep that we should report our to report our to report us to report the narratives we should report to the mind, and we have to report the minds of the health,
For me, the most relevant example of how we have to do about how we can do is make the musician with the Tom Waits, we took a few years to be in the demand.
I was talking about this subject and all of this was almost all about the discussion of the contemporary artist's contemporary artist's contemporary control, and to stand gentlemen, to stand gentlemen.
With the walker, and you immediately got the story of the story as a day in the process of Los Angeles and then everything has changed.
And as driving from a short age of a short fragmented from a piece of the time that comes in minds of the way that the revenue, and it's not about inspire and it's not about it, but it is at it, it's not about it, but it is not how to hit is at her.
It doesn't have any air, no creature, no reported reportop.
I would feel all of that the old old fanxiety in "I'll lose the moment of the bank, and the tours for the bank for the time.
I'm not enough to get a good thing, to reach a do."
And instead of the show, just by the shocket it stopped
He stopped the deep process and made something completely new and everything else.
He raised the sky and said, "You don't see that they're at volan?"
"You seven, could I write a little boy to write a track of acum?
If you really want to be in the way to be in a more applied when I can do that.
If you don't get and you get to another today.
Go and you get it to Leonard Cohen."
The tricky process has changed the whole process of that.
Not the operating has continued to be as well as the one of the things that always happened.
But the process of this, and the whole process, and it took the time around me, it was when he took the dog in the moment he took the mouse and it only because he was to go back and forth to where they come back and forth to where they come back and then they don't have to be something that has to be something that has to be something that is so much like it needs to be something like that.
It could be this collaboration and the bizarre and bizarre under a conversation between Tom and the extent and the extent of the extent that wasn't too much like Toman man.
And then I heard the story of me was going to change a little way I was working on a little bit like that.
This approach me to save when I was at the middle of "Manca, the Roage," and I have cash in a kind of disappearing to where we all study when we work on the way we do with something that we would have to go and go and look at something that I would be a disaster to be a disaster.
Not just the one of the most profound that he he was writing.
I had to think that I should just be abandoned the project.
And so I remember my open back, and I asked the open space, and I asked and I asked him.
I raised my dynamushis and I added my commentals, and I advertible the room.
I said, "You are sculpture: You and I know that if this book is not just going to be extraordinary to me, right?
Because you can see that I put one on the battle on the battle all I have to go to the welf.
So if you want to be better from it, you have to be a little bit more and more you have to do the third side.
Okay. And if you don't do this, you know, to the naid everywhere.
I would write a writer because this is my message.
And I want to consign for that I did my third siz."
because -- the Conclusion is -- hundreds of years ago in the desperately in North Africa, people get to the wild to the die of the wild music, and music, the sacred music, and the music, the wrap that they were in the rate to the race.
And they were always wondering, because dancers were teaching and they were remarkable teachers, and they were remarkable to be remarkable to do it?
But sometimes very roughly something like one of the things that really is the fact that you really have from the community.
I am convinced you all know what I mean you all about what you do, in a certain moment, like you all of a certain moment that you have an interpretation.
It's like time it stops and the dance, the password is by a kind of porting in the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 sers,
It doesn't seem to be in the entire wavelength of man.
It's lightened in and light. It's the bottom of the fire is over.
And when they were in the way they knew what they were called the named the name.
and they were the hands and they were in the scanners and they were "All," Alllah, Gamh, God's God, God, God, God, Game, God."
It's God.
A interesting among historical historic -- when the maps have invent Spanish, they took this user with them and the pronounced in the "Allah," "Allah," "Allah," "Allah,"
and they hear in the fights of the fire and dancing and dancing.
In Spania, when a interpret and mass of something impossible and magic and the "Allah, magic, the mother, the magnificent of the Talk, you know, the brain."
Hellog -- a God -- a God of God's God's God's dung of God's unintelligence.
It's wonderful because we need to have something like this.
But the second day comes to the second day when the dancer is the dance of the inspire of the morning, 111-morning, and it's not a scale.
It's a dirder that is and that is the genunited and could not be more initial and perhaps not to informed.
Would it be no one more invoice the name of Domnor when he was going to do with the rest of the rest of the wind of the rest of the wild of the wild of saving lives?
It's hard.
It's one of the most painted painting of the creature.
But it could not be a big championed if you don't think about the most extraordinary part, you know, the most extraordinary part, you know, they are from the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside the best.
Maybe if you think about the one of them was improud of a few times of your lives in a few moments of life in the next few other people have more than the time when the moments, when the moments have been sick.
If we think about this is that all the beginning of change.
I started thinking about my last few months of course I think the last months of the last months of the book that will be published by this one of these curves of my successful and crisis of my success.
And what I do is, I would do when you get the curriculum on the stage of the "Helse."
It wouldn't be saving the wood, and you can get the Continuer your Continueless, anybody would be her.
If you get dance, then you dance, then you dance.
If the genius and expensive what you can do is repair to the extraordinary choice to the extraordinary her, even for a while, even for a while, then you say, "le!"
And if no, they dancing anyway.
And with all of these no!" for you.
I think in these things and I think we should pretend to pretend to pretend to be to dee.
"You know, just h!" for you, just because you have a loade love, and the headquarters in the continuous and the headline.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ohen: Ohen: Ohen: Ohen: Ohen: Ohen: Ohen: Ohen: Ohen: Ohen: Ohen: Ohen: Ohen: Ohen: Ohen: Ohen: Oh!
We talked about some of these projects, about the human genome and what could be the fact that we could be predictable and what they might be the discovery of genes.
Now we start to start a new point from one point, digitized, and now we're trying to start to start to start to start in a new code from this new code of biology, modeling and synthesizing and synthesizes and synthesizes of life.
We tried to ask the important questions about the important questions for us to ask for us.
"What is life?" It's something that I think many biologists tried to understand to the different levels.
We tried different approaches, simple approaching to the data on the basic components.
We already died about 20 years.
When we sequenced the human genome of the human genome of biology in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world.
Now we try to ask the question, can we regenerate our own efforts in this digital forts in this digital universal university in this digital world.
This is the map of a mic, Mycoplasma genitalium, which has the most genital-general species that can replant the only in the lab in the lab in the lab.
We tried to see if we could come with a smaller genome and smaller genome and smaller and smaller
We were able to get the survey of a hundred genes from a hundred genes are there.
But when we look at the map of metabolic map, it's pretty simple, it's pretty simple,
I think it is, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can have the first one moment is probably a little bit like this is a little bit like this is a little bit like this is a little bit like this is a little bit of life.
So we decided that the only way we actually decided to stand synthesomerrow, so we can see the summer the components to reach the most most of the most fundamental components.
And so I started on the road, "Can we stand the synthesizes a crom?"
Maybe the chemistry allows these synthesizes that we never did more than we ever did I ever do anymore.
And if we can actide a cros?
A cromosomosomosome, is just a piece of chemical material.
So, our speed to digitize the life has grown to a exponential rhythmm.
Our ability to write code code to write code code, but it grew up there.
And the last time he got to a exponential curve.
I started this on a little bit more about 15 years ago.
We went through a few ethics, actually, with a bio-etal examination, before we do the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesizes of DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make small DNA of DNA in 50 letters to 50 letter but it's a generative process of generative process, so why you build a long piece of tapped more with the more error more erous people who are more error of the people in the world that are doing more than the people who are making small small small ways.
So we had to create a new way to put these little little little little little bits together, and the right of the errors.
This was our first tentative, portrait from the digital synthesis of the synthesis of Physical X 174.
It's a little virus that killer human human being.
We did the design of the skills, we went through the right of errors, and we got a molecule only about 5,000 letters of DNA by a letter of 5,000 letters.
The interesting thing that I took this piece of the income from the piece of chemical material, and we put it in bacteria and we put this code in bacteria and to produce this code and produces the virus and produce the virus and produces the virus.
The viral Partics were then released from cells and they have returned and they killed the E.
I was talking to the curate industry and they would say, I understand that this model.
They have laughter more than you are.
And so we think this is a situation where the software can build their own mashelterwise in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the whole cross of a bacteria of a bacteria
This is over 5,000 letters of 5,000 letters of genetic code.
So we said, we have to put the church on the six-sizes to the size of the size of the size of the size of a living cells that are the size of a vivivia cell.
The design is critical to be critical, and if you start with digital information in the computer, that has to be very like.
When I sequenced this genome in 1995, the first time in 1995, the standard was a 10,000 payment of the basic walls.
We found it, in the revenue, 30 errors, 30 errors. If we were used to be in the original resided.
The design is in design is a design of the gaps, which has to be a 50 letters, you have to do with all the other pieces of of 50 letters to build on the smaller sub-skills to be able to design some of the little bits of the world.
We create unique tools.
You may have read that we put "mark" in the housness, you have a genetic code, we have a genetic code, C, God, and T.
Triving the letter of those letters -- those letters about 20 recently acizes -- one letter a single letter literally every notion of the novel release of the novel --
So we can use the genetic code, and the proposition, the sentence, the ways.
And the point of all, all I did was I had to hear the code.
Some of them were disapplied that it's not poetry is poetry is not poetry and besides were disapplied to some of them was disapplied that there was no poems that they were disapplied that it was not poetry is not poetry is not poetry was poetry is not poetry was poetry is poetry is poe
We designed those pieces so that we can define was with enzymous end.
They're repair that they repair and they get them and they get them.
So we started to do the joy of the skills of five to 7,000 letters to do these little little twists, and then put it on the two-letters and then put it into the 200s, and then put it to 7,000, and then to 700 to 7,000 to 7,000 people in the 200,000 to 7,000 to 7,000 to 7,000 lets the guns.
Every peak we have these pieces of the abundance to sequence them to sequence them to make a very robust -- as you can see a very robust -- as you can see in a minute.
We try to get to get to that point of automatization.
So this looks like a baskets.
When we get to the very large pigs of 100,000 pairs of basic pairs, they don't grow that in E.
It makes all of the same modern molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular biology.
So we have we come to other hand.
I knew that there is a mechanism called recombination of the human biology, which biology is using DNA to reach it to reach the joke.
This is an example.
There's a organism called Deinococcus of the death of the radio rating role of radiation.
And as you can see in the sea panel, the cross is is destroyed.
12 hours to 24 hours later, he put it later it on his hands as it was at the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be often often often all of that.
I can live in living.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the extreatment in the extreatment, to go through a new environmental environment,
In fact, NASA showed that this is going on.
Here is a micrographic micrograpes that we built by using these procleaning -- actually using these procleaning the design of the skin that we put in the boy that we put on the skin that we put on the skin that we put in the way that we put on the skin that we have to put these these procleands that we built on the molecule that we have just using these proc
Drojja with automatically automatically automatically
This is not a picture from a microscope with electrons, but just a micrographic fire.
It's so a big molecule that we can see it with a microscope with a microscope with a microscope of it.
These are images images of about about six seconds of about six seconds.
This is a published audience that I've had a little bit of time.
These are over 5,000 letters of 5,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made by a definition of people with a definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely the largest structure that we ever have done by the largest molecular structure.
It's got a molecular molecular molecular ar ar ar ar ar ar ar bag.
If we put it with a 10 and without a 10 and without a 10 ppage page to practice this code,
So how do we go a cromoss-cross-gravy?
From a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria to work with bacteria
You also have more easier when you get to the eucario, you can just put the nuclear and you just put the nucleus and this is something you all heard -- clons.
With the chair, the cross is is integrated in the cells, but we showed you to do a curate that we can make a completely completely completely completely a completely completely completely to be able to activate it.
We had a chance of a microbial species.
These are about the same as people as well as people and the same.
We added a few genes in the plus to select the cross for this crose.
I desperately desperately with enzype all proteins.
And it was pretty amazing when we put in the cells -- you will appreciate our very sophisticated -- and the cross came into the cell.
In fact, we thought this is how far it can go and put it into something more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and we tried to design the process it.
This is a major mechanism mechanism of evolution --
We are all kinds of species that have embarrassed a second cross or a third of the third part, or a third of the other part, from the other one second, a second.
So those who think of the evolution just as a single gene of the biology.
I'm called restricted restriction, which actually had been deeping with DNA
The Cromosome that was in the cell not a thing.
The -- the cross -- the cross that we put us --
It was expressed and grateful and grateful the other cross-material, and so we got it with the cross-cell's going to be with the new cross of the cross-new cross-received the new cross-received and he was expressed and he was extent, and he was all the crosome of the crosome as well.
It became blueprint because of the gene we put in the cromosis.
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristics of a species of a species that lost in a completely new species that we put in a whole new species that we put in the cell that we put in the cell that we put in the cell phone.
All the proteins were shifted -- the membranes were shifted -- when we give the genetic code, it's exactly what we would transft.
This can sound like al-genome, but we can move the DNA of the DNA of the DNA that we can change things pretty dramatic.
Now, we have given that this is not genesis -- but it is actually built on three billion years and half years and we support that we can be on a new version of creating a new version of the Talk, in the Talk, in the digital master's new species.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obvious about it of the point of needs of new.
We are on the way to go from six and a half to six and a half to 40 years.
To put this in context for me in context, I was born in 1946.
There are three people on the planet, for each of us that there was in 1946; in 40 years, will be four.
We have a hour ints did, provided potttable, drug and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half of the six and a half and a half and a half of the housness.
It will be difficult to do it for it.
We use over five billion tons of books, more than 30 billion bars of barriers of barble-boils
This is a hundred million barils a day.
When we try to think about procleaning and all the process that will replace to replace this, will be a huge challenge.
And then of course, is all that CO2 is all the atmosphere.
Now, our discoveries around the world, we have a basic data, we have a basic data, and I like to think about these as the components in the future.
The plastic of the electronics has only doubled, or like something, and here is the diversity that came out of that.
We are limited here, first of all, biological and a biological reality and our imagination.
We have the techniques, because of these quotes of synthesis, we call what we call the genymous genically.
We have the ability to build a lot of a lot of cross that make a bunch of cross a day.
When you think about to process these 20 million genes of genes or different genes of general genes, or to try to produce the occupy of products, or products just change with a little pharmaceutical team than the last 20 years of all science.
And this is just a standard.
We can select for viable viable for viable flows of fuel, which is producing to the cleaning citizens.
This is a head of a design of a design of a design that we work in order to wait and work on these species in the computer.
You know, we don't know how it will look like this.
We know exactly how they look at their genetic code,
Now we focus on the fuel to fourth generation.
You saw that from the wind terancy in the ethantic experiment is just a unable experiment to it.
We have the generation of the second and the third of the third and the third of the third of the sockets that are air like the tremendous value as the occurred or different sells.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact impact without the food and the flower cost of food and the flower is if we start with CO2 as we start with CO2 as the first goal to design to design to this and make the first goal of the generation of the generation of the fourth generation of the fourth generation of the fourth generation of the fourth generation of the generation of the CO2 months.
Low and CO2 is a way -- but in our -- but in our discoveries around the world around the world have all kinds of ways of doing the world around the world.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It goes into the deep deep in the ocean, two miles and a half a deep, at a half a deep,
Transform CO2 in metan using molecular as a molecular as a survey as a source of energy as a source of energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 captured, which can be transported in the countries, and convert that CO2 back, and converted in the fuel in compounds in compounds, to lead this thing.
So in a short period of time, we think we could meet the basis of the basic question, "What is life?"
We have -- you know -- we have the objective models to replace the entire oil industry.
Yes. If you don't do this at TED, where another park in another part.
Let's get a majority of energy source.
But we also work now to use these same same sources to invent vaccines in order to invent vaccines in the right ways.
You saw this year with the blood -- we are always a year and a dollar in minus when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think the situation can be shipped by building vaccines of any of the time before we were going to be able to be in the way.
Here's how to go to the future of the future of changing the future of evolution, accelerating the evolution of bacteria with bacteria and finally, the end, and finally, the end, finally, eukarios.
We're almost to improve people.
Our ability is just to make sure that we have a failure to survive for a long time to survive to be very long enough to do that. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you the next thing, is a fundamental work of technology, a new technology that we've adusuopted as a part of a part of a little bit about a year. This is a year. This is a year. This is Sealo.
It's a average which can interact is local or a local amount of visual data from a lot of visual data.
We now look at a lot of falling pictures of digital and marriage and marriage in the continuous ways, spark anywhere in this one, rearrive anybody in this one, rearrive anybody in the world in the bond,
It doesn't matter how much information is what we look like the big collections are images.
Most are taken pictures of a common digital camera, but this is a digital camera, for example, is a Congress, for example, Congress, the law of the mongap.
Not important because the only thing that should limit the only thing that should limit a system of your money's number of skin on your monitored architecture to a very flexible. It's also a very flexible.
This is a book on the third side, an example of a non-imaginative book as a sudden.
It's about "Ca" -- Charles Dickens. The one colored is a colored colored is a colored colo.
To show you that it's about text, and not imagine, and we can't do this, to look like this, to look like a represented to a text; it's not a picture of a text; it's not a picture here.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read a book in electronic form.
I didn't want to recommend.
This is a more real. It's a "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian of "Gardian of a s" in a case of a safe case.
Each pictures of a sequence of a sequence.
This really gives you a joy of a plant experiences to read the version of a newspaper or a revia in the newspaper environment.
We did a little bit of a little bit of this number in "Gardies."
We created a false reclaims to a very large resolution -- much more than in any claimed -- and we have a contained of a containment.
If you want to see the properties of this car, you can see here.
Or other models, or even technical specifically or techniques.
And this really cleaning from some ideas, the limits of a monitor.
We hope this to be sick and the pop-up pop-in-in-in-in-shut -- which is not necessary.
Of course, the mapping is one of the applications of the kind of like this.
I don't want to tell you a lot of time on this, but just to tell you that we have contributed to this field.
These are all the roads in the United States of NASA finger picture from NASA scale.
Let's go to a different thing.
This is actually active on the Internet work; you can see it.
This is a Photosyn, which is a second different technology.
and Rick Szeliski to Cerki Microsoft. A beautiful college of the beautiful color and Rick Szeliscy.
So this is active on the Internet. Poslibility because Sealo.
You can see that when we create this kind of perspective, when we can navigate through images of imaging in many ways.
But the space arrived, the space arms of these images really true.
The other visual Algerian record record these images together, so that to coret the real space where these pictures are doing these pictures where these pictures of the Grases, the Grasses -- they were shown -- they were realized.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There are some of the average space.
I want to go directly to one of the original corner of Noah -- this is part of a Photosynical protool -- to show you in the vast -- to show you what I think is the pioneering of this technology, just the Photosnce. It's not necessarily just of this technology, just by vision, but obviously, just of this project-based project-based projects.
We had to care about the law of the law of the law in the law --
This is a reconstruction of Cateur Cate's, Dames in images of the images of Flickr, and you find something like a Damp Flickr, and you find something like a tricky in the room, and every one of these concrete contains represents a picture that would be found that the cool of this pattern.
These are pictures on Flickr, and all of them were related space in this way.
We can just have to be in this way.
You know, I never thought I would go to work at Microsoft is is very measured to Microsoft is also a prime here.
I don't see that I noticed a lot of the room, all the role from the SLRs at SLRs at SLRs in the SLRs in this environment.
If you can find out there in this weird of these strange strains.
There are so many mamms, size, six, bad.
Something here is a series of photographs.
This is a poster with Novel Damer who was recorded correct.
You can get a poster to a physics to a physics of this environment.
The idea is that they can do some things with the social environment. This means to collection from all the world -- from a collective memoral -- and to interconnected to what the Earth -- and to interconnected to them all those pictures have been interconnected to the whole thing that is more than the summer.
You have a model of what the whole Earth is the entire Earth.
Think of this as the long as Stephen Lawler Lawler "Virtualtual."
And this is growing in complexity as the world as well as the world as we use more benefits as users are getting more and more useless.
The news is that they are eeeeeeeee!
If someone eeeeeeethes and it would say, who I am my photography Dame, you would improve the Dame, and I could use it as a point of saving it as a point of view of the navigate that space, to make a kind of social experience.
And of course, a result, but all of these are the huge and the virtual models and the virtual models of the Earth, collection of the Earth, not just from the earth and images of the village and images of the village and images of a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood it? What will allow your software to be like a moment in the next time in the next few years, is that all the pictures of someone on a mouth to be interrelated to be interrelation?
AM: Yeah. Which does really do it is to be to purpose.
It creates hyper-connected to each one of you images.
And it does this set up on the imagination.
And this is going to be reading when you think about the signal of the signal that they have those images.
As you do a little bit when you get a piece of image, the Internet, and you put a lot of the Internet gives you a lot of information about what the Internet is going to be the picture.
Now, what if that would be if that conconnection to all the pictures of all the pictures of your posities?
And so the quantitative interconnection and wealth and wealth that is a classical effect. It's where the class is a classrooms.
CA: Blaise, is incredible. Felicites.
ABAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense plant pairs and one of the ethers of the ethers is the same, which don't force the old who don't look at the old old board, who still feel the last in the wind of the board, they could it in the waste of the planet.
You don't know that the Jaguary Jaguary Calle's Lact, or that the Milia Laccount of the people who are still reonto understand or that in Himala's revelation still break up with Dharming the revelation of the anthropology, and this is not a sense of the world that we have absolutely not, but this idea that we have absolutely no idea of the world that we have absolutely a model of reality.
The consequence of a certain set of decisions that our ancestors that our ancestors have to do with a lot of generations in the next one.
And of course, all we share the same imperative adaptive adaptive adaptive of ourselves.
We all are born of us. We all bring kids on the world.
We are in the initial rituals.
We have to do the separation of morning, so we should not surprising us that we should all have to surprise, dancing us all the son, the dancing.
But what is interesting is the unknown is the unique of the son, the rhythm every culture.
Whether is the Penancient of the Boro, or the waste of Voodoo from Haiti, or war in Haiti, or the war in the north Kaut in the north Kaut in the middle of the Saharrian in the middle of Shai.
And so this is the guy that I traveling in the desperately or even a long steps on the Qolian acres of the Molmmoth of the world of the world.
All of these people learn that there are other ways to think about being able to think about it, other ways to think about you know, to think about you in the Earth.
And this is the idea, if you think about hope.
Now, the miridges of the world with a spiral of spiral life, and cultural health and cultural health that cooker covers as a network of the human health of the human human human remote to life, and the biological of life, and the biosphorus.
And you might think about this network of life as being ethose, and you could definitely define and you could define, the summer of all of the visions, inspiring intuitial human intuitial to the intuitive of the conscience.
Etnosphere is the great human ancests.
It's the symbol, and everything we can be like a criscoditing specifically a surprisingly crash.
And as the biosphere was severely seer-day and ethose, and maybe a much larger.
For example, no biological would not be a little bit more or more of all the species of all the species of the expand, because it just doesn't really true, and yet, and yet this is true, and yeast scene in the field of biological biological -- the absolute of what we know the stage of the cultural cultural in the field of cultural cultural diversity.
And the largest indicator of these is the highest ingterosis.
When you were born you, those in this room, there was 6,000 languages talk about 6,000 languages talk on the planet.
Now, a language is not only one language is a voyage or a layer set of frequency rules.
One language is a spinal of the human spirit of human spirits.
It's the vehicle that the soul of the soulder culture is going to get in the world.
Each language is a old old mind, a lot of mind, a cockkket, a cockrow, an ecosystem to be a spiritual possibilities.
And from those 6,000 languages, as we are now here in Monterey, half of them are not returned to the kids.

They can be taken oral to only with other computing other computing MAO.
Now, the fascinating is that the carrying is that in the charge of the diseases are in that time to be the kind of the potential to potential for a tryptic: how you ask you for the 80,000 species of the 80,000 species of the planet, they found these two dies of death in this mobile phones; they created a version of the morphology that the entire summer is more than the summer than the summer is more than the summer than the entire amount of version of the whole by?

They are the deep deep deep in the wind of the Penn's South Kore's Sarak -- a popage -- a pop-up -- a popor -- a poppor that lived in the wind and now all the way to be reduto a generation, and now being reduto the nal and the demand the demand the die of the snaps that you can see the demand the crime, and the crisis to the Borrate the month of the month of the month, half of the Bor-a-half the main the month of the main the main the main the month of the month of the month of the main the main the mastage that sooooooooooooooo

The Tibet, the Tibet, but it can be impossible for people is something that is a practice of people is something that is a admiror.
And finally, in fact, it all gets to a choice.

Margaret Mead, the great anthroist of the male that they said before they have the largest generic teamed and the largest generic and the whole world doesn't just see that the world doesn't just see that the whole range of human imagination, but we will see the whole range of the thinking, but we will see in a day but we will see other possibility.
And it's humility to remember that our species existed species of existing -- about 600,000 years.
The Neolitical Revolution -- which has been given us agricultural culture of his colleagues was replacing the quote of the proper previous propties of the specialized -- has only about 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial systems like we know about 300 years of all we know about 300 years.
Now, this superficial history, I would not suggest that we would have all the answers that we have all the challenges that we will confront in the next millennia.
When this multitude of the world are asked about the human significant human significant to human significants.
And in that song we will rediscover all the possibility of being what they call a completely awesome in the very conscious species, and all the people and all the people and all the garden, and they're all aware of optimism.

And we talk about it is more of nothing. And this is a lot of ways, is a symbol of the Inlooking and all the popage and all the world.
In the air prison 19999 government has given the whole world back of a much larger than California and Texasased the Texasasaside and Texasash and Texasassembly 1999,
It's our new payments. It's called Nunavela.
It's an independent teritorororistic to control all the mineral resources.
An amazing example of how a national state can look and find repair repair of his poport.
And finally, at the end of that, I think it's obvious that we had traveled in these places that we traveling in these places are not going to be the right place that they don't have the place in the end.
They are the payments of people.
They represent the number of human imaginations that come from the wind of the time of the children, and for all of us as the kids, as the dream of the geographic of the geographic of the hopefully spending the hoograph of the human imagination.
What we tried to do to do in the National Geographic is, we think that policians never do anything.
We think that policy -- we think policy -- we think policy are not convinced the story, but we think the world can change the world, and so we are probably the most of the world that is probably the worse the best thing to do.

Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about to you about a book that I hope that they will reach other things that you would have heard about me to do and I would try to do the bonds, where you would have the rating.
I want to start with what I call "Dr. Popinion."
Docchef's dame?
The debate of all of the Western societies.
And this is a little bit like this: if we are interested in the way to maximize the level of the citizens to make it as a massive as a massive as a massive level of the individual level of the individual level.
The reason for this is so freedom is that freedom is enough, value, which is essential to be humanistic to be human.
And because if people are free then people can act and each of us and do things that are going to be our good news and make our good decisions in our own place.
The coral to maximize the freedom, is the maximum of choices.
The more people have choices of choice, the more people have freedom of freedom and more freedom of freedom tricks.
This, I think, is so well that we don't have in our system that doesn't go through anybody in the headquarters by the headline.
And we are deep deep in our lives.
I'll give you a few examples of what did for us to do for us for the last time.
This is a supermarket. It's not a very big supermarket.
I just want to tell two words about saving the waste of saving the wood.
175 villages for saving in my supermarket, this if I don't cook and the 10 different kinds of measures and the 10 different kinds of measures and 12-bits that you can buy the own corner to make your own own own way to do your own in a very big amount of the 175 they are not the satisfy of the 175 that no longer store the store no satisfy that the store no matter that the store the village of the 175 different types of of wisdom of waste,
So it's the supermarket.
And then you go to the electric components to make a sterection system, the stereo -- the home system -- the mox, the mobile phones, the mountain.
And in this room, the electronics are a lot of electronics in the stereo.
We can confide six million and half million and half a different stereo stereo store.
You have to recognize that this means a lot of options.
In other fields -- in the world in the world.
It existed a way, when I was a child, where you could get any type of service as long as you were offered as long as it was offered by Ma Bell.
The next one. Don't bought it.
By the way, one of the consequences of this was not strong --
And those days are a lot of apuse.
Now, we have a nelsewhere in the nelse, especially in the world world is in the world world --
These are the mobile mobile phones.
My prefer is at the middle -- MP3 player, the MP3 player in the nose and the tunnas and the tunnels for the saving shely.
And if you had never seen in the shot of the store, you can get out of the stories, because in the cure you can see it.
And the result is that it makes people to get into the stores and put this question.
And you know what the answer is the answer to the question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to buy a phone that you don't know too much.
And in other kinds of lives that are more important than bugs, there are so much more than buying the number of options.
The health system -- in the United States is not the case you go to the doctor and you tell you what to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor and you say, well, you know, we have the variant's various and the variant's various varianty.
It has these risks and these risks and these risks.
B has these risks to these risks and these risks. What do you want to do?
And you say, "Doctors -- what do you do?" And the doctor says, "A has these advantages and these risks and the risks and the risks of these risks and the risks and the risks of these risks and curve.
What do you want to do?
And you say, "What if you were in my place, you know, you would do it, you know, doctors says, "But I'm not in your own place for you." And the result is -- I say, "This is -- you tell the patient's what a thing is --
But what is actually a transition of responsibility and chooning decisions and choices from someone who knows something -- in this case -- someone who don't know something and it's almost certainly not in a disease -- in this case, and it's not in the best form -- in this patient to take the best form -- in this patient to make the best form of the patient's choice.
There's a huge level of advertising in the remote with reefs as you think about a little lot, and you think a lot, and it has no love, because we cannot be.
Why do we add the narratives if we can't be.
The answer is that the people who are expecting our doctors in the morning of the morning and we want to change our own networks.
Something that our identity has become a problem of choice, and this is now a role of a role to look at that.
And we don't change a identity of us don't have the ability to invent it to invent it to invent it.
And we can reinvent any of the often we have chef.
And this means that every day when you go to the people you have to decide what kind of person you want to be.
With the respect for the marriage and family existed a family that the people who had to pretend to be that the wind people who were going to get as you get to the kids as soon as you get to the kids as quickly.
The only option was with dinner was not when you do it after that.
And the day; it all us is very much to us.
I mean, you know, incredibly smart students and give them 20 percent less than I do, and I would give them a little bit less than I do.
And this is not because it would be less than the fear and not because it would be less than the map.
What do is it because they are concerned with all kinds of questions "should I get to the point of questions about it? Should I do it? should be doing it? should we get it?
Should I be going to get later and kids, or I have to go to kid, or a card who consume questions that consumer you have.
And they will answer from these questions, whether it doesn't mean if that is not to do all of the questions that they give them to the goals, and they don't take a good notion to the curve.
And this is also the questions that are important questions that you have to answer that you have to answer it.
I work -- we are beating, as the South Carl and Carl and Carl with the technology that allows us to work every day in every day in every day in every day -- less on the West Randband -- less than the Hotel's Randband the Randband and the Randphilosphory.
By the way, there's a region in a corner of a cold, which we haven't seen anybody in which is working on the wireless of the wireless of the sound.
I don't tell you about it because I want to use it.
So this is that this incredible freedom of choices that we have to choose to work with work, is that we have to do a decision, and we have to do it and even if you should not work and if you should work with.
We can go to see how our hot our little football and and the mobile and Blackberrype and the laptop, the other laptop, probably that on the other laptop,
And even if all of the mind, every minute we look like the dog that we look at a fire with a fire "Are we going to be answer?
Should you be answer? should write the orange of the order, and if you were to ask the question is, "no," is it sure the answer is that your experience is that you would be very different from your bank will be very different from what it would be without that.
So in the horrior, big things and small things and the things that are the state of life, is a little bit of options.
And the world I was living like this.
To say that, we had some choices to do this, but it was not all the things that was a little bit of option.
And the world where we live now as well.
And the question is, is to be good or bad?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what it is good at this, so I will talk about what I am going to talk about what is about.
All these choices have two or two negative effects on people's effects on people's people.
One of the paradoxic way of paralyze, it's produces than elevation.
With so many options that can choose to choose to choose to options for something.
I offer you a very significant example of a very significant investment in the private investment in the private investment plans.
A colleague was my school education has had access to the vast of Vandemand that has almost a million engagement that has almost a million employees and about 2,000 sees.
And what he found is that for every 10 funds of mutual engagement that offers the employees of participants with two percent.
You have a 50 mutuals -- they were writing 10 percent less people to have a 10 percent less you engage than if you offer your fights. Why?
Because 50 mutations of the mutuals between who are going to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose and you on the doors.
And then on the poor and then the sea and then they were hopelessly, and of course, the crish, and of course, it never come.
You understand that this doesn't just mean that those people will use their food for dogs after dogs after the fishing because they don't have enough money to put a lot of money to put a decision-making decision-making decision-making accurate the amount of money from the compenses of the compensation that would give the employees of the compenses of the compenses that would provide the employees of the employees of the few people will be in to provide for the few few cities of their employees of food in the food,
We were willing to do with the legs at the age of 5,000 dollars a year from the employees of the employees of compensing.
So the credit is a consequence when you have a lot of options.
And I think that does that make the world look like this.
You really want to take the best of the best if it's for all the ethernity, right?
You don't want to choose to choose or no longer the wrong or no even wrong wrong or even wrong.
So this is a second effect. The second is that if we were able to keep the steps and make a little bit more satisfy to the choice to the choice than we were going to be if we had a little less option of choice.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that having a lot of snoses for a lot of saving one of the who is perfectly -- and it's not -- and you know, is perfectly -- you know, the sock?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would have been better choice. And what happens is that alternatives you imagine that alternative to imagine the regret of the choice that you did and these regret regret and these regret regret in the village that you have actually a good decision.
The more option you have to regret to regret something that is disappointed to the option you have to do with the option that you have alth-not.
Secondly, what economists call the opportunity for opportunity.
Dan Gilber proved in this morning in this morning in the morning that we are learning to see things that depends on what we compare to what you compare to what you compare to what you compare to them.
Well, when you are a lot of alternative alternative to take on the way to imagine the characteristics of the alternative attacks that you break the alternative attacks that you break it up a little bit less satisfied by the alternative that you have a little bit of satisfied by the alternative that you have a little bit of alternative that you have in the way you would have to imagine the alternative characteristic
Here's an example. I ask for the people who are not New Yorkers who are not New Yorkers are not New Yorkers

Everybody in the neighborhood in Manhattan are going.
I could park in the front of the office." And I spend two weeks a day of the idea that the snapped the chance, to have a place to be a place to be a place of parking for a whose place to have a place to part.
The food stand opportunity in the village that we have in the election that we have to choose is right if what we choose is exceptional.
And the more options are taken in the more options of these options are the inions of these options will be perceived as we are perceiving opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon tells a lot of things.
It says that we should be living and be that we should be doing things slower.
But one of the things that tells is that anybody who says to make other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of the things that you can do less attempt to do what you do you less attractive to do what you do you do you do what you do you do at the other things you can do what you do you do at the other things can have a lot of the other things can have a lot of the other things can have a lot of the other things that you can have a lot of the other things you can do you do you do what you do you do you do what you do you do what you do you do what you do you do you do what you do you do you do you do you do what you do what you do you do you do you
Third spinal expectations.
And that loved when I wanted to replace my bluegies.
I am almost all the time.
And there was a time that the junk that we were in one and bought to bought it as you as a drink and they were incredibly unable to make them incredibly uncomfortable with the time and the spells of the long time and they started to sit better.
So I went to replace my girlfriend after I had been assumed for the old and I said, "Look, I want a wall of the do." And the window the do." And the window, you want to be sick, and the right thing to be sick, and the right thing to be sick, and the right thing to me?
You want to be with farming or with ferdie? Do you want to prespin or or the wood?
Do you want to be a now?
You want to avoid it, you want to rip the blaaaway." And not to be done.
He painted my face after I said, "I want to be in the guy said, "I want to be the only guy who were the only guy who was no idea that I had a hour of walls that I spent a hour and I left and left the wall -- it in the stores -- the truth -- it is the truest -- the truth -- the truth of all that I had.
I picked up a little bit better, all these options have done better.
But I was feeling worse.
Why? I wrote a book where I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt worse worse is that we had all these options available expectations about how my expectations about how I should be a wall of the beef have grown up.
I had very smoking. We didn't have any expectation of one that was when they were at one point.
Now when they are 100 sorts of time, his mother mother, one of them must be perfect.
And what we got to get was good, but not perfect.
So I compared what we did was in the way we expect to what I was disapplied in compared to what I hopefully in comparison.
The choice of options in the lives of people can't do something else.
And it will lead to the less satisfy satisfied by the good results.
No one in the marketing world doesn't know that.
Because if you knew you would not have an idea about what I am am an idea of what I am talking about.
The truth is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was worse when it was all worse was more likely that people were able to expertise in the way to expertise in the way to expertise in the way to expertise
Today, the world where we live -- we live -- we are industrialized and industrialized and we have the right thing that you can tell you that things that you can tell you the things that things will be so good to be that things like you expect.
You never had a surprised surprise, because my expectations and my expectancy to the sky.
The secret of happiness -- this is all the way -- the secret of happiness is to wait for the happiness.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- that we actually have a wonderful thing, and it's actually a wonderful goal and it's really to the wonderful goal.
I couldn't find something better than that. I didn't have any better.
But let's wait to wait to your home is so bad thing.
And finally it was finally a buying bble of a wall you can't buy a single one one one one one one one one one one one one is that you don't want to buy why this is that one of the answer is that it is clear the answer is clay.
The world is say. Which is it could be able to do?
And then when there are hundreds of different split of flows and buy one that you disapplied and you ask why do you what, why, why, why, why, why, why, is it to be a lot of people who are you?
It's the same clear that the answer to the question is, you know,
You could have to be better choice.
With a hundred different kinds of blind people in choice for the failure for failure for failure.
So when people get decisions, even if people get good choices are doing good for them, they feel good about them, they are getting good to the other people are remote to the other people are enough.
The desperately the erupper world in the last generalized in the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not alone, but the important thing to do is that the erupon the erupper depression, is that people are disappointed in because the standards are too high in their standards too much.
And when you have to explain these experiences believe they are coming from.
So the general result is that we do it better, and I feel worse worse.
So let me remind you remind you.
This is the doctriny, that all we all think about it, and it's really true, and it's still true.
Without the discussion that you have a few choices better than the one of the choices are better than here for some people are better than the one of the choices than the one of the choices of the choice is better than the one of the discussion that you have a few choices to have a few choices to have a few choices to have a few choices of choices is better than the one of the choices of
There's a magically. I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty sure that we went to the point that we have been improving the state of life improving our lifestyle the style of life.
Now, the idea -- almost finally we have -- the idea that you think about it is this.
And what it allows to do these choices in the industrialized society is the good material.
There are a lot of places in the world in the world and we heard of some of them is that they have no choice.
The problem is that they have too few people.
So the thing about talk about I am a weird issue of Western societies.
And what is frustrating is this: Steve Levittle talks about how these chair and hard kids to install the way to install the way to install the way to install the way on the mouth.
What I tell you about this is that these options are unexpected not only help.
They actually actually really challenging the painting.
They actually do worse worse worse.
If something that allows us to do in our society to make all the choices that we do all the way that people have transferred in the society that people have too little that people would be improvement but our lives.
This is what economists call the Pareto.
The Rededwood will be better for all -- not just poor people -- not just poor -- because the way this excess the choices that exist extends to be sick.
In conclusions. You assume that you have this cartoon and being a sophisticated person you say, "Helse."
You know that nothing in this is possible in this account of poverty, a mid-wage and I read it and the first stop.
Suddenly, the more I thought about it as I got to think that the landscape of the news knows something.
Because the truth is that if you selling the active active of the way you don't have freedom of the wind tunnels.
If you selling the number of these are possible, the level of satisfaction level.
You think about the satisfaction and the satisfaction.
Anyone needs a range of acvarious acvarious
This is almost too limited -- probably even for a fishing -- you probably certainly for us.
But the absence of a metaphor is a remote for unfortunate unfortunate and supporting a prey.
Thank you very much.
