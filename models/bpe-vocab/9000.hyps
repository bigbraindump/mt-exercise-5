The first thing I was the two of the two of the most important thing to the fossil of the death of the most important thing that was about the last year of the last 10 years, in the last decade of the last year.
But this is the great ideal of the most important thing that is not the most important thing of the fossil of the nanomorrooms.
The range of the fossil of a very simple system, which is the system.
He got the way to the death of the death of the wall.
The next thing about the great thing that you would have to be a very simple way to do what happened to the next thing about the last year.
The role of the fossil is the very rich of it.
You can see how the fishery of the wildly fossil the wood.
This is the sample of the wall.
And the thing is the door.
The lesson the room, a little bit of a few years ago or a few or you can see it is a little bit of a bunch of other than a poor in a bunch of other hand.
In the 17th century, this was a little bit of this --
This is a problem because it's a deep of the fossil of the the death of the most important in the middle of the middle of the wall.
When it's a very simple truck to the fossil in the room, when the fishing is the very different from the very different system.
The role of the role of the fossil of the systems of the world's population of the world.
The other hands of the fingerror in the middle of the New York is the size of the national bumbs is the same.
The Romert Bukketh of the first thing was in the 1970s was a very good at the end of the last few years of the last year.
Ok: Oh, yeah. This is a "Cy" is "the question.
And a little bit of a very simple thing called "Picy" is the "the wer" is the "the war in the room.
This is a little bit of the two of the two of the room.
But the little bit of a little bit more than that.
This is called Kylllen of the Golden called the Sylami Sylens.
You see how you can see how the fossil of the deep that the sample of this is the way to get this to the next thing to do.
These are very good news.
And the most important thing is the 21st century, the most important thing to do with the world.
The first people are a deep of the fossil of the nanomorrow is the saming of the wild of the national of the fishing of the fossil of the fossil of the deeper of the deeper of the wall.
This is the 17th of the most famous of the sample of the Sololiance.
In the January of the fossil of the death of the death of the things that you can see in the room.
3-year-old is the population of the world of the world in the road of the wildly of these fisherry.
In the cash of this is the fossil of the wild to this for this one.
The other thing is going to be the door.
But when you get the way to get the wild of the wild.
In the New York was a bunch of drug in the middle of the San Francisco of San Francisco.
This is the death of the death of the door.
And the things you see if you are the very different things.
In the role of the role of a fossil of the wildly of the wildly of the wild.
And the most important thing that have been the world's world's largest fossil and the same thing that is the same thing.
The two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the nurgy.
This is a very important example of a very simple idea.
You see the real thing that can be the most important thing you can do.
In the last few years of the two million dollars of the nanomorrow of 15,000 dollars in the middle of the city.
The problem is that you have to be the remarkable of the Politan Science and to go to the only one of the most important thing to do is a very role in the middle of the ocean of the world's largest role in the middle of the ocean of the world.
The most important thing is to the role of the systems of the systems of the human beings, which is about about 1,000 dollars a box.
The second is a very simple and the most important thing is the most important thing is the most important thing of the deep.
The United States is one of the two of the other side.
And the way was the way to be more than a lot of the deeper for the deep death
But we have a new way to be a very good thing.
This is the same of the last few years ago in the last decade of the most important thing to do.
There are a little bit of our brains in our own life.
And the first of the fossil and the fossil of a 25-year year year in the last year.
The role of the death is a little bit of a byet.
This is the good news.
In the way, the Rometery Bug Bang, a 30-year lambigues of the nanomorrow was a very good thing.
You know, you have to get the door.
This is the most important thing of the second remarkable of the second thing that was the first thing that was the Middle of the Cyrry.
One of the fingery of the death of the nanomorrow of the Crrro --
♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ It's a little bit about a bunch of poverty, and a little bit like this.
He is the most important thing to go to the U.S. and the system of the economy
The lesson the left of the finger, the way that you get the way to the way to the door.
He is the very range and the people who are the deep of the wildly fish.
The Ros: This is the most important thing about the Science of the Science of the Science of the Sciend.
The second thing of the most important thing is the deep is the "the God."
Syr: Srrrrrrrrrrrrro of Sololian S, Romano Bukka By of Gulf of my God's not to talk about what I do.
The second thing is like the Science of the Ross of the Ross of the second wood.
This is a little bit of a little bit of a year.
The other is the Romer: The RRRA new new new technologies that we can do something like a very important for our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own environment.
The question is, we are the deep is a very different way to the very different way to the return to the death of the death of the death of the fish.
The second is the great thing of the death is not the good.
We think we are a little bit -- and they were very good and they are doing it.
I don't like to be a new way to change the way to change the world.
You know, we're going to do this with us.
She's the Milic: You know, you know, a little bit of a little bit of my daughter.
So you can see a little bit of a bunch of deeper in this rooms of the wildly fish.
The les: The great is that it's a very good thing.
But this is the great idea.
And in the way, the things that is a very range of the human beings, the rrole of the system, which is a new new way to be the way to do something like this.
The problem is that you have a very important thing is about the real thing that is the dead.
The first thing of course, is the most important thing to be the most important thing to the system of the system of the system of the system.
S: The Romer: The only is the United States, the economy of the brain system, the system of the system.
The thing that is the way to get the deep of the death of the fossil of the fossil of the wild; but the same.
But now we have a solution to the restrict for the deeper to the death of the death of the wall.
You know, you know, in the United States of a billion dollars in the country.
A year of the U.S. and then then then we are going to do the way to make the remarkable to be the very role of the system.
In the way, a solution is a very important thing to do with us to be able to do it.
You know, you know, you can see the whole lot of the fish.
The Dr. S: This is the last year.
S: The other is the great idea. It's the most important thing of the first of the first time of the first of the first of the first of the first
One of the most important thing of the most important thing I was the most important thing of the fossil of our own own own own own system, which is the same called the world. It's called the world.
By Byy: We are the people to use the wildly to use the wall.
Romer: You see the role for for America. It's the time for the deep.
The Ros: The one of the great thing that is that the role of a fossil to me to tell you about the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the same in the same way.
You want to go to the door you want to get the do."
We need to be a lot of time.
I mean, you know, you know, you know,
The first day I was a Bill in the MRRRR.
And I was going to go to a little bit of a new way to be able to do this in this way.
So the great thing for the people that were not the same thing that was the most important thing is that the most important thing that was the most important thing -- the Scivil of the 17th century of the 25th of the 25th of the 25th of the 25th of the last year -- the last 10 years, the next 10 years, the second second second year ago of the world's largest est est est est est est est est est est in the last 10 years,
It's very simple.
This is the sample of the Gol.
We have the two of these are called the Ross of the Ross of the wood.
I am to tell you about this is the Middle East Cyrrrrro -- 113 miles of the 17th century of the Simililild of the Similililancy of the Simililan to the Simililililility of the Saharan Francisco to be the end of the Corge.
The 1-year-old old man was the first thing to go to the first time for the first time.
And this was the first of the SSSSSSSS.
It was a very different way to the return to the way to be the way to be the way.
It's a second of the first of the death of the death of the national of the County of the County in the Cyrro in the Middle East of the Simililille of the wall.
In other words, I was looking at the end of the 17th of the same, which is a good way to do something like a very good thing.
I don't know if you were the most important thing or not, or when he was the end of the first time to go to the first one of the first one of the first thing that was the first one of the first thing that was going to be the first one of the first time.
It is going to be a new model of the brain of the brain is the real system of the death of the death of the death of the deep.
And after a few of the problem I had a very good question, which was going to do these -- these are the very big -- these are the great idea.
The lesses of 13 million people in the lab of the death of the death of the way to be the way to be the dogs.
Now, the government has been the people who can go and say, "You can't tell you "get the deeply of the wild."
But we can do this for the same thing as a little bit of the death of what they are the death of the death of the wall.
So this is the 21st century, a little bit of the death of the death of the death of these fishery can be the same.
In a few of the people of the two of the 2..5 percent of the Middle was a dead.
So this is the sample of the same, and the two of these two re-and-houses of the death of the deber.
This is the same thing.
This is the more important thing that you have the deeper of the death of the two of the two of the same, and it was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a year.
So we have a little bit of about about 2.5 percent.
I had to go to the fit and what I was going to do.
I have the fossil of the house.
And now we are the great idea.
The second is the called the Golden Bug Banger CC.
We can use the death and we have to go to the same thing to do with the death and we can use the idea of the problem.
Now, the most important thing that is that the most important thing to do is to be the real world and the brain of the brain system, and it's going to be the way to be the way to be able to be the way to be the dead.
I think that the thing is that the way to be the way to be the way we have this idea of this is that the Middle East CDI.
We want to go to a little bit of a little bit of a Polololiancy of the Syra -- I think of the deeper of the death of the fossil of our own own own own own deeper and the way we are not just a lot of people who are not just a lot of our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own way to be a lot of our own way to be a lot of our own new way to do with the same thing for our own life of our own own own own own own own own own own own own own deal-of-of-of-of-and-bypomattraction, and the same thing that we don't have been reach, and our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own
Thank you very much.
I want to go to the hit to be able to go to the best, when you look at the end of the door.
The way you see what they are going to go to the step, and you can go to the way to get to the way to get to the way to get to the same thing that you can see the same thing that you can see the same thing that we can see the same thing that we can do.
The death of the death is the deep of a very simple way we do a very different way.
And I mean, in the fossil of the National Science of this is the most important thing that is a very different way of the most important thing -- and I was a great deal of the Scivil in my own own own sketch in the room, and we could get a little bit of a bunch of other words, and we could actually get a little bit of a fishing -- and then we could actually get a bunch of other hands to do this in the end of the end of the end of the fill, and we could actually -- and then we could be a little bit of the deepepepepepepepillustrugglaccountilillustrahead of a couple of a couple of a base of a very few years olololder der der der der der der der der der der der der of a gain, and then we could actually a little bit of the ung in the
She's going to do it?
The question was that the great thing that I was the remarkable to the world in the world of the world that is the "the "the Give the wood.
In a little bit of a deep death of a very important way to a little bit of a bunch of a bunch of the room.
They can be the way to be the deep that the death of the death of a deep that a bunch of poverty, and a role in a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of a fish.
The more important is that it's not just like the same, like the wildly you can see it in the room.
And the role of the brain is the human being-based properties of the very different system.
In these things are the very different kinds of details of the deep death of the people who are a very good newspaper and we can use them in our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own dealisol
I'm going to go to the death of the deep.
This is the great thing is to be the good news, and if you look at a time in a bunch of other hand, if you look at the end of the most important thing to the other hand.
These are the same thing is a very different from a very different way.
So if you go to a lot of people are all the time.
You know, it's the deep to the way to be able to be the dead and the remarkable to be the dead.
And you can see the death and the role of the wild.
We have been a lot of the things that we can actually use a lot of things that we can use the death of the death of the death of a deep that we have a little bit of a bunch of paper and a bunch of other hand.
In the case, we have two of the Scivil of the fossil and the fishing and the next day to the next day to the next day to me to the next generation.
I mean, we can actually very much more than the door in the room.
There are also a lot of things to be able to be able to be able to be the way to be the way to do the way to do the way to do the way to do it in the way we want to be the best way to be the best way to be the best way to be the way to be the best way to do.
So this is a bunch of a bonon-h-h-and-called a very simple way to be a very good thing.
This is a little bit of a little bit of a very simple way to the Science and the Science and the Solol.
And the most important thing was a little bit of a bunch of poverty, and every single day and the Science of the fishing of a little bit of a little bit of a bunch of other words.
And then the second thing that is about the second thing that is a bunch of other than a deep death and a new way to be the way to be the way to do.
Thank you.
These are the great idea. It's the kids that were going to get the Middle and the Middle and I would go to a little bit of a very good way to get a very good thing.
He was a little bit of a little bit of it.
And one of the things that are the most important thing is to do is not just a lot of people who don't have to do with some of the things that are going to be very important in many different countries.
All you have to be "It's called "God," and it's going to be the way to do what it is.
This is the people are going to be the deep of the door.
This is the most important thing that is our own own own deeper in the room.
It was just like to be able to be a little bit of a bunch of deeper in a very different way.
So it was just a little bit of my life.
This is a very different of the deep of the product of the death of the brain.
We wanted to be a very important for the people that are going to be the way to be the brain.
And this is a little bit of a bit.
He can go to the way to the fish, because he was the remarkable of the wildly the wild.
That's the good.
Sililil: The Grush.
♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫
Serr: The Polity;
The other thing --
When the Give of the fossil and a church of a fishing that can be the way to be the great question.
SM: She's going to be the fish.
S: Srrrrry.
SM: It's a story of a little bit of the way to make the way to be the dead.
Skkkkkkkkk!
SM: Since in the case of the idea that is a very important thing that is a very important that we have the received that we have been able to return to the fit in the road and the wildly and the wildly and the wild of the wild.
Every few of these different different different kinds of different things.
And you can see the fossil in a very role in a bunch of other hand.
You know, the cools of the Science of the Science of a national role of a death of the death of the death of the death of the death
The thing is the way that you can see the death of the death of the death of the death of the wall.
You know, you can see a very simple and then a little bit of a bunch of poverty for the door.
The thing is the surface of the system that is the remarkable and the remarkable to the sample of the war to the BBBy to the BBBBy to the BBBBB.
Trrr: She's a little bit of a second of the second of the first phabitat a bunch of other hand, a a little bit of a little bit of a lot of time.
Now I'm a little bit of a little bit of it.
She's the "Piiiive the wild"
And the great idea, I want to tell you the samp to the war to the return to the way to be the way to the remote to the way to be the way to the way to be the way to the door.
She's the great idea, you can see the fossil of the fossil of the fossil in a very different way.
S: The other question: You know, you want to see the sample of the death of the death of the death
S: The other GP: You can go to the same.
So we don't have to be the same as a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the wall.
Now, in the room, you can go to the sample of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild.
Thank you very much.
And when you look at my favorite is the way to make our own own own own way to make the way to make the way to make the way to our brain.
And I was able to go to a bunch of the fossil of this is the way to the way to get the way to the return that into the room.
The next thing I want to be the way to do is to be the way to do this in this new new new systems that are the most important thing that are going to be the same way that are going to be the same way to our own world to be the same way to our world in our world in our own own own own world.
You know, you know, you know, a little bit more than a little bit of it.
These are the death of the wants to go to the door.
I'm the good.
He said, "This is a lot of question, but it's a lot of time in the way.
It's my favorite fishing and the death of a little bit of a bunch of other hand.
And it doesn't mean that it is to be the way to be a little bit of it.
But these are the good thing that is that the one of the thing that was the mountain of my daughter that he was called my bypes of the war in the room.
And the thing is that the first thing I was going to be the great role of the fossil of the Romorrow the "Bass" -- the most important thing to the world with a bunch of people who had a little bit of the world of the world -- and the first time of the world that was a very important thing to do.
The next thing is to do with the best way to see when people are going to be the same.
Since -- the yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The question is, you know, you can see the fossil and you know that it's not the good news, you don't have a lot of you can do the right thing to do with it?
You don't know how to go to the sample of the wild of the death of a little bit of a little bit of a bunch of people who did this in the world that are going to do this in the world in the world that we have to do this in the world in the world in the world.
It's very simple,
But it was a lot of time if you don't have to get the time to talk about about about about 10 years ago when we were able to talk about the stuck -- I was a little bit of a bunch of other people who were going to get the same thing that we were able to get the same thing that I was a little bit of the deeper of the most important thing to do with the same thing that we were in the same way to the same thing that was a lot of the same thing that we were in the world.
And people said, "Is it not just like to be a lot of you don't have a very important thing that would be the same way that do you know what do you do?"
Do you know what the door of the dogs of the do?
Do you don't know how to be the deep that the very role of this conference of this is not a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of role in the launched of the wild?"
It's a good thing.
The question is, the answer -- the best thing to do with these questions is "the question."
Yeah, it's the way to these things.
And he had no one of my life.
And you know, it's a lot of the way to other things that we can't get the other people who can't get them to them.
As a new new idea, and they're all the other words.
But when I was looking at the end of the question, I was talking about the last thing that is the last thing that is the last year.
Is it something that is something about it?
It's the way to be able to get to the way to be able to get the way to get a place to a place in this room.
And what is the very important thing that is that the way to do it as a very simple thing that is the remarkable to get a lot of the people who don't have a lot of people who don't have a lot of people who don't have a lot of people who don't know what the other people are not going to do with other people who don't know the other wor?
My mother was a lot of people was not the brain of the brain, and you don't have the first time to get the human beings, if you were not just a new new new model to be a new new model of the brain, if you have a new new new technologies that is a new new model of scientific fic scientific fic fic system.
I don't have this -- how do it -- how to go to the brain of the brain system?
It's not just like this.
But as we have to be the human brains like the other hand, like the other side.
We are the fossil of this is not the most important thing to the Russians are not the best thing to do with this kind of a very good thing.
And so we have to be the great thing to do is the called the "the wild" in the 17-year-old red, and the next generation of the sample of the box, and they were able to get the stuck of the wood.
And it turns out that they didn't have to be able to be able to be the way to be the dead of the death of the door.
The first one of the fishery of the last few years ago he said, "This is a little bit of my favorite motor in my own own bad."
A very big big death of the first thing is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a bunch of it.
But they don't have no remote when we look at the end of the time I found that we were all the things that we have to go to the same as a result of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the fact that they are going to be a very death of the same thing that we are in the world to be a lot of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea
And the question is, I want to do a lot of time in this case, you can see this kind of like this is the real real real question?
You know, it's the very range -- as a little bit of the sample of the sample -- I don't know this --
I think it's a little bit of it.
And I think it's not the fishery and you don't want to be a second second second in the future.
I think it's a lot of us as a deep of the brain of the brain
And I mean, you know, my favorite -- my favorite -- my favorite -- I would be very difficult to go to the row to the road to this room, this is the end of this is the time in the middle of the first time that I was the first time to be the first time in the middle of the time that I was going to get the next thing to do.
For example, there are a little bit of a half of the year in the country.
I have a 30-year-old daughter of the children of them.
And it's very important to tell you about this little bit of this -- this is the best thing to do with the end of the first thing that was the first of the last day -- you know, what is the last year of the last year.
What I would be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of this -- -- this is that the most important thing to do is to be the most important thing to be the most important thing to do.
Oh, yeah, what do you do."
This is the way that you could do it in the road to the end of the day and the day I don't want to talk about this to me to think about this thing.
I will go to the end of this is the death that he said, "
And here is the question of the question?
And so I have a lot of the finger of the death that was to be able to be able to be a little bit of a very important thing to do with a new way to do with a new way to do with the deeper than the rest of the world.
I had a little bit of a little bit of a fossil of a fossil of my favorite -- and my favorite thing to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to do it.
And as we did it all the last year of the last few years ago I was going to go to the most important thing to do with other than we could be able to be more than we could be able to be able to be able to use the new way to be able to get the way to the things that we could be the way to use our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own new new new new new technologies to be to be able to be able to be the way to be the same same same for the same
The next thing was called the Golden and Science and the Science and the wood.
So the fossil of the deeper of the death of the death
But my favorite route and the Ross and the Polititititory of the brain that are not the best of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the do?
People who had a new idea, a little bit of the death that they are going to get a little bit of a little bit of a bunch of people and the same.
The lessons were the great thing to the human beings, the human beings.
The fossil was to be because it was a deep that it was a deadly release of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the wall.
The first thing was the same and the same thing that was a great idea, but the brain is the human beings.
What is the great thing that is that the most important thing that was a deeper of the brain is a very good way to be the very good thing.
They were able to be a very simple way to be a very simple way of the death of the death of the fossil of the fishery of the fishing of the fossil of the death of the death of the death of the death of the people who are the death of the death of the deep of the deeping of the death of the people who are the same as a result of the death of the people that are the remarkable to the reach to the same on the road, and
This is the fossil -- this is that the great thing that I was the only thing to do -- that is the only one of the way to get the same thing that is the way to be the same thing that is the best way to do.
And the world is going to be the way to be the good thing about it?
So the range of the fossil in a lot of time like a little bit of a very good question, right?
And the first thing was was not the fossil of the death of the world that would be the same as a new way to do this in this room that is the way that they are going to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to do.
The first thing was a little bit of a very good newspaper of a bunch of other do?
The first thing that was like the Politchery of the death of it.
They were going to get the Middle for a few years ago for the time.
And then my favorite and the great thing that is a very important thing that is a very important thing that is to go to the next generation of the first thing that we can get the next generation of the world in the middle of the first time to the same thing that we have to get to the same thing that we have to get to the same way to the next day to the same thing that we have to get the same time to the same thing that we were in the same way to the same thing that we have to do with the same way to the same time to do with the next c
It was the human beings, and people have to go to the way to the brain that is going to be the way to be the best way to the deep in the way.
And the first thing I have been the first time to go to a place in a new way to the idea of the human beings, to a range of the gene.
And it will be the same, I think it was a very different way.
The role of a little bit of a deep or a little bit of a very simple thing that is that the remarkable and the fishery and the fossil of the fossil of the fossil of the deeper of the deeper of the death of the death of the death of the deeper of the fine of the fine of the deeper of the fine of the death of the death of the deeper of the tomorrooms of the fine of the tac
It's like you can see how the wildly the wild.
It is not the fossil and the fishing and the invisible of these invisible invisible reference.
I think the most important thing that is a big bunch of other side of the last last year.
Well, if you think about it, and I think about the question is, I mean, what do you do you do it?
Can we do all these things do it?
Maybe we can use the details of the deeper and the other people and the death of the death of the debate.
You know, it's not going to be true.
Maybe we can't be able to get the way to the human beings, a new way of our own mind.
And it turns out that the people who are going to get the question, the thing that is the best of the death of the fossil of the people who are in the rooms of the children and their own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own time.
It's not just a bunch of church that you can see this is the truth.
But what is the question I want to do with this -- right?
Why don't we do it?
For example, like a lot of more than we found something that we did something like what we call the re-in-in-re-re-re-re-re-effective reference.
The question is, what is that the way to be the way to do something that -- -- this is that the most important thing -- that is not just the way to be the very important thing to do.
And now you can see the death of the fossil of the wild.
I had a little bit of a fossil in the United States that I was the United States of the United States of the United States that was the first time to be in the middle of the day and the day and he was able to go to the row up to the first time and he was a hour to go to the first time and the day and he was a hour to go back to the end of the end of the day and he was the time to the fishing and he was a little bit of the end of the day and he was in the end of the end of the road.
The first thing was like a bunch of deeper in the room.
And it turns out that the wildly of the two of the house.
The thing I mean, for the fossil of the wildly fossil the wood.
In fact, the way, it was a very important thing that I mean, and you know, "Poliiive your ey."
And the fishing to the road to the road and the fossil and a conference of a fossil in a bunch of time to the fishing and a bunch of time and to get a little bit of a bunch of time and a little bit of a bunch of them in a bit.
The other is not just the very big fishing to the war and the wildly and the fishing and the fishery of the fishing and the fishing of the wild of the fossil of the wildge of a bunch of other hand.
They were all the time -- and I don't have a little bit of this -- I would be the story of the story of the story of the story of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a dead.
The first day of my favorite route and the fishing and the remarkable to the return to the next thing to the story of the story of the story of the story of the most important thing to the most important thing to the most important thing to the most of the most of the most important thing to do.
The lesson the surface and the wild of the wild of the wildly and the wall.
In fact, the most important thing of the death of the death and the way that the first thing that was the first time in the first one of the first thing that was the first one of the first thing I was the first thing of the first thing of the first time.
And I was like, "This is the very good newspaper, the way that was the real thing that is the real real real system.
My mother is not the way to be the way to be the dog."
I'm a little bit of the things that you have to go to the same on the same way to get the same thing to do with the same thing.
But it turns out, it was a little bit of my own life. I was going to get this in that way.
And I see the way that they were all the time.
I was looking at the same time, and I had a new new new way to do it in a way to be a little bit of a bit.
And what is the question of it?
And how do it in the way we should be able to get the way to do this with the details to do the death of the fill?
For me, the most important thing is our own own way we have to talk about how the RII, the idea that we were going to do a little bit of a bunch of the fishing in the middle of the street.
I was the best thing to do with this was a very good ball of the death of the death of the death of the fine of the fishing of the fishing of these invisible replication of these are very unusual red.
The first thing was the mountain of the finger, and a second story of the story of the story of the "Bug and the Bug and the way it was really exciting to be the way to be the way to do.
In the way, a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a bunch of the fishing and the way to the reach of the death of the death of a bunch of poverty, but it is not a good thing to do.
It doesn't have no route or not the fish.
The thing I call it a bunch of a bbbbbbbbbb, and a little bit of a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of paper.
They're not not a little bit of a bunch of poverty.
And in the way to be a little bit of a bunch of poverty.
He was the great thing that is that the system that is something that we have been so many of us and so on.
He said, "Look at the end and said, "You can do you know what you do?"
"Can you get to a bunch of a bunch of you can get a by?"
If you want to be the way to get the way to the way to go to a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
And you know, it was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a bit.
You know, it was the hurt of the Bankkk!
The third thing is the same thing that has been the same thing.
It doesn't have no one of the way to be the way to be able to be the way to be the way to be the way.
But the most important thing and the fossil of the housin the first time that he was the best of the fossil in the room, and he had to go to the fit was a little bit of a very fishing to be a very good for a very long time to be a very good way to be a very range of the city.
It could be the role of the very range of the fishing of a fossil of a death and the fishery of the death that was not just a little bit of a little bit of a very good thing.
And when I was talking about the story of a little bit of a little bit of what I was doing a little bit of a kid.
This is the remarkable to me to the last year called "Womano San Francisco and I was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a fishing of a little bit of a fossil of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a very good way to the deepil
It doesn't have been a very good thing that was going to be the door.
I have to think about it as a hole and not to be the same thing.
I saw my favorite my daughter and I was going to go to the wall.
I was looking at the end of the wild and I was a dead, and I was a bunch of the box.
I said, "What do you know is ""Wom," and I said, "We are you going to do this -- if I don't have a little bit of my own life.
For example, you can see a little bit of a little bit of a lot of time and I just just like to be a lot of time and not just like this.
I mean, if you want to be more than you want to do you to do the way to do the way to do the right thing to do.
And it doesn't mean a little bit about it, you can see a little bit of a bunch of paper
He said, "We are going to get this for my favorite thing.
And I want to be the fishing for my favorite thing to do with my daughter.
Because the Romery is -- two years ago, the first time of the United States of the U.N. We have to go to the U.N.
And they were very important for the other question, for the people who were the people and they were the best thing to do.
But the more interesting than a very important thing and a very simple way to the death of the world that is the same thing.
I'm going to show you the way to tell you about the way to get a little bit of a little bit more like a little bit of a very good thing.
It's like the time to be the deep of the fossil of a very simple way to do something like about about 1,000 times more than the other words,
The one of the way to be a little bit of the deep.
It's the way to get the samp of the fossil of the wildly of the wall.
In the way, when people are going to be the people who had been the goodby.
And the finger of the finger and the fish. "God of the Midd," "Hy," he said, "Wom."
It's the God.
A very small thing is -- when they were the great thing -- the Golden By Sweight and this is the one of the day and the first one of the day of the first day of my daughter of the Sylame, "Holly."
and they are the time in the room, and they get the wildly and the wild.
In Solol, a little bit of a very good way to be a very simple way to the "Give the "Gol, "Hy," he said, "Yes, "Yes, you know, the great thing --
It's the good newspaper -- the God of Godby.
It's a very good for for that.
But the second thing that is the second of my favorite of the death of the death is the great thing to be a little bit of a 1-year-old is not a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the Science of the Science of the Science of the Science of the name.
It's a little bit of a deep and that is the human genes and they could not be the way to be able to get the to.
I could not be like to be the "West, when the "West, and then you want to be able to be able to be able to get the do?
It's true.
It's a very different way of the deep of the death of the brain is the possibility.
But you can't have a very good way to be a very good way to think about the most important thing to do with the most important thing that you can get the deep in the way to the way to the way to the door.
Maybe you might be like to be the very range of fishing a death to be a dead to be the sample of the deeper of the way to be the way to be the way to be the best way to get the way to the deeper and they were all the way to be the way to the deeper and the way to the door.
And as we are doing this very important to be the way to be able to be true.
I saw my daughter and I have a little bit of the last year that was the last thing that was a great deal with a deep that he had a bunch of the fishing of the fossil in my own own own deeper and my favorite role in my own own own own own own own own own own own own own deeper in my own own own own fish.
And what I was looking at the end of the finger of the death of the details of the goods.
It doesn't have no one of the Grushing the God of the GPS or you are going to be able to be able to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the good.
You know, you know, the death of the goods.
The Politchen and the Politititory is the the the death of the death of the fishing for a little bit of a bunch of people in a bunch of other hand, and then you get the deeper and said, "You know, "Wat."
And if you think about the way to be the door.
And all of these daughter.
I think these things that I should be able to be able to be able to do.
My husbb, because you have a little bit of a finger for a sample of the fossil of the wildly to the wall.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Jan: The Sylen:
I saw some of the same thing about the human genomes and the human beings that could be the best thing to do with our own own own brain.
Now we have a lot of about a new way of human being: we have to do this with this kind of a death and we go to a new way to the new way to the way to the way to the deep and the way to the door in the way to the deep death of the death of the death of the deeper of the deeping of the deeping of the fine and the
I went to the questions to talk about the question.
"What is the most important is that I think about some of the deep to the other side.
I went to the different way to the other thing to the deeper of the death of the death of the deep.
We are very much more than 10 years ago.
When I was the great rural of the gene of the world -- the world of the world in the world of the world in the world.
Now what do we can do the human being: we can use the same or of this or in this case, or this is the most important thing about the problem.
This is a very small range of the Polololiances of the human genomintuition to a very different way to the only one can be the only one of the only one can be the only one of the only one can be the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of
We started to see if we can see a lot of a different gene.
We have been going to get a half a million dollars in the middle of the human genomes that are the second thing that are there.
But when we look at the fossil fuels is very much more than our own life.
It's a little bit of a very simple thing.
But when we can see all the human brains that we can see a little bit of a very important thing that is that a little bit of a national bad.
So I decided that I was just a place that is that we can use this to be the great role to do something that we can do in the same way to the same thing that we can see the same thing that is the most important thing about the most important thing about the most important thing about the question.
And so I started to tell you how we can we see a range of the wild?"
Maybe they can be the very different different different different different from the very different that we didn't know what they did they do it?
And if we can see a church of the wilds?
A little bit of a little bit of a very simple solution is a very different kind of a very different kind of a very different way.
So our own own mind-fashioned a war to a bunch of the fish.
Our new new is to be the remarkable that is really quite a little bit of a very good thing.
The first thing I was a little bit of a byet.
I started to see the 10 years of life.
I was a few weeks ago, in fact, in a bunch of other hands that they are going to do the same thing.
But it turns out that the brain is the human genuually is very simple.
I'm a hundred million people who are in the world in the world of the CCCCC, but a few of the same thing that is a very important thing that is a lot of time in a lot of time in a lot of time in a lot of time in a lot of time in a lot of time in a lot of time.
So we had to do a new new new new way to be able to get the very good news.
This was the first of our first invisible is the real way to the human beings, the redient of the Cyrrry.
It's a very simple way that the wild;
I did the reminded up the most important thing that I was a great deal of the system, and we have a new new new system.
The thing I was the person who I was the very important thing that we were able to get the very important thing to go to the row up to this room, and this was the remarkable to get this in the room.
The range of the range of the wild of the wild and the role of the patient and the patient.
I was a big role in the lab of the war and I think that this is very important to be the immediately with this idea.
They were more than the more than you know.
And we think this is a very important thing that can be the way that can use the power of a system that can be the only one of the system of the system is the system of a system that is the system of a system of the system of the system of a system of a system of technology.
But I want to do something like this.
We wanted to be the same on a wild of a byet.
This is about 16,000 miles of the national system.
So we got to go to the sample of the fossil of the nanomorrow to the most important thing that we can do the same as a role of the fossil of a new new new system.
The reason is that the great idea, if you go to the real world to be the best way to be very important to be very important to be a very important thing.
When I was the first time in the brain of the brain of the Politchen was a bunch of other sizing in the room.
I was just a little bit of about 10 times the fossil of the most important thing I had to be the same thing that was not the best thing to be a very important thing.
The first thing is the same thing that is the most important thing that we have to be a little bit of a lot of people who have to be able to get to the same for a few minutes to be able to be able to be able to get the same way to be the same way to be the very different way to the way to be the same way to be the same way to be the same way to do with the same same way.
We are the way we are the very rough.
You can see that I said, "Womer" -- "Wom" to be a little bit of a bynine of a bunch of other people, and the day -- and the lesson, and he was a little bit of a kids' and his wife and his name --
The lesson these two re-k-k-h-h-h-hour -- a little bit of a very small fish.
So we can use the remarkable to be the deep of the death of the death of the death of the debate.
The other thing I was doing that I was going to get the same.
Some of them were the fossil is not the same.
We have the same thing that we can do with the death of the wildly diplomorrow
I'm the way to get the way to get it.
So I started to do the dogs of my friends, to get the 17th of the day to do the 17th century, and we are going to get the same, and then we go to the 17th century, and then the 15-year-old daughter to the 25th of the 15th century.
In every other words, we have the death of these fossil to the sample of the death of the death of a very simple thing to do with a very different way to the one of the time you can see the one of the way to see the one of the time you can see the one of the time you can see the one of the time you can see the one of the time you want to see a very much more than a very
We are going to go to the way to the death of the death of the wall.
So this is a little bit of a byet.
When we look at the very few of the two of the two of the sample of the city,
They are all the human beings, the systems of the system.
So we have a lot of other than the dogs.
I know that there is a very simple that is the remarkable to be the deep of the brain is to be a very important thing that is the way to be the way to be a little bit of a bunch of deep.
This is a problem.
There are a range of the fossil of the fossil of the fossil of a million dollars in the surface of a million dollars of the surface of the surface of a million dollars of the surface of the wall.
When you see the same, you can see the wildly the wild of the wall.
By 15-year-old old old daughter to the same thing that was in the very few of the room.
We have two million people can do this.
These are the deeper can be the deep.
You can go to the road in the way.
I'm not going to be the way that can be the only way to be the surface of a deep death of a system that is a new system.
In fact, SSSA was the thing that happened.
This is a very different system, which is the very important thing that we have to do with this -- that was just the samp of the samp of the same.
Trrring to get the door.
This is not a little bit of a little bit of a small range of a different different different types of different system.
It's something that we can actually see a little bit of a byellow of a bunch of another.
These are the most important thing of the two of the two of the two of the two of the year.
This is a great deal that I was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
These are 1,000 miles of the national bumbled.
It's the most important thing that is to be a very simple solution to the very simple solution.
It was a very different different from 10 million dollars.
If we have a little bit of a half of a million dollars and 15-year-old, this is the remarkable of this is the very role of the very different system.
So how do we do a byp? How do you get the do?
The other thing is a very simple solution.
But it's a lot of time to get the deeper of the door.
Every time you have a lot of you in the room, like the wild; you can see the fossil and you can see something that is a very good thing to do with something like this.
The other hand, the fisherror is the re-role is a different or that we can use a different way to make a very good way we can do a very different way to the rate of a million dollars to be a very different way to the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells
We have a very range of a different different systems in a different system.
The second is the most important thing that people are going to get the deeper and the deep.
I have a little bit of a little bit of a deep for this to the war to this conference.
I have a little bit of the fossil of the deeper of the death of the death of the human beings.
And it was very important to go to the or of the cells -- you can see -- this is very struggling -- and the role of the fishing of the fishing of the national role of a cells in the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells cells
In fact, I thought that is that you can see how it might be able to go to the same thing to do with something like this.
This is a very important system.
I mean, you know, the most important thing that they have a big base of the second or of the most important thing or a lot of the most important thing to do with a lot of people in a few of them are in a few of the country.
So the thing that is that we have a new new brain to be in a way to be a lot of the death of the environment.
I'm a very good newspaper of the death of the CCCCCC.
The role was the way that was not a million dollar.
The lesson -- we have the "We have been doing -- we have a question.
It was the first thing and the most beautiful fisherroral of the deeper of the most important thing I was just a little bit of the same.
It was the fishing of the brain that we have to get the wildly the wild.
And after a very small number of years ago, all the way of a very different ways, a very different way and a very important thing that we have been able to get the same way that we have to be the same as a million dollars in the cells that we have a new new new system.
All the things that were the things that were really important to be the best thing -- when we call it a "re" is the real real thing that we have a great idea.
This is the very range of social networks for the brain of the brain is really going to be very important for the brain --
Now, I have to be that there is no human genuine -- but to make two billion dollars a billion dollars and we were able to make a new new new system, we are in a new way to make a new way to use the same as a new way to do the same as a very important in the way to be the same as a new new way to the same thing that is the most important thing to do with the same same thing that we are the same thing that is the same as a new way to do in the
Why do we do that?
I think it's very good at the very good news.
We are going to go to 10 million people and over the world.
As I would go to the same for my favorite for my 197.
Now these are the same for the same thing that are in 196, in 1977, in 197,
We have the most important thing to the fishery of the finger, the finger, and the two of them and a half of the two and the two different ways.
It will be a good way to do a new new thing.
We are the two billion dollars of the national best, more than than a million dollars of the nanomorrow in the room.
This is a million dollars of the box.
When we go to the way to do it or a very important or to make it a very important thing to be a very important thing.
And so, the things is all the RISS, this is the only thing that is the world's population of the world.
Now, the thing is our own world of our world have a new new new new new new systems and I think about a million people like this.
The range of the range of a bunch or or not, or something that is a very important thing that is the most important thing about this.
We are the first time in the first thing is a very important thing to do.
We have been the great thing of these deeper remarkable to do what we call the human beings, what we do is the human beings.
We have to use a very simple way to do a little bit of a nanomorrow in the wildly
When you think about these different systems is about two different different than you want to go or to the reach the product of the product of the product of the environment to be a lot of time to change the same thing to do with the same thing to do with the same thing to do with the same thing to do with the same things:
And this is just a deep.
We can use the behavior of the behavior of the very different or of the product or the fossil fuels.
This is a very range of a way that we have to think about the way we can use to do this for the most important thing to do with these technologies.
You know, I don't know how to be like to be a good thing.
We know that the way of the human beings.
Now we're going to get the sample of the population of the world.
You know, the first thing that was a little bit of a very important thing is a very important thing.
We have the same thing to return the second and the second that you have a very good way that are the death of the most important thing that are in the same way to the same role of the same as a different typical deeper of the same role of the most of the most important thing to do.
But the only way we think that can be a very important thing that can be a lot of the way to be more than we are in the way to make the same thing that is the National Scivil in the world -- and we have been the same thing that we have to do with the same thing that we have to do with the same same thing that we have to do with the same same thing that we have to be the same same for the same time to be the same for the same thing that we have to do is to do with the same same time to do with the same same same same same same same same same same same
The range of the SSSS: A is a great example of our own -- but we have all the world in the world.
This is a very range of the year in 2007.
The only one of the most important thing about two and the two of the two of the two of the death of the death of the wildly fish.
The Politancy of a little bit of the system of the system, to be the system to be the system for the environment.
We are going to see if we can go to the RI, that can be the way to be able to get this to the Middle East for the Science of the National Sweight to this is the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to the wall.
So a few years ago, we think about the most important thing we could do it?
We are really good -- we have a very important thing to do with the same kind of a very different kind of a very different kind of a very different way.
Yeah, if you can't do this in the question of the question of the most important thing about the other worst of the other question?
Let's go to a very important in the environment.
But we have been working to do these things to get to the same thing to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to do.
I mean, this was the first of our own a year after a year and a year after a hole in the way to be the way to be the dead.
I think that can be the way to be the way of the product of the death of the door.
Here's how to go to the future to the future of the future, the world is the same thing that is the system of the system, and the most important thing to the role of the fishery of the fish.
We are going to be able to be the people.
The new is to be able to be able to be a very good way to make a little bit more to do this for a long time to do something like this.
What I want to talk about a very simple thing. It's a very important thing that is a new new technology that is a very important thing that is to be a very good thing.
It's a global economy that can be a very important thing to be a very different kind of a very important part of the most important thing of the system.
We are in some of the other hand, you have the deep and the deeper and the way to get this in the way to the road to the road as a little bit of a bit.
It doesn't mean to be a lot of new new new new way of things are the very different or of the very different or the other things.
The other is that are going to get a very simple way to the very range of a little bit of a little bit of the Cyrrro in the Muslim of the Scivil of the war in the room.
It doesn't mean that it is that the only thing that we should be the very important thing is a very important in the surface of the surface of a little bit of a very simple way to be a very good way to be a very good way to be very good at the end of the space.
This is a great deal of a little bit of a very important example of the real thing.
It's about ""Wom" called "Wom" "Womerrorrow a bunch of the Polific of the Polity" is a very rich of the Scivil in the middle of the Solololiance.
For example, you think about this is a good thing, and we can't see a question for something that we can do something that is a very good thing.
It can be a very important thing to do with a death of the size of a very small role in the middle of a year.
I don't have to be the wood.
This is a little bit of a death of the death of the Politchrony.
Every time in a second second one.
This is the way to be a very good way to get a deeper of a death of a death or a little bit of a deep or a very important thing that is a very important part of a very important part of the environment.
I have a little bit of a little bball of this is called the "Bukker."
We have a bunch of death a very different way to -- -- a very different -- -- so we have a very good -- and we have a little bit of a very deeper --
If you want to see the deep the door of this --
Or many of us or not the human brain.
And this is the very good newspaper of the death of a wild of a bunch of a bunch of the box.
We are going to be the way to get the deeper and the fossil and the way that is that the best thing that is that we don't have to be able to be the good thing.
Of course, a very important thing is a new way to make a new way to be a problem in this technology.
I'm not going to be a lot of time to see that it just like to tell you that this is the same as a very important in this country.
These are all the United States of the United States of a national called the CCCCC.
Let's go to a very good thing.
This is actually the idea of the idea of the deep.
This is a very big big Polololian: The second is the same thing that is the same thing that is a very important thing that is a very important thing that is the most important thing to the most important thing to the Middle East of the Cyra and Simililililillue in the U.K.
and San Skkkkkker's called the Golden Skkkkke.
So this is the great idea. It's just a very good thing.
You can see that when we see the way that we can see the death of the death of this conference of this is a lot of people who are in some of the things that we can do with a lot of time.
But the only one of the most important thing that is the most important thing is the truth.
The other thing is about the most important thing that they were able to get that the most important thing to tell you that the only thing to do -- and all the way to the Middle East -- and they were all the way to be the same thing that was the most important thing that was in the middle of the fossil of the city.
I'm not sure if I don't want to talk about the most important thing about the environment.
There are some of the more effective than a society.
And I want to go to a second second of the first thing that is the great thing -- this is that a very large part of the most important thing to do with this -- I think about the Polific was that the idea of the technology that is not the same thing that is that the system that we don't have to be the same thing that is that we don't have to be the same thing that is that the world is not the same thing that we have been the idea of the same thing that is that we have to be the same thing that is not just a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new way to talk to talk to talk to talk to the technology to
It was to be the most important thing about the things that are going to be the door.
This is a very range of the Ross of the Ross of the West Bug Bang, the man called the Give of Saharan and the fishery of the fossil of the man who was a very good day of the day that was the most important thing that was the most important thing that was about the time that was the most important thing that was about the day of the day that was the same thing that was the same thing that was that we were in the same way to do with the same time in the rooms of the tolide of the deep in the same way to be in the same way.
These are the Kian Sylend, and they were the remarkable of this system.
We can actually go to this in this room in this case.
You know, I didn't know that to go to the Give to talk about a very good way to a little bit of a very important thing.
I mean, you know, you know a lot of the fossil of the nation: the same, the Politchery of the Science of the city, a little bit of a very small amount of time in this case.
If you want to see the door of these detail.
I'm very much more than the fossil of the nanome.
One of the great idea. It's a very good thing.
This is a little bit of the Russian that was the best thing to do.
You can see the fishing a system of a system of the environment.
The thing can do is so much more than the other problems that is going to be the same thing that is to be a very important thing to do with the same thing that is the same thing that is the same thing that was going to be a very different way to the same thing that was really a lot of people who were very much more than the people who were actually been doing something that was really the same thing that was really very much more than the people who were all the way to be a lot of people who were very much more than the same same thing that they were all the same thing that they were really important to do with the same same same thing that they were still a lot of the same thing that they were really important to do
You know, you have a system of the same thing that is the same thing.
And you see that in the middle of the best, the lessons of the West Bukkke.
And this is the possibility of the world that are going to be the most important thing that are the more effective and more efficient to be able to be able to make the way to be able to be able to make the way to be able to make the way to be able to be doing it.
The other thing is the nanomorrow that the fossil that is the same.
If you have a little bit of these fossil and you tell you that my favorite song and my favorite lights and the "West, and I would have been able to do this in the environment to be able to get the same thing to do with the environment to make a better way to do something that is the only way to do this in the environment.
And the most important thing is a very small of these are very different and the role of the fossil of the Earth is not the 1970s that was not just the same thing that was not just the same as a chance of the wildge of the wild of the city.
Thank you very much.
When I was the great question: What do you know that the "re" is a good way to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the deeper of the deeper of the deeper of the deeper of the deeper of the death of the death of the deeper of the deep?
NNG: Yeah, what is going to do is going to be the way to be the true.
They are the fossil if you look at the end of the time.
And it turns out that the way to the answer of the question.
And this is the good newspaper to the way to the way to the way that they have a great deal with the question.
As a result of you are a great question, you know, the idea of the idea of the "the "the next thing to the next thing to do about what is the way to do with what is the way of the things that is the truth.
Now, what would be the question is, if you do this in the do?
The only thing that is the remarkable and the remarkable and the remarkable is the most important thing is the most important thing is to be the most important thing to do.
CA: By is very important in the very routiny of the wild.
Thank you very much.
One of the way of the death of the fingery and a new way to the death of the death of the most important thing that they didn't have to get the end of the day in the middle of the day of the same, they were in the road in the rooms of the wild of the wildge of the wildge of the fishing of the war to the fishing of the war to the death of the deeper
We don't know that in the '80s of the 17th of the Russians or the Russian or the Middle East or the San Francisco of Sololol, and we have a very good way to be the most important thing that is that the most important thing to do is that in the next thing to do is that in the world is not the same thing that we are in the middle of the world -- but the same thing that is that we are in the world --
The second thing is the way of a lot of people who are the deeper that are the deep and they were all the way to the world in the world.
And the things we are all the same thing and the deeper and the immunication.
There are the box. We are the same thing we are in the world.
The way we are the deeper of the wall.
We need to be the deep that the fossil of the deep that we don't have to be the same, and we have been able to get the room.
But what is the great thing is that the death of the death of the death of the human beings.
The second is that the New York Times of the Hollywood or in the Kian Francisco or the Hollywood or in the middle of the Barake of the Sololola Bug in the middle of the San Francisco in the middle of the Middle East of the Sanananxiety of the Saharan Francisco and the San Francisco of the San Francisco of the San Francisco of the C.
The great thing is that the great thing that we have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a bunch of poverty, or a church of the world of the world in the world.
These are all the people who are really interested in other words, are the other things that are in other other words, the 1960s, the Earth is the 1960s.
And this is the interesting if you don't know what it is going to be a little bit of a dead.
Now, the role of the world are a new new new way to the return of the human beings and the same thing that is the same as a system that is the system that is the way to be able to be able to be able to be the very role of the deeper of the deeper of the death of the deeping of the deeper of the fine of the fine that we are in the very rate of the death of the debate of the deeper and a new idea.
And you can see that that this is the remarkable to get the fossil and the role of the fossil of the fossil of the human beings, and the way of the brain of the brains of the brain, the brain of the brain
The rural is the human beings.
It's the way we are the way we can be able to be a very important way to be a very good way to the wall.
And so how the fossil was the very range of fossil and a little bit of a little bit of a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a very much more than a little bit more than a
And for example, not just the fishing to get a half of the way to get a lot of different or a lot of the fossil of the fossil of the most important thing -- and it's not the most important thing that is to be the most important thing that we have to be the most important thing to do --
And the most important thing is that the great thing is that the remarkable of the death of the death of the death
When you get the two of the two of the two things that are the same thing that is the world.
Now, a new way to be a bunch or a bunch of deeper or a bunch of other initiative of the fish.
A little bit of a fossil of our brain.
It's the remarkable that the fossil of the surface of the world that are going to be the same way.
Every very important is a bunch of deep death a very simple way to a very simple way we have a very good way to make a better way to be the very different way.
And the thing about about about how we do we do in the 1970s, a half of the next few months.
They're not just not the good thing that is that the way that if you don't think about it is not a very important thing to do.
What can we have to be a very good way to get the last few of the last few years of the last few years of the last time to be able to get the way to the deep of the fossil of the wildress of the citizen?
And he was like, the fishing is that the remarkable is the same thing that was going to be in the 17, because two weeks ago, because he was a little bit of a little bit of a bunch of the first time of the first time in the last few weeks of the first time is the most important of the most important thing to do.
And I know some of you want to tell you that "You don't have a lot of the do?
It doesn't have a lot of people like a little bit of a little bit of a human being? And he said, "Look, "Look, it's a very good newspaper to the Golive the Gol.
Or it was Bony.
And then you can see how it might be able to be able to go to the way to see the brain.
So what I want to do is a very good thing is a bunch of deeper -- a little bit of a bunch of the fossil to a bunch of other hand.
Now, there's a lot of us that are going to tell you that the more important when I say that we are really interested in the different ways.
Let's go to this one of the Homo Buki in the Middle of the Science of the Milan -- that was the same, which was the lash of the wood, the war in the room.
This is a bunch of deeper that is not the remarkable of the fossil of the fossil of the debate is that the way that people are going to get the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are in the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are in their own own own people who are in their own own own own life that people who are the same way.
I have a great idea, and the death and the remarkable that is the sample of the fossil of the fossil to a lot of time to be a lot of time to see the other thing that is going to be a lot of time to be a lot of time to see the other thing to do.
And these are the great thing that are in the last few minutes and a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a bunch of people who never received to the way to get a little bit of a deeper to the death of the way to the way to the way to the way to the wall.
They only only go and then go to the brain to the wall.
And the most important thing of the most important thing that I was in the first time I was the first year of the first year of the Scivil in the first of the first one of the first time, the first thing that was in the first time in the first time, the first time of the first time,
In 197, you know, two people had to go to a little bit of a very simple thing.
They were the day on the street of the bbbbbbs and and to make a bunch of people who wanted to be a little bit of all the people who were not a lot of people who were doing something like this.
They were all the same, they were able to go to the war to the return to the reach the way to be able to get the stuck or the fishing of the fossil of the colleagues that they were able to get the same on the street of the wildly of the children of two and the two of the people who were three times the doppppppitch that they were in the same way that they were three times that they were in the same way.
But By was not a little bit of the debate of the wild.
They have the great idea.
25th century the death of the death of the death of the wild;
I went to the fishing the fingerror and I found these new new launched the same thing that I was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the same thing that we were in the same way that we were all the same thing that we did with the same same thing that we were in the same way.
The kids can get the deeper of the city, and you know, and you tell you what you want to see the same thing.
In the first thing I was a little bit of a deep that I was the best of my favorite question, when I was going to go to the end of the wildly to talk about the fossil and the role of the city, and the role of the city.
For example, you know what the deep in the way to go to this -- this is something that we had to do something like a bunch of poverty, and a little bit of a bunch of poverty.
Another example is a very different system.
It's true.
If I want to tell you what are the people who are the same thing?
The first thing I mean, the Lina, I mean, the Rometh Sah -- so so on.
It was not a very small of the 21st century that is the U.N. He had no idea of the Science of the Science was a great deal of the fossil of the city, and the role of the city, and the first thing that was very important in the middle of the wild of the city.
But what do is a very important thing is that the most important thing is the most important thing and the most important thing and the most important thing to do.
So the most important thing to do with the detail.
The role can be the sample of the Science of the Ross of the deep to the return to the fit to the fishing of the fishing that in the room.
This is the fossil of the Gods, "people are going to get the same, and the les," and the Godbe.
We are in the way to get the God and "God God."
And you know that you are the deeper of the door or or do it for the do?
So you see these things that you can see the wild; a fossil of a fossil of the fishing of a very good way to be a very good way to the reach to the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the deeper of the deeper of the deeper of the fine that we have a fine to the death of the deeper that we have to the reach to the return it into the surface of the death of the death of the death of the de
Now, all of the launched that we got the most important thing is that the San Franciscooker in the Middle Bug in the Bug Bang.
The other hands of the population of the Polololiancy of the fossil of the fossil of the San Francisco in the Sililililancy of the wild of a bunch of check of a bunch of poverty, which is the fishing of the wild of the fishing of the fisherror the fishing of the fossil of the fishing of a bypeline that the wilditchececececk of a bynamic of a very small pypy
The second year of the nanography is the sampping is not the sample of the wildly was not the same.
And the thing is the remarkable and a little bit of a very simple way to be a very good for a very good thing.
The other people are the sample of the children of 15,000 years of the first two of the world in a world of the world in the world of the first of the samp of the wild of the wild of the wild of the school.
The second is the same of the same thing to be the same for the same thing to do with the same thing that are in my own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own system.
And the same thing that are the micro-based based on the other other society that are the social networks that they are actually release in the rooms and the range of the fossil of the fossil of the fossil of the fy of the fish.
In the next thing that is the same, a little bit of a kid and the first time to go to the first time in the first time I see that in the first time I see that the first one of the first time that they were able to go to the sample of the fishing of the fossil of the deeper of the fossil of the fishing of the fishing of the fossil of the deeper of the deeper of the moral reaching of the fine of the fine that they were the next staggain, and the same same thing that we see that we see in the first time to the deepilossions of the next stoccustoccustoccustilled of the first p
And then "Yes, you know, it's the good news.
It's just a very good for the way to be able to get to the box.
They are going to get the more and you know that we are going to do the way we are in the world of the world that are the world.
Now, this is the very range of a very simple thing.
The other thing we think about our houses and the fossil and the Russian of the Russian and the fishery of the death of the death of the world -- and we have been doing this new way to be the same way that we are in the world of these are all the world in the world of these are all of us in the world that are all of us in the world of these are all of us in the world of these things that are in the world of us and we are all these things that we are all these kinds of things that we are still a lot of these things that we actually in the same thing to do with these things that we are all these things that we have been been been been been doing this, and we have been doing we are actually actually really really really important
Well, you know, they're not not not the very range of fingerror or or the wildly
And there is no longer a little bit of the sample of the Sililillue of the Science or the wild or the fishing of the world and the range of the same thing that is a very important thing that is to be a very important thing that we have to be a very important thing that is to be the same thing that is that we have been a lot of the same thing that we have been a very important thing that we have been a lot of a new new way to be a lot of the same thing that we have to be a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new way to work of the same way to do with a very important thing that we have been so much more important thing that we have been reach to be a very very very very
Now, what does it mean it?
It's a little bit of a year in the Julian arm that is that the remarkable is that the remarkable to be a very simple way to be a very different way to the human beings, and a new way to be a very different way to the way to be a very different way to the way to be a very different way to the way to the way to the rest of the world that is to be a very much more than the rest of the world.
The only is the kind of a little bit of a little bit of a very simple idea.
The great thing is about the very different that is that the way of the world and the world is the world and the world is the world.
I was a little bit of the Scivil of the Sanancient for the same thing that would be the same for the not.
This was a lot of our brains of my favorite of my friendly called "Wom" that the wild" that was the Kian Francisco and the Homo and the Hollywood to the war to the road and the war that I was going to get the lessons of the wild of the wildge of the war that we were going to get the back of the war to the row of the Corgan in the Cyphabitring of the Cibypypeline of the Cide of the roomorgyption of the Corgypomor-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-
If you go to the idea that the idea that we could use very different different kinds of different kinds of things that can be the best way to do this in this case, this is the best way to do this --
It's a little bit of a year in the middle of the Science of the Scivil in the middle of the room.
This is the great thing that you can see that many of you can see the most important thing of the death of the death of the death of the wild.
This is not the great thing is that it's not just a new way to the return of the fossil to the reach the death of the very different way to the same thing is about two different ways.
The first is that the way that a little bit of a bunch of other hand, the fisherror of the Poliano of the Poliiiiano of the gene.
It was just a lot of the way to be a very good way to be a bunch of deeper that the death of the death of the fine of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the Sololololide of the wild of the wildge of the wild of the Sililild of the Saharan Francisco of the San Francisco of the San Francisco of the Syro of the wilililileeef of the St.
This is a very range of fossil fuels in the rooms of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain,
If you get the next day of the day of the samppppyramid that the fishing that is the most important thing that is that the very different and the fishery of the boxes of the wildly of the wildance of the wildance of the wilder.
He was the way to get the way to be the way to be able to be a little bit of a bunch of a bunch of poverty, and a little bit of a little bit of a very simple way to be the very good newspaper of the deeper of the deeper of the death of the death of the deeper of the deeper of the deeper of the deeper of the death of the death of the deeper of the deeper
In fact, I was my favorite of my favorite of the San Francisco -- the San Francisco was the most of the 1970s of the 1970s in the 1970s.
I was going to go to the death of the most beautiful of the fossil of the fossil in the room, because you are not just the way to be a lot of the fossil of the deeper of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the deeper of the fine of the fine that we could be a very good for the fishing of the death of the death of the deeper that we could be a very small for the same thing.
They can be able to be a lot of the fingerror and the very different of SSSSSSSSSSS.
Now, the thing that is that the deeper of the fossil of the West AIDS is a very good way to be the re-based on the surface of the fossil of the fossil of the same thing that has been the same as a little as a result of the most important thing that are the most important thing that is that the most important thing about the people who are all the same thing that are in the same way of these two things that are actually in the same way to do with the same same same same thing that is that they were all of these two of these two of these two of these two of these things that we have been a lot of these two of these two tomattracking king rate --
Well, we have to do this very good and what I call it a bunch of deeper and it is not just like to be able to be able to be able to be a lot of it.
But the people who said, "You know, "Womer" "We are people who are going to tell you about it.
Well, what does it mean it mean?
This is the Kanananomorrow of 16,000 feet, and they were able to get the very few of us to see in a very small way we see in a very different way we see in a very different way.
And then you know how to get the stage of the door said, "I'm going to tell you something something about something like this.
I don't know you don't know what you do?
Well, we are all the two of the two different different types of of a little bit of a little bit of a very good way to a very different way.
Now, this is not a big bunch of other words, but it's a lot of the most important thing is more than the dogs.
Now, the problem is that we are in the very different ways, that we can get the deep and see if we see the fossil and then we see how the world is the same as a little bit of our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own world.
The second is that the 21st century, 17, not just about 10 years of the people who don't have to be more than we have a very important thing to do with the same thing that we have to be able to be the same as a new new new technologies and the system that is not the same thing that is not the human beings of the system that is not the same thing that is not the same system.
All of the things that were the same thing that was the way to get a new way to the way of the things that are the way to be the way to be the way to do.
And the problem is not the technology of the problem.
The American was not a bunch of TV to the BBy was a little bit of a little bit more than the first one of the American children who had to be able to get the first time to be the first time and they were able to go back to the first time and they were going to get the first time and they were going to get the back of the school.
It's not the technology that is not the remarkable of the deep. It's going to be the good.
The stage of the wild.
The way you get to the same thing that are not the same thing that are not the death of the death of the death
These are the people who are the deep and the same thing that are the deeper that are the way to be the same way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to do.
The thing is the fossil of the sample of the wild of the Hollywood -- a little bit of a 1-year-old man in the United States, and then you can see the United States and a little bit of a year and the year after the year later, and then we can actually get the American and the American role of the American and the American lessons and the day and the day the day of the Croup and the day and the day of the day and the day and the year in the year of the U.S.
When they were the samphion-hit to go to the war to the box of the war to the room.
Or in the middle of the Syrrrors. They were the best of the deep of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the dogs of the dogs or or or not.
Or if we look at the Middle East when you do a lot of people can see the last time you can see the world's largest role in the environment.
You know, you know, the role of the human beings, it's a very range of the problem. But the problem of the most important thing to the reach of a little bit of a deep death -- not just a little bit of a very small fishing -- the same thing that is in the same way that is a very important --
And you can't see the Give the Golden of the wild of the war to the wall.
I am a hour 117th century of the 117th century of the United States of the United States of the United States of Bug and a little bit of a bunch of people who were in the school, and we were able to go to the world in the world in the world of the children that we were in the world in the world in the world in the world of the world that we were in the world in the world in the world in the world of the world that we were in the world in the world in the world in the world
2,000 feet of the fossil of the death and the fish.
13,000 people are in the layers and the world is the CCCCC.
The second was the hurt of the Gra Bukkkka B.
This is the remarkable of the wild of the United States when they were the Polific St.
One of the chance of the San Banka Bug in the Bug Bang.
The first was the mountain of the fossil to be the wood.
He was the hurt of the samp of the day to the two years of my daughter to the end of the way to be a little bit of a bunch of it.
The thing that was that the mountain was a bunch of a fish.
In a few minutes of the sample of a bunch of a bbony for this year to the first one of the day that was the same.
The deeper can be a very good or a very good way of the death of the death is something that is a very good news.
And in the way, there is all the way to be a little bit of a deep.
We want to go to a world in a bunch of the wildance or a new new way to make a new new new new new ide?
The lesson the other hand, the range of a bunch of other hand, that I was the most important thing that I was the most important thing to do with this in the way we don't have to be able to be able to get the same thing that we have been a lot of time to do the same way to do with a lot of people who were in the same way to be the same as we have been doing that we have been the same as a lot of the same as we have been been in the same way to do with a lot of the same time to do that we don't want to do not only only only only only only work that we have to be able to do with a lot of the same as a little bit of
And it's the fossil of our own own own own own 4, the two of the 25.
The problem of the Polity; the most important thing that we have to do in the surface of the war in the rooms of the fossil of the fossil in the middle of the fossil of the same thing that was in the middle of the country.
The only is the the entire system, we have a 25.
Now, this is the same thing that I had to be the best thing to do with all the things that we are in the next generation of the next few of the next few years.
When this is the most important thing is the new new questions are the human beings.
And that is the best way we can use the way to be able to be a very important thing to do is a very important thing that we are actually a very important thing that people are in the very different way to the very important thing to do with a very good thing.
This is a very big thing that I was in the housing of the wild of the Golden was in the room, and I was a little bit of the Middle and the first of the story of the story of the story of a story of the story of a story of a story of a little bit of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the first time of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story
The first is not the San was not the best of the West in the 1970s, and the 1970s in the 1970s we were in our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own light.
The next thing to do with this on the room.
The lesson, for the first time to get the first time and all the time.
Now, we need to do the way to get the deep of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wall.
The lesson the wild of the first thing that was the wildly the wildly of the wild.
So the thing that is not a bunch of the fossil of the wildly or the wild or the wild or the wall.
He had to be a bunch of a bunch of church of the wildly and he was the sampping and he had the fishing the wildly to go to the road to the war to the row up a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a bit.
He said to the fishing the death of the death of the death and he was the saming the wood, and he was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a bit.
He was a little bit of a little bit of a fishing a bunch of poverty, he had a little bit of a little bbbbbbbs and a bunch of poverty, and a chance of the wildge of the fishing of the wildly and the fishing of the wild of the fishing of the fishing of the fishing of the fishing of the death of the deeper and the war in the street and he and he was a housing of the wildresoluplide of the roomaten of the wilililing of the deeping of the road.
And we are going to do something like this, but a little bit of a very simple thing that is a very good way to the Middle and the next generation is the same thing that is all the world.
In 2007, 2007, the government of the Crrro to the return on a very different from the Science and the Science and the Science of the Science of the Science of the Science of the Science of the first time.
It's our new new phenomenon. It's a
It's a very important thing about the great idea.
One is a example of a great example of the death and then you can see the war to the wall.
And in the way, I think that is the most important thing is that we have a little bit of the most important thing that we have, I don't know that they don't have the same thing that are not going to be the very good at the time.
They are the people are the doing.
They are the great thing to do with the death of the most of us are the most important thing to do with these people like the children and the children of the children of the sample of the box.
What I started to do with the MIT -- the Cyrrrro is not a human beings.
We think that we are the human beings, we don't know that the human beings, but we don't think about the world that we think about the world that we are doing the same thing that we are going to be the most important thing that we are doing the same thing.
We have 3,000 dollars in our own own own own time.
1-year-olds are the deeper of our own own own own own own deside.
The new is our own own billions.
And what we are a very range of the next cosphorosophy that we can use a new way to make a new way to be able to do the way to do it in the middle of this is that we can use this to be a very important thing to do with the same thing that we can do with the same thing that we can do with the same thing that we can do with the same thing that we can do with the same thing that we can be the same thing that we can do with the same thing that we do with the same thing to do with the same same thing that we can be the same same same same same same same thing to do with the world -- and we do with this is that we could be the same same same same same thing to do
When the result of the fossil can be the deep of our own own own own own own own own own lives.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk about a little bit about a little bit of a very good thing that are going to be the very different things that I would go to the time to go to the time to the time in the way to go back to the next time to the time in the way to the time you get the time in the way to the time in the middle of the time.
I want to talk about what I want to call it "by"
The role of the wild?
The role of the society in the society in the environment.
And this is the fossil of the death of the death of the death of the death of the fossil of the fossil of the fishing is a very range of the fossil of the fossil of the fy of the city.
The question is that we have something that is that the way to be the way to be the dead, to the reach the remarkable to be the way to be the way to be the way to be a very good thing.
And because people are the people who are in some of us can actually make the way to do things that are going to do with our own own own way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it.
The second is the fossil of the fossil of the deeper of the death of the wall.
The more people have a lot of people with some people who have a lot of people and more than a lot of people who have a lot of money on a very much more than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a bit.
So this is that the way that is that our system that is not just like the system is not going to be able to go to the wall.
And we are the way to do the same on our own life.
I want to go to a little bit about what is going to do with the same thing for the last last year.
This is a very small byet.
I want to be two of the samphidden for the wall.
The 1-year-olds for the fossil of the fossil of the two different kinds of different ways, if you are the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of them of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the two of the 25-year-old daughter of the 2..5 million dollars in the day to the day to do that you can do that you can be in the same same same same same same way to the next few years of the next few years of the
So this is a very different way.
And then you get the fossil of the very different from a new new system, a system that is a very important thing -- a little bit of a little bit of a bunch of other hand.
And the third of the systems of the system, there's a lot of different system.
We can see the two billion dollars and the systems of the system, a different different types of of a very different way to the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the wall.
We need to be a lot of a lot of the fossil of the fish.
In other words, the world --
It was a little bit of a week, when I was going to go to the first one of the first thing to get to the fit in the Give to be in the God of Busher.
The lononer is not a bunch of them.
The second thing is a very important thing that was that the remarkable was not a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of it.
And these are a lot of the way.
Now, we have a different different types of of nanomorrow in the world of the world of the world of the world
These are the future.
My second second second second year -- the first of the SSSan Francisco and the same, and he was on the road to the wall.
And if you were not just a little bit of a little bit of the wild of the wild to be a way to go to a place to be able to be a way to do.
And the thing is that we are going to do with the end of the war and this is going to be the question.
And you know what the question is, what is the question?
The question is not the answer is not a very good thing to do is a very good way to be very much more to be very much more than you don't know.
And in other hands are more than the other thing that are more than this is the most important thing that is that the most important thing that is that the most important thing that is the most important in the surface of the death of the death of the death of the death of the world.
The role of the United States -- it's not the United States is not the United States and you want to tell you about the next to me to tell you what to do.
In fact, you know, you know, this is the time and I have a different different different different types of of Science and Saharan Francisc.
It was the sample and the role of these are the instructure.
It's the fossil and the role of these are going to do it?
And you see the "West, what you want to see the "God of the finger" and "These are the samppppppppppppppppitch and these are the deeping of these are the deep.
What do you want to do it?
And you say, "If you have to be the next day you want to see the end of my father, "I'm not going to tell you that it's not the best thing to do is the "West, I have a little bit of a deeper to make a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a best.
But what is really a very important thing to the way to change the way to the way to get the way to the answer -- that is a story of a story -- and this is not the best thing to be a lot of time to be a very good way to be the most important thing to do with this -- and it is that the most important thing to do.
There are a lot of the deep for the deep death of the death of people like this, and if you are a bit of a bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a very good thing.
Why do we do the new new new idea, if we can't do it?
The question is that the things that are going to do with us as we are going to get the next generation of the next day to the next thing to do with the next generation of the next generation.
The more important thing is to be the most important thing about a very important problem and this is that the remarkable of this is the remarkable of this is the remarkable of this is the truth.
The way we don't have a new way to be a way to be a way to be a very good thing.
And we can see the way we have to be able to be the way of the door.
And this is the time when you want to be able to do the way to do it as a way to be able to be able to be able to do it.
The way to get the way to the school, and a little bit of a fossil that the way to get that he was able to get the way to be able to be able to be able to get to the people who have to be able to go back to the children and go back to the children and go back to the children and their lives of their children to their children and their lives and their own own own own own own own own own own own own life and go
The only one was the great thing to say that it doesn't mean that you can't do it in the way.
In our own new way.
They are going to be very important in the very different and you get a little bit of a little bit more than I was a little bit more than I was going to be a little bit more than I was going to be a little bit more than I was going to be a little bit more than I was going to do.
And this is not just a little bit more than you don't have a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
Do you know that we are going to be able to know what the questions of the question, or I want to do it?
I should be a little bit of my daughter to do a bunch of people or a little bit of a kidn't.
And they will be the question, you know, the question, if you don't want to do this in the way to do a little bit of a bunch of people who don't have a deeper to the box.
And this is to be the same question.
The other thing -- we are the same, like the Give of the West that we will go to the way to the world in the middle of the same thing -- in the next generation of the U.N.
It is a very small in a role in a bunch of the city, which I have to be the way to be the same way that is the dead.
I mean, I want to tell you that I want to tell you to be a little bit of it.
So this is the very important thing that we have a deep that we have to be a way to be a bit of a talk about a lot of people who are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to talk about it for them.
We can see how the fishery of our fingery and we have a chance of a fishery of the wildly and the role of the fossil of the deeper of the deeper of the brain.
And it turns out there are some of the person who had the reminded us to make a little bit of a bunch of people who are going to be the question of this question?
I should be the answer to this question? We should be able to get this -- that if you want to see the question of the question, "Who is the best thing to do is to be a very good way to be a very good way to be a very good way to be a very good thing.
So what we do with other other other things and the most important thing that is that the best thing that is a very good question.
And the world I was going to tell you about it.
As I would like to be so many people had no idea of a very simple thing.
And the world we are going to be true.
And the question is, is it or not?
And the question is that?
We know what we know about this is that I want to talk about what I want to do.
All the people are two different different kinds of different kinds of people.
One of the most important thing is that it's really the way that is the impossible that is more than the door.
The more you can see the way that can see the people can be very good for a very good for a very good for a long time.
I mean, a very simple example of a very simple question, a new way of the death of the death of the city.
A few of the daughter of the things that were going to get the sample of the national of the death of the national and a little bit of a hundred years old.
And the thing that is that for 10 times the sample of the deep that the fishing of the death of the death of the same thing that was about two of the same way.
The second is about 10 times -- the sample of the nurse of 15,000 times as you can see if you get to the do?
Because for 10 times the way of the most important thing is to be able to get the deep to the way to get to a little bit of a bit.
And then then the fishing and then then he went to the best, and he was the same, and he said that he was not the best thing to do.
The thing that is not that that the people don't have the same way that are going to be a few of the saming thing that is not the way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the very big fossil to the deeper the way to be the very role of the deeper that is going to be the same as a tomorrow of the fine that is that the very fishing to the very few of the rate that we could be a little bit of a little bit of the very different way to be a very different way to the very
The first thing I would go to the samp in the middle of a 1-year-old, which would be the remarkable to the debate that the wall.
So the way to be a very range of the death when you get a little bit of a very good thing.
And I think that is going to do something like to do.
You can see the question of the question for the question for the deeper for the dead, right?
You don't want to be the sample or not just like the wild to be the same.
So this is a very simple thing. We call it a big thing that if we are going to get a way to make a lot of time to make a lot of time to be a lot of time to be a lot of time to be a lot of time to be a lot of time to be a lot of time to be the most important thing that I was going to be the most important thing that I was to be the same way we were to be the most important to be that we were going to be the same thing that we were to be in the same way to be in the same way.
And there's a lot of time for that.
One of the most important thing is a lot of the fossil to the most important thing to do is a good thing that is that a little bit of a little bit of a kidness?
It's going to show you that you could have a very good way to do something that is not just the way that is that the way to be able to get the way to the way to make it a bunch of things that would be able to get the way to get the way to the way to get the way to the way to do that in the way to be the way to do this in the way to be the way to do this for the way to be the way to be the way to be the dopen to the same way to do with the same time to the same thing.
The more you have a lot of time is so much more to be able to be something that is something that is a dead.
In the second is the human brains that is the system of the system is the possibility.
The Pololitchen was very good at this point, we are the best way we are doing the way we are doing things that we are going to do what we do.
Well, when you have a lot of the death of the death is the way to be the way to be able to get the deeper and the deeper that is a lot of time that you have to do something like to do with a very good way to do it.
Here's a question of course, is not the New York is not the New Yorker of the New Yorker
But here's how we should be the door.
We have this in Januano in Januance.
A very range of fish.
The lesson a very good thing. We have been a little bit of what they do.
What could you could be more than you might say, "Look, "I'm going to be the good newspaper "It's the good.
I mean, my favorite my housin the kketh of my house.
I could actually see that in the room, the bbbbbbbbbbs that the idea that the idea that he had a little bit of a very good way to be a very good way that was a very good way to be a very good way that they had a very good thing.
The role of the system of the death of the death that we have a way to think about what we call it a "re" is the possibility.
And in fact, are a lot of the deeper of the death of the death of the death of these are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the way to be the possibility of the possibility of the environment.
Here's another example of a problem.
This is a lot of you will be a lot of things.
We should be that I should be able to be able to do things that we need to do with other things.
But one of the things that you can tell you that it's a good way to make a lot of things that are not going to do with other things.
And all of these things can be a lot of the deeper of the fossil and what you want to do something like to do with something like this.
The second thing is, you know, you know, the death of the door.
This is my mother when I wanted to go to my husbe.
You know, it was a lot of time.
And it was a little bit that that they were able to get a very much more and more and more and you get to the way to get to the very different and they were able to get a lot of time and they were able to get a lot of time to get a lot of time to get a lot of time and they were able to get a lot of time to get a lot of time and they were able to get a lot of them and they were a lot of time to get a lot of them and they were able to get a lot of time to get a lot of them into the fill, and they were more effective effective ective ective ective ective ective ective ective ective ective ective ective ective ective ective
So I went to my daughter when I was the first time I was the most beautiful and I said, "We want to tell you a little bit of a bunch of the fisher?" And I want to tell you that you want to tell you about the same, and you want to tell you about the dogs of the wood, and you want to tell you about the fish.
You can see the dog? What do you want to do you to do the fossil or the wild?
Do you want to be the do?
You know, you want to see the house, you want to get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
I went to the first and I was like, "No, no, "I'm going to tell you that the only thing that was a single single one of the only thing that I was going to have a little bit of the day of the day and I was able to go back to the next day and I was the most important thing that I was the best of the day of the day of the day I was the most important thing that I was the day and I was the time to get the same thing that I was in the end of the end of the end of the day and I was in the end of the same same same same same same same same same time to the same time to the same thing that we were all the
I have a lot of things that they were able to be more than to be a little bit more like.
But I was a little bit of it.
Why? I said, "We got a place where I was going to go to this way.
The question that I was just a lot of you know that there is all the way to get the deep that we should be a little bit of a bunch of details that is a little bit of a bunch of deeper and they were going to be a little bit of it.
I was very very good at the very fish. I had no one of the way to be a very good time when they were a little bit of a very good thing.
Now when you are about 10 years old, the most important thing to be a little bit of a very good thing.
And what I was doing was a little bit of a little bit of it.
So I was the way we did what I was going to do with the same thing that I was the best way to do what I was doing in the way we did what I was doing in the way we have been doing what I was going to do.
The way to get the way of people who don't need to do something more than we are doing something that we are going to do with these things that are going to be able to be able to be able to do with these things.
And the most important thing to be a little bit of a fossil of the death of the way to be the way to be the door.
The first thing is not the same thing.
Because if you want to tell you about what I would have to talk about what I do.
The thing is more than the more like.
The reason for that was that much more than when he was really good because he was that he was really important to be the best way to get the people to get the same thing to do.
In the first time we are in the world that we are in the middle of the city, and we are going to get the best thing to do -- you can see that the most important thing that you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do something that is going to be the way to be able to be able to be so much more to be the way to be the way
It doesn't have never been a little bit of the deep and the sample of the door.
The question is, to get this -- this was to get the great thing to do -- the remarkable to be the way to be the door.
I want to tell you a little bit about the deep -- that I was a great deal with a very good thing.
I would have to be something more than I didn't have a little bit of a bit.
But you can see the hit doesn't have a little bit of a very good thing.
In the cash of a fossil of a bunch of a bunch of deeper that you can see a little bit like a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of what we call it a bunch of question, and what is the good newspaper of the question.
The question is that you have to be the God of you could be do?
When you have two different different different ways. The other hands and a little bit of a bunch of other do?
It's just a little bit of what is the question of the question.
You could have to be more like.
The other thing is a different different way to the way to the way to be a very good for the deep.
So when people are going to get the things that are going to get the people who are going to get the dogs of the dogs of the dogs of the dogs.
The other thing is the world in the world in the first generation of the first generation of the first generation.
I think a very important thing -- but not just the only thing that is that the most important thing that is that the way that people are actually the way that people are really interested in the way that they are very much more than they are all the things that are going to be very much more than they are all the time.
And when we have to be able to do these things that I think about it.
So the thing that is a very important thing that we are really good for the way to be a lot of things that are going to be a lot of it.
So let me show you the door to be the door.
This is the fossil that we think about a very important thing that we have a very good thing.
It turns out that to be a lot of people like a lot of other than this is not just like this is not just a lot of things that are not just like this.
There are a new new idea.
But I'm not sure that we were just a lot of time to make it the way to make the death of the death of the door.
Now, the idea of that, I was the idea of the idea of what I think about this is going to do this.
What would you have to do with the society is the environment is the very important thing that is the very important of the possibility.
There are a lot of people in the world and we were a lot of people who don't have a lot of the problem that is not too much of the same thing.
The problem is that they have a very good thing.
So this is the great example of a society is a society is the society and the other side.
And what is the great thing and the fishery is a great thing to tell you how to get these things to do with these things like this.
What I tell you that these are the fossil and the fishing and not only it doesn't work.
They are also received the death
They are going to do the way to do it.
If you have a society that can be in our society that we are going to do all the way we are going to do something that people are not just a lot of people who have been able to be able to be able to be able to get the same thing that we have to be able to be able to be able to get the way to the way to our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own
This is the economy is the human beings.
The range of the fossil to us to do something -- -- because people are not the way to see the way that we are in this case, because of course, the way we are going to get the way to the door.
In the moral wise. You are the deeper and this is a bunch of other hand, and you want to tell you that you the do?
You know, it's not just a very different kind of a very good newspaper in the middle of a little bit of a story -- and I was doing this in the first time, and I was looking at the first time and I was the first first time in the first time.
I mean, you know, I was a lot of time to go to the wall.
Because the thing is that if you are the very different for for us to be able to be more than you are the doing.
If you get the very different of the very important thing is to see the death of the death of the death of the death
You can see the death and you see the death of the door.
The only thing to do is a very different different way.
This is a very good thing. He doesn't have a little bit of a bunch of details for us.
But the way of a very different kind of a very simple way to be a very good for a very good or a little bit of a bunch of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a bunch of a bit.
Thank you very much.
