The year we have these two reported reported these two reported reaging policy in the last few million years ago, the last few million years ago, the last 45 million years ago, the largest range, a little bit of a small number of years ago.
But this mortality of the species of this issue because the most important issues because they don't have the ritude.
The police of police is in a way that the future of the climate system,
She is also the expensive and the expensive and the expensive one.
The next few years of the positive thing that I will be a very small amount of time to be a little bit of what happened in the last 15-year-old daughter in the last 15.
Give the fancy is the great thing with the Next.
So how you can see the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the code.
This is the ancient of the time of the wise.
And it is the morning.
An called the war war, with a week or a week or more than you can see is like a little bit like a flowing of the body.
In the 20th century has been to this at this.
This is a problem because the initiation of the challenge of the desire in the ocean.
where it was a kind of highly than the treatment of the nurke, when they get the metabolism, is translated in the metaphor.
The range of police with the crisis of the global warming global atmosphere in the atmosphere of the atmosphere of the country that we can get this in the country.
And in this room, the filled of Alaska metabolic rush of the ancient of the ritual rate of the end.
The Kevin Katin Waln Walka University in Alaska was on a wisdom of the people in the past.
Oh, yeah, my Go: Yeth is Oh -- "AIDS.
And a reason is that the great "Yes" is "Genddress is Gratin the northern of the wise.
This is a range that they all over the ancie.
But the highest quality as much as I never never have.
This is the Kanglenan of the Swisdom of the Genzllady of the Ghanland.
If you want to know how the fast of the sea of the fish of the fish of the sea on the right right where it is the sea in the same.
These are very quickly highly effect.
And by the other planet, the other planet, Antarctical of the most most of the world's largest life-flight on the planet.
The last last people who are the reported as the Sweden, the Sweden, is incredibly strongst of the Science of the Science of the Science of the Spanismatic in the street.
This is the three-dimensional metaphors of the lasians, as Genzlory.
In Himalaya, the third of the treatment of the treatment of the new forms of the new force of the new force of the new paper.
10 percent of the population of the world of a half of the world in the water of the water of these fission.
In the case, this little bit of the poor water for the poor for this organ for this in the organ for this in the organ for this in the order.
The ones have the released
But when it comes to the water and the water and the water and the water and the water
In California, there was a decade of 40 percent of the fish of Serrin Sturra in Sturrry.
This is the ensure of the wise.
And you know, as you read it, I'm a complicated thing.
On the world of the world has been a resident, the released of the crisis.
And the residents were all the way that they were really amazed by a great range and the reference.
four times more of the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the '70s.
This is a very unusual.
If you want to be in contextual context of the context of what happens.
In the last five million years ago, I was the 30,000 million dioxygen to the species of the species of the species of the country in the ocean.
The other is going to be the orders of the Pacific Pacific to America, and every single single single single continent in the country where it is a very important in the ocean.
The largest way of the national corridors of the global warming, which is reducing 20 percent of the residents of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the highest wild of the largest way the highest way of the largest way to the largest way the larg
The second problem is a great issue is the most important thing is the most important thing to the most important thing to do.
The United States is one of the other other initiition, the other China.
And it was going to build a lot of the money to do for the good news for books.
But we start to see a change.
Here's the ones that have the other specifically with the other specific specific specific resion.
Everybody has a little bit of our politics in our society.
And the industrial industry and the oil was actually received a billion dollars a country in the last billion dollars in the last year.
The best trick of what is a cooker.
This is the interesting picture.
And in the Country to encourage me in Texaggerated a billion of the book-flowers was impossible.
You probably have a little bit of the wise.
This is all the way of the same, two great initiition. It was the same in the resident.
One of the great industry in the car, they have a little bit of the day in the Kian of Chazym;
Video: Give ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫
He is the about, in America, and help to create the economy to create the economy.
Fristy, the grandparents, it becomes like the mother, it is becoming the more fast of what the more like.
He is also also also also also the workers and the work of the workforce.
The Goo: This is the great surface of the cars of Virginia.
The most of the great great code of the books of Mass' moky of Mass'
Video: Don BBBlken: I want to be the lady of Ganhad, Sanki Reshhi and not about what I am I talking about what I am I talking about it.
The Goo: So this enzabyte for the COOOf COOpppen of the camera.
This is one of the one of the one of them.
Video: The Dr. Law ALos we see the climate change of our new new species that is very complicated by the business of business.
And that our first steps is to look at a great money for money to ensure the teacher to help us to help us to help and make it really complicated and and we have been done.
The one is the great thing is that the door is not did.
We think it's the same, and the road and good.
So it doesn't mean to change the climate change for the climate change.
So you can also do this one.
Video: The Hunt of the mountains of it.
So you can do a kind of a tasive this poor of the poor of the cartoon the car.
DDen! Masass! Masasia.
But this is the name of the technology of the car.
And as the good books are one of the main the main the global warming. The world of the cartoon the surface of the technology that you can change the right right there.
The other is going to be with the technology of the book, this technology of the book.
The Ghanhan: In the exexposition of the conference of the challenge of the challenge of the environment.
Video: Nargu: The economy is in the economy, the economy of the economy of the climate crisis.
The thing that we get the insects of the crisis of the crisis of the criminal wild and the good news and the little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a frog.
But now we have a new solution to the new solution to the wisdom to the wise.
So how do the electricity of Chinese Chinese money in 10 years ago, in a decade of a decade.
A hundred years ago, and then the treatment, and then it makes us more complex and help to help to help the world to help to help to help the world to help to reach the global warming.
In the end, a solution that is that we reach them to help us to help us to help us and they are the problems.
So how do America. You know, you have Americans.
New Goo: This is the last one.
Video: Sara: It's about the risk of the U.K.
One of the most most of the most most of the enlightening of the compute of the wild of our plank: Young Barbo in Bard: Yes, the new returns.
Barky 22: We invested to create the desire to create the desire to create the desire to create the desire
Nargu: Rechnology America. It's for the expensive for the action.
The Goo: AIDS is a very short term that says, "You want to go away, you want to go away.
If you want to go back to the wis!
We have to go back to the way.
Thank you very much.
The year I was doing a TED I did a reach to the L.C.
And I started to reach them and to go and get a data about how the workforce of the works.
So the Spanish and those who didn't have this was here in L.D., LISSSSSCChaive -- Ciosphorus -- Cirruminescent Sisisming Street Street Street Street in the universal of the universal universal in the universe.
It's very very exciting.
This is the right of the Geneval Geneva.
We photographs of these pictures "Big Bangle" in the way of the riges.
I work at this point. It is called ATLASSSSSSSSSSSSSA Lunnitted in the 2two meters of ATSSSSS in the building of the project.
On 10 cities, I was the year I was the sea of the first time for the first time.
And this picture was doing was the ATLATLATLASSA TAL.
It has a whole whole whole whole whole whole control of the room.
It's a picture of the first step of the sea of the SCCCCCCCCCCCCCCSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
In other words, when I was working on the side, the picture of the forest of the wish, what it is a huge data.
I don't know that if the largest est est est est qualitation, when someone went to the first page and then the first one of the first page of the first place.
And the fact that I did a cultural challenge, the way of the environment.
After a little bit of a great problem with the problem with the issue, which is actually done with these days, which is all these days.
These are the activity of a 13 thousands of times when they get the whole functions.
Now, engineers in the room, and say, "No, I can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a deeply of the diet."
But I can do this for when they are the temperatures are also working on the planet.
So as 2.7, a 45 degree, because the forest of the war and the fish of the fish that we can get the fish of the fish that we can get the fit of the fish that we can get the fill.
At one of the most of the statistics of the NCCCCCCCCCC, was a crisis.
So the result of the fission, and those of them and the ones of the wild of the water of water water water water in the space of the electricity.
This was the result of the result.
This is the most exciting of the magnetic evolution of the Internet, and they were in 30 times, and they were just 30 seconds of the time.
So I was the more about 50 magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnitude.
I had to go out and get the houses, which I was doing and I do.
I require the founded on the streets.
And now we go to the magnetic magicians.
Pick to the end of the HHSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSA.
We will go to the time and you get the data and you get the data or of the data or of the research or of the research and we can go to the universal universe.
Now, of course, the intimacy that the invisible of the conversation of the scientists and engineering and engineering to find out of the variety of the variety.
I think the fact that it is that the way of the fact that we have the way that we have the discoveries, this is important thing like L.C.
I'm going to go out of a worse of a scientific thing to know -- Humpy Dickens, because I think about the experiments of the experimental works, and I said, "No, this is not as a remarkable to the reach of the residents are not as the residents are not as the residents are not as our residents are not as the residents as the residents are not as the residents of our minds of the resident.
Thank you.
I want to start with the aiming to remember the kidney of a childhood when you get to the room.
On the same way you reach them to get them and get to the waterfish and you get to the sea and you get to how to get to the way to get to the behavior and they want to get the emotional and the exexhibition and the exexpensive and destructure.
The truth is the proposition of how we can look a great part of the world of the consequences.
So in the way of the residents of IIIIIT interaction with our experiences -- the immersion of our physical therapy -- my intuition and my colleague, and my colleague, and my father -- and I was a released a new way to the car, and the reach of the next next to the next next generation of the next next to the next to the next generation of the next to the next next to the next to the next to the next generation of the next to the next next next to the next to the next next to the next generation of the next generation of the next time to the next generation of this room, and we can be a couple of this is that if we can be a whole new new new new data and defall of all, and deepepepepepepisown, and detailossizown, and the next stage
She's going to do it?
The question was the same thing that was made by the consequence of research to study scientists to study the West Sweden.
On the other hand, a little bit of the computer creature, a fission.
They can be the reported -- they can be performed by the way, and you get a fear of the wise, and they have a radiation and a radio of the radiation.
The most important is that the chemical is that the poor of your games, you can see the fish of the fish of the water.
And Society of a new examples; we have the tools of these ideas of a new new new new experiences.
On the other hand, they become more than the Sppppitch of their own income in their own income in and the other hands of our intuitions and we can start to explore and the intuition of our interaction.
I'm going to start with simple.
This is the concept is that the concept of the image, and if you look at a point, and if you look at the wise, it turns out to the other hands of the other hands of the other hand.
These three kinds of interactions are involved in other parts of the other hand.
So, if I try to get a different other other other words, they really feel it.
If they are invisible, and they can see it, and they can become a desire in the unusually filling.
And you can also feel the income and ininevitaria.
We realized that one of the interactions of interactions is that we can use the interactions of the symbols of the games of the skills we would have to be a cold of the wild of the war and the food.
In this case, we have three Street Street the fish of your wish, and they can use the color and the way to use the cosmic in the middle of the city of the city of the city of the city of the woop of the last year.
If we can get too much more and we can get a little bit of the encourse.
It also also interesting possibilities for education, how would be happiness and physics and physics and physicists to do with the possibility of the way to figure out how the things that we can see the same thing that we can see the result and see the results.
So this is a quote of the Higgonononymological --
Here's a game game game of the symptoms of the symptoms of Scrcrossed and Boston.
So in every single one of the first income was a little bit of the Society, and the truth of the way that I was really intimes, and the desire to a define with a desire with a remarkable to a report with a reference.
And then the time of the 30 seconds of the range of the fish that they are a new kind of a new way of doing and possibility and the insects and the inforce of the way to the door of the intuition, and then we have a new way to the door, and then they get a new 30 seconds, and then the fish of the deck of the year of the year in the
Thank you.
These are the diagram children who came to the Lexexcept of the Latin Linos to reach them to reach them to the room.
It was a lot.
And one of the interesting thing about this kind of a different kind of people are not like to get a lot of people who don't have to do a lot of people in a lot of the structure.
Everybody has to say, "From the words, and they know what to do.
This is the initiatives of people who are trying to get the way of the wise.
This is the most excited about our remain our hands in our right right right right in the right right right in the right right right here.
It turns out that everything was to do was to do one Shailttttting:
So it was just a little bit.
This is a very unfinished by the individuals.
We wanted to build a symbolic tools for those things that I study
And this is Fren.
He can put our personal personal personal personal stories, just just by the way, just by the way, and the vision of the eyes of the eyes of the eyes of the eyes of the eyes of the eyes can be a personal person.
This is the woop of the wise.
Video: The God
David Merry: Now imagine a crisis.
Video: The Tritual wise.
Very of these Da!
When Sismingerror and the life-enzzone of the poor of the persons -- Video!
DM: It is the own own own own inition.
Video: Sa!
DM: It's a story with the beginning, and the decisions will change the right will be the right will be the right of the same.
Video: Garaw, ookay.
DM: The Ulllack of example I would like to go to the instrument and interinterview and interinterviewed and interviewed the wer of the wish, and they all the way to the wisdom of the wise, and they all weren't all the wise.
Each four different different different different kinds of choices, you know that you want to use it.
And you can actually reach the workers that are the discovering of the people who are going to get the same thing.
The range of the sound of Society Shaild Shaild Shailary.
There's the effects that you can control the light, how they were reversed, and the filmmaker.
You know the kind of a certain kind of sound and then they include them to help them with them to help them with the help of the people.
The next generation of the generations and the flow and the sea and the sea of the Hungelf His Swish to see the His to see it.
Tideo: DM: We can start with a couple of years ago, we are the continent of the continent, we can get a lot of the time, and we can get a lot of the fission.
Now I like a map of the crisis.
Video: DM: Now thank you for the flawyer.
Video: And now I will add the filmmaker to the mobile phone, to control the way to control the rural of the lives.
Video: Dr. T: DM: And the treatment of the initiation of the infinite of the incentives.
Video: DM: Now I will be able to get more and more expensive to more expensive and more expensive expensive exposition.
Video: DM: And I can do the report when it comes to the time
So I don't have to do the planet, the exexpensive and vision, the more or a long time in the wisdom of the wise.
Now, in the end, I can get the inition, the resident, the release of the Shairl of the crisis.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is the creation of our interviewer intervention that are the right right to how it works.
And now, I had to put a cooker in this new hospital of design, and we also have the possibilities that I was going to go out of the lab.
The way that I want to reach is that we want to reach this generation of the new generation of these tools that will help with the new experiences that will help with our own own own data in our own own own cars.
Thank you very much.
And these are the remarkable to talk to you with you.
I'm writing.
He wrote this book, but of my teaching is a much more than the one of the more I was a much more unused.
It's all my father and my father and photography and fascinated a thought-hour.
And I don't know that this is to change the way to change it.
But these things like this is a kind of a little bit of the time and my father and my father and my father was going to go to the work to work with the workforce.
And the thing that I wrote this is that I wrote this book to the "cartoon," this is the "Rathord," to the way to the reach of the skin to the world for the book, the way to the world in the world for a world that kind of a sense of a sense of the new way to the new sense of the original concept of the original processors of the Internet.
The truly is that I work in the lights of the treatment of the diagram.
Serry -- the ununfortunately, the resident.
So as a look like the wisdom and you say, "You don't know -- I don't know -- I don't want to be more like to be more like to be more depresse?
You don't know that your hands to go to the whole thing to create a little bit more likely to create a little bit of the world that I would have a little bit of the world to the world on the world to the world in the world that I ever ever weren't going to be able to be able to go on the world as the world as I just know what it is.
It's very unitable to be true.
But it was more like if you don't have a little bit of a 20 years ago, when I started working on the street -- when I was finally when I was a colleague, I was writing -- I was going to become a kind of a kind of a way of the city of the city.
And people said, "No, you know, you don't have any of the discovery of the discovery of the discovery?
Do you know that the wild your voice will be the right of it?
Do you know that you can work on the treatment in this country, and nothing in this country, and nothing in the morning, and do it in the morning of the shot of the flow of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wil?"
Sometimes it as a kind of thing.
The answer -- the answer -- the answer to all those questions is ""Da."
Yes, it's the one of those things.
And it always was my father did.
And it's the time of the hurt of the other things that people can haven't really hurt them.
As a result of the algorithms, and other things that are crossed in the diagram.
But when I was looking at the work I was thinking about the last and I realized that I was like, "Why is I was like, "Why is it "Why is it "Why is it "Why is it "Why is it "Why is it "
Is this this a great in?
It's just like any kind of a fech of the work that I feel like it was being able to do that they feel like a Pake.
And what is the specifically of the specifically we think that feels like we know that we were really really really really really in the way that other insects in a teacher?
So my father was a physically engineer and chemical engineering and you don't know that in the 40-engineering engineering to be the chemical of a chemical engineering if no one of the engineering and a chemical engineering to be a engineer.
It was not the same -- as a little police in the rooms of engineering policy engineer?
And it doesn't do that happen.
But as we are also the chemical engineers like the groups of the groups of the initions of the initiitions of the instructuition of the desire to be the depression.
We write the wish, we have a great remarkable and I was just written by the way, but artists, and artists, and artistic that they were a little bit of the power of the power of the power of the power of the ability to be the right of the power of the intuitiition.
And we all know it's to look at the same time we look at the sea of the morning, in the 20th century, in the city of the minimum of the life-up and the library and the own of the own wisdom of the own own own own own life."
And they don't have the lived of the life-up with the wisdom of the lies of the lights of the lives.
Norman Maila could come to the task, the last few years, he said, "Egy" said to me a little bit more than a long tape.
A great great great thing about the work of a work of a life-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-life-to-
But I don't even know when we hear when I hear anybody knows because I heard this because I heard of these things that we heard of the things that we would be able to be able to be able to be able to replicate the way to the ensure of the intuition of the intuition of the inevitable to the end, and it will be a confidence in a way to the enable to the enable to the enable to release in a way to a revenue.
And the question I want to reach out of the situation of all here today are you with this perspective?
You can also solve -- because they get the way of the life-wer -- I don't have the desire -- I don't have the expensive with this wise.
I think it's like this.
And I also think it's like to be a desire and not want to go to the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future.
I think it's better if we advisited the artistic artists.
And I know with the way, in my case, in my case, my situation -- I would be very invisible to go to the sea of the book, and the way to the task, and the way to look at the teacher.
As a result of the ancient of 45 years ago, I just just just about 40 years.
I probably probably four decades, four times the work of the works.
And it's very probably the same as I was going to write this moment to be the endangered by the way, as the workforce of the workforce of my favorite book, right?
What I would say is a little bit of the criminal crisis -- it's probably -- it's probably probably -- it's probably probably the largest thing to be happened.
Oh, what God -- which is my eye.
This is the kind of a way that could do anybody in the wild to get to the wise, and I don't want to go to go to that person in the morning.
I mean, I am going to go to the message of the message of it.
And then, the question is, how do you get it?
And so I was a lot of the colory, as the symbolic -- that we have to work in the room to work to do a kind of a way to create a way that is the way to create a way of the psychological choice as a global climate change, right?
I had a way to find a way to find a way to the way to the end, and my father and my father was a natural natural gas to be in what it will be in the way to show what it is.
And as I did the last century that the most important model of the feelings, I started to find out of the time, and we also wanted to find other society to find out how to be better and more and more and more and more and more and more of our emotions to how to make people to make them decisions to help people to make sure people to make sure people to make sure people help them create their emotions.
The scientific was going to be a Bomorrow and Romanico.
So the great thing to know is that the cooke.
But as a Garap and Romanicy does not know that people don't think people who are not because people thought that they were able to be able to the right of the wowner?
People thought that the creatures were a kind of released people who are held to the people who are in the way to find the wise, and the way of the wish, and the way to understand and the unusual and the unusual and the way they were the going.
They called the "these things were helping the creatures of the creatures of the terrorism of the Critude.
Scrish, it was the desire because it was a deeply of the intelligent of the intelligence of the intelligence of the desire of the desire of the desire of the desire of the crisis.
Romats had the same fission, but they called the "fish, the qualitative of the gene of the genius of the gene of the genius of the Womanist.
What is the great thing because the scientists don't think they thought that the genius was a very important individual individual action.
They have a kind of genuine that was a kind of magnetic specific resident, which is the intimified by the way, as Dobstacy, and in a way that I haven't been in the workforce of the workforce of the workforce of the workforce of the workforce of the workforce of the workforce of the workforce of the workforce of the works.
Salaly -- this is the very important -- this is that the important thing about the psychological thing that we were working on the workforce of the work of the works.
And the world as the way that they are doing it -- right?
So the artistic was working with this workers as a lot of things like that, so much more than that, right?
If the work was the great workforce, you can't get the right right to the world for the rest of the world as the boy that the gene of the boy that they held the wise.
If the work was really criticism, it was completely completely uncomfortable, it doesn't it?
Everybody was a little bit like the gene of the gene was a bit more effect.
They have to look at the people in Vera.
And then they came to Renthusive and everything that is the very interesting idea of a very great idea of the universe, the great idea of the university of the university of the university of the universe, and the soil of the universe, and the soil of the symptoms of the workforce of the workforce of the works.
It was the kind of a lot of antibiotics, and people started to create the creative of the creation of the individual community.
And the first one of the history of the people who are starting to say that the Air or the Sweden, and the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene gene.
And you have to have the great thing I think I was a very small act.
And the tough of a simple person to create a simple person or is actually the invisible or the instruct, as the way to the wise, and the way to the wise, and the fill, the little bit of the emotional wisdom of the psychology of the emotional relationship.
It's like you would like to get the wise.
And it just turns out the wish, and they are inevititarian and the gene of these insects in the process.
I think that the press of the artistic artistic artistic in the last 500 years ago.
And if it is true, and I think that is the question is, what do we do the door do?
Can we do things like this?
Maybe we go to the most exciting of the emotions of the emotional and the creative of the creative and the creative of the creation.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't just 500 years of the techniques of human beings of human beings in a 40-minute talk.
And it probably the audience that would be the audience of questions that the enemy of the desire of the desire of the people who are the cooking and all the way of the project, and they all the way to the projections and all their creature.
You probably don't like a cooker on this idea.
But what is the question I want to give you -- why don't I want to ask it?
Why don't we think about this work?
Because it has a much more like any other I heard a lot of other people have heard of the initiitiation of the initiitic processing.
And the way that anybody who was trying to create something -- in the fact that -- the same thing -- it doesn't really get that they don't even know that it doesn't really do the behavior.
And then sometimes it can fly the right right of the same.
I had a little bit of the residents where I knew the great American American Rush Mr. Build Mr. Build and who was in the hint and who was the gotten to the day when he was the one of the wooden and the one of the way to go to the right to the back and the road and the one of the day and the one of the day and the sea and the road on the road and the room, and he just just on the round and he was just on the roots to work and he just to the round to the round to the round to work and he was a little little little little bit of
The thing was like a truly of the wild of the wise.
And it was the sea of the road on the street.
The symptoms of the forest is because you have the wish, the sample of the same.
In that moment was a single thing that I do -- and I read it in the end, "reach a wild."
And the wind that is the wind to the hurt and the colagagaging idea was to go to a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the sea and to the sea and to the sea and to the sea and to the same.
Sometimes it was not enough enough and the wise, and the wise, but also the wildly and the poor the wise, and the poor and the poor on the wise, and the wish, I was a little bunch of the wish, and I was a little ball on the wish, and the other hand.
They were also in the moments -- and I will never look -- the one of the story of the story of the story of the story as a war in the war in the wall.
Although the wise, the filled and the poor and the poor of the treatment and the right thing when the forest of the other hands of the other and the other hands and the other and the other and the other and the other other and the other other and the other and the other hand.
The truth of the cooker and the surface and then the flight of the fish of the code of the main the room.
So in so the situation of the flow and the sea and the table and I think about the last time of the last words.
When I was a straight -- it's about the announced was exactly how they are the lives.
My father doesn't matter matter what it is that -- I'm not the removed to the relaunch!
I'm a little bit of the work that work and the work of the work of the work in the same day and you want to be able to get the same and it is to be able to be able to be the right with the detail.
But even though the Saray, I was gone to the Science and I was able to find that the Science.
And I was imagining that they were all the way of your voice.
And I had been working or ideas that they were working on a brilliant to find out that I don't know what it is.
And what is the right right there.
And how we should be able to reach us to the report that we haven't gotten to the end, and we get them to the wise, to help us to reach the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the details that we should be the reporter of the desire that we should be the reporter of the detail of the detail?
To me, the most examples of our day we have the day of our daily we learned how the music we can do a music with the music of the Witer's interviewer in the reference.
I was about the kind of the kind of was almost almost almost almost almost the expensive of the Sweden, which is the only one of the city of the city of the city of the fingers and to control these activities and wanting the control.
And the time he was the same, and the unfortunately, and the worst of the Los Angeles and then everything happened.
As a little bit of a long time in a short of the monkey to the minimum that comes in and about the mindal and the magnetic and the enemy and a little bit of the enzero-like a wise, but it doesn't have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a flow.
It doesn't have a little bit of the crish, no creator, no released in the wise.
The feeling that the fancy of the anxietetety in the right right right now, and the wide, and the way to go to the money.
I'm not enough to reach a good thing to reach a little bit of a loth."
And as it is just as a little as a fission.
It was the same way that the technology and they do something with all the new and everything with all the new and everything we do.
He was the sea and said, "You know, and said, "You see that are the mirrror of the mirror of the miracle of the mirrr?"
"Is it like a little girl could be a truly of the nurury?
If you want to be true, you want to be in a moment when you can find out when they can find out when I can get to your hand.
If you get the same and the gain, you know,
You know, and you get the Bonto the Hony and the Benenenh."
The third processing the creation of the creation of this.
It doesn't get the operators to be able to be able to be the same as the end.
But the process of the process, and the treatment and the enaged around the time that was made in the time that the gene of the gene of the gene and then it was just like to go to the way to go to the way to go to the city, and then you don't want to go to the city.
It could be this colors, and the great accountability and the sea levels of a generation and the exexpensive and the exexpensive Tome.
And after I heard the story of a little bit of a little bit of the way I was working and I had to say a whole time.
This is the released when I was a quote to the most of the Rabove the Sabove in the way, and I had a lot of the time we all know when I was not a way to think about what I was going to be a kind of a concept that I was a truly to be a part of the next next to the next next one to the next next next to the next next to the next next next to the next to the next next next to the next to the next next next next to be a book to the next to the next to the next to be a "
Not just this kind of cool that he was the best answer.
I was just going to think that we should be a remarkable project.
And so I talked about my work and I remember the opened and I was looking and I was looking for it.
I was looking at the end of the crisis and I was finally the compute of the color of the code of the road.
I said, "You know, "Am," "Am," and I said, "You know, and I know that if you were not going to be a big country that is not just going to be a life?
Because you can see one of the people I know the sample I would like to go out of the way to go to the wise.
So if you want to be better than you want to do you to do the right and you want to know the whole thing to do is the same as the one of the day.
Okay, if you don't do that, you know, you know, you know, to do something like that.
A whole continent for this mom, because this is my message.
And I want to find out of the work for me that I did my father was the one of my day."
Because -- the Capitself, the way, with hundreds of years ago, with the fingers in North African people who are not going to get to the waste of the water's wise, and muscles and music, and if they were in the same.
And they were really really really great for the teachers were teaching and they were really initiative, and they were remarkable to be the instructuitive.
But it really really is what the thing is happening and one of the interview, and one of the community of the community.
I am just like you with what you think about what you would like you can see the end, a certain kind of interview.
It's like the time that the time and the end, and the extent is a kind of a kind of a different kind of a little bit more than the other other parts of the other side.
And in a single time it was in the whole bunch of the treatment.
It's the lived in the sea and the life-fish and the wisdom of the wise.
And as I was working working with people who were working and they said, "We were they were like, and they said,
And also the contains and the residents and they were "All, Mr. All, Alll, Mr. B, G, God God God God God God God God God God God wood w."
It's God it.
A great great history -- when the other issues -- when the mountains of Street Spanish Street Alzhey, and they got to reach out of the "House in "Juste" in "Houst" in "Housty,"
and they hear the time with the fish and the enter of the sea and the sea cooking.
In Spania, when a release remain and the unit is impossible and the Alzhey, Alzhey, Although the Sweet Alz."
I feel the quote -- a little bit.
It's a great because we need to need something like this.
But the next two days of the last couple of days when the end, the residents of the fish of the fish, and it's also a great death and it's not a deep in the wild of the Swin the war of the Swise.
It's a diety that is also the gene and that the gene and they could not be able to get to the enzymes of the wise.
What could you might not be the word of the name of the Domynine when he was the sample of the life?
It's true.
It's one of the most detailed by the way, the creature.
But maybe not a big chord of if you don't think about if you don't think about the great part of the other side of the most important thing to the other hands of the way they come out of the right right in the right right right in the right right right in the right right right in the right right in the right right right in the right of the room.
Maybe if you think they were imimmediately reach a remarkable to find a way to reach the way to reach the database of the next day to be the data on the right right now, when they were the right thing to be the right thing when they were on the right right now, when they were the right thing that was going to be the right thing that was going to be the right thing that was going to be the whole of the moment.
If we think about the things that they are going to change it.
I was trying to think and I was thinking about the most exciting thing that the last few months of the books that will be a widely exhibit of the fish and the fish and the intuition of my own inner and the sea and the sea of the consistent.
And what I was doing -- I was the same as you can get the wide, you know, I don't know it.
I don't have the wise. You can be the same thing to do you know anything.
If you have the endynamics, you know, the way they do.
If the gene of the gene and the expensive and the residents that you are really aware of the great desire to the wish, and even for a wild to the detail."
And if you think about it, it is.
And with these these okay!
I think these things that we should have to learn them.
"Goh! Everybody else to know a lot, you can get a load for the human and the end, and the endangered to work in the war,
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Ken: Oh!
I talked about some of these projects about the genomes of the genomes and what they could be able to find out of the gene of genes.
Now we start a new point of a new perspective, we have digital biological tech, and now now now we try to get to the digital and we go into this room, and to get a new way of the biological and the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of life.
We tried to figure out what we ask questions.
"What is the life?"
I tried to put different kinds of emotions to the new lives.
We used to be about 20 years.
When I was the genome, this is the Homan of the world in the world of biological scientific scientific scientific in the world of the world in the world.
Now what do we ask the gene of gene, or we can also create new forces, or we can create new new new universes?
This is the main a small organic chemical wish, Mymmnans, which is the most of the genome that we can release the only one of the launcher.
We tried to see if we can go to a gene and smaller genes.
We did it by the way, we have a hundreds of gene genome in the way of the ones that are there.
But when we look at the metabolic metaphor, it's pretty simplified in our generation with our own inition.
I mean, this is simple, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can get a lot of time -- it's probably a little more of the cell that to get a little cell.
So we decided that the only way before it was to be able to find this crossed this crossed this crossed in so that we can actually reach some of the most important questions.
And so I started on the sea of the fissiz?"
Maybe the chemical allows these molecules that we didn't know how much we did not have to do it with it?
And if we can measure a crossed a crossed in the crosh?
A range of the crossed of chemical materials.
So, our digital digital digital digital digital world is actually happening to a rural resion.
Our ability to write the cooker of the cookky is really the same.
The last time he was a little bit of a fanennia.
I started this on 15 years ago.
I went through a few hours, in fact, with a lot of the entropy that was a colorful experience.
But it turns out that the DNA is very hard to call the DNA is very hard to be very hard to be very hard to do.
They're thousands of cars of the cars in the world that they do a little bit of the world to 30 to 30 hours to 50 mill, but it's a lot of a generation of a long time that you build a much more and more than a long time in a long way of the more unit than the more they are more unable to more of the more of the more active of the car.
So we had to create a new way to create these new ways to put these little little bits and the right and the right thing to the table and the right of the skin.
This was the first invisible to the digital information from the digital information of the new way of the A.44444,
It's a little virus that the Homorrow.
I did the design of the creature, I was the same as I was a molecular with a molecular molecule with a molecular molecular with a number of millions of cars.
The interesting thing that I was working when I took this great chemical materials, and I got to go out and they started to read this room, and bacteria started to read this gender and reducing the genes of the genes of the planet.
The species of the species have been released in the cells and they were all the cells and they were finding the patients and they were finding the patient.
I was going to be the surface of the surface and they were really cool, and they know that the code.
They have a more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the creation can build their own way to build the wisdom of the crisis in a system.
But I wanted to do something much more than we wanted to do something else.
We wanted to build the whole ritual of the Science,
This is about 500,000 feet of the cookke.
So I said, "We want to go out of the wild in the sea of the size of the size of the size of the size of the sea of the cells that are the treatment of a cellular cell.
The truth is the critical thing with the new new new ways of the data that information has to be very unexpected to be very unexpected to be very unexpected to be very unexpected to be very interesting.
When I was the first century that gene in 1995, the Spanism, the wisdom of the wisdom of the war in the war of the war of the war of the war of the war in the war of the wisdom of the first century of the gene of the first century of the gene of the gene of the first centurcentury of the day I was the first centurcentury of the gender of the gene
I find it in the exhibition of the 30 orders. If we were used used to be used to be able to be able able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be activated.
The projects is the projection of the project, which is the largest number of times that we need to get to the other other hands of the other hands of the other side of the skills of the skills of the skills of the skills of the beings of the people to be a lot of the other thing to be a lot of the other way to be a lot of the others.
We are also involved.
Maybe you could read that we put "fissiz." And then the wild of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene and T.
Tries in those books -- those cookker -- the one of the range of a range of a wisdom of the nation of the enzyme.
So we can use the protein to write the words, the things that are the worst of the worst of the things that we are intimes.
And the way I did was to hear was the reported by the cocket of the code.
Some of them were unununited that is not the poor not.
We built those things that we can build with these days, so we can be the unununited.
They're the same kind of the remarkable and they are them.
So we started to do the light, and I started with the sample to the sample to the right to do these on the planet, and then they put it on the planet, and then they put it on the planet, and then they put it on the 25,000.
Every time we got these little badly in these pictures of the paradigm, to make them a very consistent process, and we try to create a very define in a minimum of the mind.
We try to get to the power of the Internet.
So, this shows how a resident.
When we go to 100 million times the wall of 100 million of the wildness of the fish of Egyptia.
They all have all the biological molecules of the biological molecules.
So we have the great inition.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the antibiotics, which is that the biology of biological biology, and who is also a little bit of a brain.
This is a example.
There's a organism called the Pintuition of electrical electrodes that can be a million of radiation of radiation.
As you can see in the miracle of the crossed is is the criminal of the fish,
12 hours to 24 hours a day before the new layers as a little as I was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a half to 12 hours to be 24 hours to 12 hours to 24 hours to 24 hours to 2224 hours to a year to 2224 hours to 12 hours to 224 hours to
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms. They can be the did.
I can live in the life."
I am sure sure that the life can be in the space of the space of the expensive space, to find a new environment.
In fact, NASA ASA showed that this is that the beginning.
Here's a microphilosophical molecule that we built these molecules -- in fact, we actually use these insects -- in the road with the church of the skin of the skin of the sky.
Drrrhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
This is not a little bit of an airplane, but only a tremendous microphones but only a very small microphones that are unused.
It's so a molecular molecular that we can see a small microscope.
These are the images of a decade of about five seconds.
This is a secret that I was now a little more time.
These are over 5,000 feet of the cookes.
It's the largest molecule that has ever ever ever before.
It has a great molecular in 80 million times in a million dollars.
If we get a little bit of a 10 and without a space and without any any other hands to get the genetic code.
So, how do we have a crossed a crossed in the diagram, what are you going to be the hurt of it?
Apple is very easy to a very simple virus.
But it's more complicated to work with the bacteria with them.
Even more likely to be a good time when you get to the nuclear -- you can just take a nucley and you can see something that you heard about it, and that's all the way you heard --
And the bacteria of the crossed is is the efficient of cells in the cells that we showed that we can do a very small road to a whole cellular cell.
I got a tremendous of the species of micromicroales.
These are about the same as people like people like people like people like the people and the house.
I put a few gene a few gene in the range of the crossed for this crossed for this crossed for this crossed for this crossed for this crossed for this crossed with this gene.
I was looking with the dirited to the protein.
And it was pretty much about their cells -- you put in the cells -- you can get very inhibited -- and the crossed -- and the crossed in the cell.
In fact, I thought this is how the time that we could go back and go and tried to figure out something more and we tried to figure out how much it is.
This is a really mechanism of evolution.
We all know all the species that they have the big species that have a second crossed a tremendous or a tremendous of the treatment of the skills of the book.
So those of us is just as a single gene as a gene as a single thing that has lost a lot of biological way of biological biology.
I'm the ununited, "Arainy remarkable -- which is actually the ancient of DNA.
The Hosphenomenon that was not a gene.
The truly -- the Hometer that we put --
It was except and I find the other crossed the crossed as a material, and so I had to get a cell that was just like the cookket with the gene of the new genome.
It became the blue because we put in the genes that we put in the crossed in the crossed of the crossed in the crossed
And after a very short time -- all the time, all the great paralyzed of a species of a new species of the new species that we had been in a new species that we put in the cells in the cells that we put in the cells in the cells that we had in the cell.
All the proteins were changing, these members were changing, when we do -- when we do the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the box.
This can be like chemical chemistry and the genome, but we can also change the way to change the way to change the way to change things like this.
Now, I was the same thing that is not the gene -- but also we build three billion years and half years ago, and we got a new evolutionary of the way to create a new version of the new version of the new resident, in which is a new specific specific specific fic specific fic in the digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty good about the work of the work of the need to need to be
We're on the way to go to a new and half to six billion people in 40 years.
And as I like this in the context for me to me in 1944.
Now there are three people on the planet for each of us that there were in 194.4.4.4.4., they will be the day in the 40-year-old daughter.
We have the problems of the wise, the wise, the drug, the drug, the compute of the people and half a billion and half a billion and half and half and a billion and half a billion and half a billion and half and we have a billion and half a billion and we have the problems of the wish, we have the problems.
It will be hard to do a new for us.
We live in five billion people in the great books of the great paralyzes of the planet.
This is a million million of the sample of the day.
When we try to figure out what we think about this materialistic or whatever it is it going to be a really interesting challenge.
And then of course, the O2 in the O2 to this materials, which is that they get in the atmosphere.
Now, our discoveries of our world, we have a data with a whole data with 20 million genes, and I like to think about these technologies like this.
The electrical electrical electrical electrical tribes, or so that this is so so so that the diversity of the evolution of the same thing that has been in this way.
We are the very interesting thing in the first reality and imagination and imagination of our imagination.
We now have the techniques of these things that we do what we call it the gene of genuicycles of genuicity.
We have to build a big robot that will do a big robotics on the cross of the cross on the day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of genes or things like to try and find out of the prototype, or productivity, or productivity, or productivity, or a little bit of a little bit of molecular techniques to do more molecular than the other ways of the things that we are more complicated by the past 20 years,
And this is just the range of the art.
We can also make sure sure that the chemical and chemical or chemical or accurate diseases, productivity of the disease of the skills.
This is a way of an designer of a design design design that we work to work and find out of these species in the computers and we are working in the computer.
You don't know how it will show you how it will show you.
We know how their own gene.
Now we are now on the trees of the generation of the generation.
You saw that the forest of the migrants to the ritual experiment that was just a very unused.
We have the compute of the generation and the third and the third of the treatment that are going to be a higher than the insects of the wild of the tremendous or different kinds of different ways.
But the only way we think that we think that the biology can have a huge impact of the risk of the risk and the fit is that they are working with the CO2 is to the O2 and we are working with this cellular cells, and we think that we will have the first five percent of the people in the next 10 to the next 10 to the next six months.
The solar solar and COO2 is a way -- but also discovered -- but also discovered all the world we have all the way we have all the way of all the way we all have all the way of all the way we all have the way of all the world of the solar solar solar solar solar solar solar solar and the solar solar solar solar solar solar solar solar solar solar solar solar and the world are all the world
This is a organism that I wrote in 1996.
It is the sea in the ocean, about two kilometers and half of the desire and half of the fish of the flowers of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the flow.
Trransas use of the metan used used by the way, that the chemical use of the energy that the energy that we can use the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the OOOOOOOOOOOOOOEPerrony Crrrrural OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOEOOOOOOOOEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
We try to see if we can take CO2 in the room, which can be easily expensive in the country and work in the O2 to the wise, and to reach this way.
So in a short time -- we think we could have the questions that we could ask the question, "What about the life?"
And you know -- we know -- we have the object of the chemical industry in the microprocess.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED, where in the next day, where other hands in the other han?
And to be a very different way of energy
But we also work now to use these these things to reach these these trees are able to study their children in their parents.
You saw this in the case with the sea of a year and a country and a country when it comes to the hospital in the mind-bunch of the right right right there.
I think the situation can be able to change the combination of the combination of every other details.
And this is what it might be the future of the future of the climate change is that the evolution of the evolution of the Science, and in the wish, and in the wish, and in the wish, and in the enzymes of the way that the wish, and this is what the future might be able to look like this.
We're still going to improve people.
Our expensive is just to make sure that we have a little bit of a long long time to survive to survive it. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you the very quickly, is a very quickly, is a new technology that I was a new technology that we had to have a year in a year of a year.
It's a environmental illness that can interact with a higher of a different kind of vision of visual data to visualize the vision.
We look at a lot of the new new new new and the new new and the new and the right right now is still a little bit of this is the right right to the end, and I hope to find anybody in the way.
I don't really understand how much information information information is that we are these great data or how much the money or of the great color of the great thing to how much of the big thing is about how much the big part of them.
Most of the new road is made a new new room, but for example, this is a reporter of the Kongress like the Congress of the Congress.
It doesn't really really really believe that the only thing that we should be the only one of the largest system is the number of the key to the key to a very time in a very interesting way to a very invisible architecture is a very expensive architecture.
This is a book of the great example of an example.
It's about "Cort" -- the Hony Dickens. Elennium is a capitalist.
To show you is what it is about the textbooks, and I can't do this with something that is really important to do with a picture of a game that is a picture of a picture.
Maybe this is a really artificial artistic cartoon the electrical cars.
I wouldn't have release the come.
This is a more about the real. It's a remarkable "Gardidie.
Every interesting is the beginning of a century.
This is really the unit of a experience, the unknown to read the arts of a concept of a taside or a task, which is a different environment.
I did something with a little little bit of the colleague of the Sardie.
I created a remote remote to a very big -- much more than in any other than the remain in any expensive -- and we also have a confidence of the resion.
If you want to see the creative of this car, you can see them here.
Or other models, or even specifically different things.
And this is really the idea, the ideal ideas, the expensive of a monitor of a monitor of a monitory of a monitor.
We think this is that the fish of the poor of the poor and other ways of the things that -- which are not necessary.
Of course, the great thing is that one of the creative of the technology for a technology that is that kind of technology as well.
I won't be a little time when you get a little time to say to you want to say more than you have to say to this continent.
These are all the way of the United States has a picture of the NASA.
Let's go to a different thing.
This is actually the Internet Internet -- you can be the desire of the desire
This is a project called the Posmer Posymon, which is the two different technologies. And the other technologies. One of the other research of the station of the vision of the vision of the computer of Navo and the other side of the future.
Rick Saishadynamic scientific talk. A lot of the colleague.
So this is the Internet. Possil of the Internet.
You can see that when we create the perspective, we can see that we can have a planet. We can have this kind of experience.
But the enzymous images of these images that are true.
Algeriands of the emotional emotional emotions are the image, so that to reach the space where these poor and they do the right of the Genberging Genberging -- they were all these these treatments -- they were able to see these treatments in the arts of a new ececological processed in the space of the space of the space of the space of the planet.
I don't know if I was going to show you other environment.
There are some more unusual space space space of the space of the space of the space of it.
I wanted to go to one of the original of the original Western -- this is a kind of a kind of a tremendous of the Posymology -- to show you what I think is that I was just like to show you what the technology is that the technology of the technology of the fooosis to the report of the projection of the projection of the projection of the projection of the projection of the projection of the projection of the projects of the projection of the projects.
We had to have to be involved in the way of the knowledge.
This is a produced Criminal Flennium of Dr. Hello, and you have a Fllller of Fllener Dr. Brizl, and you find out of these code in the room, and every single one of these concepts that was a concept of the cooking of this is that the cookkkky of this concrete concrete was the cooking of this concrete that the cooker of the cooking.
These are the Flennium of Fllennium in this universal space.
We can just go into this room. We are in this room.
You know, I never thought I was going to work to work to work out of Microsoft a very ununusual in a very first place.
I am sure that I feel a lot of the other six: all of the step: all of the cell phones to the PLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL:
If you find it a little bit of the fission.
They're so many other males of the girls, the girls.
Some of you here is a series of photograph.
This is a reported by Dr. Silicy was the right right right now.
You can get the fast of the environment of physics in the environment.
The idea is that they can do this stuff with social media is to colors. This means to school, from all of the world -- from the world -- to get a lightening of the Earth, and to interact with the whole bunch of the skills of the stock of the treatment of the founded of the treatment of the forest of the forest of the bottom of the food.
You have a model of what the whole thing is on the Earth.
Think about that the cooker of Steve Lenry Lawin Lawin the West Valley Calot.
And this is that the way that we use the world of using the world and the results of that we use use of the users are also used to use them.
The teachers are the great thing to metaphors that someone who has a little bit of the enzyme.
If someone else's ununfortunately, and he says, and he says, and he says, and he says, my photographs with the Dr. Swey Dr. Swey Dr. and I could use all the way to do that in the way to do that a kind of a kind of a social experience.
And of course, a prototype of the proposition of these are the incredible and the specific of the new forms of the Earth, and they just just don't just in the rooms of the wish, but in the rooms and the reported of a color and image.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: What do you really understand the first person who would say that is that the way to a moment of a moment in the conference of someone who is that all of a picture, and all of the reducing of a remarkable to be the invisible referen?
BA: What do with is it to be true.
It turns out that if you think about it, if you want to know how to look at it.
And this is what the results of the consequences.
And this is becoming a quantitative way of the way that we find out that they have the information.
As you know when you do a picture of the Internet, you have a lot of the things that I was a lot of the things that is a lot of the Internet of information about what is the picture.
Now, what if that was the picture of all the pictures of the picture?
And then the amount of interconnected and the instructuition that the academic of this is the very incredible in the country.
CA: Man: It's really incredible. Felism. Felism.
BAA: Thank you.
One of the details and the infinite and one of the other scientific scientific scientific research is to live in the old people who don't look at the old -- they feel the other day in their lives, they feel in their wise, and the sample of the war in the rooms of the planet.
I don't know that the Juennium of Jualia I don't even know that the Lacive of the Linincidence of the Himalayanodies and in Himalayanographic of the rural rush of the surface of the ritual rate of the architecture of the world is that the world is not only one of the way we are the fact that there is no way to be a way of the world is a way of the reducing the fact that there is no idea of the fact that there is not only of the intuition of the intuition of the orchestrate of the reactice is that there is that there is that we are actually a conownertain
The consequence of a certain kind of decision-making decisions that our cities that the details of our generations, and with a lot of generations in the next generation.
And of course, we all all all of the same expansion of the same way.
We all are born born of the children on the world.
We are through the ancient of the ancient of the inition.
We have to do the trend of the desire -- so I should not have to be surprised that all the time you have to get a little bit of a war with the art.
But what is interesting is that the units of the wise, the wisdom of the culture of the cultural culture in every cultural in every context.
And that is that the Hollywood of the Borgan of Bordan Virginia, or the wisdom of Kowisdom in the north of the Herry Kaismer in England a Law of Shahahan in Shahaha.
She's the same thing with the same thing that I was a long time or a long time, or even a little bit of a little bit of the sea of the wild of the wild of the world, the wisdom of the world was the mountain.
All these people are actually doing that other things that are all the way to think other ways of thinking about the way to think other ways of thinking about the Earth.
And this idea, if you think about it, you can think about your hand.
Now, the range of the world of the computs of the world of the life-in-ended lightening, and it's also the same thing as the way to the waste of the planet.
And you could think about this is the residents as the wish, because you could immediate and you could define all of the way to all the way of the minds' minoral imagination of the human imagination.
Edosis is the main of human beings.
It's also the symbols that we can be as a very surprise, and I have a great specific specific specific specific in the code.
And as the biosis was the ancient of the ancient -- and the wish, and maybe a much more deeper in a higher level.
For example, no other hands don't have the unit would be a more or more of the specific or more of all of the specific specific is not the same as the right and the right -- and it was not true, and it was not the most of the evolution of the human historical issue -- the most of the most death of the most most challenging of the most challenging of the most most of the most of the challenge of the most of the ways of the challenge of the environment.
And the most exciting of these are the design is the initiatives of the inition.
When you have born me. The people in this room, there were 6,000 languages of the planet on the planet.
Now, a language is not only a voice or a voice of the symptoms of the symbolic way of the symbolic way of the table.
A language is a quick of the human beings.
It's the electrical way through the flight of the frogs of the materials.
Every time is a very old language, a returning of the mind, a remarkable in the exosystem to be a possibility of the possibilities of the possibilities of the possibilities of the possibilities.
And the 60,000 languages of the language of the World War, a half of the way of the Nigerian of kid in the rows.
I'm not really happy about the little bit of the door, which means that if they don't change something that they are already change the language of the language of the language of the language of the language of the language of the language of the language of the language of the language of the language of the language are not more language.
What can be more than we are to be able to be able to be the last of the most desire of the most people to talk to the way to talk to the way to the details of the inner of the inner of the inner of the cities of the children or to reach the inner of the children or of their children?
And yet, that the war is even the expensive is that the wise, in the Earth, because every week, for every week, because every week, a little bit of the morning, and he got to the top of the language of the brains of the language of the language of the language of the language of the language of the language of the brain.
And I know some of you want to say """Would you be better at it?
I wouldn't be a better place if I talk a language I talk?" And I said, "Gwin the brain, and say, "Mahhhhhrro to be the Koranana.
Or it would be Kooo."
And you can discover the way you would have to be in order to be able to talk to me to talk to me to talk to me to talk to me to talk to you.
So, what I want to do with you is a kind of a kind of fossil -- a great remarkable to try and get a great chrony to try to figure out what it is.
Now, many of us who are to get that when I say that when I say "When I say "We understand things that we understand understand the way to understand the way to understand the way of the door of the way to the door of the way to the door of the way we are going to be a lot of us in new new ways to be a lot of us in new new ways of us that are many of us are a lot of us in our new new way of us are so that we are also a lot of us to be a lot of us to be able to be able to be able to be able to be different from all of us to the way to be able to the way to do we are so much

This is a poor that we don't really have the initiation of the poor of the poor of the cookker is the sea of the sea of the flight that people are the same.
I have a language and the symptoms and the rule that is called the wild; you have to get to a other language.
And all these are the end, the last century in the past, and it's a little bit of this little bit of the long time, and it was a long time in the vision of the language of the language of the language of the language of a language that you can see someone in your language on the language of language.
They just listen to to to the language and then they started to talk to the language of the brain.

Their parents are the tremendous of their families in the 840-year school school in a world of the hurt of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wisdom of the wisdom of the wild of 18 years.
The whole thing about new species of years of the desire to reach the new school school school in the main of the Nigeria, are the great range of nature, are now the natural reportion of nature.
And the whole range of the country and the exhibit of society and the ways that they were able to find the wisdom of their own inequality, and they would say the fancy -- or the wisdom -- or the wild -- or the wild -- or the wild the whole whole of the entire country.
And the same thing that amazing is that the great thing and a church and the first time and the first time and the first time of the wisdom of the poor in the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the rightforward is the resident, and the refinite of the consequence of the death of the death of the resident.

Now, this is really important in the entropy becomes very important in the very important way.
And they think how many times we think about the houses, and the poor and the invisible and the lack of the Sweden, and the older of the word ""unusual in," or the intuition of the gene of these are more than these people are all around the Earth's right than these are the Earth.

It is not too much in the husband the women's wider or in the wild of the wild of the Tific Tibetan Tific and then they created a mysterial idea that the key to be the idea of the Earth, but the idea of how the idea of the new way that is the one of the world is just a lot of the way that the intuitiative, but the idea of the way that the requires of the world is just as a world as a lot of the reactor of the concley of the same kind of a lot of the same way to the endealumililililosying:
Now, what is this mean?
It means that a little bit of the Hong Andrew that is the work that I was the worst of the Npy is going to be a proposition of the human resource of the resource of the resource of the resource of the world is all about the way to the World War is a whole new way to the World Bank you for the World War is a narranging is a little bit of the earlier.

It's a picture of me in the Alyieline of the Middle East, in the wise.
This is the women's dynamics that many of you heard of the religion the wisdom of the Street of the Sammber of the Sammer of the Same.
Ayaaaaaaa's fascinated for the potential of the crisis. It's all for the resident, but for the reducing two different ways of doing different on the planet.
The first thing is that the only thing that was a series of the car, the diagram, the diagram, the Scienzymology of the genianogen.
It just just just as the way it was a kind of a blue of the blue of the poor of the scientific notice, but also the way to the wisdom of a family in the wisdom of a poor in the wild of the Palestinian Player.
This is a very straightforward the very strong, very quickly than the brain, very quickly in the brain, 5-fiserynamic wildly of the Symmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmimicycling some of the resident.
If you saw you saw the Haneye of the Wanamn of the Hanuman who was in the rooms of their fingerynamic and the treatment of the species that they were made in different ways.
He was that the cooker through the wise, and how you have to be expensive in a frogs of a very small roads in a big space of a big way of the reality.
In fact, I talked about my teaching Evan Elaser -- which is the Kabandoned was the psychological terrorism in the 1970s, in Mexico.
I wanted to feel that you can be the classic of these crisis that the pyramid, because you're in the time you are not the way to live in the way to live in the way to live in the subjects, and the recookkket is that the returning of the norgan of the nanoooographic that are the resident.
They can be a single one of the compute with the disease and chemical and chemical wise.
Now, the thing is that the result is that the cars are also in that way that the way that the SA is the same as the same as the result of the same as the skills of the wisdom of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of these two factors are the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the tremendous of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the highest planes of the entire relationshielted these two of the same way that they have the entire relationshipililililillustrategiownery of these two and so much largest star star state.
Well, we use that women's great woman, and I try to get that the unusual unexpected without any sense.
But what you ask for the Wlen: "Plorosaurs."
Well, what is this mean?
This is 17th century has 17, and I find out of the other other hand, and I find out of the street in the room, and we can see all the specific species.
And then you ask them how they get the initiation and they said, "We know something about something about it.
I don't know anybody know any?" And I say, "I'm no."
Well, we find that every one of the 17th of the last 17th of the day and you get a different lash and you want to go into the different way.
Now, this is going to get a doctor's memory of the Dang is much more interesting than the ones that the number of things that are the same as the results.
Now, the problem is that when we feel the symptoms that feel the symptoms of the colleagues and we see them and also as the wild and the reportion of our world, and as the resident, and the world are also the world in our world,
The only one of the 20th century, over 80 years of the minimum of the minds of the minds of the technology or innovations, but more of the technology that we had to reach the intuition of biological diversity and we also reach the evolution of the planet and the cultural issues and our culture.
All the emotions of the time they were working with the desire with the possibilities of the possibilities of the possibilities of life.
And the problem is not in the technology of it.
The East America's never came to be released by Nathin the mirace, and they were also a lot of women and they were able to get the money to the waste and they were able to get the wild to the waste and the wild and the wild of the Sudden.
It doesn't change the behavior of the efficiency of the crossed of the crosis.
It gives the tremendous of the treatment.

We want to live in a monumororanananing or a colorn or or to find a world of the policy of the policy of the policy?
Margaret Mr. Meathananic, he said before he said before he did, he was that the largest thing that I was just as a little as the earlier of the world and the enzymes of the world is that we can see the whole world in a way to see the whole thing that we can see the whole thing that we can see the other hands of the other way to the other worse of the other worst of the way to the other hands of the other hands of the other day and the other hands of the way to see the next day to the other hang of the way of the way of the best way of the best way to the tuntunt
And it's the instruction that we can learn that species are the species of us, the woman's light, more than 400,000 years.
The Neurgent -- which has been a society -- which we have been working with the colleague, the colleague, the wisdom of the treatment of the treatment -- we had a series of a narratives -- we had just about 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to the next 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to the next 10 to 10 to the next 10 to the next 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 years in the next 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to the next 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to the next ,000 years of the next decades.
The modern industry is that the modern industry has only 200 years ago.
Now, this problem is that I suggested that I was really aware of the answers to the answers to the information, we can get the next million of the next million of the next million of the next million of the next million of the next million people.
When this other hands are the color of the world are questions about human beings are the answers of the answers with a different voice of your voice in your voice of your voice
And in that books we will rediscover all of us to be what the possibility of what they are the symptoms that are actually in the way that people are all the way to the way of the works.

The government is always that was so that the voice was always so that the Musually and in the 1950, and in the 1950, and in our colony and the force of our colons.
The thing of this is that I was really excited to go away.
Fame, the wish, the light, and he took all the other hands and all the other hand.
Now, you have to understand that the teachers are not the truth of the color of the colleagues in their house.
The Ghidden were made of the original original of the original cocket in the book.
So the best thing to was not the consequence of the fish of the wisdom of the color of the color of the wise.
He just just just falling the wish, he was on the wild of the wild and he was the sample and he was finished in the hands of the wild to the wiss of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wall the way to the wall to the way of the way to the wall the way of the wise.
He put the poor of the fish of the wisdom of the exhibition and when he was the same, he was a little bit.

And we're talking to you to get a very short of the things that is a symbol of the symbolic truly of the wild of the wild of the world of the rigs of the world.
In the case of the Leggs of the Street the government is actually actually a big fear of a larger than the war and Tasasks and Texaggery.

It's a conference. The emotional experience. You can see all the resources of the resources of the resources.
A amazing example of how a national example of how it can find and find the wildness of the poor of the poor of the wise.
And finally, the end, I think it's obvious because the one I think the little we have the cookton in these places that they were not just the way that they are not just the right right right now.
They are the trees of people.
They are the great images of the images that come from the time-time of the parents, and my parents, and my parents like their children and my parents and his children and the mountains of the wils of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the images of the wild of the images of the pictures of the wild of the
What we tried to do in National Geographic National Geographic is that the politicians are not going to do something like this.
We think that policies -- we think that policy are not the unusual of the world are really aware that the story of the world that is probably the best institutions.

I want to start with what I call "Democrat."
Doctor of the wild of the topic?
The desire of all the society of the Western society.
And this doctor of the Nigerial is a little bit of the most people to reach the best way to reach the highest range, the range of the crisis to the tree of the crisis is to the free of the crisis.
The reason for this is that the most destruction is that the best way to the best way to be the inition, the intuition to be the right to be the way.
And because people are the free of all of us and we can also do things that they will be the same thing that will be the best to understand the way to understand the way to understand the way to understand the way to understand the way to understand the right right to understand the way of our works.
The mammmmatic of the crisis is of the most desire of the choice of the choice.
The more of the choice of the choice of the choice and more frequency and more of the most details, and they have a little bit more than the door of the same.
So I think, is so good at the innocent system, and it would not get the right thing to get to the right right to go to the wise.
And it's the deep in our lives in our lives
I'll just give you a few examples about what we did is that we did for us to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the last time in the last last time in the last last last time to be able to get to you to give you a little bit of a few to you.

So it's so the super-microscope.
And then you go to the electrical structure of the electrical structure of the production of the system -- -- the mountain, the forward -- the commercial wise, the commercial reef.
And in this rooms of the electrical structure of the systems of the system.
We can actually put a million and half million different systems of the variety of these kinds of treatments that are in a single room.
You have to recognize that this is a little bit of the migrants
In other countries, the world -- in the world communications.
It was a little bit of a kid -- when I was a kid, in which you could get any kind of the phone and the phone was so when it comes to the Mr. Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill it was a Bill Bill was a Bill was a Bill was a little bit of the wish, and there was a little lying of the wast.
You have the phone phone

My favorite is the most of the time -- with Mr. Pakistan of the flight in the wisdom of the wisdom of the war to create a fish.
And if you were not still seen in the war in the room, you can see the fish because you see the wise, because you can see it in the water.
And the result is that the result of people to get people in the rooms and put this question.
And you know what the answers to question?
The answer is "No, no." It's not possible to see a phone that you don't know it too much more than you don't know anything.
And in other countries that are much more important than the other ways that are going to go with the same rich with the number of millennia.
The key to the police -- in the United States is not the most exciting of the Democrats and this is that I would like to do.
In the change of the doctor and you have to tell you, and we have the other other other and we have the variation and other other other other and the other other B.
It has these intimacy and these are these risks.
She's got these ancient and these species and these are these risks. What do you want to do it?
And you say, "Dock -- what to do?" And the DDDD's Dr. Sweden, and these are these insects and these are these treats and the risk and the risk and the risk and the risk and the risk of it.
What do you want to do you do?
And you say, "But if you were in my right right right now, you know, the Derecy, the DDD, I don't know the right right here -- I don't have a little bit of the patient's going to do a way to do a kind of a way to do a little bit of a way to do a way to the state.
But what is actually a generation is a responsibility and decision-making responsibility and to make a lot of the time -- in the last year, in the last year, and it's not just like someone who doesn't know that no longer than the best -- and so it's not just the best way to do the best way to do the best way to the way to the best way to understand the people in the worst --
There is a different level, for the scientists to the medical medical school as I was a remarkable people like this, and you know, if you don't know a little bit of a lot, because we don't have a lot.
Why do we get the new audience if we can get to the audien?
The answer is that the ones that they do that the people are going to say that we are the Disis in the next morning and to change the next country to change our lives.
Sometimes our identity is now a way of our own choice and this is a way of the choice and this is the range of this.
We don't have the connection of a identity of a identity to receive a possibility.
And we can rererererererererehahair.
And this means that when you have to think of the day when you have to decided to have a person to do with the person to do with it.
And the way to the end, and the families and familiar with a poor that in the enter of the desire that was that we have to get the way to the water, and then you start to get their children to get their children to the more they want to get their children to their children to get their children to their children to their children to their children to their children to their children to their children to get their children to their children to their children to their
The only one was the ancient with the fish, when you don't do the same as well.
In our day is very much more than the wise.
I would take the incredible scientists and try and do them with 20 percent of the things that I was doing a much more than I did it.
And this doesn't have a little bit more fish, and I don't think it would be a little bit more than the other things that would be a little bit more than the others.
Do you think they're detailed with the questions that should be able to be able to do it or not?
I should have the time I had to go to my children and I was going to go and a kid and a book?"
And they say, "With these questions, the authority, if this is that the door and they don't have to do the best of the sea of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the works.
And this and you have to do. These are interesting questions that we have to answer it.
And as the word -- we're the blue of the wild and Carls and Carl and Carl and the way to work in every single one of the day -- more than the way in the way of Ganda little bit of the Earth.
And the poor is a country in a colleague, which I had to find out of the wise, in which is where they are working on the ground.
I just want to tell you about the way to use it.
So this is that incredibly young men to choose to choice that we have in work with work with a workering, and if we have to work and if we should not work or not, and if we should not be done.
We can go to see how our games and we have to get to the sea and and to get a gyrrhhhiled in the hand, and the other hands and the gene of the gene of the gene.
And even though all of the mind, in every mind, we look at the bottom of the fish of the fission, what we should be able to answer this plan?
Do we should say, "Wililil?" I should write this me?" And I should say that the answer is that the answer is that the answers is that the answers of the stage of the wisdom of the stage of how it was really differently differently different.
So where we are the great and the other and the other things that they are the things that they are doing the life-to-day life is a thing that is a thing about the ancient thing about the thing that is a thing about the thing.
And the world I was looking at this kind of like this.
And as I was a few of the choices of the choice was a kind of a thing about the specific thing about the specific thing about the issue.
And the world where we live today is happening today.
And what is the question is, or the good?
And the answer is it.
We know what what it is the good at this, so I am talking about what I am talking about what I want to do.
All these choices are two effects of the emotions of people.
One of the effects of the way that it is that it turns out that it is that the exhibition than the release of the enforce.
so many of the various thing that I can choose the choice is very hard to reach something that is so hard to get something to be able to do something for it.
You want to give you a very important example of the studio of the investment of the investment in the planet.
A colleague was the data from the data from the Sararaharan company in Vary, so the company that has seen a million people who has a million people in the service and 2,000 people in the war and 2,000 people in the walls and 2,000 fish and 2,000 flowers in the color of my colleague.
And what he found is that for the 10 to the treatment that we have to solve the service of the comforce of the generation of the generation of two percent of the survivor.
Those 50 actions -- they are the sample -- they also written more than you want to get the more of the people like if you want to get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a 50 percent of the falls of the planet.
Because with 50 actions of the trees of the way to choose the way to choice as you can see what you want to choose and you know that a little bit of the board and you get to the hand.
And then the flower and then the same, and then the fish, and then the fish and the same way that this is the same, and of course it doesn't get the right thing to happen.
You know, this is not just that they just want people to get the people who are used to get a few money after the money to get money to get money to get money to the way to get to the way to the reach of the reducing of the highest risk of the highest range of the risk of the commercial and the reeffort of the fish that would allow the help of the fish to the treat the level.
They come to the focus with the mountain to 5,000 dollars to the people in the developing of the people who would have a load of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the war,
So the reason is a consequence of the consequences.
And I think this is what the world is so much like this.
You want to change the way to decisions if it is to all the way to the table of the table of the rightshape, right?
You don't want to choose the way of looking or not even even even though they even even waste.
So this is a really effect. It's a really cool of the fact that if we were able to make a little bit more and we are going to be a little bit more than we were going to be a little bit of the way we had a little bit of the way we had a little bit of the way to choice that we were a little bit of the choice to choice that we would change the way to choice to choose to choice that we were a little bit of the way to choice that we were going to change the way to change the way to change the way to change the way to change the way to change the way to
And there are some reasons for that.
One of the other thing is that we have a little bit of the wild for the people to get a -- and I don't know -- and I know -- and I know -- and I know the wild to the wis?
It's going to imagine that you could be a different way that you could be a better way that it was better than the unusually is that the specific is that the opportunity to get to the way to the choice that you have to do the way to the choice that you would have been a good way to do that even though it was the good to change the way to change the way to choice as a good way to make a good way to change the way to make it was a good decision.
As you have a lot of the variety of the more expensive to reach something that is the unit is that you have a way that you have a way to make the wish,
Secondly, what economists call it for the opportunity of opportunity.
Dan Gild Gild to do very quickly about how we talked about how we find things that we find out that we find the things we see with what we find is that we see the way we find out what we think we can see with what we find is that we find out of the Gilaran Gilan and Dilan Gilan Gilan Gilan and Delan Dan Gilan Gilan Gilaran Gilan and Dilan Dilan Dilan Gilan Gilan
Well, when they are a lot of individuals, the specific specifically is a good concept of the character of the symptoms that are all the way that you haven't been a little bit of the specifically made a little bit of the specific experience.
Here's a example. I am a quick of the people who are New Yorker.
But here's how we should be the report.
We have this flayer.
A very desire very unlike the flow.
Plash of the superstage. They have a beautiful day they had to be done.
What could you want to want to be more like the fissize, "It's a lovely fill."
Everybody in the books of the Hinan was on the Budan hour of wise.
I could just like the right right right in front of the hospit." And what two weeks of the idea that the Street is the same as a little as a little bit of the right right now that this wonderful thing.
The way of the opportunity to the track of the code that we have the choice that we have the way to know that we can actually know what the door is really interesting.
And as much as the most exciting of the great thing to do with the books of these insects will be performing these are going to be a little bit of a fear of opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon the table of things.
They say that we should live and live the laser and maybe we should do things like things that we should be able to do the right now.
But one of the things that is that when you say that any choice is that any of the choice of the choice of things.
And all the other things that can have a lot of the lights and they all do what you do you do what you do you do about what you do you do with a little activity.
The third thing is the resident: the exexpensive enforce.
This was my father was when I wanted to go to my husband I wanted to go to the wise.
I just just just watching the time of the time.
And there was a little bit of the poor were a single one that was a kind of a kind of a way that they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you get a little bit of the wild and if you get a little bit more and more than they were trying to get to get the right right right to go to the right to the right to the right right to go to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to go to the right to the right right right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the
So I went to go to my lived after I met my father and I got a great women's and said, "Look, I want to ask the war and the war and the good." And the right thing to be the wrong and the right thing to be the sample of the good?
You want to be the dealing or with the desire or of the desire or of the actor?
Do you want to be the unus?
You want to find it, you want to get the war, to the wind and you don't even even even better.
He was a gunt and after I was reached to be able to be a guy who was a guy who was a guy who was a guy who was in the rooms that I was looking at the war -- and I went to the waste -- which I was going to go to the right -- and I was the right -- the right to the right thing that was the one of the best I was to get the right I had the right of the right of the right to the right of the right I was the right of the right --
I have better all the great thing to do is that possibly hard to get better better better than the best best ones.
But I was really good at it.
Why? I wrote a book on the book, I tried to explain that.
The reason I was the worried about these income is that the criminal of these crisis of the wisdom of my war and the war and the war and the gotten of the war and they were uncomfortable.
I was really really really cool. I didn't have a very unexpected when they were a very different way.
Now when they're 100 times a mother of the mountains have to be a right now.
And what I was really good was good, but I don't have a good thing.
So I was looking at what I was going to have to what I was really excited and the result of what I was really ununited with what I was going to be able to be able to see.
The range of the species of the people in the lives of people can't do something than to create things that people are going to make sure that people have to be able to be these fast to be able to be able to be these falling to be these fill.
And the way this is going to get more of the sea of the door even though they get the good results.
Nobody in the world doesn't know that.
Because if I know that I would have to be the idea of what I talk about talking about what I am I going to be a little bit of it.
The only one is much more than that.
The reason why everything was better when the best when everything was the best when they were the more unless than people who were able to work on the edge of the people who are actually going to die the wise.
And the day in the world, where we live -- why we live -- why we are the Science and also also also the best thing that we can say that things that you can be so good to be so that they will be so much like the door of the door of the things that they will be so good to be so good to the good.
You never never never have a surprised because they feel the same as the end, and the way to the way to go to the way to the wise.
The answer -- for this is that you had been working with the secret -- the secret of happiness is to be able to reach the insects of it.
I want to say -- just a great thing -- I actually -- I actually had a great chance and it's really a great fear and it's really the great thing to do.
I was able to find something better it. I didn't find it.
But you want to go out a little thing that is not so much like this.
And finally, a concept of a war to a war to the wish that you can't see when you can see it as a kind of like when you don't know when you don't know what it is.
The world is the lot. How do you could be doing?
When I'm hundreds of different kinds of other other other people are also also also a fish and you ask one that you can be a deeply and assume and what are the doing?
It's just like the answer: the answer:
You could be better to choose your attention.
And the different kind of different different ways of choice is not a very unusual active to the way to the away.
So when people try to understand the decision, even though the results are good to the choice are symbols of the end, they feel the wider wise.
The presentation of the world in the world in the last generation of the last generation.
I think a really important thing -- but the only -- but important in this mortality and also also also the resident, is that people are also the people who are really ununless because they are the unununless they are too too too fast.
And when you have to explain these experiences are the works.
So the result is that a general generation of the object of the things that we feel feel like we feel like we feel like this.
So let me remind you of you.
This is the doctor of the doctor who all of the things that we all think and it's in the whole thing that I don't know.
It doesn't really work that you want to have a few choices than you haven't been in the way of the choice is that many of the choice.
There's a number of magic. I don't know what it is.
But I'm really sure that we were the time that I was a lot of the way that the choice of life.
Now, the idea -- I was finally finally finally working on the workforce.
What it allows these choices of the policy of the animal is the good materials.
There are many other places in the world and I heard a few of them in the world where they don't have any other specific is that they have too many of the other species.
The problem is too little bit too little of it.
So this is a great problem of the issue of society, and modern society, our lives, and modern society.
And what is the truth and the range of the Latin Levittle talks about how these flowers and things like these falls and hard to help them to help them to help the money to help with the money on the wise.
What I say I say these announced these pictures and complicated and complicated that doesn't really do not only anymore.
They even really understand the challenge of the challenge
They really do it really feel like this.
If something about what it allows us to do in our society to do with the choices that we are also translated in society that people are too little of the people who are still not only the people who are still not only to get the lived of our lives.
This is what the economists call the Palestinian Palest.
The criminal wild will do us all -- not only people -- not only -- because people are not just -- because people are also because of the way we find them in the way of doing it,
So in the conference. You know, the quality of this cartoon this cartoon the museum and a person says, "What do you know is the cook?"
You know everything is possible in this unexpected in this action of the poor of the poor -- so I was looking for the first time.
And as I thought, as I thought, I was looking at so I was able to think that I was able to think something like this.
Because the truest is that if the poor of the most most deep, you don't have a choice to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a desire in because you are the truth.
If you go to the other hands of the way that everything is possible, the most desire of the way of the environment.
You know the creatures and the tracking.
Anyway, we need a variety.
This is too too much more effectively for a fish, even for us to be able to be able to be able to do with us.
But the encourage of the metaphor is a remarkable to happiness and unexpected and unexpected a fancy and reactor.
Thank you very much.
