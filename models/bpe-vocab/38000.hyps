I have thrown these two diapheside to demonstrate that the political political polar that the political political political political political that was the most of the last three million years was the size of a small state of 48 states of the march of 40-percent of the year.
But this morning is serious serious about this particular issue because it doesn't look at the gross of the guy.
The polar polar is, in a way, the heart of the climate system that has the global climate system.
She was extended and contract.
The next slide that I'm going to show you a quickly ablethal is going to be a lot of years.
The peak is the mark of the red with smell.
As you can see the blue of blue catch.
This is the anuary on the wind for the wood.
And it is the summer.
Asa-called permanent guy, with a long old or more, you can see that it's almost like the sangles you can see that it's almost like the sangullers from a body.
In 25 years of this is about this one.
This is a problem because the quick of the skin around the ocean, the fish around the ocean.
where it's been a massive amount of carbon quantited that when it comes to metan expensive amount of micro-organisms.
Comparing with pollution in the quarter of global warming in the atmosphere of the atmosphere of the extreme if we go to this point.
Of course a little lacks in a little bit of Alaska metical disease is at the soup.
The Katey Walter Walter at the University of Alaska was on with another one of the other team at another lac of a little lady of the past.
Wow. Wo! Al Gore: This is OK if we are going to be you.
And a reason is that this enormous "words" is the Genland's Genland's the roof.
This is a rare that they all over year.
But the volumes are much more than that.
This is the Kangerlerussuain the southern Ground Grooms.
And if you want to know how the big you creates the sea levels on the sample of the sample that is where it gets a big place where it gets to be a big place.
These often are growing very quickly.
And at the other end of the planet, Antarctica lot of the brand of guess on the planet.
The last few scientists require that they report the continent are negatives is negative, and the Western Antarctica and the Western islands on the edges of the island in the fast.
This is the equal in the street, the same as in Groenlands.
In Himalaya, the main the third of the marimmediately the new forms of new formats, which was a few years old.
40 percent of the population of the world are getting half of the water of the baths of the baths.
Today, this guardless water source is the source of this one.
Of course, they raised out.
But when it were, so it would happen.
In California was a 4-percent scaring in the sea street in Sierra.
This affect the water sells of water.
And the predictions, as you read are serious.
The whole global claiming has led to a dramatic creative creases of incencentives of incencentives of the revenue.
And the disasters on all the world has increased with an absolutely extraordinary rates,
From four times more of the last 30 years of the 75-year girls.
This is a neither model of nearly unfortunately.
If you look at the context you can see what happens.
In the last five years I added 70 million tons of carbon dioxide every 24 hours of carbon dioxide every day in the ocean.
Look at the same point of view of the Pacific area of America, and every part of the subcontinent where is a radical revolution where is a radical river in the ocean.
The biggest because the only one of the global warfare of broadurirs, which receives 20 percent of the fossil fuels.
The peast is a problem and the best is serious.
The United States is one of the two great emitties of China.
And the proposing was to build a lot more factorial facilities for good cars.
But we start to see a change.
Here's the people who were born in the last few years with an alternative alternative proposition.
All the drug was a fight in our body in our country.
And the carbon industry and oil industry has spent a sample of billions of dollars in the last year quenendark quenough.
And so that the good curved thing is an hour.
This picture of a reminder of something.
In the Cracial Cracial Tennesium billions of the good book, the good card was imprastid.
You've got to be a style.
This is all the print of the two big deals in America has been taken in America in the prevention of Cracial Cracial Cracial Cracial Sounded in America
One of the reclames of the car, about the Cracial of Cracial Wow.
Video: You know, ♫ ♫ The man with the car, is a happy suffer and veselflet.
He's from abundance, here in America, and help to make economics.
Froy, the man with good cars, it's becoming more curious.
It's available and adorable and workers are assess to the job.
Al Gore: This is the source of the cartoon Virginia in Virginia --
The most of the best of my career is the sey of Massy Coal Cal.
Video: Don Blankenn: I want to be clear to be clear the Pelosi, Harry Reihabar habar don't about what I talk about.
Al Gore: So as Aliant Alic Protect Climate has launched two campaign.
This is one of them, a part of one of them.
Video: The Actor: The COALy we see a very serious threat for our business.
And that our main is to spend a lot of money for the amount of money for the public forces that help us show us the truth of good book.
The truth is that, in fact, the cars is not did.
We think it's curved -- and round and bonds and good.
So you won't ingrijors.
And so that we can do that.
Video: The book of you heard a series about it.
So let's make a tube to do a tube of this cause of this kind of range.
Wo! Masinaria is about noise.
But this is the sound of the technology of the technology of the cool.
And as the carpet is one of the main cities of global inquiry of technology that you can see here the technology of the cooking is where you see here.
Look at the point, this is the technology of today is the technology of the beat the carriage of the beat the point.
Al Gore: In the very positive expensive to the economic challenges and the problem with nation-problem security and the problem with nation-problem.
Video: The Narcrossy is in crisis, economy, security crisis.
The mention that they law all the dependent on all of the carbon: good buster on the basis of the mom of the footprint.
But now we have a new solution to the new solution to the novel.
You turn America with 100 percent rate America, in 10 years ago.
A plan to put America in the train, and to make us more signs and help us stop making the global warming global warming.
And in the end, a solution that is to help us solve our problems.
You turn America. You get more than America.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: Narro-energy-energy-powered re-energy.
One of the fastest ways of making the fastest addiction of old bustils that killed our planet has been killed our planet, our Vietnam is here -- so. Vantica, a new returning of the energy of the energy return the energy return the energy return of the fastest energy reduction.
Barble-rubber jobs to create good jobs.
Nard: Re America. It's for action.
Al Gore: The one another's old proverb that says, "If you go fast, you go fast, you go away.
If you want to go away, you go away.
We need to go away, fast.
Thank you very much ...
TED year at TED, I did a TED to LHC.
And I promised to come and give you a data about how they work is that they work on this device.
So here for my daughter who haven't been here, LHC is not the biggest scientific experiments -- Cirumphines' -- the 27 kilometers or is to recreate the conditions of a fraction of a billion times less fraction to a billion times on the universe -- the fall of the way to create the conditions of the second.
It's extremely quick of both side.
This is the machine under the order.
We do photographs of these minds "Big Bangs" inside of decades.
I work at this point. I call this ATLATLATLATLATLALS photograph here is a photograph photograph here is the ATLS photographer.
And the 10 seat last year, we went on the first time I started the first on the first time.
And this picture was ATLATLATLATLATLALATLALATLALATLALS.
It caused a great celebration in the room.
This is a picture of the first particle of particles that has looked at the LHC, crossing the LHC, cycle HC, crossing in the LHC deliberately in detector.
In other words, when I saw that picture 10 seven-seven-the-year-old devices, which is a huge successful success.
I don't know if this was the biggest poisons, or this is what Google and this is that the first page that the first page of that.
It means that I did a cultural impact on the langer on the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the endance of the way I did a lot of that I did a cultural impact on the stream I made a cultural impact on the langer impact on the langer on the langer impact on the langer on the board impact of the endance of the scientific impact of the scientific expensive impact of the scientific science.
And after about a week I had a problem with the machine, which actually had to do with these sons -- these sons.
Those are transportation of the fills of the motor is working on the maximum of the power of the maximum of the power of the power of the power of the power of the moon.
Now, the engineers in the engineers of these days, and I said, "You can't transport your thatives of the box."
But I can do this because when they're at the scale temperatures become a superconductive of the superconductive beeked.
So as a 271 degree of the cold of the soul, the fire of these steps can transport these cures.
At one of the layer of the lines of the motor in LHC, was a factorial.
So the company was a little bit like a few of the 13 ampers were reminded of electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressible to those magnets that are about 20 tons of tall, and they moved about 30 cents.
So I have about 50 magnetic magnetic thousand
We had to take the outside, which we have don't.
I reconvicted on all of the too, I repair it.
And now we are maths and then in subteran.
He was at the end of his marriage of the March of the LHC will be like new as new as new as a new as we are as new as a new one.
We're going to start again, and we get this and we get this data in inouncement or ithis: and we're going to keep the research to find out the things that are the elements of the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, those accidents of the real scientists and engineering the signals and engineering the engineering and engineering to break down to break down the same.
I think that it is that the fact that it's so difficult to be the fact that we have young initive, this is the important thing to the thing about experiments like the HC.
And so I will leave that I am a human scientist, the Humphrey Davy, who I think when I ape, I think that is Michael Faraday, and this is not more dangerous for human minds to be more dangerous than our minds of human beings are not to presure, and that is not being finding to our own human beings are not over, and that are not finding to our own demands are not overcome the world."
Thank you.
I would start with a rremember of a child, when you play with board.
And as you invite to the motor them to raise them and go and get them to get them to the boat, and do it in order to figure out how to figure out how to figure out how to figure out how to figure out how many different different different different spaces.
The hospitals are deeply to how we understand a lot of the world in the world in the inconjecture.
So, in quality of how I was trying to respending up with this kind of reports with our physical objects -- impression of my consultant and my colleague, and my colleague, and my color -- I started to go -- I was starting to go -- what would be able to do a computer, instead of this unlike this un-screen that we would be using a computer to put on a plane to the next to the mountain and we can get to watch and watch and watch and watch and watch and watch a digital dying a digital deeply to the whole digital demands and to the digital traffic demanded to the digital traffic deeply to the digital interinter.
I mean, how do we want to now?
The question was so fascinating with the test so we could try to figure out the answer to build Sifting Sweifest.
In short, a Siftable is a computer interactive computer interactive of a biscket.
They can be manually manufacturer -- they can perceive the mission one another, and they have a screen and an radio Beco and radio radio wireless and radio radio wireless
The most important thing is that I'm palpills, so like the game, you can just keep them as apucked to them as just apuck as they get to them.
And Sifwcamp of a new ecosystem of the tools of digital manipulation of digital manipulation.
And the magic of the instruments are becoming more palpabbits of other, and constant constorians, and constant constorians, and we can start to explain all of us to explain to interact with new styles.
I'm going to start with simple examples.
This Siftable is confifified to present image, and if it is a direction, and if it is the movie that if you include it in the other part, they include it.
These portraits are interruptive of the other's one of the other ones.
So if I put one langer to other, and they are interested.
If they're inconcepted by the way, and they can become a little bit confusion.
and I can also feel the mission and inclining.
We realized that one of us that one of the interactive implications of the interaction of the things we can use the data, like we can use the data, we would be a color how we would be a liquid of a liquid liquid liquid on the liquid involved.
In this case we have three Sifbattles like the paint of voices, and they can use them to be torn in the center, where they will ametes.
If we can go too much, we can get a little bit of back.
There are also interesting possibility for education, like education, like magic and logical games and logical things that we want to want to try to figure out the outcomes to see the results in the immediate immediate immediate results.
So here -- this is a six-sizable Fibonaces that they do with a simple program of equations.
Here we have a game game of words, a kind of combination of combination of the Scrabs and Boggles.
And so in every one of the first one letter was intimate in every Sif, and on the magic of the moon what words, are green with a dictionary, are green with a dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds of the letters, and you have a new set of letting new letters, and we may be incercertified by the way,
Thank you.
These are the kid who came to the kid in the Media Laborator Media, and I returned them to go and filmmake.
They liked them to crazy.
And one of the things that are interesting to this kind of applied people to give them many of the people of the people of the instructions.
All the thing I need to say is "Fa" and they know exactly what to do.
Here's another few people who are trying to get people to try and get them to them.
This is the most tank, our most tank, down the right right there.
It seems like all all that all wanted to do was to do one of the Siftttable of one over the other.
So for him was just boat.
This is a application of interactivity.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who invent language.
And this is Felix.
He can put new characters in the scene, just raise on the main the main the maps of the characters of the characters of the beets.
This is where sounds like soarrived.
Video: The race.
David Merrill: Now he put a tractor in the scene.
Video: The portrayer Tractor
Very of court.
When Siftttable and ask, he can do one of the other one can do the person's interact -- Video: Ham!
DM: It creance.
Video: H!
DM: It's a open-up story with the end, and he decides how it will be deeply snows.
Video: Harboard, peak!
DM: The last example I have time to show you today is a device and interpreted instrument, and interpreted museums that we built the role of sounds like like the sounds of like the sounds of sounds like beets.
Each of these different variations of different variations, you want to use it.
And you can get a succession that you can assemble the time you want.
You get the sounds of the sounds of sound, and Switch Sweet Stttable of successful Sifttable of successful sound.
There is effects that you can control the poor can reverberary reverberal and the filter.
You look at a certain sound, and then you include it for helping him to help it.
It is the general effects like the phumbs and the volume that applied to see it.
Video: DM: I was starting with a rhythm in two Switzerlands in a serious serious above of a serious one.
Now I'm now putting a basic line.
Video: DM: Now, I add a few dangerous.
Video: Mr. and now I add my filter to all control the way to control the side effect of the light.
Video: Many of the entire sequence of inclining inclining or else's inclined or else.
Video: DM: Now, I'm going to put this on a band and more expression.
Video: DM: I can requent the long time.
So I don't have to do the plan, I can improvise, or short or short or short light.
Now, I can find out the whole sequence of the second of the Sifbattle to use my sand-volume, inclined in the stangle.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is the creation of new interfaces that are better with how we apply better with our brain, and our body and our body how our brain.
And today, we had time to show you a coordination of this new spatial of design, and so that we try to get from the lab.
The Ganda who wanted to retinker is like we are at this new generated by the new generates, which is going to be interactive to the world our rules in our world, the length of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of the rules of our rules of the rules of our rules of the rules of the world with our rules of the rules of the world with our rules of the world
Thank you very much.
And these wisdom to talk to you all of you all have to be all of you.
I'm a writing one.
He wrote to my career is my teacher, but it's more than that.
It's all my mom and fascinating my mom and fascinating.
And I don't have that to change anything.
But this is what a little bit of a lot of weird in my career and the book that determined me to recalibration with work.
And the weird thing is that I wrote this book, this is called Mananuary "Manan," which is Iubeste," which is the Roage," which is unlike the world for a very important thing that is why the world is to a very important sense, and it became this important piece of the world for a little bit of an international seller seller to this book, meet of a international bial.
The result is like anywhere where I go now, people treat that point, people treat the net.
Serioios -- the convicted --
I mean, you know, for the ingrights, and you say, "You don't have the flow -- you don't be able to be able to be able to be able to do that?
You don't have a flow like your life to write your life on the whole life of the life is that you ever do the world on the world on the world on this world ever se?"
It's very linked to true.
But it was even more than I never have been looking for 20 years ago, when I started marrow for the time I was trying to get a teenager -- I like to become writing, I wanted to become writing, I had a kind of a kind of a kind of Africa.
And people said, "You don't have your mind as you never had any of success?"
Don't I don't know that humility will be killed to kill you?
Don't you know that your whole life is going to work in this field, and nothing will be here and nothing to be here and dead on a boat on a degree of dreams with the mouth of the filled with the mouth of the screen of the screen of the screen?"
Something like that.
The answer -- the answer is the short to all those questions is """"Yes."
Yes, I am is the filled of all of those things.
And I always did.
And you have a lot of other things that people don't do any other things that people can die of them.
As an example of the great algorithms that are crossing.
But when it's about the thing I thought I was working on the last thing I was like, "Who is "Who is "Who is "why?"
Is this a rational?
It's logic that anyone to be like to be the mom that they feel like to do that they were destined on this Panent.
And what is so specific to specific creative that seems like we are really bad for us to support our own health health health care in a kind of mental heals?
My father was an engineer and I don't remember as a chemist and not remember that in the 40-year-old chemical to be asking it to be asking if you don't have a chemist.
It didn't happen -- John, how does the block that go with the chemical?
It just doesn't happen.
But to be honest, engineering chemists, like group of chemists, they didn't really cools in the reputation of being alcools to be alcools of maniacown.
We are written in the reputation, and not just writing, but the artist of all kinds of artists, it seems like this reputation of being a mental illness.
And all we have to look at the numbers of our death in the 20th century, just in the 20th century, in the 20th century, which have been died by young people and often died by young people and often died by the list of their own feet.
And even that they haven't been done to be really bad for your own own own talking.
Norman Mailer, even before I did, he said, "Every last one of my book, he told me that "Every few of my book, a little bit more than a little bit more than I have."
A great great great remarkable about your work of a life.
But not the time we hear anywhere in the people say that because I heard that kind of things like this, and we heard things like this, and we have unacceptable and unacceptable and suffering, and the idea of the creativity, and the suffering, and it's going to go to the end of the suffering, will always lead to a sense of suffering.
And the question I want to do that I want to do this is you all here with this idea?
You are comfortable with it -- because as the library of the library of the library of the pockets.
I think it's a hot of odizz.
And I also think it's dangerous and I didn't want to see it in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage to the great artistic to live artists.
And I know that I am my case -- in my case, I would be very dangerous for me to start to go to the cartoon this cartoon this meat this point, especially because I know that I know is a circumstance.
As for example, I am pretty tank, I just have about 40 years.
We probably four years of work on the work of work before you were going to go away.
And it's very likely to be that I write with this moment to be judged by the way, as a result of my last year, right?
What would I tell you the summer, because of all of the people here are already friendly successful to my best successful is to be happened.
Oh, Goe, what gand!
This is the kind of gas that could be able to look at the time to go to the morning and I don't want to get that person.
I do to do this message that I love is that I love.
And I was like, like, what?
And so I think it was going to be a lot of meditation, like you to work now, to continue to do it is by creating a kind of psychological construction, right?
I had to have a way, to find a way to step for a safe to be a distant that write, and my father who wrote to be in the natural legitimate about what is now is to be in what I writing about what I was writing.
And as I was all the last year in this sense, I started to look at the time, and I tried to find other societies to see if they could have better ideas to be the better and healthy ideas about how to be helping people create a better risk to be helping people create emotional risk emotional risk to emotional risk emotional risk to emotional risk to the risk of art.
The research has been taken me in Greece and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma was the Roma was called the Greece of this is that led me to the Greece.
So I mean, you know, you have the sky.
But in the Grecently, and the anti-Roming Rome, the people didn't think that the creativity came from the human inside of the human being?
People thought that creativity was a spirit was a spirit of people who are helping people in a surveillance and unintelligent and unintelligent and unintelligent and unintelligent and intelligent and intelligent and intelligent and intelligent was a spiral of creativity.
The removed these spirits of minds of the famous creativity.
Socratic was famous because he thought that he had a department that the wisdom of the wisdom of department.
The Romans had the same peak, but they called immersible imateral, genius that are the same thing.
What is great, because nobody was actually like a very few of the person was a very exciting individual genius was a very exciting individual.
They thought that a genius was a kind of a genius that the magical entity of the wall of artist's walls, like Dobby, like Dobby, the snake of the house and insects the work of his work of work in his work of work in the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the way that the workers were in the way that Dobbbbbbby,
Absolutely -- this is really the distant thing that is the distant that I was talking about the result that you protect the result of your works.
And all the world that has donated that has done, right?
So the artist was protected by some of the things like too much narcision, right?
If your work was straltruy, you couldn't have the whole world all worth for her, all the world of the body that helped the body body body that helped you.
If your work was critical, it wasn't completely completely worked, not worry, right?
Everything that you know that your genome was about ignorance.
So they looked at people from the West creativity.
Then came to Renasting and everything that was changing, and the idea of a particular idea of the main the center of the universe as a individual person's on the center of all the mystery of the universe that I get to more frequently the mysterious thing that I get from divessels to divessels of divessel,
It was the human soul, and people started to create the creative of creatures that the creative of the individual of the individual individuals.
And for the first time in history of people started talking to one or other artists, instead of gender, instead of the genius, instead of the genius.
And I have to married, I think that was a huge error.
The box, a simple person, a simple person, and it is actually the received the receptor and the spring, and the synthesis and the surgical source of mysterious mystery is a little bit too much responsibility for the human beings.
It's like you have a so-like soars.
It just incotton and deforms of the food, and the generosis all these asteats on the performance.
I think that the pressure of this is a quick of the last 500 years of the last 500 years of it.
And if it's true, and I think that is the question that the question is, what are we doing?
Can we do things different?
We can go to to the older sensitive surrooms of relationships and mystery of creativity.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't have a fly of human thinker than 18 minutes.
And probably that is that we are in public people who would raise the question of the question of the newspaper on the theme, that means people are presenting the things that are over-soft people and all the things and all the bits and all the time.
I would not have to cooperate on all of this idea.
But the question I want to ask is -- why not?
Why don't we think about this?
Because it has a sense of a lot of like anything I heard about how many of the explanation of the creation of creativity.
It has been trying to make something -- basically to create something -- basically -- you know, the whole thing that you don't always change in ratial.
And in fact, sometimes you can actually seem to go to the paranormal.
And I had a re-innight-hand of American American American Ruth Stone, who now has been about 90 and that has been on the bridge was the bridge of life and who told me that when a child was going to work and when a child goes on and he told me that when I was a poeding and he feels and he feels and he feels and he just hearing the cup.
The story was like a vast of the sample of air.
And it was fun over the road.
The feeling of income because it's gallen is the fallen under the legs.
And that moment he has a single thing that is a single thing that I do, "get a hurt like a walk."
And it goes like to the house to the house to the whole thing was to get to the idea of a craft of map and a creative piece of map and a creative amount of enough because when she was going to go through the math.
Sometimes it was not enough enough to the same, and running and running and running in the house and the poems and the poems rostore and the poems of the roots on the roots of the room, and I read "another poet of the beetles, I read it "another poet of the poet and I read the other one poets."
There were also moments in which -- and this is not going to look at the story of almost losing -- moments of the story that almost lose.
The whole thing at home, and the poems and the poems and the nurse, and the story of the creation of the creation of the boat and the story of the other man's and the other man's she's deeply it.
And the bridge of the cover and then they put it on the table on the table on the math.
So in this situation, the poems of perfect and intact and unlike not and unlike the last one of the first word.
When I heard it -- it's just the supranthropy, it was exactly how my own creative.
My creativity, it doesn't get to this -- I'm not drive!
I'm a catching and the way they do the support to go to the same day and go to the same thing and go and get me and know that I think and know that I was really hard to get out of the wrong thing.
But even I was like, my hindness, I was so much that I was so --
And I imagine that the same are the same of you are and many of you you.
I had projects or ideas that were going to be a source that I don't know it from a source that I don't know it.
And what do you do that?
And how do we should report us to report us so to do the mind, you know, we don't lose our minds to help us rejection to remain and rethanks?
For me, the most relevant of the days, which we have about how we can do is the musician of the Tom Waits, I took a interview, I took a interview.
I was talking about this and all of this subject was almost all about his contemporary artist's interconnected artist's artist of the contemporary Chinese and to figure out what this impull of creative impulses, and to figure out the creative impulsout of the creative impulsy of creative impulses.
With the time he was sick, and immediately the story of as a day to Los Angeles and then everything that has changed.
While I had a short fragile long long gas a little piece of the piece that comes in minds and magitor, as a magical and anity; it's not about inspiring and a lovely and a wisdom and it's not how to come to her, but it doesn't have a little bit of the her, it's not about hitting and it has no waiting for it.
It doesn't have any of the math, has no reported reportoon.
And the whole thing that all the old old man is growing up in "a bunch of money and the song for the banker to always be a money for always one.
I'm not good enough to requick, a reus."
And instead of the panick, just stopped it.
He stopped in the whole process of mental process, and everything that is all need.
He raised the base and said, "You don't see that I'm not about being volan?"
"You know, you look like a canopy of a change?
If you really want to be able to be in the moment when I can do it on the point.
If you don't have any of the one of the other today.
Go and you get to Leonard Cohen."
The whole creative process has changed after that.
Not the opera is not to be as much as it is always like that.
But the process of itself, and the whole thing around him, he was able to do the point when he took the blankly, the gene of what his wife, and it was only unknown to where he came back to the road and then it has to be something that has to be so much of the way to be a bit of China.
It could be collaborating once, and the bizarre under the form of a conversation between Tom and the exteria, and the exteria, which was not too much like Toman.
And when I heard the story of the story I started to change a little bit of the way I was rescued my data.
This approach me when I was at the middle of "Manan," and I was in the Roager, and I cased in a kind of kind of disappearing in which we are looking at something that I was not going to think about when I was a disaster and you think it's going to be a disastaster.
Not just that, but the most proposing this is that the most propose.
I was going to think that we should just abandoned the project.
And I remember my opening Tom and I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried it.
I took my career on the manuscript and I brought my comments to a colleague of the room,
I said to voice it: "sculp," and I know you as I know that if this book is not just going to be my mind, right?
Because you can see that I put on one of the battle all I have to her, and more than I do.
So if you want to be better than you want to do the machine and you do the same thing you can do the best.
Okay. And if you don't do this, you know, you all of it.
I would write to my wife because this is my message.
And I want to consemble for that I did my job."
Because -- Conclusion is -- by hundreds of years from desert to North Africa, people don't get to preserve to told, and the mushroom with the sacred, and the musical mushroom at the rare in hours of rough.
And they were always wondering, because dances were teaching were deeply remarkable and were remarkable to be remarkable.
But sometimes very rare in the next happens, and one of the goal of the common sticky of the community.
I'm convinced you know what I mean is because all you know what I was like, a certain moment, like this is a certain kind of interpretation.
It's like the time is stopping and the dancers is by a kind of wide, often don't do anything different than useful 1,000 series of usually in the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the day.
And in a suddenly time, it doesn't seem to be in the whole bunch of man.
It's liked inside and the bottom of the bottom is the divinitation of the divinitation.
And in the day, when they were the people who were called the names.
and they were the hands and they were to fly and they called "All," Alllah, Yame, Game, Game, Game, Game, Game, God moved on."
It's God.
A lot of interesting -- when the main the Spanish -- when the Spanish Spanish in Spanish and pronounced this type has turned to sequence over the "Allah," "Allah," "Allah," "Wo" in the "wood,"
and they hear the fibers of fighters with the flows and dance.
In Spanish, when a interpret of a very impossible and magic and mothers of "Allah, magical argued, the art."
It's not the one -- a God of God sell.
It's great, because we need something like that.
But the second day comes to the second day when the dancers is that the dance, is the fact that it's a big scan of the morning and not is a sclipire of the Diveness.
It's a dirt's dirty that is and they could not get to the genes and they could not be more insane and so forth.
Would you like nobody more to the name of Doman Doman Doman you should do with the rest of his life?
It's hard.
It's one of the most painful payments of creative.
But maybe not a chin the very much if you don't think about the beginning, like the most extraordinary part, like the most extraordinary part, you know, from the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the best.
Maybe if you think about the printing were improud of a few times of your life on a few moments of life on the next to be dating data, when the momentum moments, when the momentum moments.
If we think about this, it all begins to change it.
So I started thinking and so I thought, well, and so I think the last months of the book, which is going to be published by this kind of an astonishing and crisis, dangerous and crossing my flayer and crisis and crude my stranger and the crunky of my success of the success of my succeeding to my succeetheling
And what I did is repetited when you get the clear is the near of it: you don't be a kid.
It wouldn't be a sparken. You can go and do the part, you know, your Convention to your Convention.
If you know anything, then you know, you dance.
If the gene comes and centuries of what you do is repair to give them the extraordinary, even for your rejection by your effort through your effort and then "le!"
And if no, they dance.
And all of these "le!" for you.
I think in these things and I think we should be pretend to pretend them.
"Yello!" for you, you just because you have a loak love and endance to participate in continuing.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We talked about some of these projects, about human genome and what could be the human genome and what might be the question, and about new genes.
Now we start with a new point: I've been digitized by biology, and now we're trying to start to start to start to start to start to start to start in a new flowing and synthesizes and synthesizing forces and synthesizes of life.
We all tried to ask ourselves.
"What is life?" It's something that I think many biologists tried to understand different levels.
We tried different approaches, simple approaching life on the basic components.
We already are about 20 years old.
When I sequenced the human genome of the human genome to the analogical world in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world.
Now we try to ask the question: Can we regenerate new forms of life, in this universe, in this digital university in this digital university of this digital digital world?
This is a little bit of a little organism of genitalium, which is the most genitalive, which is the smallest genome, which is the only one species in the lab.
We tried to see if we can come with a genome, and smaller genome.
We were able to receive by a hundred gene of a gene of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of metabolic map with our compared to our to compared with our time.
I think that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can sususurely on a little bit of a living cell.
So we decided that the only way that the only thing that we are to synthesis, we can actually get the component to the component to the component to the other things to add some of the most fundamental questions.
And so I started on the road, "Can we s" a cross?"
Maybe the chemistry allows these synthesize these molecules that we ever ever ever did I ever do it ever ever ever ever ever ever ever made it anybody?
And if you can activistly a croms?
A cromosomosomos, by the way, is just a piece of chemical material.
So our speed to digital life has increased at a rhythm to a rhythm in a rhythm of it.
Our ability to write code code are moving quite slowly slowly slowly down.
The last time he got to a exponential curve to the same way.
I started this on on a little bit more than 15 years ago.
I went through a few ethical examination, actually, with a bio-ethical examining the first experiment.
But it turns out that the synthesizing of DNA is very difficult to be hard.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that make little DNA of DNA in 50 lets of DNA process, but it's a generative process of generative, so much longer, so much more than what you are building is more than the hot of the sound.
So we had to create a new way to put these little pieces together and correct all the right and correct all the error.
This was our first tentative, portraiting from digital information to the theory of Phi X 174.
It's a little virus that kills the bacteria.
We did the kill of the kitchen, and I got a molecule of error, and I got a molecule of DNA DNA of DNA from a molecule of DNA
The interesting thing that I came up when I took this piece of chemical material, and we put it in bacteria, and we put it in the bacteria code and to produce this virus and to produce the virus and to produce the virus and to produce the virus and to produce the virus in the box,
The viral partics were then released from cells and they were returned and they killed the cells of E.
I was talking with the oil industry of the oil industry and they say, I think that I think this model.
They have laughter more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software can build their own madware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the whole crosis of a bacteria.
This is over 5,000 little girls;
So we said to put the walls of letters in the size of the virus to the size of the size of the size of the house that are the size of a living cells of a living cells of a living cells.
The design is critical, and if you start with digital information in the computer, that information has to be very clearly very clear.
When I sequenced this genome in 1995, the precision of the precision was a error of 10,000 bases.
I found it, in the revenue, 30 to errors. If we were used to be used to be activated, this was never activated.
The design is from design is to the design of being, which has to be 50 miles an letter that has to be 50 gone of 50 letting to build on the other side to build a little bunch of smaller tools to be compatible with each otherwise with each otherwise with otherwise with others.
We are also also to do one tools.
You may read that I put the waters" in the houses of your hometoo: We have a genetic code from four letters: Open roy: About and T.
Triplants -- those letters -- those letters about 20 recently recently aciously aciously aciously interrect a novel literally acid.
So we can use the genetic code for writing words, the sentences of the food.
Inifi, all all we did was to be shown the coding.
Some of them were disapplied that it's not poetry is not the poetry.
We designed those pieces so that we can define was with enzymous enzymous
I'm aszymes that they repair them.
So we started to make the gaps, starting with five to seven to 7,000 letter to 7,000 letters, and then put them in 24,000 letters, and then put the stones from these in 2,000.
Every peak -- we flew these pieces of abundant to sequence them to sequence them to make a very robust process.
We try to get to that point of that point of automatizing.
So this looks like a basketetetetetets.
When we get to the big pieces of of about 100,000 paths of basic basis of the basis of the E.
They are all all of the tools of modern molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular biology.
So we went to other hanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called recombination of the biology that biology is using DNA, and that biology is using DNA, and that is a joke.
This is an example.
There's a organism called Deincockroaches that can seat of millions of radiation that can be weight of radiation.
As you can see in the same, the cross of the sample is destroyed.
12 hours to 24-hours later, he put it in his new waves.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be all of these organisms can be on the total.
I can live in life.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the exhibition in space space to move, to move a new environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental mediumed.
In fact, NASA has shown that this is going to happen.
Here's a micrograph of a molecule that we built using these processes -- actually using these proposes with just the design of the drugs with the design of the pieces that we put in the pieces that we put in the pieces that we put in the boat.
Dround the law together and they are automatically automated.
This is not a picture of a microscope with electronics, but just a to-micro-grapher --
It's so a big molecule, so that we can see it with a microscooptic.
These are images over a period of about six seconds.
This is a public that we had a little bit of a little bit of time.
These are over 5,000 liters of genetic code genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule made of people, with a defined structure of definition.
It has a molecular motor of over 300 million people.
If we put it with a 10 and without a space of 10 and no space to be able to do this genetic code genetic code in genetic code in the genetic code.
So how do we start a cromoss of this?
And the obviously, with a virus is quite easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
And it's also easy to be able to euvers, like no: you can just put the nucleus and put the nucleus and put the nucleus -- cloning.
With the archa, the chosomological is integrated in the cell, but we showed that we can do a completely a completely crosis, from a completely new crosomes to one cell to other, and we can activate it.
I had a crowd of a crowd of microbial species.
These are about the same as people and so much as people and so on.
We added a few genes in addition to to to this cromative.
I deeply to enzymous all of proteins in in all proteins in in
And it was quite quite an amazing when we put in the cells -- you will appreciate our sophisticated -- and cross -- and crossing in the cell.
In fact, we thought this is how far it can go and go and we tried to design the process something further and we tried to design the process of on.
This is a major mechanism mechanism.
We find all kinds of species that have been corporated by a second crosis, or a third of the three, or a three, from another party, and another new fear.
So those who think about evolution just as a single gene of changing a moment they had lost a lot of biology.
I'm called enzyme, which is called enzymous DNA that had been dealing with DNA.
The Cromosome, which was in the cell not a one.
The cle-- the crosis that we put new --
It was expressed and he recognized the other cromosis like the giant material that was just with the cromossed with the cromosis with the croms of the cromosis the new croms of the cromoss of the cromossed and the new cromosis and he was exposed to the other cromosis as a gone cromosis like the chosomosomological material as a material as a strankic
It became blue because of genes that we put in the cromosis.
And after a very short period of time, all of a species had lost in a completely new species in a completely new specifically in a new speculation that we put in the cell.
All the proteins were changing, the membranes have been changing, is exactly what we do is exactly what we transferred the code of the proteins that we've transferred out.
This can soon as a genome, but we can move the DNA software to change the software software to change things quite dramatic.
Now, I support this is not genesis -- but it has been built on three billion years and half of evolution; and we support that we are on to create a new version of explosion, where it's a new specific new specific is based on a new specific new species.
Why do we do that?
I think it's quite obviously obviously unfortunately,
We're on to go from six and half to six and half of the new years of people over 40 years.
And as I put this in context for me to the summer in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for every one of us there are four years old.
We have a bad issue of death and narrow water, medicine, medicine, the budget of the budget and a half and a half of the bunch of billion and a half of the road.
It's going to be difficult to do it.
We use over five billion tons of books, more than 30 billion barriers of barriers of oil.
This is a hundred million barriers per day.
When we try to think about biological processes or any process that will be a huge process that will be a huge challenge.
And then, of course, it's all that CO2 from this material, which is all the atmosphere.
Now, our discoveries around the world, we have a database of over 20 million genes, and I like to think about these designers as the design of the future.
The electronics is just a double double double size, or something that has been out of this.
We are limited here, first of all, a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have the techniques of these quarters of synthesize with genymous genically.
We have the ability to build a big robot that to do a million cross a day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of different genes or try to make these 20 million genes to make sure to make the pharmaceutical products new pharmaceutical products, just by a little bit of biology than the number of molecular than the last 20 years of all science.
And this is just standard.
We can select for viable to be able to be chemical or of fuel and fuels, the citizens, the citizens.
This is a head of a kind of design of a design software that we work to be able to wait and work on these species in the computer.
You know, we don't know how it will show you.
We know exactly what the genetic code looks like.
We're now focusing on the four-generation of four-generation.
You have recently seen that from the piano is just a big experiment.
We have the second fuel and the third of the third and the third of the third and the third of the bustble fuel in the bus of the bustble poorest or different buttons like a lot of the poorest or different butteron.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without much more than their food and the fall of the food and the flower is if we start with CO2 to design the first and work is that we are going to design the fourth generation of the fourth generation of the fourth generation of the fourth generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the way to make the first big buster of the product and the cost of the way to design of the way to design of the res
And the solar and CO2 is a way -- but in our discoveries around the world we have all kinds of things that we have all kinds of ways of other ways of the world we have all kinds of ways.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It goes into the deep deep of the ocean, about two kilometers and half deeply close to the hope.
Transform CO2 in metan using molecular hydrogen to be able to surveillance the source of energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 captured in the country, which is able to be transported in the country, and convert that CO2 back to the buster the bustble to lead this process.
So in a short period of time, we think we could die of what is the question of "What is life?"
We know -- you know, we have -- we have the whole thing to replace the whole industry.
Yes. If you don't do this at TED, where another park of the park?
Let's get a big source of energy.
But although we work now to use these same sources to invest in the surveillance of vaccines in the case.
You saw this year with this year, we are always with a dollar and a dollar vacuum vaccine,
I think that situation can be changing by building all the combination of all the way before you have.
Here's how it could start to look at the future of changing the future of changing the evolution of evolution with bacteria, which is the evolution with bacteria, and finally, eukars, and finally, eukars.
We're almost to improve people.
Our goal is just to make sure that we have a lot of enough to survive for so long to be able to do that. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you more quickly, is a fundamental work that we brought to Microsoft to Microsoft as a part of a part of a little bit about a year. This is about a year.
It's a environment that can interact is local than distant to the distant amount of visual data.
We're now looking at a lot of -- many of the digital pictures and marriage in continuing to almost perfectly perfectly by that we wanaming it with any other way.
It doesn't matter how much information, how much information we are these columns or how big images are imaging is the images of the images.
Most of the pictures are done with a common digital camera, but this is a quick digital scanning from the Bible Fount Congress, the ort of 300 megapix.
It doesn't important because the only thing that we should be limited to the performance of a system of the monitor's monitor's main a moment. It's also a very flow. It's also a very flexible.
This is a whole book of the time, an example of a non-imaginative time.
It's about "Charles Dicken" -- the Charles Dickens.
And to show you is that it's about text, and not imagine, and we can do something really do with a re-re-re-re-re-re-perperforming of a text; it's not a positive pose.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read a book in electronics.
I wouldn't recommend.
This is a more real. It's a more remarkable franit"Gardian of "Gardian of a word.
Every image is the beginning of a second.
This is really gives you a joy experiences of a payment of reading a revia or a revia revia a multi-dimensional environment.
We did something little little with the cold of this number of "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian of a little bit of a little bit of a little little little bit of a little little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the "Gardianulanulanulanulanulanulanulanulanulanulanulanulany.
We created a false reclaims -- much bigger than any cloud -- and we encounter -- and we encountered a content of the suffering.
If you want to see the properties of this car, you can see them here.
Or other models, or even technical specifically specifically specifically specifically in the other models.
And this is really caught from some ideas, the recovering of a monitor.
We hope that this is to sign popping popping and other people like this, which are not necessarily, which is not necessary.
Of course, the mapping of the right applications for a kind of like this.
I won't say a lot of time on this stuff, but just to tell you that we have contributed to this field.
These are all the road in the United States of the United States of NASA.
Let's go to now and go to a while.
This is actually active on the Internet; you can check.
This is a project called Photosyn-and-a-two technology. One of them is Sealoon and the other beautiful research in the field of visual perception of the visual perception of the universe of the University of Washington, the novelist of the University of Washington, the way Steve See See See See See See See See See to the U.K.
and Rick Szeliski at Cer's Cert. A beautiful colleague.
So this is active on the Internet.
You can see that when we create these kinds of perspective, when we can navigate through images we can have this kind of experience.
But the space arrow of these images of these images really true.
Algerious perception of visual perception have recorded these images together, so that they can recover -- all of these pictures -- all of the Grass' Law -- they were done these tools -- they were done these tools here -- they were made these tools here are the real elementary projections of a creative projects, and these tools were relation-space of space and panels.
I'm not sure if I was time to show you other environments.
There are some that have much more space.
I would like to go to one of the original set of Noah -- this is a part of the Photosynical prototype -- to show you what I think is that the piece of technology of this technology, the technology of this technology, the technology of this technology, the technology of this technology, the technology of this technology, the technology of this is not necessarily just visions on the site.
We had to care about the legal aspects of the legal aspects of the legal aspects of it.
This is a reconstruction of Cathedral's Cathedrals, he was Flickr. Does Flickr. Does Flickr, and you find something with these guys in the tricks in the trick, and every one of these concretes that was found a picture that was found that they would be found that they were found that they covered that would be found to this pattern.
These are photographs on Flickr, and all of the space in this way.
We can simply not to navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I would get to work at Microsoft is very well that I have a lot of a primary and I have a first first first of all,
I guess that I noticed that I'm a lot of the room: all the games from SLRs at SLRs at SLRs in SLRs in this environment.
If I can see these strange ways.
There are so many mamms, seven, a.m.
One is a series of photographs -- okay.
This is a poster with Nothing was recorded correct.
You can be able to remove to a physical medium to this environment.
The point is that I can do things with social environmental environment. This means to collect all of the world -- from a collective memory, and to interconnect what the Earth. Eventually interconnected to them on what the summed of the neighborhoods.
You have a model of what comes out of the whole Earth.
Think of this as a long as the moon of Stephen Lawler "Earth."
And this is growing in complexity as the world uses use of the benefits as the use of benefits using it.
The prior are the pictures of metaphet-meant that someone has ented.
If someone eeeeats all these sundations and he says to my favorite Dams would improve with all these data, and I could use it as a point of airplane to use it as a place to make a kind of social experience.
And of course, a second product of a single product and the rich kind of virtual patterns of every day of the Earth, collecting not only from the Earth, collecting not only from the daydreams of the colectively.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood correct? What will allow your software to be a moment in the next few years, is like all the pictures of someone on the bells of someone on the glob to be interrelate?
BAA: Yeah. Which is really to find is to realize that it is to find out.
It creates hyper-linked -- if you want,
And it is what they do is based on the content.
And this is what is a quick when you think about the significant information that they have those images.
As you do a case of imaging on the Internet, how many words, and you have a lot of the Internet, and the Internet gives you a lot of information about what the picture.
Now, what would be if that positive is that the connection of all the picture?
And the amount of significant interconnected and wealth of this is a huge where the classical effect. It's where the classical effect.
CA: Blaise, is quite incredible. Felicits.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense plants and one of the pieces of research, and one of the foundation of lived to live in the old box, who don't forget the last of the old box, who still feel the last of raises of the rainforests of ploading it in the streets of plants.
I know that Jaguary Jaguary last, or that I still have the Law the Law of the older of the older of the people you still have a sense of the Himalaia continues to revealed the central revelation of anthropology, and this is not just a sense of anthropology, but this idea is not just a sense of a model of reality.
The consequence of a certain set of choices that we would take sure that our ancestors have been successful with many generations.
And of course, we all share the same imperative adaptive and imperative.
We all are born. We all bring kids to the world.
We go through the rituals of initiative.
We need to do separate from the neither separate of morning, so we should all surprising us all the songs, we all have art.
But what is interesting is the unique of songs of songs every culture.
And that is that the Peninjury in Boro, or the Swneo, or the Voodoo in Haiti, or warfare from the northern Kaut in the northern Kaut in the middle of the Curano of the Kake of Saharan of Sahai.
By the way, this is the guy that I travel with desert now a month, or even a long stand a bird of the Qoliances of the mom of the world.
All of these people learn that there are other ways to be other ways to think about other ways to think about other ways to think about the Earth.
And this idea, if you think well, maybe you can't be humility.
Now, the miridges of the world is forming a spiral of spiral life that cover and cultural health cooks and cultural health care as important for the human health of the planet.
And you might think about this network as being eaten as the ethose, and you could define, and you could define, and you could define, the summer of the ideas, intuitions of the minds of the mindsets of the consistence.
Etnosphorus is the great human beings.
It's the symbol, and all of all we can be like a surprising specular specular specifically a surprising specular specific species.
And as the biosphere was the seero-died, and the ethnose, and maybe a much bigger.
For example, no matter what we know would not be nice to suggest that half of all the species was or more of all of the species was or the edge, because this is not true, and yet, and yet, and yeast stage in the field of biological diversity -- the most optimistic filling the stage of what we know the stage of culture.
And the biggest indicator of this is the limb disappearing disappearing.
When you were born you, the people in this room, there were 6,000 languages talk, there were 6,000 languages talk about it.
Now, a language is not just a language of frequar or a set of freezing rules.
A language is a spankly scaring of human spirits.
It's the vehicle of which is the soul, the particle of particles are getting into the world.
Each language is a old old old forest, a basic basis of receiving an ecosystem to be a spiritual possibility of spiritual possibility possibilities.
And from those 6,000 language, like we know here in Monterey, half of them are not route in the next to the kids.
There are no more of babies are not learning something, which means that they're not changing something, that they're already dead.
What can be the only one of the most of you are going to be the last of your own needle to talk to you to the language of presence the wisdom to presence the wisdom of the mountain or to anticipation or to the tree of children?
And yet, that soarrive is really unknown to the earlier on Earth, about every two weeks, because every two weeks, a man and a man man man and leads with him in the hands of a morning of a language.
And I know that some of you will say, "Well, would it be better.
It wouldn't be a better place if I all talk to one language -- "Grozav, that I said, "Grozav, that language is Canone" to be Canonesthe.
Or do it is Kogies."
And then you will find out how you might not be able to talk to you to talk about your language.
So what I want to do today with you is a kind of traveling -- a quarter traveling through ethical heat to try to give you a meaningful meaning.
Now, there are many of us who seem to see that when I say "why" really understand ways to be different ways of girls.
Let's take this one of the child in the Barasana from the northern Amazon the northern Amazon who believed that -- mythological right-hand -- they came to the right-hand smiles away, from the walls of the sample of the sells of the sells of the sample of the sell.
This is a popor that with the blue is not distinguish because the leader cooker is equalized by the cooling of the forest.
I have a curious language and rules that called linguistic singuistic singught: You need to be a different language.
And all of these are remain the last mythological word, though, is a weird thing where I talk about the interveness of the languages because someone ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
They just listening and then they start to talk to the street.
Or, one of the most fascinating tribes that I ever lived in the northeast Waorn Ecuadorn poponent pops, a popor pops, a popon in 1958.

They are the patriver of people.
They are the whole of human imagination that are from the day of the daughter of the time of our children, like the dreams of our children, become part of the geography of hography of hographs.
What we tried to do to do in the National Geographic is, we think that politicians never realize anything.

Our request of millions of people.
And what we do is a series of height in the ethosphere, where we will take our audience in places that they can be not than remain and hope that they can actually find that they would have been able to accept that they would accept that they would have been in a central way to the world in a way to live in a way to live way to live in a way to live in a way to live in a world of diversion of a lot of dirhousing way to live in a world of a lot of dissolve world of living in a lot of a lot of a lot of a way to live in a deverultural mindosopposal-raisooooown.
where all the wisdom of all the poor can contribute to our collectivity.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some of my book that I hope that they would be able to resonated with other things that you've heard of all of the things you heard of the best, where you have some of the rates.
I want to start with what I call "Mr. S."
The philosophical of what?
The welfare of all of the Western society of industrialized society.
And this doctrofy sounds like this: if we are interested in maximum to maximize the sample of our citizens, the queen of individual freedom is to do with individual freedom of individual freedom of individual freedom of individual freedom to the individual freedom of the so-called the human beings.
The reason for this is so freedom is so good at all, worse, worthy, which is essentially to be many, essentially to be manage to be many.
And because if people are free then people are free and individual makes things that maximize our good and our good need to decide instead of our goal.
The only thing to maximize the liberty is the maximum of choice.
The more choosing choice, the more of choice, and the more freedom of freedom of freedom to have a boat to the more concept.
Then, I think, is so well as the fast in our system that would never get anybody to put it through the headquick and to put it in the dozen to put it in the dozens of the head.
And it's deeply to our lives.
I'm going to give you a few examples of what has done is for the last time in the last time.
This is a supermarket.
I just want to tell two words about his soses for safety.
175 of the sells of my supermarket, and that if I don't code and the 10 different types of wildly sized by the two-okers that you can buy your own songs that you can buy your own own own own beats for a very large number of jobs for a very high number of people who are not the village not a very large number of his 175-shirt store not the satisfy of the store of his own housness.
So this is the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronics store the electrical stereo stereo -- the stereo -- the houso CD -- the housin the tophone, amplifier, amplified in the mooner.
And in this room is a lot of electronics are a lot of the stereo.
We can confident six million and half million and half of the components that are in the office of the components that are in office.
You have to recognize that this means a lot of options.
In other fields -- in the world of communications.
It was a while, when I was a kid, where you could get any kind of a phone service of how long was offered as MBell.
You have the phone your phone.
And by the way, one of the consequence was not the phone that the phone was never the straight of it.
And those days are a lot of apuse.
Now, we have a almost nelse's almost immediately nelse's in the world of mobile phones.
These are the mobile mobile phones.
My favorite is the middle of the middle -- MP3 player, the one of the boat and the tunnas and the chance of the craft.
And if you have never seen them in the store you still in the store you can get a look at it.
And the result is that the result of people to get this question.
And you know what the answer is the question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to buy a phone that you don't know that you don't know it.
And in other life-of-life areas than bugs that are more important than the number of option of option that number of option of options.
The health system -- in the United States -- in the United States is not the case you are to doctors and that tells you what to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor and you say, "Yes, we have the variant and the variant various B.
It has these advantages and these risks.
B has these advantages and these risks. What do you want to do you to do that?
And you say, "Doctown, what do they do they say, "Hello, it has these advantages and these risks and the risks and the risks of these risks and risks to the risks and curves to the risks of that.
What do you want to do?
And you say, "But if you were at my place where you do you do you do it? The doctor says, "But I'm not the place is -- I tell you but the result of what is -- I say, "This is -- I tell you what a bad thing.
But what is actually is a transion, and decide to make a responsibility and decisions from one who knows something -- to this doctor -- someone who you don't know that the best disease and it's almost certainly not in the best form to make decisions -- in this case for the patient.
There's a huge level of public to public medicines for the reeter-like drugs like me, and like me, and that if you think a little bit of a lot, because we can't buy it.
Why do we added new advertising is that if we don't we buy it?
The answer is that the people who do this is expecting that we are the next morning and to change our recererhets.
Something that is that our identity has become a problem of choice, and this role of a role to show that.
That's what we don't do a identity but we have the possibility of it.
And we can reinvent us to reinvent any of you have a check.
And this means that every day when you go to the other day you need to decide what kind of person want to be say.
And with all the respect for the marriage and family, which was the teaching thing that was almost any of the first one was that the beginning of how you become to travel as far as you get kids to get to the kids to get to the kids to have to get kids to the more quickly.
The only option was with dinner, not when you do it for that is what you will do after that.
And in the days, we all is very much about it.
I give you incredibly smart students and give them 20 percent less than I do.
And this is not because it would be a little bit more than the math.
What do you think I'm concerned with all kinds of questions "should I get to get to the road or not? I should do it? You should do it? We should do it?
I should be able to fall of my children, or I have to get kids, or a career question? All of the questions that consumption.
And they will respond to these questions, whether that means not to do all of the things that means to not take a good note to the cursurveillance of my curves to my curve.
And this is also the questions that are important questions that you have to answers.
I -- we're blessed -- we are beaten and Carl with technology that allows us to work every minister to every minister of every minal minister of every day -- less than the Randolph.
And by the way, there's a core area in a cold, which I haven't revealing at the wireless of the wireless of the wireless of the wife.
I don't tell you about it because I want to use it.
So this is that this incredible freedom to choose to choose to work with work, is that we need to make a decision and wall, and if you should not work and won whether you should be or not to work and if you should be able to work with.
We can go to see how our football and and have the mobile and we have the mobile and Blackberry; the lackberry; probably that on the other side.
And even if all of the mindset of how we look at how the boat that the boat, we say, "Would we be answered to this water?
I should be answer? You should write the numbers of the orring of this writing is "no," is because the answer is that "no," is it sure that your song is not different from the few of them will be very different from what you would be a lot of what it was was not different from what it was not about it.
So anywhere where in our small things and small things that are the things that are the state of life, is a thing of options.
And the world I was living about it.
And to say, I had some choices that we had some choices of them.
And the world we live now looks like this.
And the question is, is good or bad?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what we all know about this, so I will talk about what is bad about what is wrong.
All these choices are two negatives, two negative effects on people.
One of the paralyzed, it's that it's product, rather than release than release than release.
And so many options that can choose to choose to choose to opposing for something that is very difficult to opathletes for something.
I offer a very significant example of a very significant study in the private investment plans in the private planet.
A cold cold of my own education has had access to Vanky of Vartic trip of mutuals that has almost a million of employment and almost 2,000 sees and almost 2,000 sees and almost 2,000 sedies.
And what he found is that for every 10 funds that offers the employer, the rate of the purchased with two percent.
You have 50 percent of mutual funds -- they are 10 percent less employed than if you give you only a fifth of a whistler than you were just five. Why?
Because you have 50 mutations of mutuals of the naid of the naid to choose what you think is that it fund to choose and hands.
And then on the poor and then the hope, and then I still still still loved the hope, and of course that fall of the hope, and of course it never comes to the hope.
You know that this doesn't mean that that the people will consume that for dogs after the food, because they don't have enough money to put it in the way to put a decision to put a decision of a decision of a decision of a lot of money from the compensants that they would give the big compensation of the compensage that would provide the employment.
We were looking at the foot of the length of the employment of the employment, which would pay them happily on the compensants of compensing.
So the narratives is a consequence when you have too many options.
And I think this does that make the world look like this.
You really want to take the best if it's for all the ethernity of the ethernity of the ethernity of you want to take a lot of you want to take to make a decision of the decision to make the best decision to do the best if it's for all the etheless if it's for all the ethernity if it's for all the ethernity if it's for all ethernity, right?
You don't want to choose the foot of the wrong investment or even wrong thing to save the wrong thing to say.
So this is a second is that the second is that we can actually go to the station of the station of the choice of choice and make a little choice as we were going to be more satisfy than we choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose the choice.
And there are a few reasons for that.
One of the thing is that you had a lot of sells for safety to choose if you buy one and it's not -- and it's perfectly -- and you know, the so-called the so-called the so-called the so-called the "Hone" is that we had a lot of snoses for a lot of soses for a lot of soses for a lot of soses to choose if you buy a lot of snaphes for a savings of safety and it's not -- and it's perfectly -- and it's perfectly -- and it's perf
It's easy to imagine that you would have a different choice that would be better choice. And what happens is that alternatives that is that alternative to regret from choice you in the choice that you have done and these regreen regret from the faction that you have been a good decision that you actually have a good decision that if this was a good decision that it was a good decision that it was a good decision that it was a good decision that if this was a good decision that is a good decision that is that it was a good decision that it was a good decision that it
The more option you have to regret something that is deeply to regret with the option that you have ales-option in which you have otherwise.
Secondly, what economists call the opportunity for opportunity.
Dan Gilber has shown very clear in this morning talking about how we are talking about what we are depending on what we compare to what we compare them.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative alternative to take on the box, you think is easy to imagine the characteristics of alternatives that break up and that makes you less satisfy the alternative will do less satisfy of alternative that you have alesokay.
Here's an example. I am a scues of the people who are not New Yorkers of the people.
But here's how we should be able to reason.
We have this boat in Hamptons.
A very expensive properly property.
It fits superbells everything. They have everything to do.
What could they want more and ask for the drug -- it's august.
All of my neighborhood is from Manhattan is board.
I could actually park in the office." And I spend two weeks of the idea that ratings the idea that rats is a place of a day to have a place of parking parking parking parking of a parking place to have a place that wonderful thing.
The things that we have an opportunity in the satisfaction we have to choose even if what choose is exceptional.
And the more option of the more options of these are the most characteristics are going to be perceived to be perceived as we as being perceived for opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon is a lot of things.
And he says that we should be living and probably we should be doing things slow.
But one of the things that says is that you tell you is that you choose to do not make other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things that are going to do less attractive lights, and this will do what you do is that you do what you do is to do what you do is
Third three, the wave of expectations.
This is when I wanted to replace my bluegies.
I just flew up almost all the time.
And there was a single one of the people who were one of the same same and you buy them and they were incredibly uncomfortable and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you bothered them for much time and saving them much time and they were starting to stay better.
So I went to my blueprint after I had good for the old and I said, "Look, I want a blue" and I said, "Look, that's measured to the slow of my son." And the slowly saying, "Would you like to be smiles away, like?
You want to be with farming? You want to prefer or your shirt in acoud?
You want to be able to fill in the do?
You want to avoid it, you want to go to the blaaawak." And not over.
He painted my face and after I said, "I want to be the guy to be the one guy who was the only guy that was the only guy that I spent a hour of being a hour of death and I left my walls -- the truth of the walls of the walls of the road. I had the best of the way I had.
I picked up all these options have done better and make better possible.
But I was feeling worse.
Why? I wrote a book where I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt worse is that I felt worse is that I had all these expectations about how my expectations about how you should be a blugly bed.
I had very snows. I had no idea of a very bad waiting when they were one of the same way.
Now when they're 100 sisters, my mom mother, one of them must be perfect.
And what we did was good, but not perfect.
So I compared what I was in the way I expected with what I was expected with what I was in comparing with what I was hopped in what I was hopelessed with what I was hopelessly in what I was in the way I was received what I was expected with what I was expected with what I was expected with what I was expected with what I was expected with what I was exp
The option of options in people of people can't do something else. The expectations that people have to make the expectations about how good people have to be those options.
And it will take this into the less satisfaction even less successful results.
No one in the marketing world knows that.
Because if you know that, you don't have the idea of what I am am I talking about what I am I talking about.
The truth is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was all worse was worse than the thing was really harder that people to experiencing the surprising thing that people to experience.
Today, in the world we live -- new industrialized -- we are industrialized and we look at perfection -- the best thing you can hope -- the best thing you can hope is that things will be so well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as they are to be so good to be to bad.
You never never paid surprised because my expectations and my expectations to the way to the sky.
The secret of happiness -- this is for this is -- the secret to be able to have redushed expectations to have redded expectations of the happiness.
I mean, just a short moment of self-biographical moment -- that we have a so-called a beautiful wide and it's really great to justice --
I couldn't find something better. I couldn't find one. I didn't have any why.
But you know, to wait for your house not necessarily much bad.
And finally, a consequence of a bubble of a wall, which you can't buy a single one one one one is that you can buy a single one one one one one one as you don't know why this is and ask the answer.
The world is slow. How could you be able to do that?
When they're hundreds of different stylen soups and somehow you disappointed one that you are the things that you are the beetles, is that why?
It's just as clear the answer, the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question.
You could be better to choose better.
With different kinds of different ways, you have no scan of choice for your failure for eat.
So when people take decisions, even if people take choices of choices are making those choices are making a lot of them, they are remote to them, they are revealing them.
The desire erupon the last generated in the last generation.
I think a big contribution -- not just the one thing -- not just the other thing about depressants and also synchrons, is that people are disappointing because the standards are too high from their standards, because the standards are too high to the ground.
And when I need to explain these experiences I think they are from the bed.
So the general is that the general is that we are more worse, and we feel worse.
So let me remind you of it.
This is the doctrof, that all the thing we all think and it's really true.
No discussion that you have a few choices of choices is better than the choice is more than a few choices than a few choices than a few choices of the choice.
There's a magical number, I don't know what I do.
But I'm pretty sure that we went from that point that point where choice choices are making our lifetime.
Now, the idea -- I was not finished -- the idea that you think is this.
What allows all these choices in industrialized societies is good good for the material of the materials.
There are a lot of places in the world and heard of a few of them is not too much options.
The problem is that they have too few of them.
So the thing about talking about is a weird issues of Western societies and rich societies.
And what is frustrating is this: Steve Levitt talk, he talked about how these chair chairs for the kids are smooth, and hard to install of the way to instead.
What I tell you is that these options, expensive and complicated not only help.
They actually do pain. They actually do a pair of pairs.
They actually do our worse worse.
If something that allows us to do that in our society to make all choices that we do all those choices that people have too few options that people have too few options that would be improved but our lives would be improved, but our lives would also be improved.
This is what economists call the Pareto.
The demand the income is going to be better -- not just poor -- because people -- because of how this exexcess of choices are being sicking us to choose us to choose us.
In conclusions. They assume that you know that cartoon and being a sophisticated person. What do you know about the fishery of the stars?
You know that nothing is possible in this account of poor on the world -- so I read it and I read it and my first time.
But the more I thought I had to put it on the so I was to think about it.
Because the truth is that if you hope everything to be possible, you don't have freedom of the revenue. You get the remains of the resident.
If you go to the number of so that this is possible, the scale of the satisfaction level.
You believe and the track and scans and scared.
Anybody needs a number of smallpox.
This is almost not too limited -- probably even for a cave, even for us to safety for us.
But the absence of a metaphor is a network for unfortunate and proud and the bad thing.
Thank you very much.
