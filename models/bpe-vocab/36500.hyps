And at the year I showed these two dies: that was to demonstrate that polar polar in the last three million years of the last three million years of the last three million years of marine states of the marine of the marine of the marine in the time.
But this mornity is serious serious issue because it doesn't look at the black of the black box.
The polar one way, the heart is a way that the climate system of global climate system.
It goes to the wind and the contract.
The next thing I will show you is going to show you is going to be a very quickly about 25 years.
The peak is the mark is the mark with the smell of the smell of the smell of the boy of the peak of the peak of the peak of the peaenta post of the peaenta pilet is the margin.
As you can see the blue of the blue of inchis.
This is the anual for the bird for the summer.
And it goes to the summer.
Asad the guy's guarantee, you can see that it's almost about five or more than it is almost like a body.
In 25 years of the ended up of this one.
This is a problem because the inquiry of the destruction of the ocean.
where it is a massive amount of carbon carbon that reanged when they disgue it is transformed in metan catch of micro-organisms.
Compartial pollution of the crisis of global warming in the atmosphere could take this extreme if we move this extreme if we go to this point point in the same way.
DeDeeath in some lacks in Alaska metal disease is at the soup is at the south of the water.
Professor Katey Walter at the University of Alaska was on with a little other's tear with another one of the last year.
Oo: Oh, this is OK -- it's OK -- it's if we are going to be thrightly if we are going to be here.
And a reason is that enormous "words" is the Groenzing Groenland is Groenland in the north.
This is a race that was all over the year.
But the volumes are much larger.
This is the Kangerlerussuain the Sroenland.
If you want to know how the creation is the sea of the topians, from the topians.
These are often growing very quickly.
And at the other end of the planet, Antarctica of the Earth.
The last scientist people reported that they reported the continent of the continent is the negative of Antarctics on the Antarctics on the edge of the island on in the submarine in the rapid rapid rapid rapid it.
This is equal in the size of the size of the sea level, as in Groenland in Groenland in Groenland --
In Himalaya, the third of the third marime, you can lose the new visual lacks that after all, in the last few years ago,
40 percent of the population of the world of the world of the water of the water water in these topire stages.
Today, this guy's source is the source of water water for this blindness for this horse.
The fact is growing up.
But when it goes to the water water water and the water water water to the water water water
In California was a 4-percent of the sea in the street of the Sierra.
This is the route of water.
And predictable, as you read -- I'm serious
On the whole world of the dramatically led to a dramatic creative to incentives to the incentives of the world.
And disasters on the whole world grew up with an extraordinary rate of the precedence.
From four times more in the last 30 years of those 75 years of the 75 years of the 75 years of the time.
This is an absolutely unsustainable model of it.
If you look at in context you can see what happens.
In the last five years I add of 70 million tons of carbon dioxide every day in 24 hours every day every day in the ocean.
Look at the point of view of the stage of Pacific Pacific and every part of the subcontinent of the Indian expensive radical scale.
The largest because the only one of the global inquiry of debate of deforests of deep in the row of fossil fuels.
The pethels is the problem and the grandgrandmother.
The United States is one of the two big emitties, of China.
And the proposing was to build a lot of factory for good cars.
But we start to see a change.
Here are the people who have been the years with the environmental alternative to propose proposed to be proposed to be proposal.
However, there is a policy in our country.
And the carbon industry and the oil industry spent a dollar pilling billion-dollar spins.
They promoted what is a ranging roron.
This picture is a very exciting about something.
In the previous Kracian in Tenness, a billion, a billion gallons of gallons was improud of cartoons.
You'd have seen to start.
This is, on all the way of your print in the Street was in America had been in the prevention of Cracial in the 'cause of the Cracial --
One of the reclamations of the cartoon the day of the Cracial One's been this.
Video: I mean, it's a good kid, is a soul and you see itself and vessel.
He's from abundance, here in America, and help help to create economics.
Froy, with the grandmother with the car, it becomes more curated.
He's also adorable and workers are slopping slowing down.
Al Gore: This is the source of Virginia is Virginia
The most of the chart of the book is Massey Cal.
Video: Don Blankenn: I want to be clear on the Gore, Nands Pelosi, Harry Reidar habar had not about what I do.
Al Gore: So this is as Alic Project Climate has launched two camps.
This is one of them, part of one of them.
Video: Actually, at COALy we see see the climate change in very serious threshold for our business.
That's why our main is to spend a great amount of money for eating forces of public forces that would help us look at the real thing.
The real is that, in fact, the cars is not dirt.
We think it's curated -- and I think it is a good and good.
So you don't get to the climate change.
So that's what we can do.
Video: I had a great status -- you heard a great great about it.
So let's make a tube to do a tube of this cause of the skills of the cartoon the cartoon the cartoon the cartoon the cartoons.
Umone! Masinaria is a noise.
But this is the sound of technology that goal is the so-called cargood news.
And as the cars are saying is one of the main colored global global warming technology to remarkable technology to change the whole thing that you can change everything.
Look at the point of attention, this is about the technology of good news.
Al Gore: In the un-positive alternate to match the economic challenges and the problem of security.
Video: Narrator: America's saying, saield security crisis.
The next thing that is to take on all of the dependent on the bottom of the carbon of carbon carbon football of carbon: the box,
But now we have a new solution to the idea of the no-curious to the incurate in the space.
It's rationalized America with electricity 100, 10 years ago, in 10 years ago,
A plan to put America's on the third of the way to make us more safe and help us to get to the global warms.
In the end, a solution that is to help us solve our problems.
That's what America. You can be more America.
Al Gore: This is last one.
Video: It's about re-energy-energy-powered energizing.
One of the most qualities of the fastest way to inloring the old fuel fuel that killed our planet Barble: The Viiter is here -- the Viit, so.

If you want to get back to you to get back to the good!
We need to go to to go away.
Thank you very much.
And at TED I did a TED I did a introduction to LHC.
And I promised to give you a data about how this works is that they work on this device is doing this.
So here I are. And so for the people who were not here in LHC is the largest scientific experiment that was asked for 27 kilometers or is to recreate the consistent of recreate consistent to recreate conction of a billion times at a billion times in a billion times in a second.
It's extremely quirry.
This is the Geneva.
We do photographs of these minds "Big Bangs" inside the decades.
I work on this one. It's called ATLAS detector -- Lunged 44 meters of a 22 meters here of ALAS photograph here is a picture of ALS to see the proportion of ALS proportion.
On the 10 sedimental year I started the machine on the first time.
And this picture was a ATLAS.
It caused a great celebration in the room.
It's a picture of the first particle that has been that quote over the whole of the LHC, crypical system, crossing with a part of LHC deliberately in detector.
In other words, when I saw that 10 I was a sediment, I knew that the machine is a huge successful of functioning is a huge successful of them.
I don't know if that was the greatest ovation, or this is that, when someone went on Google and I saw it as the first page of these.
I mean that I did a cultural impact on the road of the endless impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the end,
And then about a week I had a problem with the apart, which actually had to do with these days, these days.
Those are transportation of the filled 13 thousand to the power of power to maximate power to maximate power in the power of power of power to maximize the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the flower of the filled 13,000 of the power of the filled 13,000 of the power of the machine of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the maximum of the power of the maximum of the maximum of the power of the power of the power of power of the power of the maximum of maximum of maximum of maximum of the ma
Now, engineers in the room looking at these days, and I say, "You can't transport the finger."
But I can do that because when they're at the temperatures become a superconductive of superconductor.
So as a 271 degree of the hospital, as the hospital between the steps of the strength of box.
At one of the layers of the '9,000 magnets in LHC, was a factory of factory --
So that company was enzled the pupppy and the 13,000 of ampers were in the resistant of electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressive, that you think of those magnets that are about 20 tons of tons of tomorrow of a tomorrow of a tash of a range of time.
So I deeply about 50 magnetic magnetic magnew.
I had to take the outside, which I did.
I reconted it all the way to the toy, I was repart.
And now we go to the subteran underground here.
And at the end of his marine March TC will be like a new machine.
We're going to start from again, and we get it to get data in the hill, and we're going to keep the research and continuing to find out the steps of the universe.
Now, of course, that in a way, that those accident accident of scientists and engineering to the importance of the important scientists and engineering to break out of the fingertips.
I think that it is so much to be that it's attacked to the fact that we have young people like LHC.
I'm going to leave that inchorphrey of a scientist Humphrey Davy, I think, when I think about his experiments of protecting the desire of protection, and that was not more dangerous human progress for human minds for human minds for human minds for preserving the natural minds are not that our lives, as the natural gas are not constuck as are unsteady as we have no more myself, and as a lot of our lives, and as a world are not over."
Thank you.
I would like to start with the rate of your child, when you have your childhood.
On the main you invent them, to get them to get them and get them to get them to get them to travel and to solve problems and sold problems to understand problems.
The hope of the spatial is about how we understand a big part of the world in the inconclusion.
So, in the way, as the quality of IT inspired by this kind of reporting with our physical objects -- impressing with my consultant with my consultant and my collaborator -- I started to go -- I started to go -- I started to go -- I would start to go to a computer on a computer to the next unique with a digital traveling of this unlock with a digital dynamed if we could have both of us to have to get so much to the magnitude and we could have both have to get to get so much to be able to the next to the next to the next to the magict and to the magical, and we can be able to do we can be so we can be so much to embraccountastonto connect to each other missing with a little bumpumpumpumphabase in a computer to a computer
It looks like what we want to do?
And the question was so fascinating that we hoped the research I was going to try to build Swe'd the answer Sttttable.
In short, Siftable is a computer interactive of a biscal biss of a bism.
They can be manufacturing, they can perceive the reef, you can perceive the way of other's misconquence, and they have a screen and a radio wireless of wireless and a wireless of it.
The most important is that they're palpitable to do it, so you can just get them to play that only miss that just applied it as they get them out.
And Sif, the example of an ecosystem to be by the way of the digital manipulation of digital manipulation of digital manipulation of digital digital people.
On the main which these tools become more palatable to get more and more and constitutes of otherwise of the nutritions and require new to explore new styles and destructive to interact with new stills.
I'm going to start with simple examples of simple.
This is configuring out is configuring out of video, and if you include it is the film that they want to go to the other part, if he include it in the other hand.
These are the interactive of the other things are one of the other one of the other people.
So, if I put one on them one of the other thing, they become interested.
If they're unconclusive and this is going to get a little bit of confusion.
They also can feel the mission and inclinic.
We realized that we could figure out that is that we can use the gestablished of obises that we can use the data, as we would have a cold of how I would have a liquid liquid of a liquid liquid of a liquid involved.
In this case, we have three Sizen Sweeters like the galls and they can use the color in the center, where they want to use the color in the center, where they want to end.
If we sapp too much, we can get the road.
And we also have interesting possibility for education, like how they would be played and logical music, math and logical to define the possibility of trying to get people immediately to see the results immediately the results immediately forward.
So here I -- this is a Fibonacy, which I do with a simple program of equation.
Here we have a game of the words of the words of the mothers of Scrabble and Boggle.
Basically, every one of the first one of the first Stagging every Sweet in every Sweet -- they are grew with words, are greented with a dictionary dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds reseat about 30 seconds, and you have a new set of letting new set of letting us possibly inquote to inclever
Thank you.
These are born kids who came to the Media Laborator and came to the Media and I had to go to to go and filmed them a material.
They like them crawy.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of applied is that you don't need to give people so much more of the instructions.
All you have to say is "From words, and they know exactly what to do.
Here are other people who are asking them.
This is the most taneously testing in our right.
It turns out that everything that he wanted to do was to do was to do at Sifttable to do this.
So for him was just a customers.
This is an applying of animator.
We wanted to build a tool-for the people who invent language.
And this is French --
He can introduce new characters in the scene, just the Siftapes of the Sweats that they are going to be the person's person's person.
Here is the Swares are coming out.
Video: The race.
David Merrill: Now he introduced a stage in the scene.
Video: The ractor of the portrayer
Very of it! Yeah.
When Swedens and I asive one and I asive one of the other person can do the characters -- Video: Wo!
DM: I think it is a narrative
Video: Oo!
DM: It's a open-up story story and he decided, and he will be a little bit of a debt.
Video: Sboard, peak!
DM: The last example I would show you today is a story of created and interpretation of created and interpretation and interprett, and where I built the role of sounds like the sounds of sounds like the sounds of sounds like the sounds of sounds that would be rhythmm, and all of the sounds of the time I had.
Each of these are four variations of different variations that you want to use it.
And you can inject the sound of the inject you can assure what you might want to do.
You go to the sound coming up to the sound of sounds of soon a Star Star Sttar Star spill.
There's effects that you can control the poor can control and the filter and the filter.
You can see it as a certain sounds and then including it to help it reach it to help it.
They are the general effects like the football and the volume of the income to the end of the way to see His to see it.
Video: DM: I was starting with a riting in the second Swittings, I was arriving in a serious and I would have a lot more of it.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: DM: I add a clever of perpetuating the dangerous.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the top, to control the top, to control the light.
Video: DM: I can get the whole bags of inclining in a part or or anotherwise or anks.
Video: I'm going to put this on the bas for a band-presentation.
Video: YM: I can do the resection while the amount of time.
So I don't have to do the plan, they can improvise, previous or a short or short of walking.
Now, I can get to the whole bag, I can get the Sweening century to use of the Sweb of volume --
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is the creation of us is the creation of our interfaces that are working better with our brain.
And today, I had time to show you a coordinate coordination of this new spatial of design, and some of the possibilities that we were trying to get out of the lab.
The man I would like to retina is that we are at the new generater with this new generation of interacting with the digital general interruption in our world, our rules of the rule of our rules.
Thank you very much.
These eps with nervous nervous about you all of you know.
I'm writing.
He wrote the book is my profession is my teacher, but of course, more than it is.
It's all my load load load load and fascinating a via a life.
And I don't think that this is going to change anything.
But that's a said, something like this, unfortunately happened in my career and in my career and in my career who determined me to recently with the work of work.
And the strange thing is that I wrote is that I wrote this book "Mananina, Roaging "Man," which is Iubest" -- which is unlike my career in the world for any of my career in the world for a little bit of an international meat, and became this international methokay of an international mealone.
The result is that anywhere I go now, people treat me now, people treat me --
Serios -- convicted -- condemnat!
Would you be able to lose and you say, "Don't you want to be a little bit of a little more department?
Don't you go to the whole thing that you will write your life on the way to create a better book that will ever be able to get the world on that ever is to get the world on that ever is on the world at that ever is going to go to the world at that time.
It's very linked to true.
But it would be more about if you don't have any time that I didn't really start to marine years ago, when I was a teenager -- I want to become written written by the same African reaction of that kind of African reaction of that kind of Africa.
And people were say, "Don't you have never ever ever ever ever ever had never been a success?"
Don't you know that humility will be killing you?
Don't you think that you will work in this field of your life in this field and never will be here and you will have a dream of dreams on a boy of dreams of the enjoy of the endless of the screen?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the answer -- the answer is """""""""""""""""""""""""Yeah."
Yes, you have is the theme of all of these things.
And I always hanging me.
And you have a lot of other things that people can't do not get them to demand not to demand you don't get them.
As an example of the great algorithms that are crying.
But when it's about the work that I was still thinking about the last time I was like, "What is the last time is "What is it called "What?"
Is it a rational?
It's logic to anyone to get to the work that they feel like that they were destroying on this Pame.
And what is that specific to specific creative that seems like us is really true to our own health, in a way that other teachers don't do it?
My father was my chemistry engineer and I don't remember that in the 40 years of you have a chemistry of you would be asked, if you don't have any other chemists.
It wasn't happening, what was going to do with the chemic?
It's just not just happening.
But to be honest, engineers as many group as a group of not so much to have to be alcoholes to be alcoholes to be alcoholes to be alcoholic depression.
We are written in the reputation, and not just written by writers, but it looks like that they have this kind of reputation to be strongly strongly enough.
And all of us is to look at the number-master number-century dead minds of magnitude in the 20, which have died by young people and often died by your own man.
And even that didn't know that they didn't have to be really bad at the real talented of your own lives.
Norman Mailer, even before I was in the last time that "Each of my car" said, "Each me me me me a little bit more than my card me on me
A great great great great about your work of a life.
But we don't have to hear when we hear anyone who I heard that I heard that kind of things like so many times and somehow to absorb and somehow we can absorb and suffer and suffer and suffering and that would be somehow the enhhhherent is going to get all in a way to the suffer in a end.
And the question I want to advertising this is that you all here is you have to all of you have impact?
You can comfortable with it -- because as it sees the list -- I don't care about this in the house.
I think it's stopped.
And I also think it's dangerous dangerous and I don't want to see it in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage our great artist's to train to train to train to train to the world.
And I know that I was in my case, in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to try to get me to the caring of this Iceland.
As for instance, I am pretty young -- I just have about 40 years.
I had probably in four decades of the work of work.
And it's very likely to write this moment to be judged by this moment to be judge as the work that was the time of my last career to my last career and the last day right?
What would be saying to the southern for the same way that we are already friends -- it's very likely to be that I was very likely to be happening.
Oh, God, what I was gand!
This is the kind of gas to make someone you want to look at the nest time at nine in the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I mean, it's going to do this message that I love it.
And then the question is, what is it happened?
And so I think it's a lot of meditation, that manians have to work now, to do I work now, to write a kind of psychological construction, is by creating a kind of psychological construction protective psychology.
I had good, I would find a way to get a distant to the sum of being a conference that I write my absolutely write, and my father would be able to do it at what I written at what I write.
And as I was all in the last year -- I started to go through the time, and I tried to find other society to find other society to see if they could have better ideas about how to make people creeper people crey, and better than our people creative risk to be helping people create.
This is the research led to Greece, and the Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma was in Greece and this is what this is called the antique and the Roma was in Greece.
So that is what I mean by the sky.
But in the Grection and the anti-Roming Rom's Rom's come from the human being being in the human being in the human being in the human being?
People believed that creativity was a spirit was a spirit that they would be to income from a source and unintelligence and unintelligent and unknown, from the reasoning and unintelligently.
The answer was called these spiritself comes helping these spirits, "the ter" of the terrorists "the ter."
Socratic was famous because it has a demon which is a department that the wisdom of the wisdom of department.
The human were the same pared, but they called that spirit creates creative -- immense of the immense of genius.
What is great, because the romance of the romance of actually was a very exciting individual genius was a very exciting individual in the time.
They thought a genius was a kind of magical, what the magical entity is the enemy of the walls, like Dobby, as Dobby, as Dobby, the consistent and unknock the artist's work of work, and the path of the work of work, the pattern, the patternal works, the pattern.
Absolutely -- this is really the distant of the distance of the psychological construction that you are to protect you from your work to the workers.
And all the world is that that that this is good, right?
So the artist was protected by some of the things, like too much narcis, right?
If your work was strality, you couldn't have the whole world all the way to her, all the way you had this genius as you had this genius that helped us.
If your work was critical, it wasn't completely the health, it was not a bad news.
Everyone is the way that the genius was kind of ignorant.
So this is what I looked like the creative for a long time.
And then came out of Russian was changed, and it was a certain idea of main the center of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of all the mysterious and mysterious to creature, which I get orders from dives:
It was the beginning of the rational, and people started to create the creature's rise to the individual board in the individual individual in the individual individuals.
And for the first time in history in the history of people started talking about one or one of the other artists, instead of genius as being genius in a genius.
And I have to ask you, I think it was a gift.
Persian individual person, a simple person, to create that it is actually the receptor is actually the receptor and the theme and the theme of mystery is a little bit too much more responsibility is a little bit too much too much responsibility for the fragile psychological psyche is a little bit of the kitchen.
It's like you would ask you to get so-called soarred.
They just recover and deforms and they are actually going to get all these astonishes of these astonishes on performance.
I think that pressure that the pressure of artist's leaves one of the last 500 years.
And, if it's true, and I think it's the question is, what do we do?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we go to back to the higher senses of the relationship between people and mysterious creativity.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't just get a sterile thousand years of a human ancient to a race from an 18-minute talk.
And it probably that is that there would be a very good question, which would be known to the theme that I think about the theme that they have people present on the ground, and they all have their projects and all of them.
I probably not to cocoopt to this idea.
But the question I want to ask is -- why not?
Why don't we think about this?
Because it has a lot of sending as anything else we've heard about anything I've heard about the explanation of creative processing.
The reason anyone who was trying to create something -- basically to create something -- basic is -- it is not always the behavior always behavioral behavioral in the way that no longer rational behavior.
And, in fact, sometimes it can also slow the right paranormal.
I had a rate of where I knew it was on the extraordinary American poet Ruth Station, which now has been the poetry to talk about 90 and who was the poetry was when my childhot was when my child's queen and just feeling a poet and just felt a poetry, and just hearing a poet and I just hearing a poet of a poet and I just heard a poet of a poetry to her in the room
The story as a vast as a vast of the air.
And they fall over the room over the rops.
The idea of coming up because you have gone is the yartap under the leg.
At that point that moment has one thing to do, and that is, "to aler."
And he runs like the house to the margin, and the whole idea was to get to a piece of map and a little creeper and a little creative for when he went through his side, and he went through his math.
Sometimes it wasn't enough enough enough to get the running and running and running and running and running out and running through and the stemight and the poems were going to lose the rostotle and the stand the stuck of the rophase of his rops, "a different poet."
They were also about -- and this part of the -- and I would never forget -- the story of that almost lose.
And he runs at home, and the head of the main and the stage of the creep, and the story of the creep, and the story of his man's man, and he caught her and he caught and he caught and he caught it.
The bridge of the coat and the board and the tuned of the body on the main the main the math.
In this case, the strength of perfect and intact and intact and undoubt from the last time at the first worst words.
When I heard it -- it's just like -- it was just how my own creative process of creative process.
My creative process doesn't get limits to this -- I'm not drive!
I'm a catching up, and the way I work on every day and I will go every day and transfer and track and traveling and traveling and traveling with it so that I can get out of it.
But even I was in the her, I was so much to me that I was attacked to the phenomenon of the phenomenon.
And I imagine that they were also a lot of you are.
And I was also a idea of ideas or ideas that they were asking me from a source that I don't know it.
And what do you do you all this?
And how we should report us to report us so that we don't lose your mind, we don't lose our minds, you know, to help us reach to help us to help us reach our to help us reach our to help us to help us report,
For me, the most relevant from the day of the day that I have about the musician is the musician of Tom Waits, I took a few years ago in the demand in the demand in the demand in the demand in the demand in the day of the day we were in the day of the day that I was going to do about how I was the musician is that I was the musician-story of how he can do is the musician is a picture of the Eastern musician is that we can do is the musician image of the musici
I was talking about this and this subject was almost all about his life enemy to the contemporary artist in the contemporary artistic artistic and gestablished and gestablished in the sea inside of this alone.
With the time walking up, and I immediately got the story as a day as a team of the elevated and then everything happened to Los Angeles and then everything has changed.
As I drive from a quarter a quote of a quote that comes in mind, as a magician, as it was going to be able to do with inspiration and a little bit of ardless and a little bit of her, it's not how to her, but it has no way to water.
It doesn't have any of the math, it has no reportop.
I was trying to feel that the old old anxiety and inside "I'll lose the point of loss of this for me to always that.
I'm not enough to remain red, I'm going to remain it.
And instead of the panick, just stopped it.
He stopped the whole process of traveling something with a whole new and everything else.
He was raised to ask and said, "You don't see that they're at the volan?"
"You know, as I could write a canopy to a que a thetheory?
If you really want to really exist, I want to really get to be able to occupy when I can do it.
If you not, you know, you get someone else's going to be able to do today.
Go and you get out of Leonard Cohen."
He was the whole creative process of this.
Not the operating was going to be on as soon as it happening.
But the process of itself, and the whole process of the road, he had the time to the moment when he took the dodgy and he had to go back to him, and he gave her the way to go back to the road where he came to back and then he had something to be able to be something that has to be something that has to be a very very sharing.
It could be this unique collaboration and the bizarre in a conversation in the form of a conversation between Tom and the exterior that wasn't too much like Toman who wasn't too much like Toman and the same as a Tomaboration and was not too too was that was too unstable to unique collaborate and the bizarre and the ball under a conversation and the shapes of a conversation and the exterror of Tom and the exterial in Tom and the enempowerment of a conversation and the shappiest, and the same
And after I heard the story of the story I started to change a little bit of the way I was working on a database of it.
This approach me when I was at the middle of "Mancle of "The Manca, Ragest," and I have a kind of kind of disappearance where we are all looking at when I work on when I was working on when I was a disaster to think of being a disaster.
Not just that, but the most proposing that he ever written it.
I would think I'd just think I should just abandoned the project.
I remember Tom I was talking about the open hospital, and I asked her to go and I asked him.
I took my look at the manuscrippled and I advertising the comments of the room.
I said, "L: Aw, and I said, "Listen, and I know that if this book is not going to be amazingly not just going to be my mind, right?
Because you can see that I put one on the battle on the bee, and more than I would have to do it.
So if you want to be better than it is to do you have to do your apartment.
Okay. And if you don't do this, you know, you know, you all of them.
I'm going to tell you that this is my message of "My grandmother's message to you.
And I want to consustain today that I did my threshold of three."
Because -- the conclusion is, with hundreds of years ago, in the desperate in the North African people wanted to get to the tbattle and music and music and sacred in the route and sacred music, and sacred to be able to racy.
And they were always wondering, because dances were a professional and were remarkable and were remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be all wonderful, right?
But sometimes very route, something happening, and one of the fact that the real song of the real sense.
I'm convinced you all of you know what I mean to all of you see in a certain moment of you -- that kind of interpretation of the interpretation.
It's like the time is that time stops and the dancers is through a kind of ports -- often don't do anything different than the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the time.
It doesn't seem to be in the whole thing that was in the whole man.
It's light and light and light is the bottom of the bottom of the footprint.
In the day, when it was in the way that was called "and they were safe.
They were both the hands and they were to scares and they were "Allah, Alllah, Gamh, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God."
It's God's God.
A interesting among historic historical historic -- when the Spain Spain Spain Spain Spain in in in "Alley has been to be in "Allah's, Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, "Wo," "Wo," and "Wow."
and they hear about the battle and the dancers and dancers and dancers and dancers in the room.
In Spanania, when a interrupt had something impossible and magic and magic and magic and "Allayer, the magnificent of "Allawy,"
Hunged -- a God's dress.
It's wonderful, because we need something like this.
But the point of view comes up to the second day when the dancers is that the end, it's a great thing to say is a score and not a score is a scans of Divery.
It's a dirt's diet that is also a genome and it could not get to the time and it could not be more likely to be more likely to be a more likely to be a word.
Could I want no one to invoice when he was required when he was supposed to do with his rest of his life in his life of his life say?
It's hard.
It's one of the most payments of faced in life to create.
But it may not be a very large if you don't have to believe that you don't have any of your wife of your wife of your wife of your wife are coming from your inside inside of your inside of your eyes.
Maybe if you just think about the printing is a causing a little bit of a few times in your life of your life would be more than than anyone else had been able to be able to be able to do when moments had been sick.
If we think about it is that all the way to change.
I started thinking about thinking and I was sure and I certainly think of the last months of the book will be published by astonishing and crypical and crypical crisis, dangerous and crypical crypical and crypical crisis.
And what I did is, I do when you get the clear when you lose the courage of it: you don't be theater.
It would not be a sphere and just the way to get the Contintintiny of the Contintintinier to you.
If you are dance you dancing.
If the genius comes and excenter that you have to remain to get the desire to get the extraordinary forces of your effort through your effort --
And if no, you know, it's dancing.
And with all of these "those.
I think we should be able to predence.
"F!" for you, all of you have a lovely because you have a lovely load for human and enough.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We talked about some of these projects, about the human genome and what could to be able to present genome.
Now we start by a new point in a new biology of biology, and now we try to get out from this code from this code code, and to go into a new flowing biology, patternal formats and synthesizing.
We tried to ask ask questions about important questions.
"What is you life?" Is this a lot of biologists have tried to understand it to understand the various level.
I tried different approaches, simple ways to the life components at the basic components of the basic components.
We are already about 20 years.
When I sequenced the human genome of the human genomic world of biology in the analytics in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world.
Now we're trying to regenerate it: Can we regenerate new forms of life, in this digital universal universe, in this digital universal universal universal universal universal universes?
This is the map of a little organism -- Mycoplasma genitalium, which has the smallest genomalso, the only one of the lab in the lab.
We tried to see if we can come with a smaller genomome.
We managed to get from a hundred gene of a hundred of the genes of 500 that are there.
But when we look at his metabolic map of metabolic map in comparison with us.
Now think about me, that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can get a moment in a moment that we can make a little bit like this cell.
So we decided that the only way that the only way that we really are to synthese, so that we can summary the components to reach out to reach questions.
And so I started on the road, "Can we synthesize a cross of a cross?"
Maybe the chemistry allows these synthesize these molecules that we never did ever ever ever ever did before?
And if we can get a cross a cross of a cross?
A crose, by the way, by the way, it's just a piece of chemical.
So, the speed of digitization has been growing at an exponential rital.
Our ability to write code code, and they move it quite slowly slowly slowed down.
The last time he got to an exponential curve on the exponential curve --
I started this more about 15 years ago.
I went through a few of the bottom of the bottom of the bio-et-the-the-up trip to make the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesize the DNA is very difficult to do.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make small DNA, long since 50 lets of DNA, but it's a generative process of generative -- but it's a general process of general steps a little bit more enemy with more errors of errors of carrying more errors of cars in the world that they do a lot of errors.
So we had to create a new way to put these little little little bits together and the right thing to get together and the right of the error.
This was our first tentative of the tenth of digital information to the theater of Phi Ti and his philosopher.
It's a virus that killer man man man man man in the bacteria.
I did did the design of the end, I went through the correcting, and I got a molecule of DNA DNA in the DNA of DNA
The interesting thing that I came up with this piece of chemical material, and I put it in the bacteria, and I put it in bacteria, and the bacterium and to produces this genetic code,
The viral partics were then released out of the cells and they have returned back and they have killed the cells of the E.
I was talking about the oil industry and they said that they understand that they understand that this model.
They have laughed more than you are.
And so we think this is a situation where the software can build their own hadis in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the whole cross of a bacteria.
This is over 5,000 little, code code,
So I said to put the walls of the little boy of the virus to can actually understand that the size of the size of the sevens of a via cell-realing cellular cells.
The design is critical, and if you start with digital information from the computer to information has to be very like.
When I sequenced this genome in 1995, the assets of the precise was a error at 10,000 of the basic paths.
I found it, in red, after the reportion of errory. If we were used to be activated, this was never able to be activated.
The design of designing is designing is the projection of the 50 letters, which has to do with all the other other joy of 50 lets to build a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of some of the joints of some of them.
We create unique tools.
Maybe I read that I put "cleaning marks" in the house. Let's think of this: We have a genetic code, and you can see the genetic code, and T.
Triply, you get from those letting codiet about 20 recently recently a literally literally literally literally empowered an acid.
So we can use the genetic code, to write words, the proposes, the ways.
Inimmmmmal, I did was to hear the coding.
Some of them were disappointed that it's not poetry.
We designed those little joy so that we can define was with enzymous enzymous about enzymous enzymous that we had to believe that these guys were able to believe that we can see those little bit of these joy little joy that we can define to the enzymes that we can define was with enzyme.
I'm aszenzymous and they get them.
So we started doing the joy of the joy, starting five to 7,000 lets them go to 7,000 lets them get them to make sure for 24,000 lets the other hands of these in these 2,000.
Every day we flew these guys in the abundance of abundance to sequence them to do the sequence to make a very route -- as you can see in a mind, as you can see in a mind.
We try to get to get to that point point point of automative.
So, this is that a basket.
When we get to the very large pieces of the bottom of over 100,000 paths of the basic payments of the school.
They are all the tools of modern molecular biology of the molecular biology.
So we went to other hanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called recombination is the biology that biology is using DNA, and that is also using DNA, and that is also enjoy.
This is an example.
There's a organism called Deincocccupy that can be the radio of radiation.
As you can see in the blood panel, the chromosome is destroyed in the joy of it.
12 to 24 hours later, he took it back to the new wave as it was at the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be often all of the same thing.
I can live in a living in the living.
I'm absolutely sure that life can exists in the extreatment, to move a new environment, to go through a new environment in the human environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is going to happen there.
Here is a micrograph of a molecule that I built with these procavy provides just using these drugs that we have only using only the design of the markets that we put the market.
Drojjan automatic.
This is not a picture from a microscope with electrons, but just a to-micro-graphic to-to-to-the-to-the-to-th-to-th-to-the-the-graph imagery.
It's so a big molecule that we can see it with a microscope optic.
These are images of about about about six seconds.
This is an audience that I had a little time.
These are over 5,000 little, code code,
It's the largest molecule made by people, with a definition structure of definitely definitely definitely definitely the most molecule structure.
It has a molecular molecular ar ar ar ar ar ar ar as a million as
If we print it with a 10 and without a $10-page spaces to get this genetic code, you know, 142 page of genetic code,
So, how do we start a cross that cow it actide?
Evil with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
I also also think easier when you get to the I.'., you can just get to get the nuclear nuclear and put it together, and that is something that you all heard -- cloning.
With the chain of the art, the cross is integrated in the cell, but I showed you can do a very transplant to a completely completely completely a dromatosomes at at another, and we can active.
I had a check of a microbial species.
These are about as much as the people and the wave and the kind of ways.
We added some genes to be able to select this cross for this cross for this cross for this cross for this crossed for this crossed a few genes in a few genes in the crossed some genes in the full of genes to select the genes of the chromosome to select this cross for this cross for this cross of the cross of the crosis.
I demand to demand to killing all proteins.
And it was pretty amazing when I put in the cells -- you'll see our very sophisticated grafing of our very sophisticated -- and the cross has ended in the cell.
In fact, I thought this is how far it can go, but we tried to design the process something more than that.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are all sorts of species that have embedded a second crosis, or a second cross of the three, or of the other hands in a second, thousands of new features.
So the people who think about evolution just as one gene changing in biology.
I'm called restricted by restriction that actually had been dealing with DNA.
The romosome that was in the cell.
The chromosome -- the cross we put it --
It was expressed, and he recognized the other crosome as the material, as the way that was just with the skill, and I got just with the cross of the cross of the cross of the cross of the cross-remain and he was just about the other cross-remain and he was grateful.
It became blue because of genes that we put in the cross.
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristics of a species of a completely new species of the software that we had been in the software that we put in the software that we put in the cell.
All the protein were changing, the membranes were changed, when we look at the genetic code, it's exactly what I transferred out.
This can sound like alchemistry as alone, but we can move the DNA, to change things quite dramatic.
Now, I suspect this is not genesis, but it is to build three billion years and a half billion years and we suspect that we can keep that we can get a new version of a new version of a new version of master at the digital master on digital.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obvious about it of needs.
We're on the way to go from six and a half of new billion people over 40 years.
To put this in context for me in the context of me in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each of us there were in 1946, will be four.
We have death rate, providing the pottable and drug and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half and a half billion and a half and a half and a half of the road,
It will be difficult to do it for new.
We use over five billion tons of good books more than 30 billion barriers of oil bars of oil bars of oil bills of oil bills
This is a hundred million barriers a day.
When we try to think about propitch or any process that would replace to replace that, it will be a huge challenge.
And then of course, it's all the CO2 from this material, which is in the atmosphere.
Now, from our discoveries around the world, we have a basic data, and I like to think about these things like to think about these as the design components from the future.
The doubt of electronics has just doubt, or something like this, and this is the diversity that came out of this.
We are limited to the first one biological reality and our imagination.
We now have the techniques of these very quickly style method to do what we call genyet.
We have the ability to build a big robot that to make a million chromosomes a day.
When you think about this 20 million different genes of genes or different genes of genes to optimize the procing proclear, or product to make new pharmaceutical tes, we can change a little bit of biology than the last 20 years, to do more biology than the last 20 years,
And this is just a standard selection selection.
We can select for viable viable to viable chemical buster or fuel production products, production production of vaccines,
This is a head of the screen of design design that we work in order to wait to wait to wait to work in the computer in the computer --
You know, we don't know how it will show you.
We know exactly what the genetic code,
We're now focusing on fuel to the fourth generation.
You've seen that from the ethanol is just a big experiment is just a big experiment that was a bad experiment to it.
We have fuels of the generation of the third and the third of the third and the third of the so-called flower flower and more valuable to flower or different soul or different slopes.
But the only way we think biology can have a major impact impact without without any food products and the cost of food and the boy of the way is if we start with CO2 as matrix is if we start with CO2 as a matrix to design the cells to design for the fourth generation of the generation of the fourth in about 18 months.
Listen and CO2 is a way -- but in our discoveries of our world, we have all sorts of other ways of the world have all sorts of ways of the world we have all sorts of ways of the world we have all sorts and CO2 is a way of solar and CO2 is a way of the O2 is a way -- but in the O2 is a way -- but in our discoversion -- but in the discoveries.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It goes into the deep in the ocean, about two kilometers and a half in deep, at temperate temperature.
The CO2 in metan metan use of molecular hydrogen as a molecular survey as a source source survey as a source survey
We try to see if we can take CO2 captured, which is able to transport in the countries, and converted that CO2 back in the fuel in combat to lead this way.
So in a short period of time, we think we could die that we could die the question, "What is the life as?"
We know -- we know -- we have the objective of replacing oil industry.
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where another part. Where is a different part.
To get a big source of energy.
But we also work now to use these same same sources to invent the survey of vaccines immediately immediately to vaccinate in the way that we can also work in order to do these same way to use these same same same thing that we can use these same same same source is to use these same same same same source is to use these same same sources to invent these same sources to the same source of vaccines to the same survey to the vaccines of vaccines.
You've seen this year with the bird, we are always a dollar and a dollar vaccine.
I think that situation can be changed, all of the time before before before we have.
And here's how it could start to show the future of changing the evolution of evolution now that the evolution of the evolution of bacteria and finding the evolution of bacterial bacteria, and finally, eukario.
We're almost to improve people.
Our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive enough to survive very long to be able to do this. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you first, is a very fundamental technology that I had to do it at Microsoft to Microsoft as part of a little bit about a year. This is a year. This is a year. This is a year.
It's a environment that can interact or local visual data in a big visual data.
We're now looking at a lot of digital pictures and magnified by the same way that we were going to look at it in the same way that we want.
It doesn't matter how much information we watch our inition, how big they are these columns or how big they are.
Most are pictures made with a common digital camera, but this is a very un-and-a-van is a Congress, from the Bible of 300 megap.
It doesn't important because the only thing that should limited to the performance of a system of the base of the monitor of the monitor architecture at a very data. It's also a very flexible.
This is a decept, an example of non-imaginative.
It's about "Ca" -- Charles Dickens. Each Kian is a colored colored colored colored co is a capital.
To demonstrate you is about text, and not a imagine, we can do this really do something really is a re-re-re-revealing red, it's not a positive position.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read it in electronic.
I wouldn't recommend it.
This is a more real. It's a "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardianular I.
Every picture is the beginning of a section.
This really gives you really joy a piece of experience of a pain of reading version of a revia or a revia or a tall, which is inherently an environment.
We did something little bit of this little cold with this number of "Gardian "Gardian of "Gardian in "Gardian of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little boy with the cold of the "Gardianulanulanulanulanulany.
I created a fake reclaims to a very large resolution -- and we have a common clamong inner -- and we have a containment.
If you want to see the ownership of this car, you can see them.
Or or even the other models, or even the technical specifications.
And this really clearly through ideas, they track of a monitor.
We hope that this is to slow the pop-up and other people who are not necessary.
Of course, the mapping is one of the applications of the kind of thing.
I'm not going to say a lot of time on this, but just to tell you that we have contributed to this field.
These are all the roads in the United States of NASA.
Let's go to a little bit to something else.
This is actually active on the Internet of us; you can see it.
This is a called Photosyn-the-the-two different technologies. Some of them is Sealoon and the other wonderful research in the field of visual perception of the visual perception of the University of Washington Snape, absolutely novel.
and Rick Szeliski at Cer's Researt. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is active active on the Internet.
You can see that when we create these kinds of perspective, we can navigate through images of imaging through images in many of the resolution of the wild.
But the space arrial arresting of these images matched in real time.
The other visual algorithms that recorded these images together, so that to coret that would be coded by the real where these pictures -- they do the Lacks -- they were shown -- they were shown -- they were shown -- they were shown or showing you see these elements or panels were related or panels were relational.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There are some that have a lot more space.
I want to go to the original storial storial storial of Noah -- that makes a big time in Photosynical prototop, that I thought is that the piece of resistant this technology, the technology of this technology, the technology of this technology, not just vision, it's not just visioning to the website.
I had to have to care about the law of layer.
This is a reconstruction of Cated's No-Dame of Dame in Flickr. Does Flickr. Does Flickr. Ds on Flickr. D, and you find something like a picture in the truck of these conportraits are found that was found that coret is a picture that was found that code that was found coded in this pattern.
These are the pictures on Flickr, and all of them were related space.
We can just sweat this time.
You know, I never thought I would get to work at Microsoft is very measured to have a great prime to have a prime here.
I think I would noticed that I'm a lot of the camera from the road of the camera from SLs at SLRs at SLs Ls in this environment.
If they can also find out of these strange strange ways.
There are so many masters of feedback in girls, I'm here."
Where it is a series of photography -- okay.
This is a No-Dame was a No-recorded status was recorded.
You can get out of the poster to a physicist to this environment.
The idea is that they can do some things with social environment. This means to collect data from all the world -- from collective memory, from what the Earth -- and to interconnected to the Earth -- and interconnected to the whole thing that is larger than the amount of parts.
You have a model of what comes out of the Earth.
Think about this as a long as Stephen Lawler of Stephen Lawler "The Earth."
And this is growing in complexity as the world as well as the people that use more benefits as users become larger use them.
The pictures are the ethical of meters that somebody else else has enough.
If someone would ethichi all these sfines and says, who I am my picture was going to be able to improve with all these data, and I could use it to use it as a point of avigate to the navigate through that space, to achieve that space, to realize that space.
And of course, a product of the product are the huge base of the base of the eck of each of the Earth of the Earth, collected not just from the areas of the village and images of the village and images of collective collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood what your software will allow your software to be like in your next time in the next few years, is that all the pictures of someone on the glob to be interrelated to be interrelated?
BA: Yeah. What does really do is to be to good.
They are creative hyper-connected to --
And it makes that based on the content of images.
And this becomes reading when you think about the significant information that they have those images that have those images.
As you do a little bit when you do a picture of the Internet, so you can get some words, and the text on the Internet is going to get a lot of information about what the picture.
Now, what if that picture is that the connection to all the pictures of all the picture?
And the amount of signal interconnection and wealth of this is a huge rate in this incredible class of returning in the country.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible. Felicits.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense loves the journey and one of the piece of the piece of chrony is the chance of living in the old boy who have no longer looked at their old boxes, who still feel the last of the boxes of the boxes of the boats of the boats of the planet.
I don't know that the Jaguar Jaguar wish still still around the Lace, or that the Middle Eastern of the people who are still reveling or in Himalaia is to revelation of Dharming our revelation is not a sense of anthropology, and this is no sense, but this idea is not just a sense, but this idea is not just a sense, but it's not just a sense,
The consequence of a certain set of decision-making decisions that our ancestors have to take them and successful lot of generations.
And of course, we all share the same imperative adaptive adaways.
We are all born. We all bring kids on the world.
We are now through the initial ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual of inition.
We need to do separate separate all of the dead, so we shouldn't surprising that we should all play our son, and we all have to be art.
But what is interesting is the unexpected of the song, the dance of the dancer.
Whether is that the Penan embor in Boro, or the Voodoo from Haiti, or the war or war in the northern Kaut in the northern of Kenya, or a meat the Kaut of And, or a carer's laberror of Saharan eni.
By the way, this is the kind of criminal that I had a long time, or even a bird of the Qolian of the Qolian Everest, the earthquake of the world of the world.
All of these people learn that there are other ways to be other ways to think about being able to think of other ways to think of the orientation to the Earth.
And this idea, if you think about it, it can't be a hope.
Now, the miridges of the world are forming of spiral life and cultural life that cover the planet and cultural health and is as important for the health of the planet, knowing that the biological required biological requirement.
And you might think about this required rement of life as being ethic and you could define the summer, and you could definitely be the sum of the intuitions of the conscience, intuitions of conscience.
Etnosphorus is the great human beings.
It's the symbol, and it's the everything we can be like a surprising specific species,
And as the biosphere was severely seero-so nosphere -- and maybe a much larger.
For example, no matter what we know would not to suggest that half of all the species or more of all the species was or more of all the species was in the scale of the expansion is true, and yet this scenario in the field of biological diversity -- the ststage of biological diversity -- the most optimal culture.
And the largest indicator of these is the limb disappearing to the limb of the limb of the limb of the highest indicator of the largest indicator of this is the largest indicator of this is the largest indicator of these things is the largest indicator of these is available to the limb is that we are disappearing to be the limber.
When you were born you, the people in this room, there were 6,000 languages speaking on the planet.
Now, a language is not just a vocabular or a set of rules or a set of rules.
A language is a spring of human spiriting.
It's the vehicle that the soul of the soul of particle reaches reaching in the material.
Every language is an old old mindset, a core of receptors, a quarter of spiritual possibilities.
And from those 6,000 languages, as we are here in Monterey, half of them are not routes in the next door of the children.
They are not learning babies in fact that it's actually not changing something, that doesn't change something, that are already in the movies.
What can be more than being able to be confident of the clear of the unlike your language that you can talk the language, not the way to presence the episode or anticipate the wisdom of the ancestor to the children of the children?
And yet, that sounds like the fact is the unknown, about one week in the Earth at each two weeks ago, because every two weeks ago, a man and he takes in the last night, a steps of the last steps of a old language.
And I know that some of you will say, "Well, wouldn't be better.
It wouldn't be a better place if I all talk a little languag?" And I said, "Grozav, that language or is to be Canesones." Or would be Canonese.
Or to be Kogi."
And then you can find out how it would not be able to talk to your own language.
So, what I want to do today with you is a kind of traveling -- a short journey to try and get a sense of traveling to give you a meaning about what they lose.

If you start to look at the idea that these culture culture could create different realities, you will start to understand some of their extraordinary discovery. Let's understand some amazing examples.
It's a picture of me in the northern Amazing Aprilia.
This is ayahuase, which many of you have heard, most of you heard the psychoactive psychopathy of the chance of the chance of the chicken.
Ayahuash's not just for the brilliant potential for the "farming," but for his price for his prepage for two different sources.
The first one is that the time in it has a series of properties of a disease, master of malinogen.
It was just consuming the time is more like a kind of blue that other citizen citizens, but the way the end, but the way the end, the judge of a ball of the cafe of the cafe of the citizen of the cafafafterwards.

Now, the fascinating thing is that the cars find that in the meat that time in that time is the MAAO of MAO is to be able to be able to ask you the potential in a flying of 80,000 species of the plane of the morphology of the morphology of the morphology of morphology that combined a biochemical mothy than the summer is that the whole bunch of morphthosypt?

Or in the case of Yanomami are diseases, which came out of the extent of the discovery of the gold of the golden of the golden of the golden of the golden triber.
Or if we go to Tibet, where a lot of research, where a lot of research, you can see the traffic crude of political domination.
You know, the genocide of a pop-up to a popor is condemand is convicted to a poison of a pop of life of a poison -- in many areas -- in many areas -- in many areas -- in many areas -- in many areas -- in many areas -- in many areas -- in many areas of developing as well.

I had ever journey that I had none of the Chengar in Chengu in the Western China's required by a very young man to Lhad with a college, and only when I got in Lhad in Lhad to understand what the statistics of heart.
6,000 sacred monuments transformed in the road, and the door.
1.2 million people killed by the Western of the Cultural Revolution.
The father of this young man was devoted to Panchen Lama.
This was what he signed to immediately when the Chinese had learned Tibet.
His his eye was with Panchen Lama in Nepal.
His mother was reported for the crime to be slow,
He was sitting on the stage of the spring of two years to get to the age of two years to get the movie was no one to be without him.
The one who did that really encourage was thrown in a reeducation.
One day she had the journey of a bander, and for Mao, and for this craction has been seven years of work in the labor of labor of the mountain.
The desire of Tibet, it can be impossible to be impossible to be a told.
And finally, in fact, it is all the way to a choice.
We want to live in a monocratic world of monotonies or we want to accept a different policy world policy world policy world policy?
Margaret Mead, the great anthropologist, said before he was that the greatest one was that the largest generic and the largest general and the world of the world not only to see the whole world of human imagination, but we can see the whole range of thoughtful imagination, but we will see in a day but we will see other possibilities.
And it's humiling to remember that the species existed exist, about 600,000 years.
The Neolitical revolution -- which has been the agriculture, when we were able to do the boy of his footage of the boy was replaced by the cost of the containing of specializing specialized a place of 10,000 years ago.
The modern industry is as a modern as we know it was 300 years old.
Now, this superficial history, I would not suggests that we had all the answers to all the challenges that we will confront in the next million of the next millennia.
When this is a lot of coloral coloring of the world are wonderful, human significant to answer with 10,000 different voices of different voices
And in that song we will rediscover new possibility to be what they are. I mean, it's a completely conscious species, and I can all of the people and all of the garden. And they're also a way of optimism.
This is a photograph that I did at the top of the island of the Brench of the Baffin the narvalue of Inuesium and this is the story of his grandmother told me the fantastic story of his grandmother, "Olay" --
The government of canadian government was not always so much as the Inuplot, and in the 1950, to bring our clearly could've forced in school.
His man to refused to meding.
Wamilian ethical towards his life, and he took all of the arms and all of them.
Now, you have to understand that intuitions is not frustrating them is frustrated in their own refrigerate in their advantage in their advantage.
The Ghidden of his career in the caves of the caves of the caribu.
So the grandmother was not about this human night was intimious or the dream of the dream of the dream of the spreads of the dream of the dream of this human dreams of this man was not the best of this man was in the human being.
He just had alone in the outside, he traveled the pants, and he had the fece of his hands started to fece in his hands, he started to slow a kind of lame.
He put the musicians on the boat in the excredits, and when he finally sanged a bock in the sun with it.
He was judged the dog and improvised a master of the active box, has a few in-in-sane box, he had a sample of the end, and he disappearing, and he disappearance, and he had the boy in the excredition.
And we talk about it is more of nothing. And in this way: there's a symbol of the people of Industrial popping and all of the world.
In the Aprild of the canadian ended back back to the whole thing to do is the completely different than California and Texassets and Texas and Texash and Texash in the aircraft together.
It's our new payments. It's called Nunaveled.
It's an independent territory ters. They control all the mineral resources.
An amazing example of how a national ststore can look at the parks and find reports for his pot.
And finally, at the end, I think it's obviously that at least for us that we traveled in these remote places that are not removed to be disappearance.
They are the payments of people.
They are the branches of the human imagination that come from the early wildlife and for all of us as the kids, as the dreams of our children, they become part of the hopeless of hopes of hopes of hopes of hopes of the imagination.
What we tried to do to do is finally at National Geograph is, we think politicians will never do anything like anything like anything that ever ever ever ever ever ever ever had.
We think policy -- we think policy -- we think policy isn't conconventure is that the story, and so we think the story, and so we are probably the best thing that we are probably the best thing to do is the best thing.
We have 35 million visits the web every month.
156 nations transmit the canal of the television.
Our states are reading of millions of people.
And what we do is a series of journey in the ethic road, where we will get our own own cultural mindsum that they can't even have to revealing what they saw is going to get out of the year, the world that they would accept that would accept that we can find out there is a way to live in a world word, that we can find a lot of a lot of full of plugeowned way to live.
where all the wisdom of all the poor can contribute to our collective prosperity.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some things from a book to which I hope will give you some other things you heard about it that you already heard that you already already in some of the case, where you have some connections to the rates.
I want to start with what I call """Min."
Dock's dying what?
The Dock's dying all of the Western societies.
And this doctrin's soil sounds like this: if we are interested in the good effort of our citizens, the way to do is to make is to maximize the level of individual freedom is to maximum
The reason for that is so freedom is that the good end, valuable to get good, which is essentially to be many, essentially to be human.
And because if people are free then people are free and make things that will make these things that will be able to decide whether or no one has to decide where we need to decide instead of making a choice.
The other thing to maximize the freedom is the maximizing choices.
With the more choices of choice, the more freedom of the way they have a more freedom of freedom of the more freedom of them.
This, I think, it's so good at the surface that we don't have to do anything to get through the headline.
And it's deep deep in our lives.
I'll give you some examples of what has done is to do for us for the last time in the last time.
This is a supermarket.
I mean, just want to say two words about his job.
175 slopes for the supermarket, that if we don't hate and the 10 different types of wood and the 10 different types of the hot and the 12 of whales that you can buy your own own houses that you can buy your own 175 to a very large number of people in a very large numbered that no store no store the store of the 175 that no store no store is the store of the strength of the bodis that you can buy the shock and the 175 different staff of the staff of the same types of the stages of the stunty.
So this is the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronic components to make your electronic components a stereo -- CD system, CD -- the housin the hometof, the mothers of the hometoph, and the remain and the required.
And in this room stores of electronic components are stereotypes stereo.
We can configuring out of the stereo systems that are in the components that are in the office of a single store.
You have to recognize that this means a lot of options.
In other domains -- in the world of communication.
It was a very soon as I was a kid, where you could get any kind of a phone-general phone-generated generating so much time was offered by Ma Bell.
TTwo the phone. Don't bought it.
By the way, one of the consequences of this was not the right phone.
And those days are a lot of the daying.
Now, we have a almost neling diversity of phones, especially in the world of mobile phones in the world of mobile phone.
These are the mostly mostly of the future.
My favorite is at the middle of the middle of the P3 player is from the nose of the nose of the nose of the nose of the sun as a fear of the fear of the middle of the wild.
And if you had never seen it in the stored, you can get out of the stories, because in the curve it.
And the result is that it makes people to get out of the stores and put this question.
And you know what the answer is the question?
The answer is "No." I don't think it's possible to buy a phone.
And in other domains of life that are much more important than bugs that are the number of options.
The health system -- in the United States is not the case you go to the doctor and you tell you what to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor and say, well, we have the various various and the variant's various and the variants.
It has these risks and these risks and these risks.
B has these risks and these risks and these risks. What do you want to do?
And you say, "Doctors -- what to do?" And the doctor has these advantage of these advantags and BBB, and the risks and the risks and the risks of these risks and the risks of this.
What do you want to do?
And you say "But if you were in my place you do?" And the doctor says, "But I don't know where you are not at your place is -- we say, "We say the patient is -- I say to a part.
But what is actually a transion, and the responsibility and choice of a choice that you know something -- in this case -- someone who don't know is almost certainly and it's almost certainly not in the best form of decisions -- in this case to take decision.
There's a huge level of public drugs for the drugs with reette to reach people like me and as I think of you, if you don't know a lot, it has no logic, because we can't buy them.
Why do we get to us to get the narratives that we can't be.
The answer is that the people who do this is waiting for us to call doctors in the morning, and to change our reets.
Something that is that our identity has become a problem a role of choice, and this transition has to look at this role of show this.
that we don't change a identity but we have the possibility of us to invest to invent it.
And we can reinvent ourselves to reinvent any of the fun we have the chef.
And that means that every day when you go to define you have to make you want to be able to be able to be able to be.
With all the respect for the marriage and family, there was a little bit of the people who were going to get you at the time that was that you have to get kids as soon as you can start to get kids as much as you start to get kids as much as you start to get kids as much as you get kids as quickly.
The only one was a dinner was with dinner, not when you do this.
In our days, we all is very removing.
I mean by by unintelligent students and give them 20 percent less than I was doing less than I was doing it at less than I do.
And this is not a little bit less than the desire would not because it would be less made.
What do you think they're concerned with all sorts of questions "should I get to marriage or not? I should do it?
I should be able to fall of you later to the kid, or a card?" All of these are questions that consumption of you?" All of you have to do is questions.
And they will answer to these questions, no matter if that means that doesn't mean not to do all of the toes that I give them all the way to the curve.
And that's also what you need to do. These are important questions that you need to answer them.
They are blessed -- we're blessed as the Carl and Carl with technology that allows us to work in every mind, every minimal in every day in the planet -- less than Hotel, at least at the Royal Randolph.
By the way, there's a core in a corner, which is not revealing at the wireless of the wireless of the wireless of the wireless of the soil.
I will tell you about it because I want to use it.
So that means that this incredible freedom to choose to choose to get to the work, it's that we need to take a decision, and you have to take a decision, and if we should, and if we should have to work with.
We can go to see how our football of our football and in a pocket in a pockrype and the Gyand the laptops, probably that on the genes.
And even though all there are all closed every mind, where the puts is how the pupy a football of the football of the time.
I should say at this email to write the skin of the letter?" And even if the answer is "no," it's sure that your experience is that the experience of the football will be very different from your brief will be very different from what it would be without them.
So anywhere in the world, and these things that are and the things that are the style of life, is a thing of options.
And the world I was living like this.
To say that, I had some choices to do it, but it was not a good thing.
And the world where we live here today.
And the question is, is good or bad?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what well about this, so I will talk about what I am about.
All these choices are all these choices effects on people.
And one of the effective way of paralyze, it's producing paralyzing.
With so many of the options that can choose to choose it is very difficult to opaque for something.
I offer you a very significant example of a very significant investment in the private investments in the private plans of the private plans.
A colleague was at the time of investment in Valley of Valley company that has almost a million of mutual companies that has almost 2,000 sees and almost 2,000 sees and almost 2,000 sedies.
And what he found is that for every 10 foundations that give the employees of the employees of participants in the participants with two percent.
You have 50 percent of the mutual founding 10 percent of the people are getting less than if you have to give you only a fifth of why?
Because with 50 mutual foundations of the way to choose you to choose you to choose what you want to choose what you want to choose and you on the hands.
And then on the pop and then the hot and the hot and the hot and the end, all the way on the road, and of course, it never ever ever ever see.
You know, you know that it doesn't just mean that those people will consume the food for dogs after the fishing is because they don't have enough money to put a decision, that means that the ability is so hard to make a decision-making is so hard to make sure that the sum of compensation that would give the employees of the comman.
I was like, I would give up with the bottom of 5,000 dollars a year from the employees of the employees of compensate compensation of compensation compensation of compensation to the footprint.
So the credit is a consequence when you have too many choices of one of the option.
And I think that does that make the world look like this.
You really want to take the best if it's for all the ethernity, isn't it?
You don't want to choose the fast investment or no even the wrong thing to win the wrong way to win the wrong way to win the room.
So this is a effect. And this is that we can actually get to the strength of the strength of the choice as we were going to be able to enter the election than we are if we had a little choice.
And there are some reasons for this.
And one of them is that we had a fat a fallen for the snowy to choose if you just just -- and you know, is not -- and you know, is perfect?
It's easy to imagine that you would have been able to imagine that you could have been a better choice. And what happens is that alternate is that alternate to regret your choice that you did and these regret regret and these regret face, and these regret decisions that had something good.
The more option of the option, the more is to regret something that is disappointed to the option that you have otherwise you had.
Secondly, what economists call the opportunity to do is an opportunity.
Dan Gilber proved that in this morning, in this morning, we are talking about how we can see things that we compare to what we compare
Well, when I am a lot of alternative alternative to consider the easy thing to think about the characteristics of the attack of alternative alternative to be less satisfied by alternatives that you have a little bit of alternatives that you have otherwise you who would have otherwise you had.
Here's an example. I ask for the people who are not New York City.
But here's how we should be able to reasons.
We have this box from Hampons.
A very expensive owned ow.
It goes a superbit. They have a wonderful day -- they have the same thing.
What could they want to want more. Well, at the drack, "It's a guy.
All of my neighborhood in Manhattan is leading to the box.
I could park it in front of the office." And I spent two weeks in the idea that rats the rate of the idea that wonderful parking parking parking parking parking parking parking parking for a place to do a place of parking parking thing.
The food strength of the satisfaction that we have on the election of choices right right now.
And the more option of the most options are going to do in the attack of these options will be perceived as we would be perceived as we would be perceived for opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon tells a lot of things.
It tells us that we should live in the misses, and probably we should do things slow.
But one of the things that tells is that anyone who is a choice to make other things.
And all other things can have a lot of things that are going to have a lot of the factory is going to do what you do you do is less attractive.
Third to the third of the expectation of expectations.
That was when I wanted to replace when I wanted to replace my bluegies.
They are almost all the time.
And there was a time that the boy was a single same as you bought and you buy them as you wear and they were incredibly unable to get incredibly uncomfortable and if you boost them would start to stand widely stunning them better.
So I went to replace my blah after I had gotten a lot of good years and I said, "Look, I want a blue of blug, "You want to be straight and the window's going, saying, "You want to be smiling in the wrong life?
Do you want to be with farming? Do you want to prepared or your hair?
Do you want to be able to do this?
You want to eventually eventually want to be --
He painted my face after I said, "I want to say to be the guardless of the guy who were the only one guy who was no idea that I spent a blue that I spent a blue of the walls of the wild of the shot of the steps of the stocking.
I have a better better better than these options have been able to choose better.
But I was feeling worse.
Why? I wrote a book that I tried to explain this.
The reason I felt worse worse is that I had all these options available to me to the expectations about how I should be a wall of these good people have grown up to the grandmothers have grown up.
I had very sweats that had no expectation of the same wave when they were a single sample ways.
Now when they're 100 times, my mother was to be perfect.
And what I got to get was good, but not perfect.
So I compared what I was expected with what I expected is that I was dealing with what I was dealing with what I hope.
The option of options in the lives of people can't do something else.
And the way that will take that into the less satisfaction is even if they get good results.
Nobody in marketing world doesn't know this.
Because if you know, you don't know, you don't have an idea of what I talk about.
The real thing is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was a better when it was a bad thing that was really bad when they were able to experimenter in fact that people to experimently.
Today in the day that we live -- but we live -- but we are in industrialized and we expect the best thing to expect -- the best thing to think about how good things will be so good to be that things will be so good at all.
You never never have a surprised because your expectations and my expands, and my own expanding.
The secret of happiness -- this is all of you -- the secret to happiness is to have expanding expectance.
I mean, just want to say -- just a quick moment -- that I actually have a wonderful thing, and it's really a wonderful goal and it's really to the right right now.
I couldn't find something better than I could have been something better at all. I didn't get something.
But you look at your house is so bad at this kind of bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of a bubble wall you can't get good when you can't buy a single one as you can't just just just as you can't ask you why you can't ask why you guys why you don't ask why is that they are.
The world is coming out. What was we could do it?
When are hundreds of different stars of different split of different sets and somehow you disappoints you and ask you whenever you ask you what?
It's just as a clear that the answer to the question: I mean, you know?
You could have been able to choose better choice.
With a hundred different kinds of things that you don't have any excuse no scale.
So when people take decisions, even if people take choices are good to choose are good to make sure that they are good disappointed by them, they are required.
The desire erupt in the industrialized world in the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not the only important -- but important to this erupper erupon the erupper error of synthetic and also is that people are too high as the standards are too high to the standards are too high to the standards are too high to the rest --
And when they have to explain these experiences I think they are coming out of it.
So the general result is that we use it better and we feel better.
So let me remind you remind you of it.
This is the doctriny, that all of us believe that we all believe that is really true.
Without that you have a couple of choices is better than near near that many choices are better than a few choices are better than a few choices are better than a few people are better than a few choices of you.
There's a magical. I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty sure that we went from that point that I was going to make our life improvement of life.
Now, the idea -- almost ended -- the idea of red, the thing you think about it.
And what it allows these industries in the industrialized civil society is the good enemy.
There's a lot of places in the world and we heard of some of them is that they have too much choice.
The problem is that they have too puzzle.
So the thing about talking about is a strange problem of Western societies and rich societies.
And what is frustrating is this: Steve Levitt talked about how these chair chair of galls for kids as well as installed as well as installed as well.
What I'm saying is that these options, expensive and complicated not only held to not only help you know.
They actually have a pain pain of painting.
They really do worry about worse.
If something that allows us to do that in our society to make all the choices that we do all have been doing too puts in the society that people have too few choices not only to improve the amoral lives.
This is what the economy is what the principle of Pareto.
The desire will make us better be to be better people -- not just poor -- because of the way that exist in the way that exist exist in the way that we are sick.
In conclusion. They assume that you read this cartoon and being a sophisticated person you can say, "Wo! What do you know is the cave?
You know nothing in this account of the rate of the wave of the world -- so I read it out and I read it and I read it and I read it and I read it and I read it in the first time.
But the more I thought about it was so to hit the same way I was to think about it.
Because the real thing is that if you hope that everything to be possible, because you don't have a lot more freedom of freedom of it.
If you hope that everything is possible, that everything is possible, that everything is possible.
You believe that the credit and score at all.
Anyone needs a variety of the active accounting.
This is almost certainly too limited -- probably even for a cave, to certainly suffering for us.
But the absence of a metaphor is a network for unhappy and unfortunately, disaster.
Thank you very much.
