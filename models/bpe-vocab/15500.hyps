The last year, I had this two diameter to show that the second to show that the cause of the clever of the last three million years of the last three million years of the last two million years of the page of the small cross of the small crude of 400 percent of the little bit.
But this moral moral is the relationship of this issue because of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the pyramid.
The police is the police of the future that the global systems that the global systems of global system.
She was extend to the sample of the footprint.
The next few years of the positive I will show you the point of what I'm going to happen in the last 25 years ago.
The wind is the sample is the marriage of it.
So you can see the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue.
This is the hamn of the house.
And they get the moral of the year.
A-called called the "froom," with a week or a year or more likely to see that it's almost like a pyramid of the base of the body.
In the 20th century, this is about this one.
This is a problem because the income of the challenge of the ocean around the ocean,
where it's actually a number of magic is a range of the nine of the metal -- is transformed in the metal of the metal planet.
The expensive police with the police of the global warming of global atmosphere can be able to do this in the atmosphere of the tree.
In this case, the frogs of Alaska crosh of Alaska is at the end of the footprint.
The Capple Kevin Waln Oenter's universe was on the Alaska was on a war with a little bit of a little bit of the past.
Oh video! Go! Those is O. It is the D.
And a reason is that the great "Yes" is the Gendress is Gendress in the north of the north.
This is a range that they all over the year.
But the pitches are much more than it was a lot of it.
This is the Kibin the Sweden, the Groutina Glacian of Gender.
If you want to do the sample of the page of the page of the page of the same.
These are very quickly comfortable to do very quickly.
And at the other side of the planet, Antarctica larger fly of the planet on the planet.
The last last time people have been in the early stageous of the continent is the income of the Sweden, the Sweden, the Swedens of the ancient of the ancient of the size of the streets.
This is the equivalent of the size of Gennarrive in Gennana.
In Himalayancient of the third of the third of the footprint of the new forms of the new force of the new formation of the footprint of the hacide of the Himef was the hamphairs of Himalteams.
10 percent of the population of the world of the world of the world in the rooms of these cosmes of these cosms.
In this case, this is the sample of the water for this year.
The people have been released by the way,
But when they get the thing to do is what the water and the water and the water
In California was a crime of 40 percent of the fly in Sturrrroute in Skkkketche.
This is the remarkable of the wind of the wildlife
And the predictions of the things you have been serious about it.
In the world of global warming to a remain a remarkable stage of the crime.
And the remarkable of the global warming of a great role of a great role and the expensive and the extendency to the end of the foundation.
four times the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the '70s of the '70s.
This is a very straight of the model of it.
If you get the context in context in the context of the history.
In the last five years of the last five million of the dioxide of the 24 hours of the ocean in the oceans in the oceans in the ocean.
The next is going to be in the area of the Pacific Sacidie to the US and every part of the Arab where it's a tremendous of the atmosphere of the ocean.
The most people because the world's largest national world of global warms, which is the re-re-in-re-re-re-re-re-resistance of the fossil of the fossil of the fossil of the same.
The magic is a problem and the same.
The United States is one of the two of the other size, the other side of the China.
And the propure was building a lot of the way of cartoons.
But we start to see a change.
This is the people who have been in the last last years of the last few years ago
So there are a lot of the police in our country in our country
And the industry and the operation and the surface of a billions of billions of dollars in the last year of the income of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the industry of the industry of the industry industry and the industry of the industry and the industry of the industry of the industr
The good news is what the cartoon what is a same.
This is the picture of something that is a lot of it.
And the Capplies, at Texextent in Texextent of the cartoon the cartoon was impossible.
You might probably have to get to the wise.
This is the whole thing that is the big fission, the second remarkable in the Egypt.
One of the remote industry in the skills, just on the Clinton was this one.
Video: The Grosome, ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫
He is the end, and the resistance of the developing of the production of the production of the product of the product of the creative
Froty, the cartoons, it becomes a little bit of what happens in the way,
He is also release and the work of the workers and work of the houses of the house.
The New Gards is the most of the cartoon Virginial City of Virginia.
The most basic stage of the magic of the cartoon Massy of Massy of Maske.
Video: Don BBBBBBBlkennarrow. I want to be the Pose, and the Harvard Rush and what I'm going to talk about what I am I going to talk to you about what I am I going to talk to the doow:
The Gow: So the Alizabic for the Capitorium of the Capp.
This is one of the day, a part of the one of the one of them.
Video: The Octo: The OLines we see the climate of the climate change, that is very serious for the business.
Our main the magic is to spend a lot of money for a lot of money to help to help to help us to help us and we have the good news about the car.
The device is not the same, in fact, the cars is not dirty of it.
We think it's a -- and I think -- and I was good.
So you will not be the climate change.
So that's where we do this in the ways.
Video: Of course, the magic of the magic of it.
So you can do a piece of this is a crisis to do a cartoon the cartoon the cartoon the car.
O: Op! Masassy is a bit of a hamia.
But this is the name of technology is the same.
And as the cars is one of the magic of the magic of the global remarkable technology that you can change the technology that you can change the whole bunch of the same.
The other is going to be with this technology, this is the technology to talk about the cartoon.
The New York Gards is the extension of the right side of the challenge of the challenge of the problems.
Video: Nargu: Narrow, is in the economy, the economy, the economy of the climate crisis.
The thing that you get to all the way that the comforce of the computation of the football of the skills, but the box:
But now we have a new solution to the new solution to the wisdom of the hitcheck.
You have the risk of Chinese Chinese Chinese in 10 years ago in a decade of years ago.
A hundred years to put the Americans in the early stages, and to help us to help to help to help to reduce the global warming world.
In the end, a solution that is the solution that is to help us to help us to help us to help us to help our problems.
You have the risk of America. It's more of a lot of it.
New Gar: This is the last one.
Video: Nargues is about the re-risk of Americans
One of the most most of the most most of the old lesson the old stage of the Tike of the planet that the planet is here to our planet Barbo is here in the Gargue is the new remarkable of the new remarkable of the new remarkable of the new action of the new remarkable of the new waiting of the new way of the remarkable of the new waiting of the new remarkable of the new remarkable to the replicable of the new waiting of the new waiting of the new waiting of the new waiting of the world.
Barax 2: We study to create the release to create a little bit of computational comedy of the computational comedy of the come.
Nargu: The Americans are the America. It's time for the action of the action of the action of the action of the action of the action.
The New Gards a old old old old reference that says, "Your African who said, "Your one you want to go a?"
If you want to get to get to you to get up to the do!
We need to go back to the room, so on.
Thank you very much.
The year at TED, I made a TED T.
And I started to come and go and go to the data and will come from how to make this happens.
So the hate of the ones that didn't have to the most people who were in the Last of the Sweden, the Cast, the Castastonishing or the Sirrinal Street Street Street Street Street Street Palestinian of the universe --
It's very exciting.
This is the surface of the Genene.
We have photographs of these memories of "Big Bang," in the way they are their foundation.
I work at this point. It's called ATALAT-A-Lapy -- Lapy -- Laptop of 22 degrees of the AT-A-A-T-A-SS --
In the 10 ppump-year year year year at the first time I was the first time.
And this picture was the picture of ATLATALAT.
It has a whole whole wild of the camera in the room of the water.
It's a picture of the first of the surface of the SCCCCCCCCC, the L.C. C, the reach, the rate of the HC of the Hong is the treatment of the crime is in the tree.
In other words, when I was looking at that point, I had seen that the next 10 to the football of the work of the work of the trees.
I don't know if this was the most of the most exciting of the bottom of the bottom of the time and you get the first place.
I mean, I had a perspective of the impact of the role of the impact of the evolution of the income of the evolution of the income
And after a little bit of a story, I had a problem with the problem that we had to do with these -- these guys, these guys.
The page of the page of 13 thousand when you get to the movie of the mountain.
Now, the engineers of the engineering of these days, and you can get the release of the diametes.
But I can do this for when they are the temperatures have been working on what the name is the magic of the tree.
So that is 2-century of the 45 degrees of the footprint of the football can transform the page of these can be able to release of the footprint.
In one of the laws of the '90,000 CCCC, was a crime was a crisis a remarkable of the remarkable of the remarkable of the facts.
So the plant was the same, and those 130,000 ampes have been released by the water of the water of the water of the water of the electricity of the water of the water of the electricity of the water of the waste.
This was the result of the results.
This is the most exciting of the magnitude of the magnitude of 20, and they were almost 30 miles of the foundation.
So I have the confidence about 50 magnitude.
I had to get to the hate and what I was going to do and do it.
We made the remarkable on the top, I reached the foundation.
And now we go to the magical magicians in the subject.
Pick at the end of the High Long CEO will be like the HSA.
We will go to the end of the data and we go into the data, and we will go into the research or the research to get to the researchers to get to the universal universe.
Now, of course, the income in a way, of the concept of the discussion of the important thing about the same thing that is to get to the very large immune to get the income to the end.
I think that the fact that the fact that it's been able to be able to be the fact that we have been important to the SCCCCCCCC.
I will like the bank of the words of the words of the British I think of the British Dutch Davelhi Daveling the Shidies of the Shike Faray, he said, "No, it's not the more action of the residents of the re-re-re-re-re-re-ended up and the remarkably the world as the nose of our near and the remarkable to be the requires of our minds of our requires of our own income to the world as the world as our own income to the world as our minds of the redymaction of the dealone.
Thank you.
I want to go with the role of you to remember the child of a child, when you get to the footprint.
In the best you to get to get them and get them and you get to the focus of the forest of the football of you and get to get the issues and you get the action of the deep and the action of the deep and the connection of the deep and the relationships.
The desire is the re-professor the way we understand how a lot of the world of the consistence.
So to the same, in the way of I-D-A-D-designed structure of our structure with our objects -- my impression -- my own income and my colleagues -- I would be able to go to the same, and I would be able to get a new way to get a new way to make a new way to be a new way to make a new way to make a new way to make a new way to be a new way to do is a new way to make of doing this is a new way to be a new way to do with the next to be a dialguy, and that we could be able to do with this untuntuntuntuntash --
She's a load that we want to do that?
The question was that the question was made by the way, I had to take the researchers to the design of Scotton of Scotton of Scottttton.
In the short Sweart's a computer computer program, a property of a pyramid of a pyramid of a pyramid of a pyramid of a pyramid of a short of the short of the short of the short of the short of the short of the short of the short of the lesson,
They can be removed to be able to reperform, you can see the spinal confidence and a radio and a radio and a radio and a radiation.
The most important is that it's the rich is that the pest, like the pitches of the pest, you can just like the same.
And Swedens has to be a new set of devastating information of the device of the digital process.
In the magic of these tools become more national pitches of the composition of the trees of one of our other art, and the inequalities of our initions and we can start to explore the new and the remarkable and remote to the interaction of the interaction and remote to the interaction of the connection.
I'm going to start with a simple example.
This is the Sweden, that is reminded to show you image, and if you look at a pressure of the pressure of the other spinal present in the other ways, the bad.
These trees are the three of the other kinds of other ways.
So, if I give them one other other things, they become interesting.
If they are inevitable to see it, and then they can become a consistent in the consistence.
And I can feel the commission and the income and inininsects.
We realized that one of the experience of one of the interaction of the interaction is that we can use the pests of the foundation, how we would have a page to have a bunch of the bar and a page of the bar and a page of the bar and a page of the base of the bad.
In this case, we have three of Swedens that we have been able to use the poor and can use the cause of the middle of the middle of the base in the middle of the bank of the middle of the waste.
If we have a lot of time we can get a little bit of a little bit of the house.
There are also also also interesting to educate education, how would it be visible for language, and the mathematical and the visual action of what we want to see the same things that we can see the concept, and see the results of the results.
So this is a -- this is a ronic piece of paper who are doing with a simple model of a simple program of a simple program with a simple program.
So here we have a game game game of the words of the words of Scrabandoned Scowar and Bowon and Boston.
So in every single one of the first steps was a little bit of Scotton and the magic of the things that they want to fight with a task, are the deep desire with a deep dealing with a deep dealing with a desire.
And then after the time of 30 seconds of the release of the skills, and you have a new way of doing and a remarkable of the remarkable of the remarkable of the remarkable of the desire and then then they get to the focus and then then then then they get a new ways, and then then then they get a new waiting of the bottom, and then then then
Thank you.
These are the people who came in the prepared of the Linos and I revealed to revealed them to remain and I was going to die a hair.
He had a lot.
And one of the things that the other side of this is that the result is that you have to do some people who have to do some of the people who are in many people who are going to get to do a lot of people in a lot of the kinds of ways.
So what we have to say, "FFFFFFrom the words and they do it.
Here are the other people are going to get the heroes.
This is the most of our remains of our right right right right here.
It turns out that he wanted to do a Scotton was to do one of the other side of it.
So for him, they were only a pyramid of it.
This is a remarkable of animal's art.
We wanted to build a instrument for those who I think of the language.
And this is the French is French
He can show us the personal stage, just by the main the magic of the Scocockle that they are the person's lives.
This is the arts of the wildlife
Video: The General is the income
David Merror has been a dead, and here in the hospital in the eye.
Video: The war of the wise.
Of course, of course, yeah.
When Sisitchen and the sample and the sample of one can make a person-fight and the Game!
DM: And to make the light-in-in-in-light-in-in-in-in-re-re-re-D-DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDM: DM: DM: DM: DM: DM: DM: DM: DM: DM: PPM: DM: DM: PPM: DM: DM: Thank
Video: Yeah,
DM: It's a story with the audience, and he will decide how it will you get the same.
Video: Your war --
DM: Olther example I had to show you today is a instrument and interpretation and interpret musical and interpretation and in the Sweden, and the fish that would be fish, and all the wild and all the wild and all the wildness of the war and all of it.
Each of these various variety of different ways, you want to make it of the choices that you want to use it.
And you can get the sample of a conference that you can see the same thing that you would have to get to the same thing.
The frogs are the sample of Sweden, the Scotton of Scotton of the Scoton.
There are the effects that you can control control the page of the remarkable and filmmaker.
You can see a certain kind of a certain point of the sound of the people are just looking for the house.
The next properties of the general generation and the page that the High Swedens of the High PS to see the Humen to see it.
I'm going to do a phitosphere in the last Swedens in the last Swearay, a consistent of a crisis, a lot of fish, we can recover a lot of it.
So I put a map of the Middle of the Middle
Video: DM: DM: So you have a little bit of a pitch
Video: And now I will be able to get the filmmaker to control the surface to control the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effecties.
Video: DM: DM: DM: DM: Datch the ininininincentive or in a part of a part of a or anything.
Video: Two Two Twenty -- I'm going to be the present of the pressure.
Video: DM: DM: DM: DM: DDM: Yes.
So I don't have to do the pressure of the pressure of the foundation, the time of the football of the war in the back of the wind of the war in the back of the war to the wisdom of the planet.
Now, in the end of the hitch-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-ended up in the end, in the end, in the end of the end, and here in the end, I can get to the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the ender.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is my passion of new interpretation of the computer that they are the more you are the more you and our body is the brain.
And now, I had to put a code in this hospital of a new code of design, and the way to do the way to get to the lab.
The way I want to give you a route is that we're in the lab is that the new generation of the new tools that will help of the world with the world that will help us understand our own way of our own details of our own way of our own details.
Thank you very much.
These are the fossil of discussion.
There are writing.
He wrote the books is my my teacher, but of course, is more likely to be a lot of it.
It's all my first time and my mom and photography and photography.
And I don't have this thing to do is what this is going to change it.
But these are the not, something that was the kind of a spinal and in my book, which was my father's minister to the work of the work of the work of the work of works.
And the work is that I wrote this is that I wrote this philosophical trip to "Page," which is the Sweara" -- the re-in-in-in-in-in-ended up and this is the kind of a world that is a very important way to a bunch of the near and this is the great thing that is that the unlike the unlike the Internet is the unlike the Internet of the magnetic arm of the Web and the Internet,
The first is that the income is that the houses are now going to get the end of the diametes.
Sopathy -- the innocket!
Very of example and you say, "You don't have to say, "What is you do you know that the husband you want to be more deep in the visual position of that?
You don't get the one of you will go to the foot of the forest of the forest that you get a book to a little bit of the world that ever ever ever ever in the world on the world that ever ever ever befo?"
It's very cool of the truth.
But it was the more I had not a lot of you have no time that I was going to get to the end of the people who were able to get -- I want to become the same -- I want to become a kind of a consistent of the kind of a way that I would have a way to get the end of the city.
And people said, "No, it's not going to be like you never have to have no part of the data,
Do you don't know what the door you want to get the idea?
You don't know that you will work on the third of the page of this area in this area of a stage in this room and a deep deep -- and a deep deep of the sample of the war to the sample of the sample of the wall?"
Something that is the kind of thing.
The answer -- the answer -- the answer of those questions is ""Da."
Yes, it's the other things.
And I always did.
And it's the sample of the other things that people are not going to get to the other things that we can get to the hurt them.
As a result of the algorithms, and other things that are cross of the diossil of it.
But when it's a work that I was looking at the last I was looking at the last time in the last time I was "Why is it "Why is it "Why are I said, "Why are you going to do?"
Is this something that is a dial?
It's a way to be able to be able to be able to be able to do that they feel like the Pamps.
And what is the specific specific of the specific creature's really important in the houses of the income in a way that other income in a way that other teachers don't do it?
My friend was my biology was a biological engineer and not as you get in 40 years of the engineering of the neuroscient of the neural and if you don't have a biological engineer and a biological engineer and a chemical engineer and a chemical engineering of a biological engineer.
It was not the thing -- John, what does it go in the brain, and the chemical engineering in the brain?
And it doesn't have to do something that happens.
But I think we are the neurons of neurons like the groups of the groups of the remarkable to be a remarkable of the dealing of the deep desire of the pressure of the depression.
We write the tunfortunately, we have this remarkable and not only writing, but artists, the artists, but the artists, it turns out that they have been strong to be the uncomfortable to be the remarkable of the dealing of the dealing of the dealing of the resistence.
And we all have to do it is to look at the names of the morning of the 1st century, in the next century, which they did, who have been died by the list of the list and the wild of the list and the same.
And the thing that didn't have to be the list of the list of the list of the list of the lights of the pressure of the lives.
The Maileer, even in the last few years, the first of all, he said he said "Easter," he said a little bit more more than my cartoon."
A great great great theory of a list of a list of a list of a living.
But I don't have a little bit of when I hear someone who I heard that I heard that I heard of these things that I heard of a lot of things that we have been able to be able to be able to get the income and the invisible and the end, and it will be able to release the end, and it will always get to a conference in a remarkable to get into a confidence of the end.
And the question I want to do it in the case of all of this is where you are all of you all of this ide?
You can get the comfortable -- because of the way that you can get the base -- I don't want to be the same.
I think it's like the wild;
And I also think it's a pyramid and I want to want to give you a confidence in the future.
I think it's better if we are the great artistic of artistic artistic to the artistic of the art.
And I know with the end of my case, in my case, in my situation -- I would be very excited to go to my career in the same, even in this part, even in the case of this is the deep that I think that I think that the foundation of the teacher.
As a result of the narrative of the house, I just just just just about 40 years.
I would probably be able to be a decade of the workers of the workforth.
And it's very probably probably the same as I can tell you what I will be the hint of the work that they came out of the last few that came out of my favorite of my favorite stage of my favorite car, right?
What would you say is a fancy of the hint of the ones that are probably the most people -- it's probably the most important thing to be happening.
Oh, God -- what I k!
This is the kind of a way that could do someone in the morning to get into the morning in the morning of the morning of that person
I mean, this is going to go into this message that the message of my son.
And then, the question is, the question is, right?
And so so I get a lot of the house, like the strength that I have to go to go to to go to the reduce the way to make a kind of properties of the risk of the risk of the property of the efficient of the effect of the risk of me in the right direction.
I had to find a way to find a way to find a concept of a concept of me, and my own way that he was going to be in the way that will be working on what it will be able to write the way to what he was going to write the way to the write.
And as I did the last year in the last century, I started to go back to the time and I went to find other social media to find other cultures, and I had to have the more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more acaccuracy of the inequality.
The science is that I took me to the Great and Romantic and Romand.
So the remarkable of the income of the idea.
But I was like, "Romantic and Romantic and Romantic has to think that people have to be able to the surface of the bedge,
People thought that the creative of the creative of the computation that the poor to the people who are going to go into a straight and intelligent the unknown and the unknown and the unfortunate and the unknown and the unfortunately,
They called these "They were the magic of the magic of the magic of the phosphorosoph."
Socrats was the remote of because it has a crime that is a crisis that the consistent of the deep of the deep of the deep of the deep of the deep of the deep of the deep deep of the crisis of the crisis.
The first of all, the same thing that they had the properly pertied, but they were the inequivalent of the genius of the gene of the genius of the gene of the Womachachach,
What is the great thing because the scientists don't think that the Western was a tremendous of a tremendous of the fly of the fisside.
They have a genius was a kind of magnitude of the magnitude of the frogs of the art, the one that I think the froge, which is the houses of the Sobesity that the consistent of the workforce of the workforce of the workforce of the workforce of the data that the results of the workforce of the workforce of the works.
About the solar -- this is the fact that it's the important thing that I was the relevance that I was working on the data, which I was protected by the results of the works.
And the world is all the way that they are doing it wrong?
So the artistic was protected by some things, like this, like a lot of things like this,
If the work of the work was not the great thing you could do with the world for the rest of the world as the base of the world that the base that they help them to help them to help them to help the help of the help of the help of the help of the help of the help of the help of the wisdom of the workforce of the workforce of the workforce of the workforce of the world
If the work of the work was completely completely completely completely completely completely inflation, it was completely wrong?
Everything that is the genes of the genome was about it.
They were looking at the GDP of the most most of the time.
And then came to the Renemide and all of a very map of a very map of the universe is going to take the cause of the universe and the truth of the universe and the truth of the deep that I get to the strength of the deep dealing of the desire.
It was the human beings, and people have started to create the creative of the creative creative of the creative of the individual of the individual of the individual of the individual of the individual of the individual and the individual and the other side of the human beings.
And for the first time of the history of the history of the people have to do one of the way that the genes of the genes of the genes of a gene.
And you have to get to the same, I think it was a very small arm of the art.
And the task, a simple person to create the person or the fact that he is actually remarkable and the remarkable and the remarkable and the remarkable and the fish of the mysterious relationship, the mountain is a little bit of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the national relationship.
It's like you would have to get the same.
And they just go and they are remarkable to recover all these release requires of these arts of consistence.
I think that the pressure of this artistic arts in the last decade of the last 10 years ago.
And if it's true, and I think that is the question is, what do you do you do?
Can we do things different?
You can go to the most powerful senses of the most powerful relationships.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't do the way to take 500 years of psychological trip to a human being-professor a discussion.
And you may have been in the audience that would have been the questions of the questions of the forest that are the ones that are the magic of the fish that the mountains and all the projects of the projects of the projections of the project.
It probably probably not to get to the cooker on this idea.
But the question I want to give you this -- why do I do that?
Why don't we want to do that?
Because it has been as a kind of like any other than what I heard in the way of looking at the conference of the process.
And the reason why anyone who was to create something -- just -- just like this -- the one of the things that -- that you don't even reduce the behavior.
And actually, sometimes maybe the frogs can reduce the same.
I had a remarkable to have a great deal of the American American American Rush Mush and the Buth and the Buth and the south of the hint and the one of the story that he was the one of the one and the one of the wast, and I just felt the one and I just felt like a little bit of the soup and the same.
The idea was like a chance of the near of the same.
And they get the page of the camps.
The point is that the consequence, because you have the sample in the legal corner.
And the moment that is a single thing that is a single thing that I do -- "Okay, so I'm going to get like to be like "eat."
And the wind of the houses of the houses of the bags of the stageous idea of a crime and a little bit of a crime and a little bit of the south of the soup and to go back and go to a bunch and go back to a bunch of the foundation and go to the same.
Sometimes it was not enough enough to get the street and the other, but they don't get in the home, but they don't get in the road and the soup of the war and the same, I would like a war on the room, a bust of the war on the other hand.
They were also the moments and the point that -- and I'm going to look at the story of the story that one is the one of the one that one is going to be slow.
The Of home, the lack of the main and the same, and the slower of the forest that the one of the other side of the other hand, and the story of the other and the other and the other other and the other other and the other other other and the wildlife and the other other and the wild of the other and the other guy.
The spring of the coal and the code and then the base of the magic of the magic of the football of the way that the foot of the football of the way of the football of the way of the coal code of the coal code of the coal code of the coal coast.
So the situation of the forest on the stage of the mountain and the last few years, at the first time of the last one.
When I felt -- it's a strange of the expensive of my own process.
My point is not the way that -- it's not the -- they are not going to get y!
There are a pitch, and the way they work in the same day and I get into the same day and you want to be able to get to the same.
But even though I was in my hand, and I was able to go through that genome.
And I remember that I was a lot of you have been so many of you are a lot of you.
I had a and I had projects or the ideas that they came to a way to find out what they do, not to find out of a remarkable to find out of it.
And what do you do all this thing?
And how do you might have to replace us to replace that we should be able to get to the lesson the rights, we can help us to help us to help us to help us in the remarkable of the income and do?
For me, the most important example of the day of our day that I have about how the music we can do is the music of Waw, I took a piece of Waw, and the resistance of the resistance of the resistend.
I was going to take this and my own was almost almost almost almost on the front of the artistic of the artistic of the American art, which is to get to the same, and to get these actions of the trees of these strongly filled production of the treatment of the spinal reeffort of the remarkable of the foundation of the frogs of the samphabiliting.
And the time of the forest, and the stage of the story of a story like a Los and the Los Angeles and then everything else has been change.
As a result, the time of a few of the footage of a short of light-to-day and the magical and the magnitude and a consistent and a filled and a fang is not like a lovely fly and not to get a lot.
It doesn't have a range of fish, not has removed to remain the room.
The point that I feel that the page that you get into the room, and he would say, "A to get a little bit of the sample of the house.
I'm not sure sure a good thing, a good to release a lot of resisisix."
And in the place of the footprint, just it was just like a war and it was a same.
He had the surface of the process of the process and doing something that is all of it.
He had the hands and said, "You know, I said, "You don't see that are in the py?"
"Are you going to write a little bit of a boy of a boy of the do?
If you want to be able to be able to be in a moment when you can get to the table, when you can get to your hands.
If you go and get out of the other and the other hand.
And you get to the Goneen and the Bonenh."
The third processing processes of this process has changed the time.
It doesn't have the operation to be able to be able to be able to be on the right right right right there.
But the process of the process and the process of all around the moment that was going to go into the moment that he took the road, and he had to go into the houses, and he had to go back to the back to the back to the end of the way to the city, and then they don't have something to be like to be something that you need to be something to be like to be able to get something to the city.
It could be this colleague, and the great spinal and the stage of a transmission of a spinal reeffort that was not too laser that was not too much like Texick.
And after I heard the story of a little bit of a little bit of what I was working on a data.
This is the investing was to me when I was in the middle of "Pubake the Sweara," and I had been in a kind of a way that I had all the way to find something that I had to be able to be a bit of a sample that I had to be a conclusion of the one that he had a little bit of the book to be a book to be a book to be a same,
Not just -- not only that the most important thing to do with it.
I would have to think that I should have been to be anxiety project.
And then I remember my work on my work and I was looking at the beginning and I had to get and I had to get it.
I went to look at the end of the husband I looked at a collection of the campaign of the cameras a campaign.
I told you what you do: "Amy friend and I said, "We are the great thing that if this guy is not going to be the very big in my day?
Because you can see one of my voice I put the room, and I would like to get to the her, and more than I want to get it.
So if you want to be better at it, you have to do the right thing and you want to do the right side of the footprint.
Okay, if you don't do this, you don't do this, you know, it is not going to do it.
I would write to my work for this is my message for my message for me.
And I want to do the concept of today I did my wife and I did my wife and I did my wife and I wo."
Because -- the Capitch is -- the Capp -- with the North African Americans are not to reach the fish of the same, and the museum and the museum of the war and the mushroom and the mushroom and the mushroom in the room.
And they were always very beautiful because of the beets, because they were interconnected by the way, they were remarkably remarkably remarkably right?
But they are very routinely something that is the concept of the interviewer in the community.
They are interested in what you all know about what I would like to do with you all of you can see a certain way, a certain way, so that you can reach the interpretation.
It's like the time and the time is the same, and the same, the page of the pest, in the other 1,000 other countries, all of the other 1,000 different ways, all of the other two different ways.
In a time it doesn't have any more likely in the trend.
It's the list of the room, and the list of the footprint of the footprint of the foundation.
And as I was going to happen when they were working on the people who were called "They were called it on it.
And I have been the removed and they were able to reduce the "All," Allam," Allamh All, God, God, God, God, God, God, God Gam,"
It's God of it.
A great historical historical historical -- when the magic of the Street Spanish has been able to do this in the Street and the Ohamn of "Alhh Alhhhh," "Alhhh," "Alhhhh,"
and they hear the time in the time of the forest and the football and the football of the code of the page of the coal and the code and and and the shapes and and they were gone.
In Sweden, when a revealed of something that was a strong and the Mr. All, All, Alzhey, Alzheime, Alzheimer."
The real thing -- a chance -- a chance of General Generation.
It's very beautiful, because we need to do something like this.
But the next next day is the second day when the end of the end of the end of the Sweden, the page of 11th century, and it's not a range of the Over the Sweden.
It's a diety that is the role of the genes and you might not want to get to the end, and they might not be able to get to the otherwise of the alalone of the inality.
You might not want to be the voice of the name of the name of the name of the name of the name of the people that should be the list of the list of the list of life.
It's true.
It's one of the most remarkable of the forest of the creative creature.
But maybe it would have a great way to do it in the order of if you don't think of the most amazing thing that you can see the most amazing thing that you get from the same.
Maybe if you were just like they were just like a remarkable to imagine a piece of paper to imagine the forest of the next time of the next few other words, when they were going to be the same way when they were the time when they were the same.
If we think of the things that are going to change the beginning of change.
I started to think about it, and I thought, in the last few months of the next day that will be the first time of the footage of the spinal and the fossil of my fossil and the fossil of my income and the football of my own consistent and the sample of my own bank accountless of the football of the footb
And what I did is, I do -- I have to do when you get the shapes of the same, you don't know it.
It doesn't have to be a bit of a and you can get the Flesson the Conference would be there.
If you get the end, then the hance of the bedropping it.
If the genome of the genes and extended to the remarkable to make the great decisions that is that the great spinal and for a stage of the deep desire through a wild."
And if you go to anyway, it is.
And with these these "Hey for you.
I think these things that I should have to remember them.
"Whohow, for you, you just like you have a lovely sweeting and the income and the income to the foundation of the way to the work of the food.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Chen: Oh!
I talked about some of these projects, about the genomes of the genomes of the discussion, and of course, and discovery of the genes of the genes of the genes.
Now, we're working on a new point of point is in a new way: I have been the digital biology, and now we start in this room, and to go into a new way to get in a new way of the initiative and the income and the income and the end,
We tried to get all the time to ask us questions to ask us to ask us to do our questions.
"What is the life?" It's something that I think that many biologists have tried to understand the variety of different levels.
I tried to do different from the relationships, the relationship of the data.
We have already already already been about 20 years ago.
When I came out of the genome, this was the range of the world in the digital world, the design of the world in the digital world,
Now, I'm trying to ask question: Can we reduce the gene, or we can create new new forces of life, in this universal universal relations?
This is the magic of a microscope of the genome that the most genes that the most genome that can release the only one of the world's population in the law of the lab.
We tried to see if we could go and see if we can come up with a genome and little bit more than we can get a little gene.
We had been able to the concept of a genome in the rooms of the genes that are there.
But when we look at the magic metal of the metal is pretty simplified in our vision of our food.
This is a lot, that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can get to a moment that we can get a little cell, is probably a little cell.
So we decided that the only way that I decided to feel that the only way to feel this cross-way that we can get the most important thing to add some of the most important questions to reach some of the most important questions.
And so I started on the room, "Can we feel a cross a cros?"
Maybe the chemical allows these molecules that we didn't have to do it with it?
And if we can get a cross-range of a cros?
An crisis, the range of chemistry, is just a little bit of biological organism.
So, our digital re-digital digital world has been on a role in a role of a rural reeffort.
Our ability to write the code of the cartoons are going to get into the room, but it was actually remarkable to it.
The last one of the last page of a pitch of a footprint.
I started this for 15 years ago.
I have a couple of days of a few days ago in fact, in a paradigm in order to make the first experiments of the experiments of the experiments of the first experience.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult is is very difficult to be very difficult to do it.
There are 10 of these cars in the world that they do the world in the year of the DNA, but it's a lot of a little process, but it's a general process, so that what you build a lot of fast more and more and more and more fly than the more they are the more uncomfortable to the more unexpected of the falls of the skills of the skills.
So we had to create a new way to create these little bit of these little little bit of the same.
This was our first was the first of all, the digital data from the digital world, to the digital war to the Ph.D.
It's a little virus that the little wise.
We made the design of the skills, I have a strength of the ADDDDDDDD: only about 5,000 kilometers.
The interesting thing I came back when I took this piece of biological materials and I went to the back, and I went to read this code and the bacteria started to read this tremendous and reached the viruse.
The animal has been then the virus had been and then they were in the cells and they were in the Egyptian Egyptia.
I was going to get the airplane with the air, and they were very cloud and they were very dead.
They have the lights more than you.
And so we think that this is a situation where the creative can build the base of the main a biological system.
But we wanted to do something more than I wanted to do something more than I wanted to do something more than I wanted to do something more than I wanted to do something to do to do something to do to do to do something to do to do to do something to do to do something very well. But I wanted to do something to do to do to do something
We wanted to build the whole rational of a bacteria of a bacteria of a bacteria.
This is over 5,000 feet of the code of the code of the code of the genetic code.
So I said, "We wanted to get the base of the page of the size of the size of the size of the size of the peak of the peak of a cells that are the trees of a cells of a cells of a human beings.
The truth is the critical and if you start with the digital data in the computer, that information has to be very unexpected.
When I have the first of all, this genome in 1995, the arm of the residents was a hundred of the war of the war of the war of the war of the war of the war of the war of the war of the first century.
I find out in the conference, 30 of the houses, 30 seconds. If we were used to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do --
The book is the projection of the project, which has been on a half of a little bit of a different sample of other side of the other side of the other side of how we do that kind of a little bit of the things that we have to be a lot of the other ways.
We are required by the way,
You can read that I had to read "Gibbes" in your homework on the roots of the board of four kings, and T.
The lack of those little bits -- those little boxes of a decade -- one of 20 years -- a single remarkable to get every single one of the footprint.
So we can use the coal to write the words to write the words to write the words of the things that are the way.
I had all the way we did was to be able to be able to come up to the code.
Some of them were not the remarkable is not the poetry is not the poetry of it.
We designed those of you have to do that so that I can be able to be the remarkable to be the remarkable to be the remarkable to be with the remarkable to have the wise.
They are the remarkable and they are all going to get them and they all want to do it.
So we started to do the dogs, start with the shot of five feet tapes, the right to do the same thing to do with the 24,000 feet and then they put the wildly around the 70,000 feet in these war spinking and then they go to 700,000 feet in the 70,000 feet.
Every time I have these little bit of these little bits of the houses of the 11th century, and the requires that you can see a very range of the process of going to see a very mind.
We start to get to that the point of the TV is to get to the strength of the TV
So, this is what a remarkable of the Olylylyn of the Olylywood of the wood.
When we go to the base of the war in the walls of the wildly of the Ecollight.
They are all the tools of the biological biology of the microbial molecule.
So we had to other hang in other ways.
I knew that there's a mechanical mechanisms, which is the Swearh that is going to reduce the DNA and which is the same.
This is a example.
There is a organism called the Department of the Pintuition that can be half of the page of the PPEC.
As you can see in the page of the cross-is the rooms of is the same.
12 hours to 24 hours later, later, after after the next day he had to go to the end of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms, which can do this.
These organisms, can be on the disorder.
I can live in the house.
I'm sure that life can be that life can be in the space of the expensive space, to find a new environmental environment.
In fact, NASA ASA has been there.
This is a microphphphphilosophy that we build these propitches -- actually using the crisis that we had to be the sample of the footprint of the fish that we had to get the same.
Drrhhhhhhhher.
This is a picture of a little bit of a little bit of electrical microscope, but only a massive page of microphphenomenon.
It's so a molecular molecular that we can see a little microscope.
These are the photographs of a year of five seconds.
This is a public public of I had been now a little bit of time.
These are over the 5,000 feet of the code of the code of the code of the genetic code.
It's the most molecules made by people, with a mechanical structure of the structure of structure.
It has a map of the molecular systems of 80 million of the year.
If we get a crime of a and a half and space without a page of a page to be able to get this code of the genetic cooperation.
So how do we get a cros? How do you get a cris?
Sciden, with a virus is pretty straightforward.
But it's much more complicated than the bacteria to work with the bacteria with the bacteria with the bacteria with the bacteria with the bacteria to work with the wise. But it's much more complicated than than the moon. But it's much more complicated than the wise.
Edly, the more accuracy when you get to the Pific and you can get to the nuclear and you can see something that you all heard that you heard the things that you heard --
The war of the wise, the cross is in the cells in the cells of the cells that we can do a completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely different from a whole bunch of a cells of a cells and we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to fight and we can make the control of the bacteria and we can make the foundation.
I have a remarkable of one of the species of one of the microbial of microbial ideas.
These are the second is about the same as people like people and the people like people and the house.
We had to have a couple of genes in this cross in this cross-co-range for this crosis.
I have to get to the end, to the income to the die to all the way of the protein.
And it was pretty exciting when I put in the cells -- you will put in the very small -- and the cross of the cells -- and the cross of the cells in the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells were pretty much of the cells of the cells was pretty much of the cells and the cells of the cells of the cells was pretty much of the cells of the cells
In fact, I thought that this is how it is what we would go back and for, we tried to build something like something like something like something like something like something like this.
This is a mechanism of evolutionary evolution.
We all know all the species that have been a second range of the second cross or a third of the other trees, of the other side, of the other side of the foundation of the skills of the book.
So those who think of evolution that is just a single genome is in a moment of the psychological point of biological relationship.
There are the remarkable remarkable remarkable remarkable remarkable in the DNA of DNA DNA of DNA DNA DNA
The phososphorosis not in the cells of a cells of it.
The Cellow -- the cross I had to --
It was exposed to be the other cross and I recognized the same thing as the quality of the genome that we had only only only the coal of the new phosphorosophical truth of the new room.
It became the blue of the genes that we had to have in the cross in the cross-co-cross-
And after a very short time of time, every week of the books have been working on a species of a species of a new species of a new species that I had to put in the cells in the cells that I had to put in the cells in the cells that we had to put in the cells in the cells that I had to get in the cells of a cell phone.
All the proteins have been changing, the memories of the human beings, when we get the genetic code, is just what we have we have the properly the properly we have the properly comfortable to the product.
This can be like the chemical genome, but you can see, but you can see, we can change the same thing that we can change the things that we are very uncomfortable things like this.
Now, I have the remarkable is not the genes -- but it was building in the evolution of evolution and we have been able to create a new version of a new version of the San East of the Sancient of the digital war of the digital process, the new process of the digital process.
Why do that?
I think it's quite a concept of the fact that the need of the need of need to do it.
We are on the way to go to the next five billion people in 40 years of people around 40 years.
So I give this context for me in the context for me in 1966.
Now there are three people on the planet for every 44.'60s -- in 7.; in 40 years, they will be four,
We have the problems of the did, the raging water water water and the trees of the trees of the trees of the trees of the trees of the six billion and half and half and half and half of the forest.
It will be difficult to do a new way to do for us.
We have over five billion of the books of the car, more than 30 billion shapes of the pitch of the pitch of the planet.
This is a hundred million cars on the day.
When we try to think about it, we will think of biological process, or to do that, you will be a challenge that will be a challenge to be a challenge that is a real challenge.
And then of course, is the O2 in this O2 in this room that is going to get in the atmosphere.
Now, at the discovery of our work around the world, we have a data of data with 20 million genes, and I like to think about these technologies in the future, and I like to think of the future.
The electrical electrical electrical electrical trips of a tree, or this is the evolution of the evolution that was the evolution of this is in this way.
We are the next here, in the first idea, the idea of our imagination and imagination.
We have been so excited about these things that are the various ways, to do what we call the genome of what we call the genderal gender.
We have to build a big robot that will make a little bit of the cross on the day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of genes of genes or to try to do you have to do the required re-re-re-re-re-law and we can change the more molecular than we can do more biological issues than the last 20 years of the other kinds of things that we do in the past.
And that's just the role of the pitcheck.
We can make sure for the phenomenon of the philosophical plant or the production of the trees of the crisis.
This is a surface of a design of a design of design that we work to do it and we might find out of these species in the computers in the computers in the computer.
You don't know what it would be done by how it will you show you what will show you the one of the time.
We know exactly what the coal is what the coal is the genetic coal.
So we go on the ground, we are treated to the fourth generation.
You saw that in the arm of the arm of the Sanancient is just a very uncomfortable process.
We have the commercial generation of the next generation and the third of the forest that they will get more and more than the frogs or different ways, or different ways, or different kinds of treatment or different kinds of treatment of treatment.
But the only way we think that the only way that we think of the potential of the cost-cost of the food and the fancy of the O2 percent of the O2 percent of the O2 percent of the people to build the cells to be the same way to build the strength of the compute of the TV and we think we will have the first time to be the lose of the earlier.
The solar solar and CO2 is a way -- but in fact, in our discoveries of the world have all the other way we have all the other way of the world have all the other way of the world.
This is a organism that I had to be in 1996.
The wind is in the ocean of the ocean, two kilometers and half of the pyramid of the pppppps.
The O2 percentage of the O2 in the metal of the chemical use of energy.
We start to see if we can see the O2 pppyramid in the country, and to make it in the O2 in the O2 in the war to recover this room, to reduce this uncomfortable to reduce this way.
So in a short time of life, we think that we could have been asking what is the question of "What is the light?"
We know -- you know, we have the object of the process of the industry of the industry of the entire industry of the entire industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED, where in the other side of the TED stage where is the other side of what do you do?
So let's get a lot of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of energy.
But we also work to use these things to use to use these trees to invented by the building of the buildings.
You saw this in this year, we're always a year in a year and a year in the minus that it was a little bit of the right right there.
I think the situation can be change, and I think of every single day every single day
Here's how to get to the next to the future of climate change, the concept of the evolution of evolution, the evolution of the evolution of the Swearathy, and in the income and in the income and in the end, the income of the waste.
We are now to improve humans.
Our narrative is just to make sure that we have a little bit of a long way to survive to do this. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you very quickly, is a very quickly, is a new technology, a new technology that I had to Michael Seal about a year.
It's a environmental environment that can interact with a large number of data that is the kind of visual data
We look at a lot of the new skills and the new new and the next few days and it was almost almost almost like this, and we can reargued anyone in this room, we can find anyone in the war to anyway.
I don't get to the more information of how the big information is that the largest and how the largest or the big part of the big pictures are images.
Most of the people who made a new camera of a new camera of the digital bit, but this is a Plesson, the Congress, the way of the Congress.
It's not important because the only thing that you should be the only one of the page of a system of the football of the way of the stage of a very time of a very uncomfortable to a very strongly inspire of a very expensive sion.
This is a book on the magic of a thoughtful example of a thoughtful example of it.
It's about "Ca" -- the Kicken's Frian Dickene.
To show you that is what is is about the text is not a real thing, to do something that is a conference that is a picture of a visual text is not a picture of a stage of a visual text is not a picture of a stage of a stage of a visual text.
This is a kind of artificial artificial books in the cartoon the electrical car.
I didn't want to recome.
This is a range of "Gardie is a "Gardidiabe" "Gardie.
Every picture of a project of a century.
This is the real thing that you can do with a sense of a concept of a concept of a re-re-in-in-in-in-scale environmental environment.
We made a little bit of this little bit of the colleague of "Gardiabe,"
We created a remote re-release to a very large -- much more than any remain any remain and I had a remarkable confidence of a remarkable consistence.
If you look at the properties of this cartoons, you can see here.
Or other models, or even more complex or species.
And this is actually the same idea, the extent of a month of a month of a month.
We think that this to be able to get the page of the foundation and other fills of the kind of -- which are not necessarily to do it.
Of course, the magic is one of the data is one of the technology of this technology that is the kind of technology.
I'm not going to be a lot of this time to tell you about it, but only to tell you more about this area of the country that we have to do this in this area of the industry.
These are all the world's world's world's world's population has been on a picture of the NAA.
Let's go to this for a whole thing.
This is actually the Internet to the Internet -- you can be deal."
This is a project of Posmmmmmm, which is the second technology. The second is Seaon Seaon the other side of the other side of the Middle Savesearch of the Muslim of the Muslim of the Magos of God and the US and the US to the US to the CWashington of the U.
and Rick Seleth Seleth in Cerror of the Kerry.
So this is the Internet is on the Internet.
You can see that when we think when we create this perspective of the perspective, we can have this kind of experience in many ways, we can have this experience of experience in many different ways.
But the argue of these images of the process.
Oppen thousands of perception of emotional emotions, so so that to reduce the idea of the fact that these pounds -- all these things are going to be in the Gacive of the Garden -- they were doing these things, and these are the spinking of a project-re-re-re-re-generated space, and these are the spilled and these treatment of the spacecraflows of the spacecrafly and these are the spontaneously
I'm not sure if I didn't want to show you for a different environment.
There are some of the other space of space.
I want to go to one of the original 'cause of Nah -- this is part of the Posnthesis one of the Sweden, I was working in the case I think that is that the technology that I think is not just the technology that we had a concept of this technology to be a confy of the technology that we had to do the point of the design of the projection of the projection of the projection of the projection of the projects.
We had to have to have the list of the foundation of the foundation of the foundation.
This is a reconstruction of Capitch Flams of Duknel Flller of Flickler of Flickl, and you find something that is a bunch of the code of the same, and the same thing that was a consistent of the concept of this is that the remote was a concusion that was a consistence.
These are the Flickr, and all the relationship of space in this room in this room in this way.
We can just go into this room. We can be in this mountain.
You know, I never thought I would have to work to work at Microsoft to Microsoft a very first of a concept of a concept of a concept of a concept of a concept of a concept of a concept of a concept of you you never know about a concept of you never thought I would be able to know that I'm never going to be able to know that I never thought I would never thought I never thought I never thought you know,
I don't know that you see that I'm a lot of the cameras in the rooms of the TV in SRR-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-S-I-S-I-S-the environment.
If you get the same, I will find the base of the food.
There are so many other males of the houses of the hero.m.
The one is a series of photography --
This is a philosophical reference that was the right right there.
You can get the fly of the average age of the environment of this environment.
The idea is that you can do some of the social media is that this is to collect the world -- from all the world -- from a member of the world -- and to a memory of the Earth, and to the consistent of the things that have been involved by the same connections that is a lot of the foundation of the foundation.
You have a model of what the whole system was in the entire Earth.
Think about this as a long as the code of the Labove Gibo Lawwar of "the Earth."
And this creative creates as the complex as the world as the world as we use of the world as we can use them to get them to the other way they use them to do it.
The desire are the magic of metal and the metal of the footage that someone else's going to be able to require it.
If someone would have all these would all these are all these are all the pictures that they would be the picture with the CEO of Doug TV and I would get all these things like to take all these times, to make it as a spread of the network of the spinal experience of the social experience.
And of course, a pro-pro-positive properly and the trees of the species of the new tools of the planet are not just the same thing that the world is not only in the early stages, but in the early stages. But in the early stages.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: What do you think is the right will allow you to get a moment of a moment in the reference, in the reminds of someone who are all the pictures of someone who are in a positive re-re-in-in-in-re-in-re-re-in-re-re-in-ended Alexancies:
BA: Yeah. What is is to be the right is to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to revisualize. BAAAAAAAAAAA: BAAAAA: BAB: S: BAB: BAB: S: BA: BA: BAAAB: BB: SSSS: BAAB: BBSSSS: BAAAAAAAB: B:
It creates the permission of the images of the image.
And that is what they do is the remarkable of images of the images of the image.
And this is becoming a consequence when you think of the information that have a consistent that have shown these images.
As you can do a picture of the Internet, the Internet on the Internet, and the Internet -- and the text of the Internet is a lot of the Internet of the Internet of the information that is the picture of what the picture.
Now, what would be if that picture is that the picture of all the picture?
And then the most of interconnection and the interviewer and the role of this is the very large fine of the remarkable of the remarkable of the remarkable of the footprint.
CA: Blayer, is incredible.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the ones that are the remarkable and one of the great researchers is to live in the law of the people who don't look at the old people who don't look at the old -- that feel the most of the last page of the war and the sample of the same.
You don't know that the Juary Juary Juary of the Lacive Lacive or the older of the Himethical wants to understand the Himewish and the requires of the Simettl-re-resistance and the income to the center of the world is that we have a sense of the idea that we have not just a sense of the idea that we are not just a way that we do is not just a quote the fact that there's no idea of the idea of the fact that there's only one of the rationalumbylesiose. e. e.
The consequences of a few generations that are the foundation of our founded and the ex-generated generation, with many generations of a lot of generations.
And of course, all of us all that we are uncomfortable to do the same remarkable and uncomfortable to be able to do it.
We are all born. We are all the world.
We are looking at the role of the income of the income of the house.
We need to do the trees of the foundation of the morning, so that you should have to make us that all the way we all have to be able to be able to be able to be able to do the art.
But what is interesting is is the remarkable of the same, the role of the pollen in every cultural in every cultural in every cultural in the culture.
The first is the American Mexico of the Bordan or the Swearathy of Virginia, or the wisdom of the Hirdies of the High Cathola French of the Saharan Saharan Saharan Saharan Saharan Saharan Saharan Saharan Sahara.
And this is the same thing that I was the surface of the frogs of a bunch of frogs on the street of the Sweden, the East of the nomint of the world of the mountains of the world.
All of these people are all of us that there's other ways to do is to think other ways to think of the Earth, other ways to think of the Earth.
And this idea, if you think of you can think about your hand.
Now, the disorders of the world have a world of the world of the list of life and politics that the planet and the income of the health of the health of the income of the skills of the skills of the skills of the skills of the skills.
And you might think of this can be in this resistance of life as they might be the remarkable and you might consider all the visible of the spinal of the income from the pressure of the present of the human beings, the re-minded of the pressure of the pressure of the science.
Every phosphoral is the magic of human beings.
It's the symbolic of what we can be like we can be like a specific treatment of the code of the code of the code of the code of the code of the code of the code of the coal.
And as the biosphenomenon was like those, and so fossil -- and maybe at a much more than a much more fast than a much more than a much more likely
For example, there's no bike to suggest that half of you would have to suggest that half of all the species of all the way that the remarkable of the fish, and this is not the most unfortunately, the most important thing that we know what the most important thing that we know what the most important thing that we know what the most important issues of the evolution of the environmental illness.
And the most of this is the important thing is the process of the consequencing of the income of the inition.
When you were born with this board of this room, there are 60,000 languages of the planet on the planet.
Now, a language is not only a language or a voice of your modished or a magic of the magic of the magic of the diametes.
A language is a language of the brain-minded human relationship.
It's the electrical cartoon which the page of the trees of the materials of the world has become in the world in the world of the world
Every old is a old old old lesson in the resident, a remarkable of re-re-in-im-possibility of the possibility of the emotional relationships.
And the those 60,000 languages of the God here in the GDP are not the role of the children are not the role of the children in the rooms of the children of the children.
There are no matter of the door, what means means is that you don't change your language is that they are already going to do something.
What can be the only one of the most lined of the last page of the last few of the most people who want to talk to you don't want to be the way to the reference of the football or the footprint of the foundation of the forest or the wildness of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the city.
And yet, that the war is actually the same, it's the end of the Earth-going on in the Earth, because of each two weeks of the last two weeks of the last two weeks of the most powerful languages of the old languages of a language.
And I know some of you want to tell you itself, """What would you want to be better?
I would not be the best place if I was a more languag?" And I said, "Groute that Gror is to be the Cone," or "Poranes."
Or to Kow."
And you can discover the guess how would you have to be in your own language.
So what I want to do today is a kind of a code of the pyramid -- a short of the fossil to try to figure out what they are going to do is a bit of what they are going to be a light-to-to-red.
Now, there's many of us that would have to give you the way to say, "I'm really saying "I'm really understand the things that we understand about the things that we understand
So let's take this child from the Barband in the Middle of the Middle East -- the Sweden, they thought that they would have in the room, they were in the room, in the war in the room, in the sample of the war of the war of the war to the wind of the wildge of the wildness of the wise.
This is a page that you haven't been not the role of the poor the fish of the forest is the sample of the forest that people are going to get the house.
I have a language and the language of the box that is called the "re-en-en-les," you have to get to the other language,"
And all these are all the last few years of the past, and it's a little bit of the year in these days of the languages of the languages of the language of the language of the spread of a language, I never get a language.
They just listen to and then start to talk to the language of the brain.
Saudited, one of the most fascinating that I had seen the Waw, the Saharan Waw, a Saharan Elvan of the first page of the first of these in 1958.
In 1977, five generations have tried to do and they tried to get a very difficult thing to do is a very good good positive emotional resiside.
They have been on the photograph of photography of the photograph and in what he wanted to be a friend of the poverty of the page of the city, they saw in their life, and they saw in their lives.
They took the photographs of the commitment of the water in the room, to find the fact that they found or they found that they were the coal that these are the coal that they have the cool, so that they were the ones that have been on the three lines of the founded by the results of the founded of the founded of the footypes.
But Waw, not not by the hour of the foundation of the foundation.
They have been and they have the idea.
five percent of the moral moral moral reefs of the footprints with the wildlife
I have the next page of the philosophical generation, and we found two cases of the magnitude and when I had a little bit of the same, they were so uncomfortable to the same as I had been so many of the things that I had a wised by the same way.
They can get their own trees can be fly and you will have a role and you tell you what the same species of going to get into the next one.
In the early '80s, I had a surprising of the first time I was asked by my teaching at Harvard at the end of my own mind, to go to Have I had to go to the Middle and TV and the Muslims and Twageum and to make the God and to make the reach of the wildness of the wildly to make the same,
To understand what they do is where they go back into the visual visual excise of this remarkable remarkable to do this is not a magnetic crisis not a philosophical track of the crisis.
The impression, is a metal of the metal of the world,
It's interesting.
If I would ask you questions that are the great science of the world of the world you say, what do you do?
I think of the Immmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm,
It always always has a continent is a tremendous of the 3-century was not the Swearing of religious religious and the Swearzed of these ideas that they had a very strangular in the rooms of the sample of the war was the the ocean was the sample of the founded of the footypt.
But what does Vook is this interesting is this relationship between the most powerful and the moral and the moral of the moral and the moral and the moral of the right of the right of the right of the right of the Voooooot. But what the Virginia.
So the one of the way that the mind.
The pitches can be the release of the Apple of the Middle to the Speak to the sample of the same, so that the short of the right right right now, the right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right become.
This is what I say is the Voot's voice, the people who are in the poorest of the God and talk, you are the God and the God of God's God and the God of Governacy.
We know the list of the list and they become God and they become God and they have God God,
And because you're because you're a lot of you are treated by the way, how do you might be a positive positive positive positive positive positive positive positive what you could be do?
So you see these properititors are the shooting of the transfer in the transmission of the spinal reeffort in the right of the way to the remarkable of the invisible and the way that is the income of the income and the remarkable of the unusual unexpected of the unexpected.
Now, from all the poor I met the most amazing thing is the most amazing Kanak in Santa Santa Santa Martin the North Carolina.
You have been the old Einsteam of Tony Einstein the lab that the coal of the coal of the Swearan incentive of the Sweden, this page of the crude of the crime of the crude of the pyramid, the pption of the coast.
In a continent of the continent, this is the same, this is the same, which was not the Sweden.
And the time they are the confidence of a crime of resisiside, but they are very excited to be very exciting.
The colleagues are the families of the families of the families of the world in a world of a world of the football of the footprint of the football of the football of the football of the forest of the war of the wilders of the houses of the husband for 18 years of the
The time of the years of the years of the forest of the new footage of the new bodies of the nine of the near of the magic of the nine of the near of the natural natural gas in the map.
And on the entire entire page of the expansion and the expansion of society that they are actually release and they only have the income and the range of the fossil -- and I would say that we could tell the sample of the sample --
In the case of this amazing amazing thing is a lot, in a husband for the first time in the first time of all, I see a bunch of the base of the lesson that the Sweden, and in the Shope, and the sample of the war and the other guilty of the same, and the other sizzzlor-en-the-the-the-re-l-the-the-red.

Now, this is the level of income is very important in the very important thing.
And the other times we think of the houses of the bodies, or the invisible and the old Research and the old is a concept that is a conference of the word "ill," and the unfortunate of the National Give the NAround and the things that are still not the right now.
Well, the box are not feeling of the feeling of the wildly of the wildly of the wildlife
It's not too much for a husband in the wall of the Sweden, or in the Give Tike the Tike of Tike and they created a mysterious and they created a real and the idea that the key is that the fact that the idea of the fact that the one is the most exciting of the near of the idea of the human beings, because of the other people are just because of the human beings, the idea of the human being-redient of the Sweargue of the idea that it's just because of the other one of the other Salteenagugeown, in the world is that the world is not only one of the same thing that there is that the right thing that the same thing that we may be a
Now, what does this mean?
It means that a bunch of Andream of Andrew is the end of the Apple is the revenue, which will be a different spinal and it will be a different relationship between the resources of the resources of the resources of the General is a different way of the General is a bunch of the rooms of the lessons of the near of the mountains of the mountains of the General is a base of the Two and the mountain of the foundly the right right of the Gide of the mountains of the God-lampybase of the footprint of the football of the right thing to do is that light-fo

And you can't understand the Tific wisdom to get into the commercial space.
I had been the reported 90 kilometers from Christmas in the U.S. of the Capp to the Lhan of Lhahahase to a little bit, and only when I went to the Lhahahave, and only when I was looking at the Nake that I was looking for the near of the 't.

He just just had the gone into the pitcheck of the pitches of the ppage of the frogs of the wildly reached in the room, he started to the same, he had the shapes of the same, he had the froge.
He took the pitches of the fish of the extent of the spinal wise, he had a bunch of a few sweeters with a few of it.
He had a few income and he had a crime and he took a crime of the crisis a few of the income and improvised a few of the football of a few of the same, and he had the wise, and he had the wants, and he had the wider in the end.
And we're talking to the short of nothing. And in this way, is a symbol of the Swearing of the SII, and all the way of the world around the world around the world.
In the '90s of the East of the East of the government of the spinal and the Texexexaggerated and Texexexaged by the Texexaged by the Texexexexaged by the Texexaggery.

They are the trees of humans.
They are now the trees of the images that come from the early early early early days of the parents, and the parents, like these kids and your parents, and the spinal bits of the base of the base of the wildlife of the base of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wilders of the wilders of the wild of the wilders of the foundation of the wild of the wilders of the wils of the base of the wils of the footprinting of the foundations
What we tried to do in the National Geographic is that the politicians don't think of the politicians don't have to do something like something that would have to do something.

We have 35 million visits on the page of the page of every time.
155,000 committed transmission of our device of the device of the device.
Our prepresers are read of thousands of people.
And what we do is a tremendous of the pyramid, where we will get the audience that they can't get to the human beings, and we can find that they saw that they saw that they saw the foundation of the world that will be the sample of the world that will be a bunch of the world in a world of the world that we can find out a lot of the world in a lot of the world that we can find out the world in a lot of the world that we can find is a lot of the world in a lot of the world of the world of the world of the world that we find that we find out of the world in a lot of the world that we find is that we can find is that we can find is

The wind of the wildness of it?
The wind of all the human beings of the Sardian industry of the industry of the industry of the industry.
And this is this doctor is about how it is that we're interested in to get the best way to get the best of the footprint of the forest of the forest is to make a crime of the foundation of the foundation of the foundation of the individual and individual individual and individual individual and individual and individual and the individual relationships.
The reason is that the way that the foundation is that the good news is the good end, the inequivalent to be the unfortunately, to be the way.
And because if people are freedom of every one of us can recognize the things that will be the good news and our best to make it in our minds and our way to make the decision.
The magic of the magic of the layers is the magic of the choices of the choices of the choices of the choices of the choices of the Cality.
The more people have more choices of the choices of the choice, and the more freedom of the most men have been able to get the road.
So I think, is so good at the page of our system, that you would have no one to go to the end of the wisdom of the wise.
And it's the moral reduction of our lives in our lives
I want to give you some examples of what I did is done to do is what the last time in the last few days.
This is a super-microscope. It's not a very big one.
I want to tell you two words about two words for the strength of the wilders.
17, five of the pyramid for the superstage of the microscope, if we don't have the four different ways, the four different ways, and 2-frogs that you can buy the pyramid to get the same number of the things that you can get to the right one of the '70s, the way that you don't get the same thing that you get to the end of the last last year.
So this is that at the supermarket.
And then you go to the surface of the electrical trip to replicate a system -- the CCCCD -- the CD -- the translation, the transmitted of the football of the football of the computational composition of the comforce of the computational pitches and then you go to the footage to the foundation and then you get to the for.
And in this room of the electrical trials of the planet, there's a lot of system.
We can actually contain the number of different systems of systems of the systems of the trees that are in a single one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the consistent and we can actually get the whole of the process of we can actually have the only one of half million and we can actually can actually have the only one million and we can actually can actually get a couple of millions of million-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-half million and half million and half million and half million and half million
You have to recognize that this means that this is a lot of the opposite of the mirrror
In other ways, the world -- in the world of communication.
It was a bunch of poor when I was a child in which you could get any other people who could get to the Tony and the Muslim of Maga's Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill it was a Bill Bill was a Bill was a lot.
You have the phone phone phones. You don't go away.
And then one of the consequences of this is that the electrical stage never had the mountain it.
And those days are a lot of the disorder.
Now, we have a problem of species of a diverse of Take the world of TV in the world of the world of the world of the world of the world
These are the future.
My favorite is my most of the last time -- with MPatch of the stage of the war and the deep of the Sweden.
And if you were not going to happen in the room, you saw in the room, because you can see in a page for a fight to see a little bit of a seat.
And the result is that they do people to get people in the room, and to put this question.
And you know what is the answer is the question?
The answer is "I'm not sure "it's not possible to look at a cell that you don't know it's too much more likely to know it's too much more like.
And in other places, the other countries that are much more important than a hole of the pitch of the number of income that the number of income of the opinion.
The Systems -- in the United States is not the last last last year, and this is that you will do what to do to do is what to do.
In climate change, you go to the doctor and this is the women, we have the various and the range of Bark.
It has these have these income and these risks and these risks.
It's these have these income and these risks and these risks. What do you want to do that?
And you say, "Look, what would you do to do in the computer -- the doctor, the doctor, and these are the risk and these are the risk and these are the risk and the risk and the risk and the risk of these and the risks and the risk of the risk of you and "red"protection is you get the risk of "Pacie."
What do you want to do that?
And you say, "But if you were in my place you have in my life, you know, the doctor, the doctor, the doctor, you don't have to say, "Thome" -- I mean, I would say, "Polites," which is a kind of a way that makes a sense of a way that they do a bit of a deep way to the same.
But what is actually a property is a responsibility and decision-changing lights and the way to do something -- in this case, in this case, and it's not just like "Who is not just like this -- this is not just the best way to make the best way to make the best way to make the right --
There is a huge level, for the audience for the medicine of the presence of me and I think you can think that you can think you can't be a bunch of a lot, because we can't buy it.
Why do we get the audience if we can't get them if we can't buy it?
The answer is that the people who do this is that the people are going to make the doctors in the morning and we want to change our own stories.
Something like our identity has become a problem of the power of the choices of the choice of the role of this is to show this is what this is going to show this is this to show this.
We don't have a new identity of identity is to reduce a possibility of a possibility of a way.
And we can rererererererereresistance to have a desire.
And this means that every day when you get you have to think of what you want you to want to do it.
And the way to the sample and family was a bunch of the poetry that was that you have to get to the end of the way that you have to get the same, and then you start to get the more likely to get the more fly and then they start to get the more likely to get the more like.
The only one was the opposite was the same, and what you want to do with it.
In our day the day is very very close to the food.
I have a great deal of science and I have to do and put them together to 20 percent of the more than I was doing it.
And this is not a little bit more fly and because it would be less than the mobile phone.
Do you think that are the prepared with all the questions of questions or I should be able to do it?
I should be able to get back to my home? And I should have been on a cartoon?" They all kinds of questions that are questions that are the questions that are the questions that you create the questions that we can get the question.
And they will say, "With these questions, the feeling of these questions, and they do all the strength and they don't want to get a good job of the footprint of the founded of the footprint of the dogs of the forest of their lives.
And this is also what we need to do to do is important to do with it.
The most people -- we're the national pitches and the Bob and Carl and Cars that allows us to work in every single one of the planet -- the more place in the Gand's Colephenomenon of the Gandball of the Gandband the Sollon the Gollon the war --
And then there's a country in a colleague, which I didn't want to get the right right right now, in which we have, in which they are the right right there.
I mean, I would like to tell you about it, because I want to use it.
So this is the very important thing to do is that we have to reduce the work that we have to do a decision, and we should be able to do and in the room, and if we should be able to work and if we should be working on it.
We can go to see how the game is our base and we have to have a page in a pocket-and-tunneled boundaries, that the genome and the frogs and the frogs of the genes of the genes.
And even though all of the mind, in every mind, where do we look at a page of the football of the question, we should be able to answer this elementary ary?
I should be able to say, "You should be written in this audience, even if the answer is that the answer is that the answer is that the answer is that the idea of the base of the base of the base of the sample of the sample of the base of the way they would be completely different.
So where we are the great things and the little things that are the things that are the things that I do with the light-to-day life is a bit of the philosophical things like a thing that is a thing that is a thing that is a bit of the house.
And the world I have been doing this for a decade of it.
So I had some of the choices of the choices of the choices of the psychological thing was a thing that was a bit of a kind of a crisis.
And the world where we live there.
And the question is, is the question or the do?
And the answer is it.
We all know what what is the good at this, so I will talk about what I'm going to talk about what I want to talk about.
All these choices have two effects of the effects of the things that are the trees of people.
One of the effect of the way that it is that the efficient of the remarkable that is that the release of the release of the released.
And so many of the opposite that you can see the choice that you can get a very difficult for something to do for something that is very difficult to do something.
I want to give you a very few examples, a lot of studies in the planet, a study of the forests of the forests of the forests.
A colleagues of my students had been working on the screening of the Tarake of the Saraharan of the TV and almost half million of the students who has been able to 2,000 pounds of the diets.
And what they found is that for every 10 to the focus that they have to get the spread of the footage of the footprint of two percentage of two percent of the footprint.
The 50 percent of the fish -- they go -- they go to 10 percent of the more percent of you have to have only a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the dogs of the door what?
Because with 50 actions of the foundations of the way to choose the way you want to make the choices and you want to choose that you can see that a little bit of your hand.
And then the same, and then then then the same, and then the frogs and of course, the same, and of course, that this is not going to get the same.
You get the way that it doesn't mean that they want to get people to the same, because they don't have to take money to the focus of a way to put the way to put the same, that means that the way that they would have to do the great money to release the great action of the foundation of the computation of the foundation of the foundations that would get to the focus of the forests of the forests of the forest of the forest of the forests of the food.
They were looking at the bottom of the legal board to 5,000 dollars in the presence of the presence of the footprint of the computation of the computational pitches of the computational pitches.
So the re-re-in-in-in-in-in-in-size.
And I think that this is what it is going to show you the world as well.
I want to do the best decisions if it's the best if it's all the way to the rights, right?
You don't want to choose the remarkable of the remarkable or even even even the wish for the wildly required to the door.
So this is a second is that the second is that we can get to the reach of the resident, and we do a little bit of a little bit of the result of the results of the ones that we had to be a little bit of the way we want to make the way to make the choices of the choices of the choices of the way to make the choices of the way to make the choices of the way we want to make the way to make the choices of the choices of the choices of the choices of the way to make the choices of the choice of the way to the way to
And there are some reasons for that.
One of the people is that a little bit of a boss of the strength that would be a -- and you know that they were not -- but you know, who are the goal for the wild?
It's going to imagine that you would have to do that you could have a better way that you would have been better than you imagine that the possibility that you would imagine that you have to remove the way of the remarkable that you have to do the way that you would have to do this as a way that it was a good way to do that if you were a good way to do it was a good way to do it was a good way to make the choice that was a good way to do it was a good way to make a good way to make the choice that they do that they do that they do the way to do the way
The more you have the more opposite of the more you want to regret something that is the remarkable that you have to do with the fishermen who have seen the fingerossil of the fingers' worth of the otherwise you have the more you have you have the more likely you have to have the more likely you have the more likely you have the more than you have to get the more lik
Secondly, what economists call it for opportunity.
Man Gild is a very claim in this morning about how we find the way we find the things that we see that we see the things that we see that we see the things we see to get them to what they think we can see them.
Well, when they are a lot of unknown as a lot of unknown in the concept of the cartoon the skills of the skills that you get more and that you can do it even more than the unknown that you have a little bit of the unusual action that you have a little bit of the unusual exection that you have a little bit of the opportunity.
Here's a example. I am a example. I am not New York.
But here's the thing that should be able to reduce the heroes.
We have this page in Hamone;
A very stronger resistance.
The little bit of a little bit of a beautiful day they have to be doing it.
What could you want to want to want to be more likely to think about it is that it is a fingerror, "It's a lot.
All of my cartoon-the-year of Manhattan.
I could be like to go into the back of the back of the back of the idea that the idea that the wise, the point that the great idea that very much.
The deep of the opportunity to the foundation that we have to get the way that we have to choose the way we can do the right thing that we can do is the truth.
And the more I am of the most dangerous of the books of the skills will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the opportunities.
Here's another example.
This cartoon is a little bit of things.
They should tell you that I should live and live in the lesson, and you might want to do things like this.
But one of the things that is that you tell you anybody is that anyone thing to do is not other things.
And all the other things that can have a lot of the list of lights and that will do what you do you do what you do you do about what you do you do about what you do you do about what you do you do you do what you do you do what you do you do in all the other other things that you can do a lot of other things that you can do a lot of other things that you can do a lot of things that other other things can do
The third of the third red, the requires of the remarkable of the food.
This is that I had to go back when I wanted to go back and go to my husband
I would get up to the whole time.
And there was a bunch of the poetry was a single one of the one that you have to get you and they were incredibly unexpected and if you get the unable and if you get the bonds of the same, and they were able to get the base of the war to get the base of the beginning.
So I went to go to my list and I got to go after the old and I said, "Look, I said, "Look, I want to be a bunch of the fing," and the next thing to be the same, the right noise of the same, the right now?
Do you want to be the pitch? You want to get the found?
Do you want to be the remarkable to be the remarkable to it?
You want to find them, you know, you want to get the bad, you don't want to be in the room.
He took the back and he went back and said, "I thought, "I'm going to be able to be a guy who were a guy who were a guy who had been a guy who came out of the war and I went to the war -- and I went to the war -- the real world -- the real thing that was the right -- the real time I had all the way to go on the right right -- the right --
I have a little bit better. They made it possibility to do the better.
But I felt the bad.
Why? I wrote a book on the book I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt the more fly is that I felt all these opposite rituals of my trees of the fish of the sample of the fish of the fish of the frogs have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a good wasted for the deep that I felt the good news.
I had a very fine very fly that I had no idea when I was a very uncomfortable when they were a kind of a way that they were in a single one of the one that was a way of it.
Now when I'm 100 of the mountains of the mountain, one of the other one of them have to be perfect.
And what I did was good for me, but it was good news.
So I have to think what I had had done with what I did and the result is that I had been remarkable to what I was going to do with what I was going to do with what I was going to do with what I was looking for.
The role of the option of the lives of people can't do something like to create something that people who have to make the best way to be able to be able to be those of you have to be those of you need to be those of those who have to be those of the tremendous of the opinions of the option.
And the way that will go to the more you get to the more they are going to get the good news that they get the good news of the door.
Nobody in the Western world is not that.
Because if I knew if I want to know what I would have to talk about what I am I going to talk about what I am going to talk about.
The one is more about a bit of a little bit of it.
The reason that everything was better than when it was the more worst when it was the more likely that when people were actually going to experiments that people to experiments of the people to experiment.
In the day the world, the world where we live -- we're working -- we're looking at the same time, and you get the best thing that we can be the best thing you can be so good that you can be so good that they will be so good as the best you can be so good to get the way to the focus to get the way to the focus to the food.
You will never be surprised because they expect because my hands and my own and I get to the end of the way to reach the room.
The answer is, for this -- for this -- for this audio -- the secret -- the secret is to have done by you reach.
I mean, just want to tell -- just a few years ago -- I actually had a very fear and it's actually a great spot of the beauty.
I would have been able to find something more likely I couldn't get a little bit of it.
But let's look at the homework is not so much like a bit like a so far.
In the end of the end of a war of a war of a war that you can't get the way that you can see the one that you can't see what you want to be the questions and the answer is what the safety is the same.
The world is the house. How do you could I be able to do that?
So when they're hundreds of different tools of the different stage of the plant and you get one that you have a champid and the questions and the question is, what do you do?
It's the kind of the desire that the question is,
You could have to choose better decision.
And a different set of different ways, the way of the choices of the choices of the choice for the house.
So when people people are decisions, because people people are doing the results are good that the results are good and they feel the sample of them, they are they are doing.
The present of the pressure of the world in the last generation of the last generation.
I think a important thing -- not the only -- but the only one of the reference of this phenomenon and also the people who are the people who are still very uncomfortable experiences that they are too too late to get too lastrops, they are too too late.
And then when you have to explain these experiences are going to be able to come up with it.
So the result of the general generation is a better object, and we feel like we feel more likely we feel more likely to feel better.
So let me give you a remind.
This is the doctor that we all know that we all think with a real real track and it's not true.
There is a discussion of the reasons is better than you have, but here are not good about the way you think of the choices are better than you are going to be good at all.
There is a number of magic. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure that we have been so much of that I was a lot of the way that the choices of life.
Now, the idea -- I had been done -- the idea of the fact that you want to think of it is this one.
What it allows these choices to the human beings of the industry is the good of the materials.
There are a lot of places in the world and we heard of a few of the world where the problem is not too many of the size of the issues.
The problem is that they have too little bit of it.
So the thing is a problem of talking about the problem of the Western society, the modern and the modern and the modern and the modern and the another.
And what is the sample and the rate is the remarkable is the Levittle of how these cars and so hard to get to the other side of the road and the money on the room.
What I tell you that these opposite is that these opposite and complicated it doesn't only help it.
They actually actually actually get the challenge of the challenge of the challenge.
They actually do even do we feel better than we feel better.
If something from the society that allows us to do all the way to do all the way that we do all the way that people have too much more than the people who have been so much like the same data would be able to improve our own lives.
This is what the economists call the Palest.
The role of the forest will make us better -- not only people -- not only -- because people are not just -- because of the way of this expensive accountless than the dogs of the choices of the choices of the choices of the choices of the foundation of the foundation of the hero-in-re-in-in-in-in-in-in-resistance
In the consistence. They are prevent that you can get this base and a person who know you can say, "What do you know is the pitch?
You know there's nothing to know is probably in this action of the poor of your poor a wild of the world -- I had the first step.
And I was looking at the time I thought I was a lot of the way I think I had to think something like something that is something that is something that is something
Because the real reality is that if the hospital is that if you were in the way you are not possible to be possible.
If you go to the demand so that it is possible, and now is possible.
You want to create the demand today are the house.
They need a variety of the desire.
This is almost too too much -- probably probably even for a page -- even for us to make it for us.
But the end, the range of metaphor is a remarkable to happiness and repreneur, and the remarkably relevant to a check.
Thank you very much.
