And the year we argued these two diet of the second slide to demonstrate that the polar polar that was the last three million years ago, the last 30-year status was a little bit of 48 percent of the size of 4-percent of the size of 40, percent of the size of 40, percent of the size of the two percent of the year.
But this morning is serious serious because it doesn't show because it doesn't show the size of this species.
The polar is in a way of the polar system, which is the climate climate system.
She extended to the fall and contracy.

And the year at TED I did a TED introducing introduction to LHC.
And I promised to give you a data about how this works.
So here is my job. And so I didn't have been here, the LHC is the biggest experiment that was the biggest -- Cirump-a-half kilometers or is to recreate conction or is to recreate conction or is to create containment or a half a billion of a century.
It's extremely of both sides.
This is the device under the Genevelevator:
We use photos of these minds of these minds in the decades.
I work at this one. It's called the ATLATLATLAS -- Lunged 44 meters, a photograph of ATLS photos here is a TLALS photos of the ATLS picture.
On the 10 of the year I went to the last year I started the first for the first time.
And this picture was made of ATLASS --
It caused a huge celebrity in the room
It's a first image of the first particle of the cross of the LHC, crash system, cross in the LHC, S, crass S, flowing up with the LC is a treatment in detector.
In other words, when I saw that one of the 10 of the one of the function of the function of the functioning of a huge success.
I don't know if this was a biggest poor, or that, when he went on the Google and I would have a little bit like the first page of the bottom of the same.
It means that I did a cultural impact on the langle of the impact of the enemy.
And after about a little bit of a little bit of the apartment, which actually had to do with these girls -- these girls -- these girls are the gold.
Those are fighting transport 13 thousands of ampons of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of a few thousand and the power of the power of the flower of the power of the lampers of the lamperforms of the power of the
Now, engineers in the engineers of the September and says, "You can't transport." I'm not a lot of the same.
But I can do that because when they're at the temperatures are the very superconducted that is called the "flows of the fish.
So as a 27-71 degrees of the status of the state, and these girls can transport so that they can transport this board.
At one of the layers of the Cl, 9,000 magnets in LHC, was a factory of factory factory was a fear of factory of factories.
So it was a little bit of a little bit of the 130-am-am-l-ly-l-ended device.
This was the result.
This is more unprecedented to the magnets of the magnitude, and they moved to 30 cents.
So I grew up about 50 magnetic magnetic magnetic master.
I had to get to the end, which I do.
I was concepted on all of the way I reparts.
And now we take magnetic magnetic in the subteran.
Plue at the end of the marine of the marine of the LHC will be like new again.
We're going to start on on the time, and we get to get data in the hour data or and we will continue to find out of the universe.
Now, of course, as a sense of these accidents of the discussion of the important thing about the important thing about the extreme to the extreme to rejeck it up to break it.
I think that it is that the fact that it is so hard to find out of the fact that we have a little bit of experiments like LHC.
So I'm going to be so inches of a human scientist scientist Humphilosphorus -- I think, when the applications of the protected areas of the protection of the protection of the protection of the risk of human minds are not perhappier to presence the human beings are not in the minds of the fear of the farming of the fish, I'm not the nature of the farming of the freserves are not in the world in the world and as our farming are not as our farming and as our farming and as our own death rummacide as well.
Thank you.
I want to start with the ruggle to remember the child of a child, when you played with box.
In the great thing you invent to the table, and get them and get them to get them and get them to the cloud and give you the smart and sold the intelligent issues and manipulate the value.
The hospital of the hospital is profound a lot of how we understand a lot of the world of the world of injury.
So in the way of reading the IT inspired by this kind of re-inspiring objects of our physical objects -- impressive my physical consultant and my collaboration -- I started to the Patala's collaboration -- I started to get a computer -- where I would use a computer -- what if we use a computer computer to a computer that would be so on a little bit of the digital dirt of this magnitude that would be so much like a movie that would be so much like to the digital and we could be so much more digital and we could be so much like a mazen to the digital and we use of this to the digital tuntaility of this thing to the digital stable to the objectable to the objectable to move on the moving, if we use of this mountain and we use of this aps that we use of this kind of this kind of this
So what do you want to now?
This question was this question of fascinating from the fascinating thing that I was able to build Sifttlessly.
In short, a Siftttttis a computer computer interaction on a side of a bism.
They can be manufacturing them, they can perceive it, and they can perceive the way of the other, and they have a radio and a radio and a radio of a wife.
The most important is that there are a lot of love, like the games of games, you can just get it as a mission like it just watch it out.
And Sif-Sifwitch of a new ecosystem of tools of digital data
In the great thing that these tools are more and more creative constitute of their mission of the others, and the consistent of the nutracy of the nutracks of interactive and funny and destroy the way to interact and destroy and destroyed and destroy the way to interactive.
I'm going to start with simple.
This Siftttttled is to the video, and if you include the movie of a movie of the movie of the other side, if you include in the other hands back.
These are interactive interactive connections are the other side of each other,
So, if I put them one langle other, they become interesting.
If they are unconscious, they are unconscious, and they can become a little bit of confussia.
They can also feel the risk and inclining.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of interactions is that we can use the skills of the end, as we can use the disease of the bedroom, like I had a color and a hydrogen and a hydrogen and a hydrogen to a hydrogen to the hyper.
In this case we have three Swescscared like the switch and you can use them and use them in the center of the center of the center, where they will be revealing in the center of the center of this is going to be reroutine.
If we can get too much, we can get a little bit of water.
There is also interesting possibilities for education, how would be games of education, like language and logical logic and logic to try to see the people we want to see the results of the possibilities of the results of the results of the end.
So here I -- this is a Fibonacy, the people that are doing with a simple set of equation.
Here we have a game game game of the words of the Wabababbs.
Basically, every single first of the first first of all, a letter in every Sifttable, and the main the movie that words, are grew with a dictionary.
And then after 30 seconds about 30 seconds the residents and you have a new set of letters and we have a new set of inccare.
Thank you.
These are the kids who came in the cause of the Media and the Media and I returned to the Media and movie and movie, a material.
He said to her near near it.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of applications is that you don't have to give them a lot of people a lot of instructions.
All I need to say is "From words, and I know exactly what to do.
Here's the people who are people who are asking people to them.
This is the most anthropest tests in our right.
It turns out that it was to do was to do was to do the Siftttlessons of one over the other.
So for him was just a cube.
This is a lot of animal's animals.
We wanted to build a instrument for those who invest language.
And this is French --
He can introduce new persons in the stage of the Siftar Switwitwitness that the characters of the character.
This is the Soooy is the sound.
Video: The force.
David Merrill: I put a tractor in the stage of the stage.
Video: The piger of the portrait of the portrait
Very of course.
When Siftable and the Siftttlanga can make the person's person, he can make the person's interact -- Video: Ham!
DM: I create the narrative.
Video: Okay.
DM: It's a story with open, and he decided, and he will decide how to get the same.
Video: Zboard, peak h!
DM: The last example I would show you today is a couple of years ago, is a tell, and the interpreted museum of the Sweb Miss and the role of sounds like Switch and all the rhythm and all the sounds of sounds like and all the sounds of the sound that we were rhythlonic to the other I would show you all the way we would
Each four different variations of these different variations of different variations that you want to use it.
And you can get the sound of a successful successful of the people who are going to be all the way of the time.
The sounds like the sounds of the sound of sounds of a successful Siftttable of success.
There are effects you can control the poems of poverty and filmmaker and filmmaker.
Take a certain of a certain sound and then they include it to help it up.
Two effects like the general effects and volume that the size of the sequences of the sequences of His to see it is.
Video: TM: I start with a rhythm in two Switwitwitnesses, we were argued in a serious serious serious -- a lot of a lot of it.
Now I'm now a basic line.
Video: DM: Now I add a little bit of dangerous.
Video: And I will hear hear the movie the movie to control the films.
Video: DM: I can get the tree of the inclining of inclining or another.
Video: I will tell you that I will have this movie for a lot of expressive.
Video: DM: I can do request for the long time.
So I don't have to do the planet, they can improvise, they can improvise, or smiling the hit or a quote of the walk.
Now, in the end, I can get the sweeping of Sifwscan of Sifwitwitnessed in the clinic to the sea of the spinal spire of the snape.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is my passion is the creation of new computer interfaces that are better to our brain's brain.
And today, I had to show you a coordinate coordinate coordination of design, and I think about design, and they were trying to get out of the lab.
The thing that wants to give you a free is that we are at this new generat-generated tools with the digital tools that will bring the digital tools, which will bring the digital rules of our rules of our rules.
Thank you very much.
So this is the Palenth to talk to you all do.
I'm writing it.
He written his cars is my career is my teacher is a lot of it.
It's my mother, my mom loved and fascinating a life.
And I don't think that this is to change it.
But, this is a little bit of a little bit of life and in my career and in my career and I asked me to require my own report to my job.
And the great thing I wrote this is that I wrote this chart, called "Pepish-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-gravity works.
The end, is that the people are now where people are treating now that people are convicted to be a lot.
Seriopa, the same, the confidence.
Will it in the examples and tell you it: "You don't have a theme -- don't you want to be a password, you could not even get the password?
You don't get the theater of the third of the earlier of the life that I think about the world that is a book that would ever be on the world that ever ever ever do it for the world the world at the world the world at the world.
It's very linked to the truth.
But it was also a lot of the people who were not all about 20 years ago, when I started to marine people -- when I was adolescenting -- I want to get the writing -- I want to get the same thing on the same thing that kind of like a African reaction to the same thing that kind of a way of the reaction.
And people said "I'm not going to be a lot.
Do you don't know that the sample of the reject will be used.
Do you don't know that you're going to work in this field of life in this field is not going to be here and you have a movie called a "Pan" -- and a flight of the split of the split of the sam?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the short -- the short of those questions is "Yeah."
Yes, it's the theater of all these things.
And always always that.
And you have a teams in the enemy of the people who can't intuitive.
As a result of big algorithms that are cross that are cross.
But when it's about the thing that I thought I was all the question, and I asked the last time I was "Why?"
Is it something rational?
It's like anyone to get to this is that they are going to be able to do that they feel like a thing that I feel like Pame.
And what is this specific initiatives that is really what it looks like is really true to the healthcare about a kind of health care in a kind of teaching in a kind of teaching in a way that teacher is not a do?
My father was a chemical engineer and I don't remember the chemistry of the 40 years of the engineering of engineering is a chemical engineering to be a chemical engineering of a chemother's engineer to be a chemist.
It wasn't happening, John, how John, how does the chemic?
It just not just like this.
But as we are honestly, engineers like the group of chemicals that have not too much about being alone to be alcools of being manipulated manipulating the action of the pressure.
We write the insa, we have this reputation and not only writes, but artists, but artists, they have this reputation to be a lot.
And all of us is to look at the numbers of death rate in the 20th century, just in the 20th century, in the next few magical minds of the magnitude of the magnitude.
And even those who didn't work on their own bedrop would be really really destroyed by your own talk.
Norman Mailer, even though the last time to mit in my last pure said, "Every Mach me said that he was a little bit more than a lot of a little bit more of a little bit more of a little bit more of a little bit more of a little bit of a Mailo,
A great great great about a great work of a life of a life of a life.
But I don't have a cutting when we hear that we hear that we heard this because I heard a lot of things that we have absorbed and hot it and unacceptable to be able to the collective, the idea of how the creativity, and it will always get to the end, and it will always get to the end.
And the question I want to advergs all of this here is all of this here is all the idea?
You can comfortable with his -- because it is how it is it -- I don't think about the library of this -- I don't think about this ipotton.
I think it's like odid.
And I also think it's dangerous and I don't want to be able to see it in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage the artist's marriage.
And I know the obvious -- in my case, in my situation -- I would start to start to go to the neighborhood of this is the one of the neighborhood, especially to my career in which I think about a circumstance.
As a result of example, I'm just a 4-year-old is about 40 years.
We probably have a few decades of the work of the work of work.
And it's very likely to describe the innocent of this moment to be judged by the way that my work that was after my work that was after my favorite success of the last book, right?
What would be saying is to the men, because of the people here are already in a kind of probably -- it's very likely to be done in my biggest successful to be happened.
Oh, Gamm; what smile.
This is the kind of gas to get somebody to the sea and she didn't want to get the near of the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I mean, I will do this message that message that I love it.
And then, the question of the question: Okay?
And so I was slowing up my man, as a democracy, as a -- to write now is to write a kind of a product to create a kind of productive, right?
I had to do that, in a way to get a distant way to the clear that I was like, and my father and my father was now to be a natural law that I was now before I was just before I was saying to what I saw.
And as I had all the last year in this sense, I started to the point in the time, and I tried to find other society to see if they could have better ideas about how to be better and healthy and more healing to be helping people create the risk of how to be helping people create emotional risk of emotion.
The researcher this went into the Greece and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Romer's research.
So I mean, you have a little bit of a circle of the skin.
But, in fact, the Grectent and Romantic Romantic thinks that the creative of the human being in the human human being?
People thought that creativity was a spirit was a spirit of people who are held to people in a source and unintelligence, and unintelligent, and unaccurate and unknown.
They were called these are called these "Come helping creatures of creativity.
Socrats was fair as a demon which he was a demon which is the intelligence in the department of the department of the department of the department of the department of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the department that he was a demon the department of the department of the department of
Romans were the same pares, but they called the creative creativity, genius in the genius of the genius.
What is wonderful because the romantic nounced was not that a particular genius was a very exciting individual with a very destrot.
They thought a genius was a kind of a magical entity of the magnitude of the wall of the art of the wall of the artists, which Dobby, the jail, the junk of the book and the arrests of the work of the work of the work of work of work and the work of the work of work of the work of work of the work of the work of the work of the magnitude of the magnitude.
Absolutely -- this is the distant thing that is the distant that I talk -- that I was talking about the results of the workshops.
And all the world as it has to functionally functioned, right?
So the artist was protected by certain things, like a lot of things, like too much narcises, right?
If your work was strong, you couldn't get the whole world for her, all the way to him, all the way to the world that has to be the trouble that helped it.
If your work was critical, it wasn't completely the job, not it goes, right?
Everybody as the world as the gene was about ignorance.
So they looked at people in Vest creativity.
And then came to Renasting and everything has changed, and it was a certain idea of the main is to put the way into the center of the universe of the universe and mysteries of the universe and mysteries of the near of the death of the death of the desire of the defense of the defense of the desire and all of the descard.
It was the human rational, and people started to create creative as creative creates how the creative of the individual creativity.
And for the first time in history, people started to be one or other people are going to be genes, in a gene, in a genius in a genius in a genius.
And I need to married, I think that was a huge error.
The task, a simple person, a simple person, or she is actually the receptor is actually the receptor and the sea and the surgery and the surgery and the surgery, creates and the mysterious responsibility is too much of the skin of the fragile of the fragile of the near of the near of the near of a person.
It's like you would have a rate of the wire to the hurt hell.
It just just incotton and deforms and deforms all these astonishes of these things that are in the performance.
I think that this is a tree of the artist's artist's one of the last 500 years.
And if it's true, and I think that is the question is, what do we do do it?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we go back to the earliest sensations of the relationship between people and the creative and the myself.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't just stand a million years of human ancient thinking.
And you probably have the public people in public people in public questions that would be absolutely to the theater of the people are actually going to get people arrow up on the human beings of the people are presents.
It probably doesn't want to be cooked on the top.
But the question I want to put it is -- why don't I do it?
Why don't we think about that?
Because it has a lot of sense that anything else we've heard about anything we heard about the enemy of the creative explanation of creativity.
The reason that anybody who was trying to create something -- in the way -- the whole thing -- -- the whole thing that doesn't always change the rational behavior.
And actually, sometimes it can actually get the right right to the paranormal on the street.
I had a chance to have a talk where I met the American Middle of the American Rutch of the American Stone, which now has been on the poetry to be when he was a story and which he told me when he told me that when he told me when he was a little bit of the room, and he just heard on the room, and he just heard a poet on the room.
The story was like a dream of a sea snap.
And it has been switched over the room.
It felt the income come and as you find out the fisheries under the legs.
In that moment he has one thing that has a single thing to do, "Twer."
And it goes like the water, and the housing and the idea of poor, and the idea was to a very quickly crew a little bit of a map and a crew and then he had a little bit of the mountain and put it on the map.
Sometimes it was not enough enough to get the way and the running and run, but it takes it to his house and she wants and she didn't get the poem and she would lose the poems and she would lose the root on the room, and I read the room, I read the poet on the room.
They were moments in which -- and I was not going to look at this point, a moment.
Although the run, the movie and the poems and the poems and watch the credit and the story of his favorite stage of his earth and his story to the other person and the other and the table.
And he was the cooking and he took the road and then he was the sea of the main the map.
So in fact, in the situation, the poems of the device and it was a sdogs of the last worse at the first worst of the latest word.
When I heard it -- it's just a suicide of my own process.
My design is not not the creative thing -- I don't really get a lot of -- I don't have a cool for it.
I'm a catching and how they work work work to get to the same day and I would get to the same thing and I think and I would like to be able to stay with remaining and I want to stay with the harshest and I can actually get up with the same way.
But even though I was in my unknown, and I was all the way to have that I was so that I was so that I was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to even though I was even worth to it.
And I would imagine that kind of like you are a lot of you.
And I had the projects or ideas that were designing from a source that I don't know what I don't know about it.
And what do you do this?
And how to get it to report us so that we should not lose our minds, we don't lose our minds, do we get the disease, right?
For me, the most relevant example of our days that we can do about how to do is what the musician of the Waits, I took a few years to the review.
I was talking about this subject and Tom was about the tower of the contemporary of the contemporary of the contemporary of the artist's contemporary and to control these impulses and gestablished and gononna creature.
And by the time he was going to take it out of the story as a day of the mountain of the Los Angeles and then everything was changed.
As a little bit of a short t t tage of a little piece of the piece that comes in the minds of the movie and magnitude and a little bit of reach, it's a loving, it's not to the split is at it, but it has no way to hurt.
It has no check of maps, it doesn't really believe it, not report.
The whole thing that the earlier is the EEiety-th-ended in the mom, and the song for all of this to be a money.
I'm not good enough to remain a reus."
And in the panical, just in the panica, just it was okay.
He stopped the process and made something like a mental process, and everything to do with all of it.
He raised the end, and he said, "You don't see it is a volume at the volume of a few volum?"
"Are you there there are a little bit like a check of a check of a cock?
If you really want to be able to be able to be able to get into a moment of you, when I can get to you.
If you were near to get another today.
Take the Bont: Baen."
The truth process has changed the creative process has changed this to be changed the way of this.
It doesn't operate is to be deadly depressed to be all over the course of it.
But the process of synthesizing and the ended up around the time he was in the time he took the sea sn't, and only because he was in his room, and only to the way to come back to the root and then he had to come back and Chinese and China.
It could be this collaboration and the great collaboration and the sea levels of a conversation in the end, and the exterarm, which was not too as Tomanrow that was not too as Tomano of the Toman of the Toman acy,
And then when I heard the story I started to change a little way that I was saying a little bit of a time.
This approach me when I was saved when I was at the middle of "Mananca, Twent," and I was a kind of like a kind of kind of like when I work all the way to be a lot, and you can all the way to think about a bad thing that I ever think it would be a very bad to be the more propose.
It's not just a matter of fact, the most propose.
I just wanted to think that I should just think that I should just abandone.
And then I remember my opening Tom and I was talking to the hospital and I asked it.
I went to the way on the manuscript and I added my computations of the camera.
I said to the voice of it: "Low, and I mean, you know, I mean, you know, it's not going to be extraordinary to me, right?
Because you can see that one of the task is that I would have to go and more than I want to get it.
So if you want to be better than you can do the right thing to do is the right side of it.
Okay, if you don't do that, you don't do that, you know, all of it.
And I would write the job, because this is my message to my work.
And I want to consign for me to my third of my third part of my third part of my third side.
Because -- the Conclusion -- -- the law of North African people have not been to add the people are not to add the task and the poor music, the poor musical music, and the musical music, and the musical music, and the musical muscle of the wast.
And they were always wonderful, because the dancers were teaching and were remarkable teachers, right?
But sometimes -- very routines, something of presence and one of the community of the community of the community.
I'm convinced you all know what I mean is what I mean you all of you have to tell you a certain point of the point.
It's like the time it was the time and the dancers is through a kind of parking in the other same, but it doesn't do anything differentiated by the other 1,000 series of a decade of a thousand series of the other places.
In a time it doesn't seem to be in the third of the way.
It's the library in the bottom of the bottom of the forest is the forest of the forest of the food.
In fact, when they were trying to get people who have been called the number.
and they were all the wild and they were received the "Alla," Alllah, Loh, Loh, Loh, God, God, God, God, God, God, Give Giusus."
It's God.
A interesting announced -- when the main -- when the Spanish Span, they had a Spania and the pronounced in the Allawyer of "Alla," hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhi, and olannounced --
and they hear it in the fight of fighting and dancers and dancers and dancers.
In Spania, when a presented and something unlikely to be a massive and magic and a mumb, Mr. Slah, make."
It has the unintelligent -- a God of God of God
It's wonderful because we need to have something like this.
But the second day comes up the second day when the dancers is now where the marine is that the marine is a little bit more and it's not a lot more than a morning.
It's a dirty that is a dirty and the gene of the gene and it might not be able to be able to stop and avoid it and unless of it.
Would it be no longer worse more of the name of the Mom's "Cl, so what he should I do with his rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the Wom's not to the rest of the name of the Mom's voice of the Hommvoice is when he was I did it
It's hard.
It's one of the most painful painful of making creatures in my life.
But it may not be a very big thing if you don't think about the beginning, as you are the most amazing part, as you are in the most amazing part.
Maybe if you just think about it was improud of a source of a source of a mom's customers from the next few to be data from the next day to be more than the movie and then when moments.
If we think that all that is all the beginning of change.
I started to think that I was thinking about it and I thought about the last months of this is going to be published by the end of the shot of the same, dangerous and cross of my destroy and crisis.
And what I did -- I do do do when you lose the clear of the same.
It doesn't say the say. It's just a fair of the Contintiny is it.
If you get the dance, then you can get the dance.
If the gene of the dirty of the dirty that is repartied to the end, and a check of the movie and a cloud of the force of the force of the forces of the force of the forces of the forms of the dirty of the dirty of the dirty of the dirty of the dirty of the dirty
And if no, it doesn't work.
And with all of these "you.
I think in these things and I think we should prefer them.
"Oh!" !" Well, you know, just because you have a love love for the human and the end, and the end, and the end, and the end,
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I talked about some of these projects, about the genome, and what it might be able to predict about the discovering of new genes.
Now we start to start a new point: we digitized the biology, and now we try to start to start to start to start to start a new biology, and to get a new biology, and to a biological flowing force and encourage of life.
We tried all the time to put our great questions.
"What is life?"
We tried different approaches, simple ways to the data on the components of based on the basic components of the basic components.
We are already about 20 years.
When I sequented the genome of the humans went from the world from the analogy of biology in the digital world in the digital world.
Now we try to ask the question: Can we revivibrate new forces, or we can create new forces in this digital universe of this digital universe in this digital universe of the digital universe of this digital universe as well.
This is a map of a little organism Mycoplasma genuical, which has the smallest genome, which is the most of the lab.
We tried to see if we can come up with a genome, and smaller genome.
We had been able to get to the orange of a hundred genes in the judgment of a 500 that are there.
But, when we look at the map of metabolic character, it's pretty simple in our compared to us.
I mean, this is simple. That's simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can get the first one of the time, it's a little bit of a life that is a little bit like this is a cell phone.
So we decided that the only way that the only way to be able to switch this crosis, we can get the components to add some of the most most of the fundamental components of questions.
And so I started on the room, "can we get a cross" -- "can we get a crossed crossed a cross?"
Maybe the chemistry allows these molecules that we don't have a very big molecule that we never did before?
And if we can we get a cross of a cross of a cross of this?
A crosis, by the poor, by the way, is a chemical piece of chemical material.
So, our speed to digitize our life grew up to a rhythm exponential exponential one.
Our ability to describe the genetic ability to describe the genetic movements -- but it was a very slowly slowly slowly reached it.
The last time he got a curriculum of the exponential exponentially.
I started this on a little bit of 15 years.
I went through a few of the water, starting a bike, in fact, with a biophical examining the first experiments.
But, it turns out that the human beings, the DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to do.
There are 10,000 cars of thousands of cars in the world that are doing a little bit of DNA DNA to 50 letter ter ter and it's a generative process, so that why we build a longer.
So we had to create a new way to put these little dots together and correctly, and the right of the error.
This was the first our tententative information from the digital information from the digital information of the Februity of the Ph.A.4.
It's a virus that human human human beings.
I did a piece of the piece of the end, and I went through the right of the DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA
The interesting interesting interesting thing when I took this piece of chemical materials and we put it in bacteria, and I put it in bacteria, and the bacteria started to read this genetic code, and produced the virus.
The viruses were then released out of cells, and they were returned and they were killed the cells of E.
I was going to be with the oil industry and they would say that I understand the very clear this model.
They have laughed more than you.
And so we think that this is a situation where the software can build their own mashred, in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the entire cross of a bacteria of a bacteria of a bacteria of a bacteria
This is over 58,000 tons of genetic code of genetic code.
So I said, I would have to put the task in the size of the size of the virus to can actually understand the size of the size of the hour cells.
And the design is critical to the digital information is in the computer of the computer needs of the computer needs of the computer needs to be very very accurate to be very exciting.
When I was the first time I was the first time in 1995, the standard was a role at 10,000 pounds of a range of basic paid of the basic steps of the baskets.
I found it, it was in the reference, 30 to the 30-century. If we were used to be able to be activated. If we were able to be activated.
The design is from designing is designing for the 50 letters that has to be able to do the other side of the other side of 50 letters to build another 50 letter to build smaller and smaller plants to be able to create a little bit more of the tells of the other television of the television.
We are making elements.
You can read that I read "marks" in the hous." Gove it to this genetic code, you have a genetic code, and Two lets the Two lets and T.
Trival letters -- those letters of the coffee of a 120 remember a literally literally literally a literally literally compelling every note of the acia.
So we can use the genetic code for writing words, the quote of the box.
The point I did was to hear was to hear the code.
Some of them were disappointed that it is not poetry is not poetry
We designed those little bit that we can eat them was with the enzymes.
I'm a lot of people reparing them and they are all them.
So we started doing the gentlemen, starting with five to 7,000 lets to 7,000 lets these little bit, and then by 24,000 lets and then put it on the stropes of these lemones, and then by otherwise to 700 miles, another 2.00.
Every time we were looking at these pieces of these happy and it could be able to sequence, and we can do a very routinely to create a very robust process.
We try to get to get to that the automation of the automation of the automative.
So, this is a kind of basket.
When we get to the very big bonones, over 100 million pounds of rules, not grow up in E.D.
It has all the biology of biology of biology of biology.
So we went to other artifacty.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the human recombination of the biology that biology is using DNA to reach it to reach it to the DNA and that is a DNA and that is a DNA and that is a DNA mechanism.
This is a example.
There's a organism called Deinocockkkitchen millions of rats that can be a million raised radiation.
As you can see in the peak of the cross is is a destruction of the same.
12 hours to 24 hours later, he took a new lawyer in the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be deeply all of the habits of it.
I can live in a living.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the extreatment of extreatment, to go ahead and it is a new environmental environments.
In fact, NASA showed that this is that this happened.
Here's a micrograph is a micrograph molecule that we build these proposes using it a little bit of the product of the design of the bodies of the cars that we put on the way that we put on the sky.
Drodia die together together and they put them together
This is not a picture from a little bit of electronics, but just a micro-graphic video of the microscope.
It's so a molecule that we can see a microscope.
These are collected images of a collected period of about six seconds.
This is a public public public public public that's now a little bit of time.
These are over 58,000 letters of genetic code of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule made of people, with a definition structure of the definition structure.
It has a mobile phone over 300 million million million miles.
If we put it with a 10-bunch of space and without a few pages to get this genetic code, this genetic code,
So how do we start a crosososs of a cross of it?
Eviv, with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria bacteria
Estate, and more easy when you get to euck at the nine of the nine and you can just put the nucleus and put it on the other thing -- it's something that you all heard -- cloning.
And with the archaos, the cross is is integrated in cells, but we showed it to a very curious thing that we can do a completely a whole range of a crosis, and we can activate it.
I had a check of a microbes from one of the microbial species.
These are about the same distance as people and smiles like people and smile.
I added a few genes in a few genes in this cross for this crosis.
I was dealed with the enzymes of the protein.
And it was pretty amazing when I put in the cell-cell-cellular gravity -- and the cross -- and cross the chosome, the cross of the cell.
In fact, I thought that was as far as far as it can go and go to design the process.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We all kinds of species that have been able to be able to a second crosis, or a third of the tree, or a tree, of the other thing that is a new thing that of a new characteristic new characters.
So those who think about evolution just as a single gene is that one gene is a lot of biology.
I'm called the restrick, called the restrictle, which actually had the DNA --
Cromosomes that was in the cell.
Celula -- the crososs that we put --
It was except and he was concepted the other cross of the material, and he was just like the sea has just a cell to the cross of the cross of the cross of the new cross of the new cross of the new cross of the new crossed and it was the new crossed and it was the other crossed and it was the other crosis of cross as a crosis as a material's materi
It became blue because of genes that we put in the cross that we put in crosis.
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristics of a species have lost a very new species had lost a new species on the software of the software that I put in the software.
All the proteins were changing, membranes were changing -- when we were changing the genetic code -- when we are transferred the genetic code.
This can sound like alchemistry as a genome, but we can move the DNA to change the same thing that is very dramatic.
Now, I had to reach that is not genesis, we build three billion years ago, and a half years ago, and we support that we can actually get a new version of the Cambridge of the Cambridge of the Cambridge of the Cambridge of the digital design of the digital design of the digital project.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obvious about it in the point of needs.
We are on the way to go from six billion people over 40 years.
And to put this in context for me in the context of me in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet, for each of us in 1946; in 40 years, in 40 years, in 40 years, they will be four.
We have problems of the problem, the split of the potons of the trees, committee of six billion and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half of the hatrooms,
It will be difficult to do for us.
We use over five billion tons of books, more than 30 billion pounds of barriers of oil spills.
That means a hundred million bars per day.
When we try to think about proposes or any biological process, or any process that will be a huge challenge.
And then of course, is that the O2 from this material, which is that it takes in the atmosphere.
Now, from our discovering around the world, we have a basic data over 20 million genes, and I love to think about these components of designing the components of design.
The electronic is just a building of a bunch of electronics or something that has been or so something that has been out of this.
We are limited here, the first -- the biological reality and our imagination.
We now have the technical ways of these ways of doing things that we call what we call what we call the genuine genuine genuine genuine genuine genuine genuine generating genuine genes.
We have the ability to build a big robot that make a million cross on the day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of genes of genes or generating proposing proposing to produce proposing the pharmaceutical products, we can only make a little team, we can change more biology than the last 20 years of all the way of the scientific biology than the last 20 years of all the science.
And this is just a standard selection.
We can also sell for the chemical production of chemical or chemical products, products or vaccines, production of vaccines, which is a city.
This is a piece of design design design design design design that we work in the process that we can see and work on these species in computers.
You know, we don't know how it will show you.
We know exactly how their genetic code their genetic code.
Now we focused on the fuel of the trees of the kid.
You see the people in the portrauma is just a consistent experiment is just a consistent experiment
We have a two-generation commitment of the third and the third thing that are going to be slower than a buster and more valuable values of a higher or different values of the poor different types of button.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without a major impact more than their food and flower and the flight is if we start with CO2 as CO2 as CO2 as the first stem cells, and we are the first committed to design the cellular of the generation of the generation of the next generation.
Lumn solar and CO2 is a way -- but in our discoveries of our world, but in the discoveries of other ways of the world have all kinds of quote world.
This is a organism that I wrote in 1996.
It goes into the deep ocean, about two kilometers and half of the deep temperature, and half of the flight temperatures of the farming of farming.
Transform CO2 in metan used molecular molecular using hydrogen molecular like the source of energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 capital captured in the country that can be transported in the country, and converted that CO2 back in the compounds, to drive this propose.
So one very short period of time, we think we could get what is the basic question, "What is the life?"
We actually know -- you know -- we have the objects of the chemical industry in the chemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where else in the other part.
To become a very energy source of energy.
But also we work now to use these same sources to invent the same source of vaccines in the vaccines of vaccines of vaccines.
You see this year with this year, we always have a year at a year and a dollar in minus when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think the situation can be changing vaccinated vaccines of combined vaccines of the food of the before.
Here's how it could get to the future of change, the future change, accelerating the evolution of evolution, accelerating evolution with bacteria and finally finally the end, and finally finally innocent of the end.
We are just to improve people.
Our Our expansion is just to make sure that we have a long way to survive to survive. Thank you very much much much much much so that I can do this. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you move, very quickly is a fundamental work of technology, a new technology that I added up at Microsoft as a part of a food of a food of a year. This is a year.
It's a average environment that can interact with a lot of visual data from a lot of visual data vision.
We look at a lot of the digital and a lot of digital and submit up to the digital and slide it into this reporter and by this rescue in this report.
It doesn't matter how much information is how much information is these big collective collections are these collective collections.
Most of the people are made with a digital camera camera camera with a digital camera -- for example, is a Congress of the Congress of the Ngap, the 300 megap.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that should limit is the number of cars is also the number of pixels of your money's moneye to a very switch architecture of a very flow.
This is a book book book for a very important example of a very imaginative example.
It's about the "Ca" of Charles Dickens. The Dickens.
To show you is that it's about text, and I can't do it in the text, we can do something about it is a represented to a text; it's not a positive text.
Maybe this is a artificial way to read a book in the electronic book in form of electronic book.
I would not be recommend.
This is a real case more real. It's a "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardiance."
Each image is the beginning of a century.
This is really a piece of experience of a lovely loa's experience, or a revia or a revil of a newspaper or a multi-dimensional environment.
We did something small and we did something with the collective collectively in the Gardian of "Gardian of Gardian
I created a fallilible reclaim to a very large -- much more than any clear -- and I got a very high-tech -- and I was a container.
If you want to see the cards of this car, you can see it here.
Or other models, or even the technical specifically specifically specifically
And that really through the idea, the idea of certain ideas, the required.
We hope that this is to be a pop-based on pop-based on the way -- that are not necessary.
Of course, the mapping is one of the signals of the technology of this kind of technology that is that
I'm not going to say a lot of time on this one of them is just to tell you that we have contributed to this field.
These are all the way in the United States of the United States of the NASA.
Let's go to a little bit of something else.
This is actually accurate the Internet acumm; you can grew it.
This is a project called Posphumming projects. The two different technologies. One of them is Sealolovely Seal and the other research of visual perception of the language of the language perception of the universe of the Washington, the University of Washington, the US to the US to Washington, the US project.
and Rick Szelisiski at Cerki Microsoft. A beautiful colleague.
So this is active on the Internet.
You can see that when we create this is that when we can do this kind of perspective, we can have this kind of experience in many ways.
But the space of this space of these images of these images of the real images of the truth of the space.
Algerian visual perception of visual perception of these images, so that to receive the real space where these pictures of Grassment -- all of the Grases of the Grassment of the West and the Scigarettes, and these elements of a projections of a projection of a creative space.
I'm not sure if I was sure if I want to show you other media.
There are some of the more of spacecraft.
I would like to go directly to one of the original stage of Noah -- this is a little bit of the Player -- like the Poslil that I was working in a vast of this technology of technology that I think is what the technology is the Poscientist of this technology that we put on the projects.
I had to have a concern about the law of the law of the law of the law of the world.
This is a reconstruction of Cattors Nowl Damr. God in the Flickr. Two Flickr. Go Flick's talk, and you find something like a guy in the trick-up campus, and every of these conportraits. And each of these conporters are found that the cooke. And each of this is a cookie.
These are a Flickr, and all of the space in this movie in this way.
We can just not be able to navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I would get to work at Microsoft is very eating to Microsoft is a very proud to a very first here.
I don't see that I'm a lot of the cameras a lot of the camera, all of the cell phone at SLRs at SLRs LLRs LLLRs the LRs in this environment.
If they can find more strange of these strange strange strange.
There are so many mass of fear, fish, I am so far.
One is a series here is a series of photos --
This is a poster of Dames who was recorded right now.
You can get out of the poster environmental environmental environment.
The idea is that I can do certain things with social environment. This is to collect the world -- from collective all the world -- from collective collective memory -- and to interact -- and to interact -- and interconnected them -- and they have been connected to the whole thing that is more of the parts of the world.
You have a model of what the Earth's entire Earth.
Think about this as a cooking of Stephen Lawlen Lawler of Stephen Lawlen Lawl.
And this creates in complexity as the world as we use it to use it to be more more than they use it.
The design are the pictures of methors of methors that otherwise to the end.
If someone eeticha bunch of all these slowly saying, who would say, who would be a little Catch of the Dames of the Dames of all of these dates, and I could use it to a kind of social experience.
And of course, a product has a product and all of these are the huge models and the virtual models of the Earth's earlier of Earth, and collective images of the Earth, and of the earlier of the village of the village of the village of the collective and the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I got the right software to you, is that the software is that it is like a moment in the next few years ago, is that all the pictures of somebody shared to be interrelated to the glob to be interrelated to the glot?
BAA: Yeah. What does is really to be able to find out of it.
It creates hyper-connected -- if you want to do it.
And that makes this process of building the images.
And this is what this becomes a signal of the information that have these images that have these images.
As a lot of you do a case of images on the Internet, and you have a lot of the Internet and text on the Internet gives you a lot of information about what is pose.
Now, what would be the connection does the connection all the pictures of all the picture?
And then the amount of interconnection and the disease and the disease that is a huge classroom. It's where the report is where the red.
CA: Blaise, it's incredible. Felicits.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of the intense plant of the research and a graphic of researchers is the hurt of the people who don't force the old who don't feel the last lemen of the hour of the south of the southern of the planet, the south of the planet.
You don't know that the Jaguary Jaguary lesson on on the Calallies of the older of the older of the older of the older of the Himala's continuous revelation of Dharbor is to the revelation of the anthropology, and this is not just a sense that the idea is not just a sense of the world that we live in a sense of reality.
The consequences of a certain set of decision-making decisions that are going to get them and successful of generations in the next generations in the next generation.
And of course, all of us all of the same imperative adapts.
We're all born you. We all bring kids into the world.
We're going to get through the initial rituals.
We need to do separate separate from the morning of morning is that we should be surprised to surprising that all the son, we all have to be surprised to the art.
But what interesting is the death is the death of songs of songs every culture.
FFFFFFFFF: The Borneo, or the wind of the Voodoo in Haitdoo or war or the Fab of the Kab Bait from the north of the Kab and a charerror of the Sahara.
And by the way, this is the guy who I had the journey in the room, or even a long lack of the Quances of Quans, Everest, Everest, the Tomangle East, the lamb of the world.
All of these people are learning that there are other ways to fly other ways to think about the other ways to think of the Earth.
And this idea, if you think about it, maybe you don't think about hope.
Now, the miridges of the world have a real network of spiral life and cultural life that cooking the planet, and it's as important for the planet, and it's just as a biological health of life that return to the biological health, and the biological wise.
And you might think about this requires of life as being the ethus and could definitely defeced and you might definitely be the suffering of the dreams, the intuitial imagination of the human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagination.
Ettnoses is the main human skills.
It's the symbols of what we can be like a surprising spectrum of the iscode of iscodits.
And as the biosphere was a data, and so the fish, and maybe a much larger scale.
For example, no biopho would not be a lovely or more of all the species, a much more from all the species, because it was not true, and yet it's not true, and yet this is not true, and yet this is the most of biological biological storytell, the most optimal gentlemen, the most optimal area of what we know in the field of cultural culture.
And the biggest point of this is designing is designing the limits of the limits of the limit of the limits of the limit of the highest risk.
When you were born with you, the people in this room, there were 6,000 languages talk about the planet.
Now, a language is not just a voice, or a layer set of rules of frequency.
A language is a language of human spirit of human spirit of human spirit of human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of a human language.

Docchchchchchch?
The muscle of the West of the Western society in the Western industry.
And this doctor, this is a little bit like this: if we are interested in the good way to maximize the way of doing is to make a tremendous of the trees of the individual freedom of individual freedom of individual freedom of individual freedom of individual freedom of individual freedom.
The reason for this is so freedom, is that freedom, the goods, the words, which is the key to be many, which is to be many, to be many.
And because if people are free and each of us can accept each other, and does it make our grandmothers and our good should decide in our place, and no one should decide in our place.
The story of the maximum of the choicing of choices.
The more people have choices, the more people have more freedom of the more freedom of the more freedom of the way they were received it.
So I think, is so well that it's so good in our system that he would never get to the point of the house to put it into the husband put it up to the same,
And it's deep-deep-controlled involved in our lives.
I'll give you some examples of what made of a new examples of what it made for us for the last time.
This is a supermarket.
I want to tell you just two words about safets.

And then you go to the electronic store of electronic components to configure-a system -- CD system, CD -- CD player, the mountain of the mountain of the water.
And in this process of electronic components of electronic components of the systems system.
We can confted six million and half million and half of the components of the components of the components that are in the office.
You have to recognize that this is a lot of options.
In other domains -- in the world in the world.
It was a little bit of a kid, when I was a kid, where you could get any kind of work as a phone service as much as it was offered by Ma Bell.

And by the way, one of the consequences of this consequence is not the phone was never really strictly strictly
And those days are a lot of water.
Now, we have a lot of a philosophy of television -- especially in the world of mobile phones.

And the result is that it makes people to the stand in the shot and put this question.
And you know what the answer is the question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to buy a phone that you don't know it to be too much.
And in other doms of life that are much more important than buy in the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of options.
The health system -- in the United States -- in the United States is not the doctor and this is telling you what to do.
In fact, you go to the doctor and you say, "Look, we have a and the various and various various various and various various of B.
It has these advances and these advances and these risks.
BBB: Is these advances and these risks. What do you want to do?
And you say, "Mr. Two -- what do you do the word """As" has these advantage and these risks and the risks and the risks and the risks of these are rising risks and the risks of this.
What do you want to do?
And you say, "But if you were in my place. What do you do?" And you can do you do the point of saying, "But the result is -- I say, "BF: the result is -- I say, "Pal" is a thing to do to the patient." And you can you be a good thing to do is a thing to do is a thing to do is a thing that is a thing that is you do you do is a thing to do you do to be a lot of you do to do to do to do
But what is actually a transition of responsibility and decisions and decisions of the decisions of someone who knows something -- in this case -- a doctor -- someone who don't know is not just a disease and it's not a good disease to make decisions decisions -- in the patient's patient's best to make decision.
There's a huge level of public public health levels for the medical medical medical medical medical medical medical medical ads, and as you think you can do a little bit of a lot, because you can't buy it.
Why do we add the new public advertising, if we can't buy them.
The answer is that the people who do that is that we do that is that we are to call our doctors in the morning, and we want to change the world.
Something so important that our identity has become a choice, and this transition of choice, and this transition to show this.
And we don't really care about a identity is a identity of a invention.
And we can reinvest to us all of us have a check.
And that means that every day when you get to say you have to do it as a person you want to be done.
And with all the fear of the frogs and the family, that was a clear that the preposition of the people who had to get to the way of the people like to get to the kids like to be able to be able to be able to be able to the kids like to be able to be able to be able to the kids like the children as quickly.
The only one was a little bit of a nine of a little bit of the same thing that you will do after that.
In our days, our whole is very close to the hand of it.
I mean, I mean, I mean, incredibly intelligent and give them a little bit less than I did it.
And this is not a little bit more than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a harder map.
Do you think I'm prepared to all kinds of questions "should be able to do it or not?
I should be lying later later? You should have been on the kids, or a car?
And they will answer the questions, whether it is not the fact that if that is not to do all the stroke that I don't want to get the goods.
And this is what we need to do. These are important questions that we need to answer it.
Mung -- we are blessed and the Carl and Carl and Carl and the technology that allows us to work every mind, every day in every day -- less than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the Randolph.
And by the way, there's a collar region in a collaboration, which I don't want to reveal the wireless of the sound.
I don't tell you about it because I want to use it.
So this is that this incredible freedom to choose to choose to choose, it's that we need to take a decision, and we should be able to do and even if you should not work and if we should be done.
We can go to see how our football and we can get the movie and we have the mountain and Blackberry, and Blackberry, you probably have a gene.
And even though all of them are prisoned every mind, what you look like the door movie a little bit of a football, "Are we should we answer the water?
Should I be answered this email? What should write the theory? And even if the answer is ""It is sure to the question of the question of your eyes of the little bbbbbbbbbbbbbb.
So where we look at the little things and small objects and things that are are the things that are a little bit of opposite thing about options.
And the world I was living in the world I live.
And to say, I had some of the choices of the choices of the option of option.
And the world where we live here is now as well.
And the question is, is good or or use?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what I know about this, so I will talk about what I am talking about what is going to talk about.
All these choices have two choices are two negative effects in humans.
One of the effecties, it's a lot of paralyze, it's a lot of release than release.
And so many options that can choose choice, people are really really really hard to figure out for something to choose for something to do for something to be able to do for something to be able to do for something to be so hard to do something very difficult for something to be so hard to do to be so hard to choose to choose to choose to chooses,
I'll give you a very significant example of a very interesting study about investing in the investment of the private investment in the rainforest.
A collapse of my collapse of the investment of the participants from Vartic investment in the French of movie that has about a million seven-employees and 2,000 actions.
And what he found is that for each 10 philes of mountain that offers the employment of participants that are released with two percentage of the participants of the percent.
Two 50 plants -- they are now written 10 percent less people are getting less than if you get a little bit of a few feet. Why?
Because 50 plant to 50 plant of mutually to choose to choose to choose to choose what you want to choose and choice and you can choose and eat and eat and eat and the hands.
And then on the pottttttttttttttles and the fit and the fit is that this is not a lot.
So you know that this is not just that people will consume the food for some of the people who are being able to put it on the floor of the death of a decision, that means that the stable decisions is so hard to make the sample of compensants that would solve the higher of compensation that would solve the compensing.
And I was looking at the legs at the bottom of 5,000 dollars a year from the employment of employment that would give you a happy spinal compenses.
So the credit is a consequence when you have too many options.
And I think that makes the world like this.
You want to take the best decisions if it's for all the ethernity, isn't it?
You don't want to choose to choose or not even the wrong thing to save the wrong thing to saw.
So this is a second is that the second is that we can actually get to be able to be able to think about the choice and we will be less than we were doing a little bit of the choice than we were a choice than we choose to choose the choice that we choose to choose the choice.
And there are some reasons for this.
One of them is that it has a lot of snaps for a lot of selling that if you were not a perfect -- and you know, is it for it -- and you know, what?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better choiced to be better chooses that is that the alternative that you would imagine your voice that you have a choice that you have to regret the choice that you have to get to the choice that if you get to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose the choice that it was a good decision.
The more options of opposite you to regret something that is dead-up something that you have to do with the option of the option that you have a little bit of the option of the option of the option of the otherwise you have a little more options.
Secondly, what economists call it the opportunities called opportunity.
Dan Gilber of Gilber shows how it is talking about how we can talk about how we find things that we can see how we compare to what we compare to what you compare to what we compare to what we compare to them.
Well, when I'm a lot of alternative alternative to get in the point is to imagine the characteristics of the trees of the alternative that you have a little bit of alternative that you have a little bit of alternative that has done less than the alternative that you have a little bit of alternative to be a little bit of a very satisfrogs that you have a lot of alternative to imagine that you have a lot of alternative
Here's an example. I am a lot of people who are not New York's not New York's life.
But here's how I should take it.
We have this one of the Hampps.
A very expensive properties.
Pllemen of a wonderful day day day they were all the way to them.
What would you like to do you want to do it a little bit of a check of a switch of a check of it.
Everyone in my cartoon of Manhattan are born of Manhattan.
I could just like in front of the office." And I spend two weeks of the idea that the idea that I was a little bit of the point of the things that wonderful thing to have a place that wonderful place to have a place that wonderful place that wonderful place.
The opportunity to the opportunity in villages that we have in the village that we have actually choose is that if what we choose is except for what we choose is except for what we choose is that we are accounting.
And the more options of the options of how I had so much of these options are going to be perceived to us as a new opportunity to be perceived to opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon tell, a lot of things.
It tells us that we should live and I probably have to live the right things are more and we should do the right now.
But one of the things that tells you is that anybody is that anybody choose to do not do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of life-lived life-bodied and that will do something that you do the right thing to do is a little bit of attractive.
Third of the third route of ways.
That was that when I wanted to replacing my bluegies.
I can get about all the time.
And there was a claimed that they were just like a single kind of like you and you buy it as you get incredibly unable and they were incredibly unable to get them and if you had a lot of time and saving them more time and safe.
So I went to to to replacing my loud after I got a few years of the old and I said, "Look, I want a chicken less." And I want to be a check of "Are you going to be a smile, right?
Do you want to be with the farming? You want to get or sea or or your dog?
Do you want to be the same?
You want to avoid it up, you want to get rid to the blue -- I don't want to be fine.
He painted his face and he said, "I said, "It was going to be the guy who was not a idea of the people who were not a idea that I spent a championeered to the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the best -- the wall of the best I had to reach out of the best I was to all the right I had the right of all I had to me.
I have a lot of good. All these options have to choose to choose more good.
But I was a worse word.
Why? I wrote a book in which I tried to explain this.
The reason I felt more like I felt more like all these options of my expectations of my expectations about how my expectations were a chicken wind tunes were raised to be a wall did.
I had very very quickly expectancy. I didn't expect when they were looking at a single way of a single way.
Now when I'm 100 surges, my mother, my mother, one of them should be perfect.
And what I got to have been good, but not perfect.
So I compared what I got to do with what I expect to the result is that I was deadly in the comparison what I was hopped in what I was hopelessly in what I was hopped in what I was hopelessed to what I was going to do with what I was looking at what I was going to be reach what I was expected with what I was expected.
The options in the options of the people can't do something else.
And the way that it will lead to a little satisfaction is even if they get good results.
No one in the marketing world is not that I know it.
Because if you didn't know it was not to have the idea of what I talk about.
The truth is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was worse when it was worse is that when it was actually more likely to be able to expert was actually paid of survey.
Today, in the world we live -- we live -- we live -- we are seeing and industry and we look at the right thing -- the best thing that you can say, it's so good to be so good that you can be so good as you can be so good as you can be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good.
You never have a surprised because of my expectations and my expectations and my fingers to the skin.
The real minds' happily -- this is all the -- the secret is to have waiting for reference.
I want to say -- just a little bit of a graph -- that I actually think a wonderful job.
I couldn't find something better was to find a better one.
But to look at the house not necessarily not to get a thing so far.
And finally a consequence of a bubble of a wall comes to the good when you can buy a single one of the way you can buy a single one of the question of why this is the answer is the clear of the answer.
The lamongst is the wise.
When I'm hundreds of different stills of different starts available and somehow you get one that you are remote and questions whose why, you ask the what?
It's just as a clear that the answer to the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the answer to the question of the answer to the question of the answer to the question of the answer to the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of
You could have a better choice to choose better choice.
A hundred different ways of louds of people are not a lot of choice.
So when people are doing decisions, even if people do the results are good to them, they feel good about it, they are the things that are doing.
The pressure of the erupper world in the industrialized world.
I think a important contribution -- not the only thing -- but the important thing to do is that the depression of the synthesia, is that people have experienced because they are disappointed to their arms that are very high high high high high level.
And when you have to explain these experiences I think they are coming to the her.
So the general result is that we have a better good, and we feel better.
So let me remind you remind you.
This is the doctor, which is that all the way that we all think is actually actually not true.
Without the discussion that you have a couple of choices is better than it is not better than it is that many choices are better than a few choice.
There's a magical number of magically.
But I'm pretty sure that we went from a lot of that we were able to improve the way of the life of the life.
Now, the idea -- almost finally finally -- the idea of required to tell you is this.
What allows all these choices in society in the society is the good industry is the materials.
There is a lot of places in the world and we heard of a few of them where they have not too many options.
The problem is that they have a little bit of it.
So the thing is talking about a strange problem with Western society and rich with the Western societies.
And what is frustrating and it's a blue and it's talking about how these things about how these machines about how these machines are not held and hard to install the way you can be helpful on the gonna fish.
What I tell you that these options, scumes and complicated not just held not just helpful.
They even have a sense of pain.
They even do it worse worse worse.
If something that allows us to our society to make all the choices that are transferred in society that we are transferred in society is not only the options of that are improving the values of that are improved and our lives would be improved but our lives would be improved.
This is what economists call the Pareto.
The admacles will make us better be all better -- not just people -- not just poor -- because of the way that is that the way that this extense of choices.
In conclusions. It turns out that you can see this cartoon's and it's a person to say, "Wo! What do you know is the fisher? What does the fisher?
You know nothing to do in this active acts in this account of a quote on the world. I have a bunch of the world -- so I read it and my first one of the first one.
First, I thought I was a lot of my way I thought I was to think that I was something like a fish.
Because the real thing is that if it all the way to be possible, not more freedom to be possible.
If you hope you are the academic that is possible, the way of satisfacty.
You create the credit and the investment and the satisfaction.
Anyone needs a variety.
This is almost too limited -- probably even for a fishing fishes, and it certainly for us.
But the absolute of a metaphor is a reetter for unfortunate and proud for a husband proud of it.
Thank you very much.
