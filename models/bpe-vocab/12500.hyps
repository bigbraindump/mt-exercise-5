It's very exciting.
This is the top of the Gending.

And the 10 poet of the first year I was the first time for the first time.
And this is the picture of ATTTTTT.
It just a little bit of the camera is going to the camera
It's a very first of the first of the most of the people who were in the lab in Los Angeles of the HHis S, and the LED, the His in Los Angeles.
In other words, when I was looking at the top 10 minutes of the foot of the sea as a very quickly, which is a very different way.
I don't know that if this is the most of the most most of the mother, when he was a little bit of the first one of the first place.
I mean, I had a lot of social interaction of the environment of the environment.
And after about a little bit of a little bit of the problem with the problem that had to do with these days, these little girls -- these little girls -- these little girls are the poorest of the war --
The whole thing is on the surface of a million people who are the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the skills of the board of the does.
Now, the engineers of the road to these days, and I can't get the depression of the details of the same.
But I can do this for when they are now going to have the only thing that is the same kind of a super-raised products.
So as 2-year-old is 24, more and more and more of the poverty, those are the same, and those are the same.
And one of the people of the women of the NBBB, L, the NBB, he was a little bit of the same.
So the main the same, and the mountain of the 14 million people have been remarkable to the water into the space of a space of water
This was the result of the result.
This is more interesting to think about the National CO2 percent of the Internet, and about 20 times the road, and they have been able to get a lot of time.
So we have been about about 50 percentage of 50 percent.
We had to get the same, and what we have is.
We have the remarkable thing I had to remain the room.
And now we are the great immune of the crisis.
The next one of the World BBBBBBBBBB.
Now we will look at the time, and we have to get to the data and I have to get the data and we are going to be able to get to the university of the universe that are the universe.
Now, of course, as a way, as those who would remind that of the conversation of the things that we can also see the same thing.
I think that the fact that it's a very difficult thing to do is that we have a sense of the things that we have been interested in House of HHHis L.
I will take the sample of a Cathley of the Angelelellow, I think that I was a lot of the work of the world -- I think that the world was not the remarkable to the demand the same, and the demand the demand the demand the demand and the deep are not as our desire and the determine is not as we have to remarkable to the debate our demand the remarket.
Thank you.
I want to start with you to hear about the child's mother, when you get the mountain.
And as you can find what they do to get to the people to get to the same, and you can get to the enter and you can also see how to the expansion and to the expansion and to the expensive and the expensive and the expensive and the exexpensive and the exexpensive and the expensive and the expensive and the exexpensive.
The deep is the right is the impression of how we do a lot of the world of the world in the world of the world
So to look at the end of the Democrats of this conference of our emotions with our physical and the challenge of the Sweden, and my infinite -- and my mother, and I started to get a poor I started to get to the presence of the demand if I was a strong to the demand if I was a lot of time to make a lot of the demand to the deep that we could be a very few of the people to make to make a lot of the demand the compensand the deep to the depression of the depresside, and the depression of the demile of the commission of the commission of the interviewar that I was a very few dad of the foundannowar that we have a little bit of the compopopopopopopopopoooooote
Would we do that?
The question was this is the question I was the great thing I had to explain the explained Spitch Spitch Spitch Spppits.
And the great Sweden, Sweden, it's a very demand a little bit of a sea of a same.
They can be required by the way, they can be remain the surface of the deep and the only one of the electrodes and a space and a space of a space of a space of a space of a space of a space of a space of a space of a space of a space of a space of a space of a space of the water can be a space of a space of a space of a space
The more important is that it's like the wild and so you can get the same, you can get a lot of money as well.
And the Hellot's mom of a new kind of new idea, we have the new idea.
And then the same thing that these are more and more and more and the whole thing is the other parts of their own lives, and the other parts of our own lives, and we can start to explore our own and we can find the opportunity to find out the street.
I will start with the expensive to the possibility.
This is the reason to make the conference of the talk, and if you look at a very high school in a very small step, if you look at the other hand.
These are the same kind of work are a lot of the other words.
So if I have one one of them are really interesting.
If they are the conference, and they will become a conference and they can become a demand they can become a demand the same.
And you can feel the expanded and the remarkable and the end.
We realized that one of the problems of the problems of all of the problems is that we can use the demand we can use a sense of how we have a lot of the money we could be a sample of a pound of the water and the water and the water is a little bit of a young woman
In this case, we have three Niiiika slap of the poorest of the poorest of the center of the middle of the same.
If we have a little bit of the same, we can get into the same.
There are also also interesting to see for education, as a scientist, and the language of language, and the language that we want to be able to find out how to make sure sure that the things that we can see the same thing as well.
So here we -- this is a little bit of the Hononone; they do with a great phenomenon of the planet.
This is a good newspaper of the things that are the most of Swedening Sweden.
And then in every single single core of the first steps was a little bit of Sweden, and the same, and the things are the same, and they are the sample of a demand a little bit of a same.
And then the year of 20 seconds in the century of the forest and you have a new kind of a new kind of debate and and so we are the possible.
Thank you.
These are the same are the patients who had the opportunity to the Middle Last to the Middle and I had to get a very uncomfortable to get a very uncomfortable to get a very unuseful solution.
He did the mountain.
And one of the interesting things are the interesting thing about this is not like the people don't have to do with people who don't have to get a lot of people who have to get the structure.
All of you have to have the word "'" and "You know what it is.
This is the other people are going to get to the light.

DM: It's a story with the story of how the vision will be the same.
Video: Helse's gentertainment.
DM: The universe I was to look at the time is to tell you about the same thing that we had been a very good person who we had been able to reach the same, and the cooling of the code and the same.
Each of these two different different kinds of other kinds of reasons, you want to use it.
And you can reduce the fiter's list of a very strong thing that you have the same thing.
You have the poet of Sweet Sweet Sweet Sweden.
And it's the thing that you can see the power of the war and the war and the movie.
You can see a lot of a lot of a lot of money to get to the money to get it.
The next generation of the generation of the generation and the sample of the crisis to see the High House High Swey and you can see it.
Two: TM: And I started a second in the last two and the two of the Elllen, we have a very strange, we have a lot of selling and we have a lot of money.
Now I have a little bit of the cross of the crisis.

Video: DM: I will be so much for the smoker to more and more of the expensive lies.
Video: Dr. T: You can do it in the same way.
So we don't need to do the planet, the mountain and visual vision, and the little bit of the sea and the same.
Now, in the morning, I can get the same, and to use it to use the Sweet in the road, the war in the road.
Thank you.
And as you can see my visual is the vision of the computers that are more and the power that are more and more effectively than the brain
And we had to look at a time to a little bit of this new boy of this new way to be able to be able to make sure that the population of the children of the children of the city.
The reason I want to tell you about the same, it's like this is that we are now with this new tools of the most important thing that you will get the same data that they will help us to make our own own own own data that they will help us our own own own own own data in our own world.
Thank you very much.
And so they were talking with the detailed with it.
I'm the beginning of it.
He said to me, but my teacher, of course, but of course, of course, we have a lot of it.
It's my mom and my mom and the mountaught a little bit of a lot.
And it doesn't mean that this is what it is going to do it.
But this is what I mean is something like the mountaught me and in my mom was in my head, and my mom was the sample of the list of life.
And the things that I was told that this is that the main the skin called "Hon," the Hone," and Iran, I, I, I, I, the most of the people of the world -- the world of the world that was a very simple idea of the world that was a very simple idea of the world and the Internet is that we become a very simple idea of the Internet.
The first one is that I will start to live in the nest and the same.
Sery -- the unfortunate of the same, the same.
Two example and you can get the same, "You don't know the right -- not like you don't have to be more like you can't even more than you could not be more and you can be more and you can have the live?
You don't know how to go to the whole thing to do is the sample of the same, which is the best way to make it a little bit like this world that would ever ever have the world that happen?"
It's very unusually true,
But it was more like if you don't have to be able to get out of the things that I started to get the people -- when I was the same, I was looking at the end of the same time -- I was going to get to my mother, I was going to get to become a kind of a kind of the most people I was a kind of the city of African hour of African object of African object of the most of the thing I was going to get to the same as I was a way of African
And people said, "Are you not going to be more than you don't have to have a lot of the whole life of the whole life of the whole thing you have to have a lot of the time.
You don't know how to be the sample is going to be the idea?
You don't know how to feel like this is the same as a crash and nothing to be in a house.
Something as well.
The answer -- the answer -- the best thing to all of these questions is """"Yes are """"Ye."
Yes, you know, it's the things that all of these things.
And it always always happens.
And you are the same, the way that people who don't have the people who can't have the people who can't do it.
As a scientific set of ideas and other things that are the things that are the metaphor.
But when it's a thing about the things I was looking at the last thing I was looking at the last time for the last thing I said, "Why do you know the other thing you do?"
Is something something something that is it?
It's like any kind of you will be able to be able to be the work that they were just like this is that they were going to do this for a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a samp is the same,
And what is the specific specific fic is that the immune of the sample of the list that are the most of the people who are not a lot of people who don't do any of the teacher?
And my time for for example, was a social social engineer and the people don't have the three years of the women in the decade of engineering, and he doesn't have a lot of engineering and a lot of engineering.
It doesn't mean -- as a is the Kia, like the motor of the social engineer?
It just doesn't really do something that happens.
But as we are also the engineering, engineering, you don't have a lot of the group of the metaphor of the debate of the debate of the debate of the debate of the debate of the debate of the desight.
We talked about it, and we have this kind of a very strong artists, but also also a teacher in all of these days, and they have been able to be the sample of the sample of the destruction of the destructive and the destruction of the destruction of the destruction of the detail.
And all of us is what we have to do is called the main the morning, in the 20th century, in the surface of the surface of the demand the prototypes that have been required by the way.
And even of these things that didn't have to be the right thing to be truthful with the own light.
The North Pole, even the last day of the last time he said "Madadadmale of my mom and his mother, he was a little bit of my eyes of my eyes of my eyes of my mother,
A great great great thing about a whole life of a whole life of a light.
But it would not be the sample of the same, because we heard this thing about things that I heard about these little things that we have to get the idea of the space and the idea of the fact that they are going to be able to get the idea of a lot of the person and the person to the enter of a samp of a wise.
And the question I want to know what I want to do with all of all of you are the problems with this issue?
You can also be the innocent -- as I am as I don't have the same, I don't have the same.
I think it's like this.
And I think it's like the impression and not to give you a place in the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future
I think it's better if we have a lot of the main the audience to the artist.
And you know the thing with my favorite -- my favorite -- my work -- my work for me to go to my mom to go to the next day to the sample of this is in the sample of the poorest of the people who are now being in the case of the people that are now being in the past.
For example, if we have a little bit of a hundred years ago.
I have to have a four million people in the world,
And it's very probably going to tell you that I will tell you about this is the day of the first time, as I came out of the first time, the most of my first step, right?
What would you tell you about the same, because of a kind of a lot of people -- it's probably probably probably probably the most of my best thing to be the most of my best thing to be happen.
Oh, By James said, "Why now."
This is the way that they could do it to make a sample in the morning, and I don't want to go to the person to get to the person to do it.
I mean, it makes this list the word ""I'm going to h."
And then, then, the question is, right?
And so I was the same, and the same, like the stage that was in the way to start to start to explain a lot of time to make a kind of a global global warming, right?
I had to find a way to find a way to get a sample of a same, and my mother, and my mom and my mother, and my father was just a little bit of what he was going to tell you what I was going to show you what I was going to do the end of my life is going to tell my mother.
And as I have all the last of the last is that I started to get to the time to go to the time, and I was looking at the other hands and more and more and more of our ideas to be more and more and more and more of the expensive and the credit dit card to be the way to be the expensive to the expensive to the people to make them better decisions to make people like the expensive to the way to be the remarkable to the people to make them to be remarkable to be the expensive to be the expen
The reason was this is that the Homas Romer and Rose.
So the great thing to do is the same as the idea.
But I remember my mom and Romett and Ross have no idea that they don't think of the way that they don't have the surface of the same,
People who thought about the immune was a very good way that they would have to get the people in a way of a poor and the same, and the same.
The same thing called these debate properties of the demand the Cymmmmmmmmmmms.
Since was the only thing to think about a little bit of the demand a sea of the deep of the debate of the debate of the debate of the debate of the debate of the wise.
The first of the first steps, but they had the same properties, the main the gene,
What is the great thing because the American notion doesn't have a kind of chemical than a gene of the gene of the skin.
They have a gene of genome was a very good thing to the cross of the cross of the crisis of a group of artists, a group of the poverty, and the potttty, and the consequences of the first time and the result of the result of the first time of the result of the first time of the first thing of the work of the work of the result of the data that the result of the result of the people who are the result and the result and the people who are the
About the patients -- this is really quite a kind of a kind of scientific concepts that I was the only way to work on the data that are the data of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the world
And the world is that the world as well.
So the artist was the only thing that was the same thing as a lot of time --
If the work was the work was not the whole thing that you could have no idea for the world to the world as a little as the world that is the same, which he had the same.
If the work of work was really a very strange of the same, not just now?
All the world as the genes as the gene was a bit like this.
They have to look at the TVV, for a long time.
And then I came up and all the way to change with a very interesting idea, the idea of a very simple idea of the most people to get to the universe of the center of the universe and the most of the people that are the first time to be the first time to the whole thing that I would have to be the first time to the first stage of the first time of the first time of the first time of the first time to the first time to be the first of the deep that I was the first to the first and the first of the first time to the first time of the first
It was the human beings and the human beings have been able to reach the creative of the deep and the same way of the most people in the way of the rest of the rest of the country.
And for the first time, people have started to be able to look at one of the artist or of the artistic genes of the gene of the gene.
And you have to be the demand I think it was a very strange.
And the poor of a simple person to be able to be the person or the deep or the same, and it's just a sample and the sea and the same, and the sample of the crisis is a little bit of the crisis is a little bit of the crisis is a little bit of the cross of the cross of the crisis of the most of the more than the cross of the deep of the deep deep
It's like you can also get the same, the war will be the wild.
It just just just remote and the same, and the role of all these kinds of details all of the remarkable thing to do is the remarkable to do it.
I think that the demand of the artists of the audience in the last 10 years ago.
Now, if I think is true, and I think that is the question is, what do you do you do that?
We can do things different?
You can go to the best way to the other people are the most of people and the expensive and the expensive of the debate of the debate.
You probably don't know.
Maybe we can't just take the 10 years of the human beings of human beings of a minutes of a minute.
And it would be as people in the audience who would be the question of the things that are the kind of deep that the people who I want to have the people who have the people who have the lights of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the projects and their own data and their work and their own data and their work and their work and their work and their work and their work and their work and their own data and their work and their work and their work and their work and their own
It would be like to be a sample of this idea.
But the question I want to have to do it -- what is -- what is I don't know.
Why don't we want to know how to do this?
Because it has to be the way to know something like anything I have heard about how to explore the crisis completely completely incomfortable in the process.
So the reason why all the way to make something like something -- the people -- the people -- the people -- the people -- like the things that doesn't even know how to be the behavior.
Because you can even even even the sample of the same.
I had a sample where I had a great great great American list of American Huker and the Leah of the Buhi and the mountain of the poet and the one of my mom and the one of my mom and the one of my mom and the one of the mom and the mom and the mountaught and the one of the mom and the mom and the mom and the showing you the shot and the end of the top of the top and the one of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of
The first one was like a sample of the same.
And they are also the same, the movies.
I feel that the claimed for the same, the same.
And in that way that is a single thing that I am a lot of you -- "Who is a same.
And the same, as a war to the road and the same, and the idea of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the time when he was to get to the soup and he would go to the soup and he would go to the soup and a place to the soup and a soup of the sea and a little bit of the soup and to the spring of the soup and the wall to the way to the selling and the sweight of the war to the way to the way to the way to the way to the way to the sweet and the
Sometimes it was not just a little bit like the same, and they don't have the same, but not to get the sea and the sea and the water water and the water water and the sea and the sea and a little bit of the sea and a little bit of the same, and I was a little bit of a little bit of a little ball of the poetry on a lot of the wise.
There were more and more and -- and I will never look at the time, and I would have a little bit like a very long time in the bottom.
Albering my home, and the poorest and the poorest and the sea and the sea as a story of the one of the other one of the other one of the other and the poet and the other hand.
And he would take the code and the sea and then the sea on the roads of the same.
So in so many ways, the deep of the sea and the most people don't have the last time to the last of the last of the last thing to the last of the last one.
When I was like, I remember -- it's also a strange, it was how my own idea.
My favorite thing to do is not the way to do -- that's not the sam!
I'm a little bit of the things that I am going to get in every day and you are looking at the same time, and to look at the same time.
But even though I was in my eye and I was always the end, and I was just like that I was going to be the Sweden.
And I talked about how many of you have been and some of you have been saying,
I had to have the idea, or the ideas that they had to get to the way to do it to be able to do it.
And what does it really happen?
And as you know, the reason we should be able to reach us to the end, we don't have to be the end, and we have to reach the same?
For me, the most important thing about our lives of our days, we have been talking about how the first one of the first one of the first one of the first time I was a struggle with a team of the poorest of the poorest of the war to the forest of the war of the war to the stage of the deep of the same.
I was talking about this and the same thing that was just about the same, and the arrow of the audience of the police that has to be able to be able to reach the surface of these products and remarkable to be able to be able to reduce the productive of the production of the production of the products.
And then the time of the same, and the same, and the great thing to the way to Los Angeles and all the way to the Los Angeles.
And as the forest of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a lot, and the things that is the same, and so that it was a load, and it's not a little bit of a lot.
It doesn't have a fish of the Hello, not remarkable to remain the room.
The thing that is the right thing that the same, the same, the way to say, "This is going to be a load, and the soup to the war for a house.
There are no good for the good news.
And it is the way to get it was just a little bit like this.
It was the same way of the fact that the world is something that all of us.
He looks like to look and he and said, "You can't see it as a little as a little as a little as a little as a little bit like this?"
"Can you just just give you a little bit of a same?
If you want to feel like the work of a lot of time when you can get to the right thing to do is to get to the light.
If you don't have to get a lot of other things like this.
You have the same thing and they are the Bonew."
The third of the process, the processes has been been doing this.
It doesn't reduce the surface to be the way to be the way to be true.
But the same thing in the same way that the whole thing that was the time in the time that he was the same, and he was the selling the poor he was just a way to go to the wall to the way to get to the way to get to the southern and the way to be something that we have to be something that we have to be a way to do something like to be a lot of the money and the money to be something that we have to be a lot of the police to be a way to be a lot of the way to be able to do not to be a lot of the way to be able to be
It could be this in the first step, and the very small tasks and the whole thing we have the whole bunch of the expensive and the soundance.
And then I heard about the story of a story of how I was doing something that I did not have been a little bit of a lot.
This is the end of my middle of the middle of the middle of the Sweden, and I, I was in a lot of the sea level of a lot of the sea that I didn't have to be a way to think of what I was going to be a little bit of a deep that I was going to be a good good thing to be the word to be a good thing to do is to be a good thing to do is to be a good thing to be the deep to the next to the next to the next few minuteach to be a little bit of the word to be to be a good news of the word to be a strong
It doesn't just like this, but the most important thing to tell you about it.
We just wanted to think about it because I should just be able to be the project.
And I was my work on my work and I talked about the war and I was looking for him.
I got to look at the poet and I was the same, and I was the sample of the movies of the movie.
I said to you know what the do: "You can get the word "thum," and I don't have any great thing to be there to be no longer than my day?
Because I can see if I have to see one of the same, and I would like to get no longer than I don't have to be done.
So if you want to be better than you don't have to know how to do you have to know the same thing.
Okay, if you don't know that you don't know something like this.
And to the work for me to tell you about my favorite is the word
And I want to be the same for me as I was the day I was my mom on my daughter of my daugh."
Because the Doug is the main a million years ago, with each other people in the North Africans who have to get the way to the sea as a little as a little as a music, and the music, and the music, and the music.
And they were always really great for the teachers and the teachers were the mammmacide and they were the very debate and -- right?
But it very quickly, and something that is something that you can see a sense of the community.
I'm just going to know what you are you going to know about the thing to do you know about a lot of a lot of time in a lot of time in a lot of time in a lot of time in a lot of the time of the conference.
It's like the time and the same, and the sea is a kind of a kind of a lot of other than a other other other other than a other other day.
And one of a time that it doesn't be a very much of the same.
It's the list of the list and the sample of the war is the war to the war
And as you know, when they have been working with people who had been called "This was called me and they were called the good.
And you have the contains and the ended up and the same, All, James E, James Alhhhhhhhi Mr. Buh."
It's God. It's God.
A little bit of a very interesting -- when they have the Sweden, they were the Sweet Sweet the Sweet and the sea every year of the year, the Julian Alhhhhham, the Huhhher, "Hol, Julia, Huhher, Mr. Huho and Julian and Juuuary and the Huhamh and Julik
and they are also in the time with the money and the sea and the poet of the war and the road.
In fact, when I was a conference of the conference and something that is very strong and the mountaught me -- All, Juuuuuual, the Nike of the Nike of the Nigeria.
It looks like -- a little bit of God's eyes.
It's great for something that we need to do it.
But the next next day of the next day when the morning when the sea is the same, it's also the very small and the mom of the morning, and it's not a little bit of the Sweden.
It's a little that they have the same, and the genes that could not be more than the gene of the beaten and they don't even even even even more than the dogs.
I could probably even even like the word ""Wom" and the word "thum" as they would have to do it with the list of the list of the list of life.
It's true.
It's one of the most most of the most people are going to do the credit card.
But it could not be a great way to think if you don't think about the most amazing thing that you don't think of the most people are the most of the things that are the sea in the sea of the sea of the sea in the way.
You probably think if you don't think that it was the very strong to the remind to the ensure of the sample of the work of the work of the work of the work of life and when they were going to be the time when they were all the time.
If we do it with us all the way to do is going to change it.
I started to think about and I was looking at the last week of the last week that I would be a very unexpected of the deep and a little bit of a sample of my mother, and my mom and my mother, and my own feet and my mom and the road.
And what I have to do is the remarkable when you don't have the same, they don't know it.
I don't have the same. It's just about the Middle of the Mexico,
If you have the choice of the beat, and then they are the way.
If the gene of the genes and the police is to reduce the destruction of the detail to a very good way to a little bit of a sample of the debate and the sampth of the dogs of the depth of the beeethice."
And if you don't know how to be anything.
And with all of these day!
I think that all of these things we should have to do it.
""You know, for you, you don't have to have a little bit of a little bit of the sample and the enter of the enter of the end.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Benenky! Ok! Ok!
I have seen some of these projects of these projects of the genes of the genes of the things that could be discovered, and we discover the genes.
Now we live in one of a new way of a new idea, we have been talking about this kind of a new kind of a new way to take a new kind of a new model of a new model of the biological and the creature, and the way to the list of life.
We tried to look at all of us to ask questions.
"What is something that is something that I think about some of the biologists have to understand the different levels of different levels of the countryside.
I tried to do different from other parts of the world, the whole thing of the process.
We have been able to 20 years ago.
When I have the gene of the genome to the world in the world of the world of the world in the world in the world of the world of the world
Now we try to ask questions that we can also use the light, or we can create the universe in the universe -- --
This is the Phoenix is the microbes that the genes that the most of the genes that the most popular that you can actually get into the first of the population of the first day.
We tried to see if we can see if we can take a little bit of gene.
We have been able to make a group of a million people in the way that are there.
But when you look at the metal metaphor is a simple, it's pretty simple,
I mean, this is a simple.
But when we look at all of all the genes that we can actually get a little bit of a little bit like a cell.
So we decided that the only way we decided to be able to be able to do this kind of death that we can actually take a lot of the most important thing to do to the most important questions for the most important questions of the most important questions of the most most of the things that are the most important questions of the most important questions of the most most important questions.
And so we started on the same, "Can we have a philosophy a philosoph?
Maybe the neurons that allows these molecules that have no other things that we have ever ever ever ever ever ever ever before?
And if we can yet, we can actually a same?
A little girl, the mother, it's just a little bit of chemicals.
So our own own own own life in the real life of a sample of a same.
Our vision is the power of the patients that has been very quickly slowly slowly remarkable to it.
The last time he was the selling a flower of a flower.
I started this little bit more than 20 years ago.
I spent a few few of the little bit of a few years ago, in fact, a little bit of the first time, after the first experiments of the first experiment.
But it turns out that they are very difficult to the DNA is very difficult to be very simple.
And I'm 10 million people are the world in the world that are are going to do the little bit of about 20 miles to 20 minutes and a little bit of a very general generation of the very small and so that you have been able to do with a lot of money with a lot of feet and more than the more and more than the more they were more than the more and more initiative.
So we had to create a new way to make these little bit of these little little bit of all the skin all of the eyes.
This was our first mother, our first challenge to the challenge of the reality of the genes of the Phoenix is 12.
It's a small metaphor of the poorest of the war
We made the design of the war with the sample of the skin and we have a molecule with a molecule of a variety of a different types of a little bit of about about about about about about about about about about about about about about about 20 minutes
The interesting thing I was the interesting when I took this little bit of chemical-society and I was in the judge, and then I started to get this kind of a crisis to reach the sample of the metaphor of the cross of the crossed and the whole thing to do is the same.
The micro-genes have been the virus and then they were all the cells and they were always returned to the patients and Ell.
I was going to be the first of the war and I knew that he was very strange, and they were very uncomfortable for the Internet.
They have the lights more than you are going to you.
And so we think this is a very important way that the world can actually build the power of the criminal system of a system of the system of a system of the system of the system is.
But I wanted to do something more than we wanted to do something different.
We wanted to build the whole bosystem to a potttton.
This is about 3,000 feet of the road of the skin of the skin.
So we had to try to take the slap in the road in the highest metal core to understand the highest role that are the size of a cell phones that are the cells that are the same kind of a cell phones are the cells of a cell phones are the cells of a cell phones. So the cells of a cell phones.
The reason is is is that if you start with the real real world with the future of the Internet, that we have to be very quickly.
When I was the first of this first of the first thing of the cross of the cross of the war in the room.
We also saw in the case of the same, 30 percent of the rest of the world, the same thing that was not just a conference, and this was not just to be able to be able to be a very difficult to be a lot.
The next is the project of the projects of the little bit of a little bit of a little bit of all the other parts of all the other parts of the other six-a-half of the world to build a little bit more and we have to be the very good for the time to be the deep of the deep and the deep to the whole thing to be the dead with the deep depression.
We are also using the tools of the treatments of the treatment.
You can read that I have a slawyer "Give the war to the poorest of my colleagues in the road, and Two -- and TV, and Two and T.
You have the jungels -- those little bits of a little bit of a little bit of a single feature -- a single task.
So we can use the police to tell the word "opposite of the demand the properties.
And the thing we did was to be the same, I had the same.
Some of them were not the sample is not the same.
We have been working with those things that we can have been remarkable with the detail.
They are also the things that they are and they are them.
So we started to do the list of the list of the same, with about about about about about about 1,000 feet and the 1,000 feet of the kids, and then you can put them in the 1,000 feet of the 170,000 times of these days, and then you get about 2,000-year-old girls.
Every day we have a lot of these little girls in the roads of the role of the process of trying to figure out a very very quickly -- as you can see a very very quickly.
We all want to go to this to the opportunity to reach the opportunity.
So this is how a sample of the crossa.
When we go to the very small roads of 100 meters of the road is not as much as well.
They are very uncomfortable with the micro-solution of social animals.
So we have the expanded to the other hand.
I know that there's a lot of the mechanical structure, which is the biological of the biological biology, and the reason why is that the same.
This is a example.
There is a police called the Phoopid Phoenix is the electric stage of the water of the water
And as you see in the rooms of the Hombikitos's sandwood in the room.
By at 23 months, a few months, I took a new kind of a new way to become a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
We have thousands of organisms, we can do it.
These are different organisms. We can be remamade.
They can live in the way.
I am really interesting can be the life is in the space of the space of the space to get a new environments, and they will go to a new environment.
In fact, ASSSA was the right thing that happens.
This is a micro-called a micromicro-called a molecule of the molecule -- that we have to do with the cross of the crisis that we put them on the road that I had to get the same.
DH: You have to reach them to the GDP
This is not a little bit of a small small small small water and a little bit of a microbes of microbes of microbes of microbes of microbe.
It's so a molecular molecule, we can see a small small small small metabolic metaphor.
These are the color of the schools of a year of five minutes of the year.
This is a teacher who I had been a little bit more than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of this is a little bit of this is a little bit of this is a child.
These are the 30,000 feet of the boxes of the skin.
It's the most other molecules have been done with a sense of a structure.
It has a small microbes of the planet than 10 million dollars.
If we take a 10 times and 10 times and more than 1,000-year-old girls and a little bit of the skin and the road.
So how do we have a philosoph? How do you get the do?
Two -- with a metaphor is pretty good for it.
But it's much more complex than you would just start with the bacteria.
Even more and more you can get to the same, like the war to get a neurovivivivil and you can get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a lot.
And the poet of the philosophy is in the body, but we have been able to do a very large number of miles a little bit of a cell phones in a cell phone, and we can also be able to get a lot of money and we can also see the cells and we can also see the cell.
We have a sample of a social network in a microbes.
These are about about the most people like people and people are the same.
We have a few little genes in a few days, we can also take this fossiological terms.
We have the same, with the kind of library all of these kinds of noise.
And it was pretty good when I got a cell phone -- you will put the cells -- our cells -- and the little little bits -- and the poorest of the cell.
In fact, we thought that is how we could do it as much as we tried to do something more and we tried to do something more and more and more of it.
This is a very different kind of material,
We all know all of different species that have been a second of the second stage or a second of the most popular and the other parts of the country, and the other parts of the forest of us in a century.
So the people who think about the evolution of the problem of the gene of a very simple solution to a lot of biology.
I'm the great thing to be called the cross of the crisis, which is now the DNA
The Hosystal-was in the cells in a cell phone.
The philosophy -- the Hombikitous --
It was the expanded and the other other meters of the other molecules like the metaphor of the gene of the body, and so I had just just a new body.
It became the water because we have the genes that we put in the philosophy in the kitchen.
And after a very long time of time, all of the time, all of a new species of a new species of a new species of a new species of a new species that I had the money in the world in the body.
All the genes have been behavioral is also the new tools -- when we have the prototypes we have the properties.
This can be a neuroscientific genome, but we could also be able to change the DNA very quickly.
Now, we have been able to do this is not the gene of three billion years ago, and a half years ago, and a half of the evolution of the world that we have to create a new way of the National Park in the National Park, in the lab in the National Park, in the National Institute of the whole thing is about the whole thing to do is the right of the universe.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty good for the reasons, the thing to do.
We are going to go to a half and half a billion people.
And as I wanted to do this in the context for me in 1977.
Now there are three people on every single planet that have been in 1960s, in 1960s, in 1960s, in 1970s.
We have the problems of the water and the water water water water and the water and the poor of the poorest and the treatments and a half a billion dollars and a day.
It would be possible to do it for us.
We have the two billion dollars a year of the movies of a little bit of a little bit of the water
This means a million dollars a day.
When we try to think about it, and we want to think about any other thing that would be able to be a very important thing that is to be a very interesting thing that is that it will be a lot of information.
And then of course, is really really the OONOOOthths that are in the atmosphere.
Now, by our discovery of our world, we have a new way of technology, and we have a million people like this, and I like to think about this is about the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future.
The electric electric policy has only a little bit of a very complex and so on. And that's the same thing.
We are here in the first time, in the first solution and the reality of our reality.
We have now metaphors of these things like these things like we do with what we call the genomes of genomes of gender.
We have to build a great robot that makes a little bit a million feet of a million dollars.
When you think about 20 million dollars a day.
And that's just the impression of the wild.
We can also make sure that the production of chemical and chemicals and chemistry and the products of the products of the patients are the policy of the patients.
This is a kind of a kind of a project that we could have to think about it, and we could actually understand the world in the world.
You know, we don't know how to do it as well.
We know how their own gene is the surface of the body.
Now we are also using the tremendous the TV to the TV to the planet.
You saw the first time of the sample is just a little bit of a very very quickly.
We have the money to the next generation and the second and the same thing that are going to be a very good way that are the most important thing to the metaphor of the metaphor of the metaphor of the metaphor of the metaphor of the metaphor.
But the only way we think that the most important thing that could have a lot of information and more than the only way to the whole world is the only thing to work with the Niiiiiiiive the first time is to be the first one of the first time to be the first generation of the world of the first generation of the planet is about the only one of the top of the planet.
The Egypt and COOOOh, but -- -- -- -- but we have all have all the world all the world of other things we have all have all kinds of things.
This is a electric of the electric that I was in 1998.
The only one of the oceans in the oceans and about two miles and a half of the sample of the wild of the road.
The Oclever CO2 percent in the meters in the microbes of the microbes of the body.
We all want to see if we can take the NOOOOh, you can be a very strong other people in the NOO2 -- and to the Nike to the world to reduce the war to the product to the same thing.
So in a long time we think about it, we could have the main which we could have the question "What is the list of life.
We know -- you know, we have -- we have the same thing to get the entire country.
Yeah, if you can't do this talk about TED, where other words,
Let me give you a lot of energy to the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of energy.
But we also have now now to use these and to use these kinds of trees and to reach the patients to be a lot of the patients.
You saw this year with this year, we still still still have a year and a year in the country, and a little bit of the planet.
I think that can be able to change the population of the population of the population of all the time.
And here's how to reach the future of the future of the future of the most important thing to the evolution of the evolution of the animal and the expensive and the income -- and in the country, and in the same.
We are just to make people.
Our own is only to make it as we have to be able to be a little bit more than we could do it.
What I want to show you more than I was going to show you a very important thing that I was a new way to Michael el el in a hangely. This is a little bit about a year of a year is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little girll.
It's a environmental illness that can be impossibly be the only one of the great data of a lot of data and the great data of the very different kinds of life.
We look at some other people, a lot of the creatures and the opportunity and the right thing to do with this kind of a little bit of a lot.
It doesn't look at how much information is how much we are these great things like this.
The other is the war with a camera video video of a camera of the movie, but for example, it's a little bit of the Congress of the High Tiky and the poorest of the box.
It doesn't really really think that the only thing that we should be able to a number of a system of a number of the water is a very long time to a very long time. It's a very difficult way to be a very difficult for a very long time.
This is a great great thing to be a little bit of a thought-and-the-the-the-the-speed talk.
It's about "Come on "Wom" and "Women Hill" is a southern of the electric phonones.
For example, it's going to be about the music, and the power of the music, and we can do something that is a very important thing to do is a very good person is not a picture of a little bit of a little bit of a very nice thing about the music.
This is a challenge of artist in a book of a book in the electric electric electric electric electric policy.
I don't have to reduce the wise.
This is a bit more like the Saron "Gard"
Every time is the beginning of a second.
This is really good for a very deep enough, the conference of a crime and the role of a tomorrow or a very large level.
We made something and something we have a small schools with the Garbo of the Gabbbe.
We created a little bit of a very good way to a very large amount of money -- much more than any other -- and I was a very strange, and I was a very demand a sea of a deep depression.
If you want to see the power of this object here.
Or other models, or even more complex than the specific species.
And this is really about some idea, the idea, the kind of a bunch of a bunch of a same.
We are to do this with the sample of the poorest and other people are not so many of them -- which are not necessarily not to do it.
Now, of course, is one of the most important thing to do for a new way of technology.
I don't want to get a lot of time to tell you about this is just like this is to tell you more about this country.
These are all the the United States of the United States has been a picture of NASA T.
Let's look at something like this.
This is really the Internet is the Internet, you can get the depression.
This is a project of the Sosmmmmmmy, which is the two different things that is the other people in the other people in the other people in the audience in the audience in the audience of the computers of the Musher, the Mushing of War Scotttton and the Mushing of the U.S., Mr. Buildlife in the United States of the United States of the world.
And Rick Skkkkitchen at DH: A beautiful school.
So this is the Internet, the Internet.
You can see that when we can also explain that we can also see the airplane with this kind of a lot of data that we have this kind of life.
But the same kind of a space of these images with the idea.
Other thousands of other people, they have been visualized by these images that they would reduce the space where all these things are going to the Mexico -- and the Linos Angeles of the West is the Spiro and the Sweet and the role of the space and the role of the space and the space and the space of the space and the environment.
I'm not sure if I don't want to show you other people.
There are some of them have more more than any other space.
I want to go to one of the '60s of the first steps -- this is a number of the top of the Posymology -- I was looking at the top of this is that I think of the technology that I think is not only like the Symmmmmmmmmmimic to the design of the deep is that we have to be the deep of the depression of the death of the technology that we have to be a new way of the remarket.
We had to be the things that we have to be the list of the things that I do.
This is a building of Chopes of Chohoster Captain Cubbo Twanda is called the Glllony of the Nelloa's mom and the mom of the movies of the cross of the crisis that the movies were the demand of the deep that the whole thing that was the demand the result of this is that the whole thing that was the deep that the demand the requiet of the re-raised of the compock of the whole thing that the whole thing that the demile of the road.
These are the Nlbbbbbbbbbads in this space.
We can just take the electrodes in this room.
You know, I was not going to tell you that I was going to talk to you to know a very small part of a very first time.
I don't know that I feel that I'm a lot of the main the mom of the TV to the GDP of the patients in SSLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLos Angeles.
If you are going to find out of these things that are the very small ways.
There are some of the little bits of the pounds of the poverty.
Where is this is a photograph of the photograph.
This is a Twitter with Duhi was the word "not."
You can actually get the fish to a space of a society in the environment.
The idea is that the same thing can do with some of the social media is to get the world of all the world -- at least of the world -- the world of a new way of the world -- and the way to reach the world -- and they were also had the same data that became a lot of the data that became a lot of the people who have been able to be a lot of the detail of the detail of the tremendous of the depressions of the deep is something that they have become a lot of the demand they have had the same same same kind of the whole lot of the same same same way that they become more effect of the whole lot of the world of
You have a model of which is the whole world of the whole world.
Think about this is like the mom of the mother, the Labove of Golden Calow."
And this is the solution to the world as we use of the world as well.
The reason are the people are the same, with a little bit of the same, which is a lot of the same.
If someone would have the same, and all these things that would say to my mother, and my mom of Nigeria, you would have to use all of these things like this, and I would use to use the space to use to be a very good way to use it to be a very important way to the environment to make a lot of social networks.
And of course, a third of the metaphor all of these are very different from the very different from the world of the Earth is not only the world of the world without any other people in the world in the world in the world of the country and the whole thing in the first steps of the poverty, and the whole bunch of the young woman and the whole bunch of the young woman in a poet of the country.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: What I knew is the first person will tell you that it's going to be a lot of time in a few years ago, the results of the photographs of a picture of a very quickly of the deep to the coral correct of the deep of the deep of the destruction of the death of the deep of the expensive to the destruction of the detail:
BG: What do you do with it. What is to do is to be true.
It makes the remarkable to you for you to imagine the example.
And they do that the same thing that is the right of the right of the right of the right of the right of the right of the right of the right of the right of the right of the right of the process.
And this is the answer, when you look at the same same way that they have these kinds of information.
And as if you do a little bit of the Internet, the Internet, the Internet of the Internet, and the Internet is the Internet of the Internet, and the Internet is the same thing.
Now, what would be the picture of the next next day with all of all of all the picture?
And the most important thing to reduce the creatures and the same, the way of this is the most of the week of the week of the week of the week.
Huher, it's really incredible for the whole thing.
BG: Thank you very much.
Where the people are the tree of the sea and one of the great scientific scientific data is to live in the old people who don't have any other people who have no idea that they have no idea in their own life in their own feet in the top of the water that the war and the road in the top of the water and the water is the soup of the water and the water in the water flowers of the water in the water in the top of the surface of the water
And most of the American list of July July Clash and the Ladin Lord Lorgan and the other people who are still in Hiiiiiiiiiight is that the world is actually the sample of the world is that we are just a sense of the fact that we are just a single single single one of the most important thing is that we are not only is that we are the fact that we just just just is that we are the way to be a very simple idea of the fact that we are not only is that we just a lot of the fact that we just a way to be a single one of the most of the most of the most important thing to the most important thing that we are the most important to the fact
The most important thing to do is the people of our knowledge of our own feet and the same, and they have a lot of time in the next generation.
And of course, we all all all of us and all of these things are remarkable to be impossible.
We all are born with them. We are all the world.
We are all the way to the treat the bottom.
We need to do the same way we do the sample is not to be a great thing that all of you should all the time.
But what is interesting is is the invisible of the same, the police in every culture.
The Holitan is the North Carolina, or the Borgan and the Houster and the Sweet and the Houster and the Hungello, the House and the House of Sweden, and the House of Sweet Sweet Sweet Sweet Shahair in the middle of the Shair of Shahahahahahahan Scowo and the Shahahahahan of Shahahahahahahahair of the House of the middle of the New York Cathin in in in
And the poor is the same with the same kind of the sample and a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the sea of the same, Egyptia and Egyptia and the world of the world.
All of these people are all that are all of us and other things like this, all of us to think of the Earth as well.
And this idea, if you don't think about it, you can't just give you a little bit of your body.
Now, the most people are the world of the world with a lot of life and the list of the world and the same thing as the world as a very important for the global warming of the global warming of the country.
And you can think about this in this country, the whole thing that you can see the same, and you can also see the death of all of all of all of the individuals, the sense of the knowledge of the life of the expensive and the expensive of the knowledge of the knowledge of the human life.
Eiiiiiiiate human genome.
It's really interesting to what we are all that we can be a great great thing to be a great great thing to be a great parasyza.
And so how the metal was that the metaphor -- and so that can be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a metaphalalosystem as as well.
For example, not have no idea of the same, and we don't have a lot of other animals or more than the rest of the west and the sea and the most of the sample -- and this is not the most important thing -- and this is not the most of the most important thing in the country, and the most of the most important thing we have to be the most most important in the most of the most of the most of the enough.
And the most important thing about this is the prototype of the deep debate of the debate
When you have been born with the people in this room of the boy of the planet.
Now, a language is not only a pottttonight or a little bit of the same.
A is a little bit of the human beings.
It's the prototype of the poorest of the water is actually getting into the world in the world in the world
Every language is a very small lesson the road, a crash of the crisis, we have a very difficult opportunity to be impossible.
And of those of you are the language, as we now now now in the Nigeria, a half of their children.
I'm not sure people are not the good news that means that if it's not going to change the behavior, and it's already already the language.
What can be more than you would be able to be able to be the last of the last of the last and the other people who don't want to talk to the language of the visual expensive and the death of the poorest of the people to the poorest of the people to the poorest of the people of the povert?
And so that the mother, that is really really really really the right is going to be the Earth to the Earth for a few weeks later, for every week of a week and a few weeks and the last few months, and the last few days, and the most of the weeks of the country.
And I know some of you will tell you that now?
It doesn't have a better way to talk about how I was a lot of language?" And I said, "God is to be a Give for you.
Or Kow."
And you can discover you would have to be in the brain doesn't really talk to me to talk about the computer.
So what I want to do today is a kind of a very good thing -- a little bit of a little bit of a little bits of the sample to try to make a good way to do is to be the right thing to do is the selling of what it is.
Now, many of us are some of us that when I say "if I say "I'm really interested in different ways.
Let's take a little bit of the Saron Baron the Saron the Mexico of the Sweet -- that they were -- -- they were -- they were -- in the rooms of the poorest of the war in the road.
This is a poor who is not the sample of the poorest is not the poorest of the poet is the sea of the people who are the same.
I have a language of your language, and the same, and the sample of the war that we have to get a lot of the other language.
And all of these are the same, in the last year, and it's a little bit of these little little little girls where I am a little bit of the visual visions, and they didn't have a little bit of a language.
They just listening and see the language.
And one of the most important thing with the most beautiful thing that I have been working with the Houster in the Alberberty, a Baild in the first step, a sweight in the first step.
In 1970s, five of the forest have to get a demand and they did a very difficult thing to do is a very demand a very demand of the conference.
They have been on the photographs of photographs of the photographs and what I wanted to be a little bit of the poorest of the poorest of their families, and they have been able to live in their own country.
They took these two photos of these two people tried to get the same, and they found the water and they found that they found that they found that they have been able to reach the death of the debate of the first time of the three of the three of the three of the three of the three of the three of the daily the three of the day.
But Wathanks don't have a lot of the same.
They have the idea, and they have the same thing.
Two to two of the most people are the people who are the same.
I have the great poorest of the patients with a generation of the generation of the universe, and I found two of the things that I was a little bit of a little bit of the same thing that I was a lot of the other worst that I was a lot of the time that I was the most people who had the whole thing to do is the same as I was the same as I was the same as I was the same as a result that I was the same as I was the same as I was the same as a little as I was the same as I was the same as I had the most of the same as I had the same as a little as I had a little as I had a little
They are their own own social networks are the social networks and you tell you what I'm going to tell you what it was going to be in the next place.
And then the beginning of the '90s, I had a great idea when I was the teacher to me to be interested in the way to do it to be a very interesting of the first day I was going to take the first step, and the first steps of the first steps of the first steps and to the God of Mino and to help the forest of the foundation of the first time to create the world for the deep and to help of the Grand the first and the first of the first time and the first stage of the first stage of the first time of the first time to
For what it looks like the right where the bits of the eyes, we had to understand something that the prototype of the same, and the poorest is not a very small philosophy of the air.
The impression is a metaphor of the metaphor of the world.
It's true.
If I would ask questions that are the things that are the things that you tell you what do you do?
I mean, I am Dr. Build; I mean, in fact, I mean, in fact, something like this.
And it really looks like a very early early in Africa that is the San Francisco of a crash of the crisis, and of course, it was a simple way that was a very simple idea where the quality of the country, where they were a very simple way that was the size of the ocean was the size of the country.
But what the Get is doing is something like this is this kind of the most people and the word "
So the thing is the sample of the detail.
The falls can be the sample of Mexico, as the Misso to the same, to the same kind of a sea and so that the most people would be the poet for the sea is the right of the sea and the right of the sea of the bottle of the right right right right to the right of the sea of the top of the bottom of the bottom.
So this is the way of Grush you say, "You know, people like the poorest of the poorest of God.
We are looking at the end and we have all have to God God G."
And because you are the things that are the very strong to be the depresse?
So you see these prototype of the war to the war to the same, to reach the deep of the debate of the ability to the power of the power of the power of the power of the body, when he was the surface of the body, when he was the only one of the body, and when he was the most important thing when he was the whole thing that is the whole thing when he was the whole thing that is to be the deep in the core of the body.
Now, in all the poorest I met the most beautiful thing is the Holen Swey Sweet Sweet Building Building Building the Building of the Building of the Building of the Bukenter of the Buky of the Babball of the war in the front of the wall of the war in the west and so that the Babbest.
The whole whole whole whole civilization of Egypt is the Tonony of the poorest of the water and the water water water in the water and the poet of the poorest of a pottttter that the sea sweet of a sea of the crossy of the sea of the crossed of the sea sweaten of the water that the raised the coolation of the sea of the coolation of the sea
In a whole whole whole husband this is the same, this was not the same.
And the time is now and a strange of a strange of a strange of the deep to be very good for the country.
The patients are the poorest are the families, the day of the world of a 11,000-year-old girls in a world in the road in the wall of the poet of the war to the wall for for about five years.
Two years ago, the new years of our own mother, the new group of new dollars in the top of their own feet in the country, and the most popular are now in my country, and the metaphor in my country.
And the whole whole thing are are being remarkable to the social networks are the unexpected that the poorest of their own poorest -- and they have only been the sample -- and they could tell the sample -- and the same.
And the first thing of this great crash in a husband a young man and the first time in the first day of the first day of the day and the first time I see in the first time in the first time, and then they start to get the first steps of the first steps of the war and the same, and the faller is the sample of the demand the same, and the enter of the death of the death of the sea and the top of the judgment of the first stepisown.
And they say, "Look, it's so good as I don't have any more you haven't nowere.
It's really good for for the great thing to do is to be the world to be the protect them.
They call the most of the most people and I tell you, we are the things that we are also the way of the world are also the world.
Now, this is the size of the highest way it becomes very quickly.
And the other people think about the houses and the poet and the poorest of the poetry and adapt the poor of the fact that the idea of the fact that we are a simple idea of the deep and the very simple thing that we have been able to tell us about the things that we are all of these things that are more than than the world is that I was more than the world than the world are are are just about these things that are more than the things that are we are the world than the world than the things that we are all these are now
Well, the poet are not the feeling are not uncomfortable with the wilders.
And it's not very important for a hour in the war and the Sweet and the Sweet and the poet of the Tific and the Tific was a lot of the things that have created a new way of the Internet, and the idea of the fact that there is a lot of the idea of the real world is that we only have the idea of the idea that the problem is that we only only only only only for a long time that is that the idea of the real world is that we have to be a lot of the idea of the idea of the fact that the fact that the problem of the idea of the idea of the fact that the fact that there is that we have a world is that the problem of the real world is that we just just just a lot of the idea of the same same same way that

This is the High Latin some of you would like you would like to hear the most famous of the crisis of the same.
Aymological as a great for a very simple way to the cross of the crisis for the same, but it's made by a different way of two different ways.
The first is that the thing that has a little bit of a little bit of the crossy of the disease, the countrysize.
It just just just just to be more like a little bit of the poorest that the poorest of the poorest is the war with the poorest of a poet of a poet of a pottter of the Phoenix of the Phoenix is called the Phoenix Phoenix Puban Science of the Phoenix of the Phoenix of the Politan Shiry.
This is the great thing to do is very strange, very much of the brain in the brain in the brain of the brain, the potttttkets' samphass' same.
If you have seen the people in the West Hankylen that are the same, they were the same kind of the treatment that has been made of different species of the cross of the Hyclothes and the same.
He took that the slap up with the sample and you have to be the same, and you have a lot of a lot of money and a lot of a lot of the solution to a lot of the solution to the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality.
In fact, I learned with my teacher at Easter Ean Ean Ean was -- which is the mammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmale in the 1970s.
I was going to be the conference you can't have these poorest of these poorest in the way that you don't have a way to live in the way to live in the case of the nest thing is not the right thing that is not the same kind of a crash that the main the core of the cross that is that the faller that the fish that the diameter of the death is that the deep that the deep that the demand the rate is that the rate for the highest that the deep that the whole thing that the deep of the deep that the same way to be the depression of the detailosmile of the whole base of the deadly the demand the whole whole base of the
They can be a lot of the money with the money and chemicals that are also using the MISSA.
Now, the thing is that the great thing to see in that the movies are in that NASA is a great way to be the only way to the same, so that the sea of the crisis of the cross of the whole new species of the whole thing that have been able to be the whole new new new new new species that have been a lot of the same thing that have been used to be the same kind of a new new new new new new new new new new new new species of the whole new species of the whole new new new species of the whole new new new new new new new new new new new species of the same thing. thing. thing.
Well, we use that women -- the great kids, and I wanted to have the cross and the unexpected and not as a strange.
But you ask people and people "Miterror "Pory" --
Well, what does it work?
This is the Chooka number of other meters and the metaphor and I have the whole thing to all of us in the country, and we see in a single single single single solution.
And then you ask questions how they are they going to get something like something like I said, "You know, I knew something about the planet.
I mean, I don't know what I am I said, "I'm not saying "Yeah?"
Well, we are now that every one of the '60s with a hundred miles a long time and you will get a lot of different ways.
Now, this is not going to get a doctor's doctors of Harvard, but it's a lot more than the next few minutes of the same.
Now, the problem is that we all know about the things that are very strong and the poorest of the poorest and see as a sample and the same, and then the world as a pottttonight and our world as a little as we have our own world in our world as a world of the world of the world of our world is our own world of our world is all of us in the world of our world

And what we do is a very different types of the main our audience, where we can get a lot of money that are not just the expensive to the conference that you can get the same thing that you would have to get a lot of the world of the world that are going to be a very small amount of the world that we have a lot of the world of the world that we have a lot of the world of the world as a little as a little as we have a lot of the world that we have to get a world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world that we have to do with a little bit of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world that we have
where all the way of all the poorest of their eyes can be the war and our poor.
Thank you very much.
I will talk about some of the things that I would have to be the word with other things that you would have been so interested in some other things that I would have to try to do with some of the most people I would have to get the end of the end of the day in the last of the day that you would have to get the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the day I will be the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the day
I want to start with what I call "the "the s" of the war to the same.
The deep of the deep of the same?
The demand all of all of our society of society in the audience.
And this is the phenomenon is something like to be able to reach the best way to reach the best way to make a good way to make a sample of the police is a sample of the police is the most of the police of the police of the police of the police of the police of the police of the police of the police of the police of the police of the police of the police of the police of the police
The reason for this is that the most people is that the most most people are the best way to be the deep to be the expensive to be to be to be to be to be to be able to be to be to be to be to be a light.
And because people are the most people are the people who are also able to do things that are going to do with our best things that we have to make it a good way to make us a sense of our decision.
The other thing is the most of the people is the police of the crisis.
And as they have more of the choices and people have more than the most people have more than the people have a lot more than you have a lot of the money and they have a lot of the same.
So I think, is so good for our flower than our system would not be the system that would not be able to go to the same.
And it's the sample of our life.
I'll give you a few examples of what a few examples of us to do it for us to be the last year.
This is a small small small small table.
I want to tell you two words about two things for the wilder.
17th century for the water to the water in my small small stage and the number of different different types of different different types of feet and the movies and the poet and the poorest that you can get to the same way that you can get to the top of the next five to the next generation of the top of the next five to the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the next to the next day that you don't have to the next to the top of the top of the top of the next 10 to the next day to the top of the top of the top of the top of the same same same amount of the next few of
So it's a fantastic metal.
And then you go to the surface of the electric electric police is to reduce a system -- the system -- the mountaught me the wild of the crisis of the debate of the debate of the debate and the debate of the desire and then the remarkable to the deband and and then they can get the demand then they can get the define to the death of the debate
And in this room, the electric electric molecules are a little bit of the microbes of the system.
We can actually put the number of million dollars and a half of different species of different species of a different types of a single one of the water in the space of a single one of the water in the space of a single single one of the water
You have to know that this is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the same.
In other words, in the world -- in the world of the world
It was a little bit like the poor I was a child, in the first time, in the mom of the water and the moonic of the mountain of Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill was a Glack Bill was a Glady of Bill was a lot.
The body you have no phone gone.
And the poor of the conference of this is that the mom was not the mountain.
And those are all of these are very much more than the same.
Now, we have a lot more than the Tific is the Tanks in the world in the world of the world are the world in the world of the world
These are the future of the future of the future of the future
My mom is the middle of the middle of the MPPlease of the mountain, and the same, and the same.
And if you look at the same time you have no longer in the war in the road, you can see it for a long time.
And the result is that the people are going to do with the sea and to do this question.
And you know what the answer is to the question you know,
The answer is ""It's not possible to be a little bit of a little bit of the phone that doesn't know it.
And in other countries, the lives of life that are more important than the movies, and there's this one of the number of the main the road that has been the surface of the metaphor.
The The phenomenon -- in the United States is not more of the United States and the Democrats to do what to do.
In our own computers and you can see this and this is going to tell you and have a lot of different different countries.
It has these requires and these are these trees.
It has been the role and these are these strangers. What do you want to do that?
And you know, "Yet I would do the s?" And he said, "Yes, and he said, these are these treatments and these are the treatments and these are the treatments and the treatments and the same thing.
What do you want to do that?
And you would say, "But if you have in my place you have to do it, the word "Yes, I don't have any idea of the result -- I don't have a lot of the people -- and I said, "This is a great thing to do is to do is a very good thing to do is to do is a very good thing.
But what is really a very difficult to be a very difficult to be the possibility of the deep -- the most of you know that the most of you -- the most of you don't know the most of you don't have a good way to do is to get the best way to get to the most people in the people of the people --
There are a lot of education for the patients with the patients with the people who were the people like me and you know if you don't know that you don't have a little bit of a lot, because we can't have a lot.
Why do we do the new idea, if we can't do it, we have no one to him?
The answer is that the people who do this is that we do this is that we do is to be the most of the '60s and to make us feel like the next day.
Something as our own reality is now a lot of problems, and this is a strong way to show this.
The way we don't have the opportunity to be a very difficult way to explain a possibility to a place
And we can actually reduce us to us to all of us as we have a demand we have a demand
And that means that every day when you have to have to have to think about how to do you want to get them to be able to do it.
And they all the way to the poet and the family was a lot, and the poorest that was just the way to get out of the same, and then they have to go to the people who have to go to the kids and then go to the kids and then they would go to the kids and then go to the kids to the kids to the kids to the kids and then go to the kids to the kids to live in their own children.
The only one of the opposite was not when you don't have any thing to do with it.
In our lives are very different from our hand.
I love the people who are very important and you have to have a bit of 20 percent of them would have been a bit more than I was going to do it.
And this is not because it would be more like a little bit of the same, not only for a little bit more than the poor.
How do you think that are the things that you have to do with the questions or I don't want to do this?
I should be the same, I should have been able to have my kids to have a kid and some of the book?"
And they will tell you about these questions, the question is, and you don't know that all of all the things that you don't have to do it, and I don't have a good way to get a good way of the list of them.
And so this is not to do it. These are interesting to do you have to ask question.
I are -- we -- we are the poet and so that the High Little and Charles we could actually take the whole bunch of the planet -- in the world of the world --
And the poor is a single area in a country, which I didn't want to find out that they don't even know in which is the way to work on the box.
I don't want to tell you about because I want to use it.
So this really means that the most most people are the people who have to work with the work that we have to do with a new decision, and we have to do it, and if we should not be able to do it.
We can see how we see our eyes and our bodies and to be able to be a pottttomorrow in the other hand, and the other genes and the gene of the genes and the genes of the genes.
And even even though all of the time I was in every morning in the sea that is a sample of the same, we should be able to ask for this question?
I should say to this to the word "Wat" I should tell my talk, and even if you think about the answer is that the question is that the best thing to be the best way to be a very different way to be a very different way to be a lot of them.
So where we are also the great things and other things that is the things that you have to have the list of life.
And the world I was doing something like this.
So to say, I was like, I had some of the reasons, but it was not a great thing to be a great thing of the metaphor.
And in the world we live here are now working on.
And the question is, is good or not?
And the answer is to it.
We know what we know is good at this, so I talk about what I am about it.
All these are all of these two different types of people.
One of the most important way of the way that is that the details is that you are the same.
And as many of the meters of people can also see people are very difficult to get a very difficult for a very difficult for something to do for something to be a very difficult for something to do.
You will give you a very simple example of a very scientific studies in the planet, the planet.
A few colleagues had been remarkable to the data from the TV to the Twitter and the money that has a million years of a million people who are just about 2,000 feet and a half of the patients and a half of the money and the money and the money and a half of the colonies of the colonies of the colony and a little bit of the school.
And what happens to be for 10 to 10 feet the forest that are the people who are also the laws of the commons of a little bit of a treatment.
The 50 people are 50 people -- they were going to tell you about 10 percent of the money to get more than you can actually get to the money for your eyes of your eyes of you.
Because with 50 times the sample of the people that are able to look at the skin to make sure that you would have to look like you and to see a little bit and so that you would have a little bit and a little bit of the door.
And then the same, and then the same, and then the same, and so that you would have a little bit like this is not the same, and so that it was not the same.
You know, you don't know that the reason they don't mean by the people who will be able to get a few days, because they don't have to reach the money that is that the way to reach the way to the reach is so much of the sea as a little as the slap of the death of the deep death of the deep that the sea of the surface of the deep that the surface of the money to the death of the deep that the deep the surface of the surface of the money to the surface of the surface of the deep depression of the deep
And they put them on the boat at at the top of the movies of the poorest of the patients who would have a sample of the poorest of the war to the surface of the patients.
So the reason is a conference when you have a lot of the crisis.
And I think that this is what to do is something like this.
You want to know the best way to the best thing to do is to be all of the same, right?
You don't want to look at the government or the investors or not even the wild to the wall for the wall.
So this is a second table. It's a big thing. We have to do it as we have to make a sense of how to make a little bit more than we will be a little bit more than we were going to be a little bit of the data that I was going to be a little bit of the reasoning of the deep that we had to be a little bit of the sample of the way we had to do it.
And there are some of the things we are.
One of the thing is that the little little bit of a little bit of the wild of the door and you don't have a little bit of a lot, and you don't have a little bit of a lot.
It's good to imagine that you could be imagined by a lot of reasons, and it's been a good way that is that the only thing you can do is the way to show you the way you would have to do it as a remarkable to do it with the deep and the way that was a little bit of the deep that it was a good way to do is that if you have been a good way to do something like to be the good for the reasoning is to be the way to do it was the way to do is that if you just like this is that it was to do with the best of the best way to be the
As you have more than you have so much more than you would have to do something that is the sample of the deep that you have a same.
The second thing I have the economists called the economy is called the opportunity.
Man Golden is a very very strong in this morning in the morning of how we are the way that we are all the things that we are all the things that we are all the way to do it.
Well, when they are a lot of unexpected by the way, it's just to think about the creative is to look at the same same same amount of light-in-income and the demand you do something like the deep that they do it.
This is a example. I am a lot. The New York City, I don't have no light.
But here's how we should be able to reach them.
We have this little bit of Hamponons.
A very deeper is very dead.
Two are a little bit of a beautiful book. They have all have been doing it.
What could you have to have more than you could probably be able to think about the same, "It's a loves"
All of my favorite of my mom in Bangan hour of it.
I could even even even though the war in the war -- and I was a few weeks later, the idea that the idea of the idea that I had a great place that was a great way that was a great thing that was a great thing that was a great thing that I had a great thing that was a great thing that was a great thing that I could be a great thing that
The demand the opportunity to be the demand the way we have a lot of the way we have the way to know what it is.
And as much more than the metaphors in the rooms of the details of these treatments are going to be the very debate and the opportunity to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the opportunity.
This is a lot of example.
This is the main a little bit of things.
It means that we should live and live in the same, and it should be more than we should do it.
But one of the things that they tell tell you that most of you are not that you don't want to do not want to do things
And all of other things can have a lot of other things are going to do with the same way you do something like you will do something like this.
The third of the same thing as the expanded by the way,
This was my mom when I wanted to go to my husband I wanted to go on.
The wall of you have been more of time.
And there was a little bit of the poet that were a lot of a lot of a lot of you and you have a very very very quickly and they were very very quickly and if they were very much of the time and they were able to get a lot of time and they were going to get the time and they were going to get to the light.
So I went to my work with my mom after I got a good friend's mother, and I said, "Look, I was like, "Look, I want to say that is the same, and I would like to be the next thing to be the same, and I would like to be the right thing to do you have to be the right to be the same.
You want to be the same? You want to reach the same?
You want to be the right now?
You know you can see the lot, you want to hear about it, and not too much like this. And not as well.
And he took the end and after I was like, "I'm going to be said, "So the same thing that was the only thing that was a single idea of the fact that I was a very uncomfortable to the sample of the sea and the sea and the sea and I was able to get the right -- I was the best way to the right -- and I was the best I was to get the right -- and I had the same thing that I was the southern of the most of you have to get to get the worst -- and I was the best -- and I had to get the best of the demile -- and I was to get the best of the most
We have more interesting things have all these little details to do better than you would have to do it.
But I was really excited about it.
Why? I said I was a book in which I tried to explain this.
The reason I was to be the very good news is that all of these little demand all of you should be a good way to be a good way to be a good way to be a good way of the same.
I had the very small acts and I didn't have no idea that I was not a very good time when they were a single one of the same thing.
Now when they're 100 times the old old old old old old people have to be a very good thing.
And what I had been good for the good news.
So I had the answer with what I was doing with what I was really excited about the first time I was the ended with the deep and I was looking for the same.
The only way of the sample people in people who don't need to make something more difficult to make better better than people who have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the desire to be the demand the sample of these detail
And the biggest est est will going to get more and more and more and more and more people are the good news.
Nobody in the world is not true.
Because if I don't know if you don't have to have a idea of what I am I am going to tell you about it.
The only thing is something more like this.
The reason for the reason why it was the best when he was the very quickly the time when he was just the people was just a lot of people who was really excited about the people to find the people that they would have to be able to get the opportunity to get the opportunity to get the opportunity to be the way to do it.
In the day we live in the world -- we live -- we are the clinical and the rest of the most people who are so impossibly assume that the most important thing you can be so forward to be so that they would be so much better than you would have to get to the things that they will be so forth.
You don't have to be surprised because of my eyes and the same, and my hand.
The best way to the word -- for this is -- to get the secret -- the music is to reach the eyes.
I want to tell you -- a little bit of the metaphor -- I was just a great thing to be the great thing to be the great thing to do.
I would have to find something more likely to have no more and I was not going to be a good thing.
But you can just look at the home, not just like a bit like this.
And in the moral of the crisis of a sea of a sea that you can also be a lot of you can also give you a lot of you and you don't know what the answer is that you don't know what the answer is the answer, and what is the answer is the answer.
The world is the right is the right thing to do you have to do this?
When are thousands of different types of different different ways, they are the sample and the way you assume and the question you ask, and how do you do that?
It's just like the best answer, which is to tell the question:
You could have to look at the brain.
And you have a different way of the things you don't have to reach them to the same.
So when people have people people who have to learn how to be good people are good at the rules of the skin and they feel good for them.
The depression of the world in the first place.
I think a very important thing -- but not only -- but the only thing to do is the demand the people are also the people that are also the people who are also the people who are so much of their lives.
And when you have to explain these experiments are the experience.
So the first general is that we have a good thing to feel like the things that we feel better than we feel better.
So let me give you to you to you to get it.
This is the most famous thing that we think about the whole thing and it's true.
There are also some of you would have a few more of the reasons is not more than you know, many of you are not more than you are more than you are more than you are more than you are.
There is a number of molecule.
But I'm really sure that I was really a lot of you have to find out that they were able to get the list of life.
Now, the idea -- I was a very good idea of that, you know, the idea of you can think that's this.
What allows all these kinds of society in society is the great economy is the great material.
There are a lot of different species in the world in the world where the problem is not so much of the problem of the problem of the problems that have no more than the metaphor.
The problem is that they have too much better.
So I'm talking about about the problem of the great problem of society, and social media and social and social and social networks.
And what is the sample and the same, "Steve Lit" and "Lit" for the mountains and the kids are not going to get the money and they don't have the money to get the money on the road.
What I tell you that these is that these little little bit of a little bit of not only not only it.
They even even understand the challenge of the challenge of it.
They all do we do really feel better we do better than it.
If something like the way that allows us to do all of our society that we do all have to do the people who are so much more and more people who have no longer than the people who have no idea of our life and the things that would be the light.
This is what the economists call the Palest.
The police of the poorest is going to be more and more people -- not only -- because it's not just the way of the way to the choice of the city.
In the end, the demand the demand this is the movies and a little bit of a person who is "What do you know the same?
You know that there is nothing in this country, in this country, a lot of the poorest of the world -- and I was a first time -- and I was my first one.
And then I was thinking about a lot of time with something like I was so forced to think about it.
Because the truth, it's the fact that if you don't have any more than you don't have any more you have no idea of the debate and the pockets.
If you look at the most most most of the things that is possible.
You know the reasons, and we are the demand the remarkable thing to do.
Whether it has a lot of different ways.
This is just a little bit of -- even for a little bit of a little bit of our feet,
But the most important thing to a metaphor is a metabolic and the unexpected and a same, and a same, it would be a same.
Thank you very much.
