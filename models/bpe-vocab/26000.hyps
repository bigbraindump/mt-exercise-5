The year I started to show these two diesetry to show that the polar tar polar that the most of the last three million years of the last three million years ago, the last three million years ago, he was a little bit of the age of 40-percent of the marriage of 40-percent of the top of the second die.
But this morning, the seriousness of this specific issue because it doesn't show the size of the guy.
The police of the police is, in a global warmed global system.
She expectations and the contraction of the bottom line of the food.
The next step that you look at the speech will show you the right thing on the last 25 years.
The post of the emancient is the marine of the smile
As you can see the blue of blue dogs.
This is the anudust for the time.
And it turns out the morning.
Asad the guy, the forest of five years or more years or more than five years or more than the box, you can see in a body.
In the 25 years of the year at this point,
This is a problem because the death of the destruction of the death of the ocean around the ocean around the ocean that the paper.
where it is a carbon carbon scar carbon carbon that is same, where, it's transformed in metal of the metaphor of the microorganisms.
Comparing the pollution of the global warming of global warming in the atmosphere can we take this point in the extreme thing to do is that in the extreme point.
In certain ways, the lacks of Alaska metal metal metaphor is at the end of water.
The Katen Water Walter Wallter Wallter was on the University of Alaska at another one of the one of the one of the one of the last few to the past.
Anow! Ano! Al Gore: This is OK -- it's the question of whether we are going to be here.
And a reason is that enormous "wor" is the Genzing of the northern Genland in the north.
This is a race that they all over the year of the year.
But volumes are much larger than that.
This is the Kangeruselsssush Genland.
If you want to know how the big the topier of the topier of the topier is where it comes to a big place.
These are actually going to grow very quickly.
And at the other end of the planet, Antarctica most map of the world's largest planet.
The last people who have reported as the end of the continent of the continent of the balance of the Antarctica is the negative Antarctica, and the West, the remarkable island in the room,
This is the equal of seven feet in the big level, as the Genland in Genland in Genland
In Himalaya, the third of the third of the third of the new vision, you see the new formats, which was the new years of being being guid.
40 percent of the population of the world of the water in the water water from these topier.
Today, this guard is the source of water for this city for this orgable for this orgable for this city
The fact they were raised up.
But when it were, so it were, and with the water water water and the water water
In California was a 40-percent of the frog in Sierra.
This affect the water soulder.
And predictable, as you are seriously seriously.
On the whole world has been able to take a dramatic creative creature.
And the disaster of the whole world have grew up with a great great great great reference.
four times the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the 75 years of the 75 years.
This is a completely unusual model of it.
If you look at the context of the history of the time.
In the last five years, I added up the 70 million tons of the carbon dioxide every day of 25 million hours every day in the ocean every day.
Up to the Up to the Pacification of the U.K., and every part of the West, and every part of the individual of the individual where it's a radical resident.
The largest because the global inquality of the global warming of fingery inner of it, is the arrows, the arrivereign of the fossil of the fossil of the fossil of the forest of the world's largest unit is the largest of the global warming of the global warming of the global
The Petra problem and the cars is the most serious thing is the most seriously.
The United States is one of the two big emergency of China.
And the proposition was to build a lot of factory for the car.
But we're starting to see a change change.
This is the ones that have been the same specific in the last years with the same specific years.
All of the political policy in our country.
And the carbon and the oil and the oil and the oil spill, the last year of the last year, the quenenence.
And promoted the book is a forest of the forest.
This picture of something about something like this.
In the Cracial Cracial Tenness, a billion gallons of store was impairs was imprast.
You probably see it in the stirling.
This is, the whole thing about the second big depression in the U.S. has happened in the preparing of Cracial Cracial Cracial Cracial Cracial --
One of the first of the great industry of the book of Cracial Cracial Cracial Octocy, it was this.
Video: ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫
He is the abundance, here in America and helping to create the economy.
Frosty, the man with the car, it becomes the more time.
He is also adorable and workers recover the removing.
Al Gore: This is the very important source of Virginia,
The most of the most famous book is the most of Massey of Massey of Massey of Massey of Massey of Massey in the most of the Massey on the most of the most of the forest of the most of the forest of the world's largest made.
Video: Don Blankenn: The Gore, Nana, Nana, Nana, Fore, Harry Reihabar would not be about what I'm talking about.
Al Gore: So the same as Aliquid for the Climate Climate Climate the two campaigning.
This is one of them, part of the one of them.
Video: In COALLOALergy new climate change as a very serious as a three-dimensional threat to our business.
And that our main is to spend a lot of money for the public force of public force to help us look at our time.
The device is not a good carrier.
We think it's a curriculum -- and I have good good
So you don't want to make the climate change for change.
You get that in our understanding of it.
Video: The good newspaper, you heard a map of it.
So let's make a chance of this cup of this pocket of the cartoon the cartoon the carriage.
Aimm! Masininaria is a little bit of the same.
But this is the sound of technology of the good technology of the food.
And as the good good news is one of the main the global inforce of the global remarkable technology to change the technology of the technology of the technology that you can change the whole thing.
Up to the point of attacks, this is the good technology to the goal.
Al Gore: In the potential positive positive practice of economic challenges and with the problem and the problem with the problem and problem with the problem of nationals.
Video: Narrator: America is in the nationality, economy, economy, the climate crisis.
The approach that they have to do it all the dependence on the basic combat the bottom of carbon on the motor.
But now we have a new solution to the unexpected to the incurious heside of the cities.
You can probably have America with electricity to 10 years ago, in 10 years ago, in 10 years ago.
A plan to put America to get the third of the time to help us stop and help us to help the stopping of global warming.
In the end, a solution that is to reach us to help us solve our problems.
You can take America. You can get more of a lot of it.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: The Narrator: It's about re-energy-power.
One of the most difficult ways to innocent the most farming of the old combat our planet, our our planet who are killing our planet, our Life is here to be here in the God is here in the soil.
Barbered the rush to create the road to create the platform.
Narrator: Rability of America. It's time for actire.
Al Gore: Ara: The subject of African hour African who says, "If you go fast, you walk down the right thing to get up right here?"
If you want to get back to the sound!
We need to get it back to it, fast.
Thank you very much.
The year at TED I did a LHC.
And I promised it to give you a database of how this function is going to get this machine
So here is my daughter for those who have not here in the largest experiment that was the largest scientific experiment that was the most scientific -- the Cirumpy Street Street Street Street Street Street Street and a billion of a billion in the university of the universe, the frog of the universe.
It's extremely measured.
This is the Genevevelevator.
We take the photos of these minds of "Big Bangs" in the decades.
I work at this point. It's called the ATLS -- Lunged -- Lunged 444 feet of 22 meters here of 22 meters here at the ATLS pictures of the ATLS picture.
On the 10 seven, I went out for the first time.
And this picture was the ATLAS.
He caused a great famous to control the room.
It's a picture of the first particle that the amount of particle that quick the LHCH, cross the LHC, cross and the particle in LC and particle is in the freedom of LC and particle in detector.
In other words, when I saw that image 10 seven, I knew that the device of functioning of functioning as a result.
I don't know if this was received the biggest or that, when someone went on the Google and it was going to see the first page of the age of the top of the one thing that the first step of it.
I mean, I did a cultural impact on the wind impact on the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the dissident.
And after that, I had a problem with the device, which actually had a problem with these days, these days.
Those are the transportation of the finger-foot power function to the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the moon.
Now, engineers in the room, and we say, "You can't transportation the plant of the amphas."
But I can do this because when they're at the temperatures become the superconductive of the superconductor.
So as a 27-year-old boy, and the hospital of the hospital between the steps of the box, the box.
At one of the lawyers of the 9,000 magnets in LHC, was a factory of factory facility.
So the company was enzing a little bit of the 13,000 ampons were innited to get electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impression, and they are now going to be able to get over 20 tone, and they moved to 30 seconds.
So I have a kind of magnetic magnetic magnetic
I had to take the end of the things that we were going to do it.
I reconvicted on the top, I repair to repair
And now we take magnetic in the subterm.
The end of his marvelous March of the LHC will be like new as a new as a new as a new time.
We will start to get out of it, and we can get the data, and we'll continue to get the data and we'll continue to find out that the elements of the universe.
Now, of course, the kind of a way, those accidents of the reopening of the important thing about the important thing about extreme thing is going to break it up.
I think that it is the fact that it is the fact that we have young inalso, this is the important thing to do is the important thing like LHC.
And so I'm going to leave the words of a human human consciousness of the Humphilanic, but when the early experiments of the protection of the protection of the protection of the protection of the protection of the risk of the mind, he said, "I'm not worthy for our minds of our minds are not finding to our own minds and our own intirements, and they are not finding the world and the world are not finding and our worth of the world are not finit."
Thank you.
I want to start with the kidding to you to remember when you play with your kids, when you play with your boat.
On the map of the first result, you know, to get them down and get them to get them and you actually invite them to get it and sold the problem, and to solve the wind and manipulate the hospitals.
The point of the hospital is deeply to a lot of our injury.
So the way that the IT reinspired by this kind of a new way of our interactions with our physical objects with our objects -- impression -- my immediately and my colleague, my colleague, and I started to go -- I started to use a computer, where I would be able to get a computer of this unique with a computer that could be the next one of the next step to the demand a global warm to be so much to the information that we could be so much of our information and we can be so much to take to take to the right to the wrong with our own information, and we have to the question of our own information and we have to the question of our own information and we have to be so much of this unstage with this unstage with a computer and then go of our own computers of this unununununununununununtivistill, and the same
And it turns out that what do we want to it?
The question was that the question of the fascinating we put the researcher we put the researcher Siftable to build Swedge.
In short, a short, Siftable is a computer interactive path of a bism.
They can be manufactured, they can perceive the forest of the forest of the world, and they have a screen and a radio and radio and radio radio radio and radio radio of the radio of the wife.
The most important thing is that there are plenty of games, like the box of games, you can just get it up to the way it would take it to get them out of it.
And Sif, the Swe'd give the example of an ecosystem by the digital manipulation of the digital process.
On the map of the device becomes more like their mission, their own consequences of each other. And the other side of the other nutrients and convictions of our nutractive and destroying new new and destroying new and destroy and destroying new and destroy the way to interact with interaction.
I'm going to start with simple.
This Siftable is confifired to show you video, and if you include in a direction, if you include in the other hand, if you include in the other part, they want to get back back back back back.
These are the interactive of the other side of each other.
So if I put one on the other side of the other one, they become interesting.
If there are inconted in it, and they can become a little confidence and they can become a little confidence.
I can also feel the risk and inclining.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of interacting is that we can use the same way we can use the way to manipulate the data, how we would be able to make a light.
In this case, we have three Switwitwitness as a gas and they can use them in the center of the center of the center of the center, where they want to be the center of the center of the center of the center,
If we can get too much, we can get too long, we can get back.
And we also have interesting possible for education, how would it be able to education, mathematics and logical, mathematical games, and that is to try to see the possibility of people to see the results in the end.
So this is a Fibonacy, the Fibonacy, which is a simple program that makes a simple program program.
Here we have a game game game form, a kind of combination of Scrabs and Bostage.
And the fact that in every single one of the first time in the end, and the main every Sifttable, and force the mountains to forget with a dictionary.
And then after the last 30 seconds of the letters of the letters and you have a new set of letters and we can make it possibly intimate.
Thank you.
These are the people who came to the Laborative of Laborating at Laborator, and I returned to determine their way and removing.
He just loved it to the crazy.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of applications is that you don't have to give them a lot of people who are not able to give them a lot of people a lot of people who are going to get them to get them to get them to give them to the people to get them to get them to get them to get them to get them to the other people of this kind of applicators of this kind of appreciate
All you have to say is "From words, they know exactly what to do.
Here's a few people who are trying to get them to get them.
This is the most tangible test, the right hand in the right right in the right.
It turns out that everything he wanted to do was to do was to do one over the other.
So it was just a customers.
This is a animal animal kingdom --
We wanted to build a instrument for those who invest language.
And this is Frix.
He can introduce new personality in the scene, just down the stage of those Sweden.
This is the sounds.
Video: The race.
David Merrill: Now he introduced a stage in the scene.
Video: The Tractor of the portrait
Very y!
When Swedittable and asthanks to one of the sanger can make the person's person's personality -- Video!
DM: It creates his own narrative.
Video: Hun!
DM: It's a sense, and he decided, and he decided.
Video: Zboy, the pyico!
DM: The last example I have time to show you today is a device of designing and interpretation of the music that we built the Mism, and in which we built the role of soil, and all the sounds of the sounds of the sounds of the sounds of the soil.
Each of these different variations of different variations that you want to use it.
And you can get the sound of a succession that you can get the kind of a person who are going to get the kind of time.
You get the sound of the sounds of sounds of a successful Sweet Swetable Sweden.
There are effects that you can control the poor can be reverberary and the filter and the filter of the film.
You see it in a certain sounds and then you include it by helping it to help it to help it off.
They are general effects like the general and the volume that are applied to see it in the way of going to see it.
Video: DM: And we start to a second Swey in the second Switzerland, we can recover them in a serious seriously.
Now I'm now I'm going to put a basic line.
Video: DM: Now I add add it too.
Video: And now I'm going to hear the top, to control the top, to control the effect of control effect effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the light.
Video: DM: And he can bring the third inclining inclining in a part of a part of a part of a single one or something.
Video: I will think of the bage of the bagging filmmake.
Video: DM: I can resection in the long time.
So I don't have to do the plan, can be improvise, you can improvise, or a shorter of the walking.
Now, in the end of the third intree of Sweden. And so the Swedish of the volume of the volume of the volume of the wheelchair in in the stanger.
Thank you.
And as you can see, my passion is the creation of new interfactory that is right with the way that they functionally better with our brain.
And today, I had time to show you a new coordination of this new hope, and you can put it in the lab.
The God that wants to retiny is that we are at the new generators with the tools of interacting with the interface of interaction with the interview, which will bring the rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules
Thank you very much.
These are the dealing of you to play the box.
I'm writing.
He wrote the book is the teacher, but of course, more than that.
It's my mother, my mother, and fascinating a life and fascinating.
And I don't have this kind of change is ever going to change it.
But these are the kind of a little bit of life and the book, and in the book, which is my release reduce me to me to require me to the worker.
And the strange thing is that I wrote this book for this character, this is the "Manancy, Roagertaining "Iubesty," which is the way to be able to be a very important thing to do with any of my career and became this important thing that reasonable to the world for a little bit of an international message.
The result is that the city is that people go right now, people are being convicted by the way,
Serios -- the convicted -- the convicted of it.
With in the rest of the people say, "You don't know is the theme -- you don't know is the theme that you can't stop it?
You don't know that you're going to start to write the forest of your life that time to create more cool for the world that ever do with the world that ever do this?"
It's very linking to the real thing.
But it was also the more I remember if you don't have all the time I started to get out of the people -- when I was adolescentrepreneur, I want to become writing, I was going to become the same thing I had to get out of the same response to the same term dealing the same thing on the same way that I was a kind of a African reacting.
And people said "I'm not going to be a lot of you haven't seen any success?"
You don't know that humility will be killing your require?
You don't know that you're going to work in this field of your life and nothing will be going to take a morning of the one of the death of the headquarters of the flamp of the flexible with the end of the rain?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the short -- the answer to all those questions is "Yeah."
Yes, you have a theme is the theme of all of those things.
And it always always came to me.
And you have the theme is the end of the people who can't intuitive things that people can be able to intuitive.
As an example of the great algorithms that are cross that are crosset.
But when it's about the work that I always thought I was all the question I asked the last time is "What?
Is it something rational?
It's the logic to be the work that they feel like they were enough to do that they feel like the Pame.
And what is the specific initiatives that seems like us is true to the healthcare is true to the healthcare about health care in a kind of health care in a kind of a way that other teachers don't do it?
My father was the chemistry and you don't remember as a chemical as you don't have a chemical engineering of the chemistry of the chemistry to be a engineer to be a engineer and it's a chemistry to be a chemistry engineer to be a chemistry.
It wasn't the thing -- John, how does it go with chemical?
It just doesn't happen to be happening.
But to be honest, engineering as many groups have not always a lot of cities to be in the reputation of the reputation of being alcools of being alcools.
We write that in the insects of this reputation, and not only writing, but the artists, it seems like this reputation of all the way to be powerful and they seem to be powerful in order to be powerful in the end.
And we have to do is to look at the numbered by the numbers of the 20th century, in the 20th century, in the 20th century, and often in the forest of the human minds and often often often often often have been died by the light.
And even those who didn't have the own thing that didn't do is really being really required by your own light.
Norman Mailer, even before the last time to go to the last interview, he said that "Each me a little bit more of my book."
A great great great about your work of a life of a life of a life of a life of a life of it.
But I don't have a clip when we hear that we hear that because we heard this because we heard of all of the things that we have absorbed and something, and I accept the idea of the collective and the unusual and the unusual and the art, and it turns out to get it back to the end of the required.
And the question I want to add to all of the things that you are all of the impact with this idea?
You are comfortable with -- because as it sees the light, and I don't have to be impaying with this stage.
I think it's like this is a bunch of it.
And I also think it's dangerous and I didn't want to see it in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage our artist's marriage to the truth of the trask.
And I know the reason why I know -- in my situation, my situation, my way to start to start to go to the point of the neighborhood of this one of the forest of this one of the circumstances in which I think is a circumstance.
For example, there are pretty much like 40 years.
I have probably four decades of the work of the work of the work of work.
And it's very likely to write the end of what I'm going to write with this moment of the work that the work that the work that came back to the last time I came up with my last last last time I was right here?
What it would be a little bit of the people here are the same friends here we are already probably the most successful of my -- it's very likely to be happened.
Oh, Game, what gand!
This is the kind of the kind of one to the way to look at the end of the day in the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I mean, I will do in the continue to do it in the message that I love
And then, the question is, what?
And so I think the movie of meditative that -- to be in the way to go now, to try to get it to write a sort of a general construction of the democracy, right?
I had to find out a way to find a distant way to fly a distant distant to me, and my father and my father and my father who was going to be now in the room, and I was now in what he wrote to do it.
And as I always looked at the last year in this sense, and I started looking at the time, and I tried to find other society to find other society to see other society to be better and healthy and healthy and healthy people are better and healthy people are more healthy risk to make the emotional risk of emotion.
The researcher this has been in Great Roma and Roma and Roma Anyway,
So the great thing you can do is the incheck of the sky.
But in Grecently, the Rome annual Roming the people who don't think of the human being in the human inside the human human inside the human human and the human human brain,
People have thought the creativity, the creative was helping people who are held to a surround and unintelligent and unintelligent and untable and unneeds.
The name were these spirits of creatures of creativity, the term of the term of "proce."
Socrats was the famous for a demon that it has a department that the intelligence of department.
The human were the same pattern that spirit of creative, but they were called the immoral spiritual --
And this is great, because they don't believe that they have not believe that a particular genius was a very expensive.
They were creating a genius as a genius was a kind of income from the war studies of the war studio, in a way that Dobby, the journey of the journey of the journey and unfortunately, the path of the work of the workplace, the path of the workplace, the result of the workplace, the result of the workers of the worker of the workernal of the war of the walls of the war in the room, which is the result of
Absolutely -- this is the distant is the distant that I was talking about the psychology that we were going to protect your results.
And all the world of the way that it did functionally good.
So the artist was protected by certain things, like for example, too much of the same as much as I was saying, right?
If your work was strallim in the street, you couldn't get the world for it, all the way to the world the way that has helped this genius to get this into the room,
If your work was critical, it wasn't completely release to your not?
Everybody like the gender gender have been a bit like this.
And they looked at the people in the West creativity.
And then the Renastasting and everything has changed, the idea of a certain idea of how to put the human universe as a person in the center of the universe and mysteries and mysteries the universe of the death of the death of the debate of desire to demand.
It was the human immediately and people started to create the creative of the creative of the individual creatures in the individual of individuals.
And for the first time in history of people started talking to one or other artists, as the other artists in order to be genius to get a genius.
And I have to marriage, I think that it was a huge error.
And the mysteries, a simple person to create the creative of the fact that it is actually the receptor and the capture of mysteries and source source and source source is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a long responsibility for the human beings.
It's like you have a cover of the so-like soil.
It just goes and decode and deforms and deforming and generen't in the process of the accounting.
I think that the pressure of this artist's one after the last 500 years.
And, if it's really true and I think that is, the question is, what do we do with it?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we go back to the older sensors of relationships.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't just stand to stand for 500 years of thinking about a rational talk.
And you probably have the public people who would raise the signals that would be absolutely to be the theme that they are actually going to get the people present the people present the people presentation of the people presentation of the projects and all the projects and all the time.
It probably probably will be covered to this idea.
But the question I want to put it on is -- why not?
Why don't we think about that?
Because it has a sense of how much we heard something else else about what we hear about looking at the very inner of the creative process.
And that anyone who has ever been trying to create something -- basically basically the whole thing -- it is that it doesn't always get the behavior.
And, in fact, sometimes the right partly the right partner of the right parts.
I had a reference that I met the American Rutch of American Rutch Ruth Stone, which is now has been in the jade of 90 years and that was the bridge, and he was the story of when he was a story and just told me when he was a poetry and get it feels and I just heard, and I just hearing a poetry and I just hearing a poetry and get the road to have a poetry and hear the cameras a poet in the American of the end of the roof.
The story of the story of the sample of the same.
And it was the price of the campaigns.
The point of income in the same, because you get the bottom of the forest.
In that moment the point of doing one of the one thing that is, "To get the applive it as a watch."
And the running as the top of the house and the third of the idea was to get the idea of a map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map and he would take it through the map and to put it on the map.
Sometimes it wasn't enough enough to get it and the alone and running and running and running and the stage in the house and the poor and the poor and the poor and the poems and the poems of the room, and I read the room, I read "another poetry and a different poetry and a other word.
They were also at the moments where it was not going to look at this time -- moments that story is the story of the story that almost lose.
Also, the chair of the main and the made, and the poems of the credit card the credit card the way to the other person and the story of him and the story of him and through the other person and through the other and through the other hand.
The main the code and the tragedy of the cop of the main the main the map of the map.
In the case, the right application of the right map of the nose of the nose of the last word at the first worst word.
When I heard it -- it's the suicide, it was just the way of my own process.
My design process doesn't matter to that -- I'm not released to this -- I'm not drive!
I'm a catching where they work in the way they work on every day and go back every day and turn it into the same way and you can actually get out of the right and they are going to be wrong with the wrong with the wrong with the wrong with the same way.
But even though I was like, I was in my hair, I was able to know that phenomenon.
And I have imagined that kind of have been and many of you are.
I was also my projects or ideas that they came from a source of a source that makes me know that they don't know it.
And what do you do you get this stuff?
And how do we should be reporter our minds we don't lose our minds, you know, we don't lose our minds, you know, we can help us get to help us remote to help us remote to remote our ance?
For me, the most relevant from our days, which is what we can do is doing is the music of Tom Waits, we took a piece of the Waits, I took a look at the demanding of the revivivivil in the demandy.
I was talking about the subject of this subject of his life ended his life to the contemporary artist's contemporary artist who started to control and gestablished to control these and galls to the creative and gentlemen.
And the time it was the story of the story of the story of the story of the death of the death of the death of Los Angeles and then everything has changed.
Whereas we drive from a short fragile in a short pig of the time that comes to the earlier and magnetic and magnified with the head; it's not about it, and it's not about it, but it doesn't have to go and if it doesn't have to go away.
It doesn't have any of the map, it doesn't have any reported report.
The fact that the whole thing that the screen in the Eastern in "About to lose the point of the moment for the time.
I'm not enough to revealing a reus."
And instead of the panels, just just went out of the show.
He went through the third and he did something with something that we did something all with all new time.
He raised the question of the same, and he said, "You don't see that they're at volan?"
"You know, you look at a chance of a chance of it?
If you really want to be able to be in a moment when you can get to a point of you.
If you get your mouth and you get out of somebody else's life.
Take it and you get it from Leonard Cohen."
He was a creative process has changed this with this time.
It doesn't have the operating to be the same way that always get the one of the time.
But the process of synthetic process, and the third of the time he took the time to the end of the moment he took the headquarters and only because he has to come back to the room, and it took it back to the room, and it has to be something that has to be able to be a look and China.
It could be collaborating and the bizarre, and the bizarre in the form of a conversation and external exterarrest, the exterrorist that was not too much like Tom.
And after I heard the story of the story I started to change a little bit of the way I did it say.
This approach me when I was a friend of the word "Manclay, Roager, Iubest, and I have a case in a kind of disappearing to be in the case that we all in the way that we were not a disaster to think of it would be a disaster, and you think the most of it will be a lot,
Not just that, but the most proof this book ever ever ever before.
I was going to think of that we should just abandone.
I remember my opening Tom and I was talking to the open-up and I asked it.
I went to the next step on the manuscript and I rerererererererelease a collision of the camera.
I said to the voice of it: "Leave and you know that if this book is not going to be amazing, not just going to be in my daughter?
Because you can see that one of the battery that I would have to go and more than I want to know that they don't know.
So if you want to be better at it, you need to do your own job, and you need to do your own side.
Okay. And if you don't do that, you know, if you all of a whole thing.
And I would say that my message for this message to my message.
And I want to consign about my third of my third part of my third part of my third part of my third side.
Because -- the Conclusion -- with hundreds of years ago, hundreds of years ago, people get to get to the people get to get to the table, and museum to get into the wild of the wild and music, the hot of the welderly of the wood's wood.
And they were always wondering, because the dancers were teaching and they were remarkable, right?
But sometimes the way, something happened, and one of the presentation of the community of the real community of it.
I'm convinced you you you all know what I mean you all of you in a certain moment of you in a certain point of interpretty.
It's like the time and the damong the time is the passage is not in a kind of place that you don't do anything different than one of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 ser, all of the other 1,000 series of the time.
And in a time it doesn't have any more time.
It's the list of the bottom line is the air is the air is the forest of the forest of the forest of the forest.
And as I get out of the people who were telling the thing about number.
They were the left and they were the end and they were "Allawy," Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, Game, Game, Game, Gammo and ylah, Game, Gamnew, and they were ununpreneunted and they were ununpreneted and they were the woodly and they were the end and they were the doing.
It's God.
A great among historical historical -- when the main have been at Span, and they took this with this useful has been to get up with them in "Allah in "Allah," and the rumh," and "Lin," and old, "Lina, and y" in "old, les."
and they hear about the time with the debate and dancing and dancing and dancing the flat the fly.
In Spania, when a reuser interpret something impossible and magic and magic magic and the magic of "Allah, magnificent Way, or Allah, magnificent voice,"
It was intelligent -- a God -- a God of God guy.
It's wonderful because we need to have something like this.
But the second day comes up to the second day in the morning, the end of the time is the marriage of 11th and it's not a more and more is not a scale.
It's a dirty that chances the genome that it can not get more and you might not be able to get the time of it.
Would you like one of the name of the Domn's name, so what he could do is supposed to be able to do with the rest of his life.
It's hard.
It's one of the most painful of the most of the creative of creativity.
But maybe it doesn't have a big thing that you don't think of how you don't think of the most extraordinary of your daughter are going to get from the inside of your own daughter are from the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the head.
Maybe if you just think about it was a proud of a source of a source of a moment of a moment of life to be a long time of life and when it momententententalemented to be a lot more and more than they were able to get out of the forest.
If we think about it, it all is all the way to change it.
I started thinking and I thought and I thought that was going to be a moment of the book that will be publishing the book that will be publishing and a same, perhaps, perhaps, and the crisis of my successful and crossed the signal.
And why I did it, by repetition, when you lose the curve: you don't be theater.
It doesn't be the sea and it just to get the Contintiny to your attention to your own beach your goal.
If you get the dance, then you get the dance.
If the gender gender comes and the center of what you do is repair to leave the dog of the way to leave the end, even for a momentum to a lack of the force of the force of the force of the force of the deforce of the disorders of the disorder.
And if no, it doesn't anyway.
And with all of these "fe."
I think we should have to be able to pretend them to pretend them.
"Oh!" for you, all of you just because you have a love for human human and inforce to participate in continue to participate in continuing.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We talked about some of these projects, about the human genome and what could be able to predict about the discovering of new genes.
Now we start to a new point of view: we digitize biology, and now we're trying to start to start in this room, and we're going to go into a new fisheries, and to go into a new form of biology, and in terms of life.
We tried to put all the time to put our questions.
"What is life life?"
We tried different approaches, simple life at the data, simple components.
We were just about 20 years.
When I sequenced the human genome genome -- this was taken from the analogical world in the digital biology in the digital world in the digital world.
Now we're trying to ask the question: can revivivivil or we can create new force of life, in this digital universal universe?
This is a little organism of a little organism Mycoplasma genitalia, which has the smallest genome that can replant in the lab.
We tried to see if we can come up with a genome and smaller smaller.
We were able to get the surface of a hundred genes of the one of the way that are there.
But when we look at the metabolic map of the map of compiling with our time.
So let me -- this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can only get the first time that this is a little bit of a life that is a little bit of life that is a life that it will be a life of life.
So we decided that the only way that we actually have to be able to do this crosis, we can see the amount of the components to reach some of the most fundamental components.
And so I started on the room, "Can we get a cross?"
Maybe the chemistry allowing these molecules that we don't have a big amount of that we never did anything?
And if we can actually act a cross of a cross of it?
A crosis, by the way, is just a chemical piece of chemical material.
So our speech of digital life grew at a ritting ritself to a ritself.
Our ability to write code code, and it is moving to the same way.
The last time he came to a consequence.
I started this on a little bit more than 15 years.
I went through a few times, in fact, with a bio-etal examination before it makes the first experiment.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficulty is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of cars where small small small brains in the world long long enough to 50 letter 30 to 50 letter, but it's a generative process, so that what you build a long piece of teenaged with more and more and more ertainers.
So we had to create a new way to put these little dots together and right together and right all of the right of the right of the error.
This was our first tenth of the digital information from the digital information of his life of his Physicist 174.
It's a virus that human human beings.
We did the piece of paper, I went through the right of the right of the right of the DNA by about 5,000 letter DNA by about 5,000 letters.
The interesting thing that I took this piece of chemical material, and we put it in bacteria, and bacteria started to read this genetic code, and bacteria started to read this genetic code, and to produced this viruse.
The viral Partics were then released from the cells and they came back and forth and they have come back and they have been back to the E.
I was going to see the oil industry and they said that they understand very clear this model.
They have laugh, more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software can build their own map can build a biological system.
But we wanted to do something more bigger.
We wanted to build the entire cross of a bacteria of a bacteria
This is about 580,000 letters code code,
So we said, we have to put the wall of the water in the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of a cell cell phones that are the top componental of a cell phone.
And the design is critical and if you start with digital information in computer, that information has to be very positive to be very positive to be very positive to be very positive.
When I sequenced this genome in 1995, the standard of presence was a error at 10,000 payment of the bottom of 10 paths of the rule of the forest.
I found that, in fact, I was reveal 30 to the original century, this would never be able to be able to never be activated.
The design of design is the design of the forest, which has to be the long way to do is a little bit of all the other dog to build the other dog to build the sub-unusual units to create less than each other.
We create elements elders.
You may have read "gentl" in the house. Good in your households in the neural code, we have a genetic code, and T.
Triries -- those letters -- those letters a range of about 20 amino recently by a single textbooks -- one letter the end of every author in the end of the one of the end of those letters.
So we can use the genetic code, to write the words, the proposition,
And the mysterial was to hear the code of the code.
Some of them were disappointing.
We designed those little dots so that we can determine it was with enzymous
I'm enzymous and they are all them.
So we started to make the piece of the piece of paper, and by 7,000 lets the way to 7,000 lets to do it a couple of letters and then put it in the room, and then put it up to 7,000.
And the time we have these little bits of these very few ways to abundant them can sequence, and to create a very robust process, and we try to create a very robust -- as you can see in a minute.
We try to get to get to that in the automatizing.
So this shows that a basket.
When we get to the very big market in 100,000 wallons of walls that they don't grow up in E.'.
It turns out all of the modern biology biology biology biology.
So we were right to other hand.
I knew that there is a mechanism called human human recombination, which biology that biology is using DNA, and that makes it look like DNA, and that makes it a piece of it.
This is a example.
There is a organism called Deinococcucus that can be the expensive, and the radiation.
As you can see in the cross of his head, the cross is froged in the kitchen in the kitchen shoes.
12 hours to 24 hours later, he took it to the whole new way to start to start the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be often often often all of the state.
I can live in life in the life of life.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the extreatment of extreatment to find a new environmental environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is the same there.
This is a micrograph that we build this molecule that we build these procle processes using these drugs with only the game of the design of the design of the bodies that we put in the skin that we put in the whole thing that we put in the whole thing that we put on the top.
Drojjaw them together in the automatically.
This is not a microscope with electronics, but only one of the micrograph but only one of the micrograph totoo.
It's the big molecule that we can see a microscope with a microscope with a microscope of the optic.
These are collecting images over a long period of about six seconds.
This is a public that we had a little bit time.
These are over 580,000 letters of genetic code,
It's the largest molecule made by humans, with a structure of a structure of the definition of the definition of the deforest.
It's a molecular molecular molecular in 300 million of the year.
If we put it with a 10 and no space of 10 and no space to get this genetic code, this genetic code,
So how do we start a cross of it? How do you get it here?
Evivivivil with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
Either one, more than you get to the end, as you can just take the nuclear nuclear and you can just put the nuclear -- and that's something you hear -- cloning -- and that's a one.
With the bacterium is the cross is integrated in the cells is integrated in the cells that we can do a completely transplant to a completely completely completely a single crosis, and we can activate it into a cell to the point of one or a cell to get it to the way to make it active.
I had a check of a microbial species.
These are the second distant as people and the same way as people and the same.
We added some genes in the plus to select this cross for this cross for this cross for this cross for this crossed for this crossed a few genes of the gene of a few genes of gene in a few genes of genes in the full gene of genes in the full gene of genes in the full of genes in the full of this cross for this cross for this cross for this cr
I had a demit to the human proteins.
And it was pretty amazing, when we put in the cells -- you will take the very sophisticated grades, and the cross came into the cell.
In fact, we thought that this is how far it can go and try and do it to design the process of something more and we tried to design the process of doing something more and more and more on.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We get all kinds of species that have all sorts of species that have a second crosis, or a third of the third of the other one of us from one second, thousands of new new new new characteristics of new new characteristics in a second.
So those who think about evolution just as a single gene in the biology.
I'm enzymes, called restriction that actually had the desire of DNA.
The key that the human human cells not a lot of it.
The man -- the cross that we put it --
It was extent and he was convicted the other cross as a material, and so we got to get it up with the cross of the cross of the cross of the cross of the cross of the cross of the new cross of the other crossed and he was the other crossed and he was the other cross of the other cross-collection of the other cross-as the human crosis, and so
It became blue, because of genes that we put in the cross that we put in the cross
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristics of a species have lost in a new species of a completely new species on the software that we put in the cells that we put in the cells that we put in the cells that we put in the cells that we put in the cell phone that we put in the cell time.
All proteins have been changing, membranes were changing -- when we look at the genetic code, is exactly what we do is exactly what we have transferred the genetic code.
This can sound like alome, but we can move the software to move the software to change things very dramatically change the very dramatically of the dramatically dramatically of the dramatic chemistry as we can get amattracted as a dramatic alome,
Now, I supposed to be genuine -- but it has been by the three billion years and half years ago, and we support that can be able to create a new version of creating a new version of the Talia, where the Talia, which has a new specific specific design for the digital maze, of the digital made.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obviously of the need of use.
We're going to go from six to six to a half of people over 40 years.
And I would put this in context for me in the context of the 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each of us there were in 1946, in 40 years, will be four.
We have a hour of southern water selling water potttable, drugs, commonly and half.
It will be difficult to do it for us.
We use over five billion tons of cards, more than 30 billion barriers of oil --
This means a hundred million barriers on the day.
When we try to think about procing the biological and anything that will be a huge challenge.
And then of course, the O2 at this material, of course, that has reached the atmosphere.
Now, our discoveries of our world, we have a database of the data data with genes, and I love to think about these projects, and I love to think about these projects.
The electronics of the electronics has just a due in the components, and this is the diversity that has been able to go out of it.
We are limited here, the first time, a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have the techniques, and we have these kinds of things that we call the gender, combinattractive gender, combinattractive.
We have the ability to build a big robot that makes a big robot that makes a day.
When you think of these 20 million genes of genes of genes or trying to do you think about procing the occupy of products that are going to be a little pharmaceutical team, we can change more biology than the last 20 years, to do more biology than the last 20 years, the whole system.
And this is just standard.
We can select for chemical viability, production or fuel or fuels or fuels, production production of vaccines, which is the city.
This is a design model of a design design design that we work in order to figure out how to do we find out to work in computers.
You know, we don't know how it will it look like this.
We know the genetic code, their genetic code,
Now we focus on the fourth of fourth generation.
You see that in the mixture of the mixture of the whole thing.
We have a second generation of the next two and the third of the third and the third of the way that are sounds like the more value, in comber and different ways.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without the product of food and the fall of the way to the limit is if we start with CO2 as we start to design and work is if we start to design and work with this one generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the forest of the fourth of the forest and the forest of the food and the cost of the food.
Lumber and CO2 is a way -- but in our discoveries -- but in our discoveries all kinds of other ways that we have all sorts of other ways that we have all sorts of other ways of the world have all sorts of other ways of the world --
This is a organism that I wrote in 1996.
It goes into the deep ocean and about two miles and half a mile, and half a half a five-foot temperature,
Transform CO2 in metan use molecular molecular as a source as a source of energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 captured, which can be easily transported in the country, and to convert that CO2 back to the buster in combat this point, to drive this stuff.
So in a short period of time, we think that could have the question of what is the question of "What is life is life that is life life life it?"
We actually know -- you know -- we have the chemical models of the chemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED, where another part.
So let me get a major source.
But also, we work now to use these same sources to invest to invention in the vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of the same cover as well.
You see this year with the bottom one year and a dollar at a dollar time, and a dollar vaccine.
I think that the situation can be changing the combination of any time we were going to be able to change the way of doing it.
This is how it could go to the future change the future of evolution now is the evolution of evolution with bacteria with bacteria with bacteria and finally, finally, and finally, finally, finding the bacteria -- and finding the end.
We're just going to improve people.
Our eye is just to make sure that we have a long time to survive pretty long enough to survive it very long to be able to survive.
So what I want to show you very quickly, is a fundamental work that we added it to Microsoft it at Microsoft as a year, this is a year. This is Seal of a year. This is Sealo.
It's a medium that can interact with a lot of visual data in visual database.
We look at a lot of digital pictures of digital pictures and switch on the continue to continue to go through this and rearranging anywhere in this room, rescue anyway.
It doesn't matter how much information is not the information of the big information is these collies, and how big they are images.
Most of them are pictures of a regular camera in the next room, but this is a picture of the Congress, the Congress, the city of 300 methods of 300 method.
It doesn't have important because the only thing that should limb the performance of a system is the number of skills of your monitors, it's also a very flexible architecture.
This is a book of the time that a non-imaginative example of a non-imaginative example.
It's about "Chase of Charles Dickens. The city is a chapter is a capital-one capita is a capital.
To show you that is the text, and not a imagine, and we can do something that is really a reference to show that it's not a position of a text; it's not a positive positive.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read an electronic book in form.
I would not give you a recommend.
This is a real real. It's a "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian of "Two in the "Gardian of the "Gardian in a case of a real.
Each picture of a second, the early seconds.
This is really gives you a piece of experience of a quick experience of a version of a revivil of a revivil of a revivil environment.
We have a little bit of this with this number of this number of the "Gardian of "Gardie."
I created a very big reclaim to a very larger -- much more than any clear -- and I was able to get a common conclusion -- and I was corporated by a confidence of it.
If you want to see the property of this car, you can see it here.
Or other other tech, or even other techniques
And this really through the idea, the law of a monitors of a monitor.
We hope that this is to be the poppponing and other people like this -- which are not necessary.
Of course, the mappping is one of the kind of the kind of like this.
I'm not going to say a lot of time on this day, but just to tell you that we have to tell you that we have contributed to this field.
These are all in the United States of the United States of the United States at Native ASA.
Let's go to a little bit of something else.
This is actually active on the Internet accumulation; you can great.
This is a Pinctive, which is the second two different technology. Some of them is the two different technology. Some of them is Sealow, and the other other very good research. The other visual visual university of the universe of the University of Washington, the University of Washington, to the U.S.
and Rick Szelisisse's research, Microsoft. A colleague.
So this is active on the Internet.
You can see that when we create this kind of perspective, when we can get this kind of imaging through images of images in many ways.
But the space of these images of these images of these images of the real images of it.
Algerian visual perception of these images have recorded these images, so that to rescue space, in fact, in the Grassment of the Grases -- they were done by the way, and the Death and the Death and the Swenemies here and these elements here and these elements were related to the space.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There are some more that have much more space space space ality.
I would like to go to one of his original stage of Noah -- this is doing a big protototoward to a Pforce -- to show you what I was working in the box, the technology that I think is the pioneh of this technology, the technology of this technology, the technology of this technology, the technology that we put in the projects, which we put in the website.
We had to have a widely worth of the legal aspect of the legal aspect of it.
This is a Cathedral Cathley imagery of Flickr. Glick's images of the Dams on Flickr, and you find something like a Dug Flickr, and you find out of these concrete contains in the room, and every one of these concrete contains.
These are the picture of Flickr, and they were related in this motion.
We can just have to be a navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I would have to work at Microsoft is very measured to have a first time I have a first time here.
I am nowhere you see that I'm a lot of the cameras many of the camera in the cell phone at SLRRs LRs Red SLRs in this environment.
If I can find out more fish.
There are so many main of fear, fission, and I am in the way.
One is going to be a series of photography --
This is a Nowl Dames who was recorded by the right time.
You can see the poster of the person of this medium for this environment.
The idea is that I can do certain things with social environment. This means to collect all the world -- from all of the world -- from a collective memoral -- and to interact with them -- and to interconnected them all those pictures have been connected to them. All these pictures have been connected to the country.
You have a model of what the Earth's entire Earth.
Think about this as a long as the first time of his work of his work "Virture."
And this creative creature, and of course, the world as well as the world as they become larger as they use it.
The pictures of the book are the meeting of metaphors that somebody else ended up there.
If someone would eaten all these slowly, and he says my photography with my picture, then the picture of the NowDs would improve with all these data, and I could use it as a place to make it a social experience of that space to make it a social experience.
And of course, a product of the rich and all of these are virtual and the virtual patterns of the ecal patterns of the Earth are not only from the earthquake, collecting not only from the back of the back, but from a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood the right thing to allow your software to allow you to get a moment in the next time in the next time for years, is that all the pictures of someone else to be interrelated?
BAA: Yes. That is really to be true to be dealing
It creates hyper-connected -- if you want to see each other.
And it does it make it based on the imagery.
And this becomes a quick of the information that they have the significant information that they have those images.
As you do a look at the Internet, you know, you look at the Internet, and the text on the Internet, and text it gives you a lot of information about what is posing.
Now, what if that picture is the connection to all the picture?
And then the amount of connection and the disease that is a huge amount of this is a huge amount of remote in the country.
CA: Blaws, is really incredible. Felicality.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of the journey of the trip of the footprint of the forest of the forest of the people who have no time in their old people who don't look at the old box, who are still feeling in the window, they still feel in their room, and they are in the leading of plants and the lead it in the planet.
You don't know that the Jagure's late of the Laccount of the Laccount of the older of the older of the older of the old man who are still replicating with the Himallim of Dhardware to remember the revelation of the world that we are not in a center of anthropology, and this is not only one of the world that we don't have a sense of the world that we have no sense,
The consequence of a certain set of decisions that our ancestors that are the strangers that are used to be successful and with many generations in the next generation.
And of course, we all share the same imperative adaptive.
We are all born. We all bring children on the world.
We go through the ritual rate of initiatives
We need to do the separation of the unit of morning, so we should be surprising us to surprising our time we all have to have the art.
But what interesting is the uniqueness of the son, the role of songs every cultural every culture.
FFFF: The tribes in Borneo, or the Voodoo in Haiti, or the war in Haiti, or the war in the northern of the Kaisneander, the tribal in the middle of the Sahai.
And the bridge, this is the kind of criminals that I had a month or even a long time on the Quensions of the Quart, the Everest, the earth of the world of the world.
All of these people are able to learn that there are other ways to think about other ways to think about other ways to think about the Earth.
And this idea, if you think about hope, maybe not to get your hope.
Now, the miridges of the world together and cultural life forms and cultural life that cover the planet and is the same important for the human health health care for the human health care for human health care about human human beings.
And you could think about this required in this network as the ethic and you can define the right summer, the nosphere, ideas of all the time, idea, inspiring of the visual imagery of the human imagination of human consciousness.
Etnosphere, human ancestors are the human ancestor.
It's the symbol, and it's all that we can be as a surprising specific specific specific specific specific specific specific specific specific specific species.
And as the biosphere, the biosphere, and the nosphere, and maybe it can be a lot more larger.
For example, no big, no big, unfortunately, half of all the species of all the species of all the species of the expancy, because it was not true, because it is not true, and yet this is not true, and yet this is the most of the scenario biology -- the most optimistic reality of what we know in the most optimal culture.

I want to start with what I call the "doct."
The Doctoring what?
The Doctors of all the Western society in the field society.
And this doctor in the soil, this sounds like th: if we are interested in the good way to maximize the level of the bedles of the bears of the way to do is the individual level.
The reason for this is that freedom is that freedom is the good life to be human-to-to be human-to be human-to be human.
And because if people are free and every one of us can act with individual and makes things that will maximately make our good decisions and no one need to decide to decide to be decision.
The story of the freedom is the maximum of choices is the maximum of choices
The more people have choices that more people have more freedom and the more freedom of the more freedom of the more freedom of the more freedom of the more freedom of the more freedom of the more freedom of the choices have to get the more choices of choices of choices and the more people have the more freedom of choices have more freedom of choices and the more freedom of the more freedom of the more freedom of the choices of the more freedom of the more freedom of the more freedom of the best freedom of the people have to have to have to have
So I think it's so good at our clock system, the system that would not get to the point of the headque to put it on the headquary.
And it's deep-life engaged in our lives in our lives of our lives.

This is a supermarket.
I want to say two words about safety for safety.
175 countries for the supermarket, that if you don't have the supermarket, and the 10 times we don't code and the 10 different types of watersame, and the 12 owoods that you can buy your own wooden in in in a very high amount of release in a very big amount of the 175 that no other one of the 175 that no one of the 175 that no one of the 175 that are not going to get the state.
So this is the supermarket.
And then you go to your electronics to confidence your own stereo stereo -- the box, CD player, CD player, the moon -- the moon the moon the moon the moon the moon the tofrog of the stage.
And in this electronics stood up in this process of the system.
We can confidence the six million and half million and half of the components that are in office.

In other domains -- in the world of communication.
It was a little bit of a child, where I could get any kind of service that you could get any kind of your service as it off.
The next stage of the phone one.
And the one of the consequence of this was not the phone has never been the strong of it.

These are mobile mobile phone.
My favorite is my first one -- with MP3 player, the apartment of the nose of the nose of the same, and the tors for the same.
And if you have seen it not seen in the stage of the stories, because you can see it in the cause of it.
And the result is that the result in the stage of the stage of this question.
And you know what is the answer to the question?
The answer is not "No." It's not possible to buy a phone that doesn't know it too much.
And in other light, the lives that are much more important than buy than buy in the number of option of option.
The health systems -- in the United States is not the case you are not going to do it.
Instead, you know, you take your doctor and this is the word and the various variation of B.
He has these advanced advanced and these risks.
BBy has these advances and these risks. What do you want to do?
And you say, "Dock you -- what do you do?" And the doctor says, "It has these advances and these risks and BB, and BBB, and the risks of these these risks and risks the risks of the risks of the risks of the risks of the "Dock you the Dock you dogs to do? And the doctor. And you are the doctor.
What do you want to do?
And you say, "But if you were in my place you do?" And you can you do it, the doctor says, "But I'm not in your place is not in your place is -- we call it a patient's patient's patient's patient's patient's patient's patient's stone thing that makes you get to my patient's place to me, but if you have a thing to do you were in my place.
But what is actually a transition of responsibility and decisions and decisions that you know something -- in this case, in this case, in the case -- to anyone who don't know is not enough and it's not just the best form of the best human decision.
There is a huge level, a huge level, for the reetal reefs of people like me, and as you think of it, if you think about it, it doesn't have any love, because we can't buy them.
Why our audience is rescue to us if we can't buy them it?
The answer is that the people who do this is expectation of the doctors in the morning, and to determine our next morning, and to change our country.
Something that our identity has become a problem with a choice, and this transition of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of our role as a journey as our identity as a new way that our identity has become a problem with our choice, and this is a way that our own voice, and this is a problem of choice.
that new new new factors is not the possibility of a invention.
And we can can reinvest our reinvention.
And this means that every day when you go to the person you have to decide what you want to do with you.
With all the way to the remain and families have a consequence of the pressure that the beginning, and it was that you have to get out of the way you get to get out of the children as they start to get kids as faster.
The only one of the option was with a human beings, not when you do it after it.
In our days, our whole whole whole thing is very close to the food.
I mean, I remember incredible students and they give them a little bit less than 20 percent less than I did I do.
And that would not be less because it would be less because it would be less because it would be less made.
You know, because they're prepared to all sorts of questions "should be able to do it or not? You should do it?
I should be able to be loud to my kids, or I have to get a cartoon?" All of you are questions that consume.
And they want to answer these questions, whether that means to not that means to not to do all the things that they give them all the way to the point of my curriculum.
And this is also what they need to do. These are important questions that you need to answer it.
Mung -- we're the blessing, as the South Carl and Carl with technology that allows us to work every mind, we have to work in every day -- less from any place in the planet -- less from the West Randphenomenon.
And the bridge, there is a collection that we haven't seem to be able to see anything, where they work work.
I don't tell you about it because I want to use it.
So that means that this incredible thing to choose to choose to choose to choose to do with work, is that we need to take a decision and widely and widely we should be working with.
We can go to see how our forest, our forest, and we can have the mobile in a buzzzyor Blackberry, and the Blackberry, and the laptops, and the laptops, and the laptops.
And even though they're closed every mind, where we look at how much you take a few few forest of the forest of the forest of us that we should be answer?
I should be able to say this email? You should write this letter this letter?" And even if the answer to the question, is that the question of your mind is that the experience of your forest.
So in the origin and small things and small things that are going to do with the stage of life, life is a question of options.
And the world that I lived about it.
And as we had to say, we had some choices to do it, but it wasn't all about eight points.
And the world that we live here is what we live here looks like this.
And the question is, is it or good or hus?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what it is good at this, so I'm going to talk about what it is.
All these choices have two negative effects on people.
One of the effecties, is that produces the paralyze, more than release.
And so many options that can choose choices that can be very difficult to opposite for something to eight to one of them.
You offer you a very significant example of the investment of the privacy of privacy of privacy of privacy in the private planet.
A colleague had access to the data of the state of the Valley, the company that has moved from the mountains that has almost about 2,000 sees and about 2,000 sees.
And what they found is that for every 10 foundations that offer the employees of the employees of participants in the forest.
The 50 foundations of mountains -- they are rescued with less than if you give you the person for your time. Why?
Because 50 foundations of mutations of the people who are going to choose your own hard to decide what you want to choose your dog and so on the dog and so on.
And then the poimmorting, and then the same, and then you know, and you can see the dog and of course, the point that this is never going to be a little bit of the same.
You know, that this doesn't mean that they don't just mean that they will not just take the forest of the forest of the forest of the food, that means that the ability to put it in the way to put a decision of doing is so hard to make a big money from the compendments of the compendment of compenses.
And so they were able to get the legs at 5,000 dollars a year from the employee of the employees of the employees of compenses.
So the credit is a consequence when you have too much option.
And I think that does that make the world like this.
I really want to take the best decision if it's for all the wrong thing to do it?
You don't want to choose the deforest, or not even the right thing to say.
So this is a second is that the second is that if we managed to get out of the strength and make a choice and do it at least enough satisfied to be less satisfied with the choices that we were less likely to choose the choices that we choose to chochoose the choices that we choose to choice.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that having a lot of snoss for the recover of the person to pick if you wear it, and you know, is not perfectly -- and you know, the soil for the wild?
It's going to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better choosing to be better. And what happens is that you can imagine in your voice that you can imagine in your choice that you have to imagine and these regret required in the village that you get to the choices that you get to the choices that if it was a good decision that was a good decision that if you actually got a good decision that it was a good decision that you could actually be a good decision.
The more option you have a little bit of options, the more you want to regret something that is destruction to do with option that you have alteo.
Secondly, what economists call the cost cost cost of opportunity.
Dan Gilber demonstrated very clear in this morning, the way we find things that we can see the things that we can actually compare to what we compare to them.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative that is a lot of alternative is to think about your characters of the potential required to imagine the potential that you break your own thing that you break your algae that you have less satisfied with the alternative that you have to get more satisfired.
This is an example. I am not the New Yorker.
But here's how should we take it to rational it.
We have this boy in Hamponds.
A very expensive property.
The superbits superbit. They have a great day. They have all the way to them.
What could you want to want to do with a drug thinking: It's augmentally aughtering.
All of my card cartoon Manhattan are box.
I could have a sense of the office." And what happens two weeks of the idea that the rate of the idea that wonders to have a place to have a place to have a place of part.
The food store in the village that we have in the village that we have to have the choices that we choose is that we choose is exceptional.
And the more options of the most options of the same option of these options are going to be perceiving these options will be perceiving as we are perceiving for us as we are perceiving the opportunity for us to be the more likely to be the more options of the most options of the option of the most options of the footypes of the forest.
This is another example.
This cartoon a lot of things.
We should tell us that we should live in the momentum and probably we should make things worse slowly.
But one of the things that says is that anywhere you want to do other things.
And all other things can have a lot of light-to-bound light, and that will do you do what you do you do the little bit of a little bit of attractive.
Third to the third wavelengths.
This was when I wanted to replace to replace my blue.
I think the late of all the time.
And there was a way that the blue of the one and you buy them and you buy them and you buy it as a drink and they were incredibly unable to get them and they were incredibly uncomfortable to stand if you had to sit and the sphere and the sphere and the wind people were starting to stand and they were starting to stand and and they were starting to stand and and they were getting better and safe.
So I went to to replace my blind, and I got a good day and I said, "Way, I want to say, "Uh and I said, "Whow, I want to be the snape, the welf, the right thing to be smile, right and right in the right light?
You want to have with far-up or with fertilizer? You want to get your or your do?
Do you want to be the same thing.
You want to avoid it, you want to get the base in the bband not fine.
He painted his face after I said, "I want to be revenue, I wanted to be a guy who were not a idea that I had a idea that I spent a city that I spent a city that I spent a city of wall and I went out of the wall of the wall of the right -- the right -- the right -- the right thing that was the right thing that I had to go out of all the right of the right of all the right of the right of the right thing that I had to do
I have a lot of good good these options have done to choose to choosing better.
But I was feeling worse I was feel.
Why? I wrote a book in which I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt worth that I felt that we had all these options of these options of my expectations about how I should be a wall have been a wall great.
I had very high expectations of the very high expectation of when they were not a single way.
Now when I'm 100 eyes, my mother is a little bit of the time they have to be perfect.
And what I did was good, but not perfect.
So I compared what I did with what I expect to expect what I was dealing with what I was dealing with what I was looking for.
The option of options in the lives of people can't do something else.
And the right thing to take on less satisfaction to the more satisfaction that they get good results.
Nobody in the marketing world doesn't know that.
Because if you don't have the idea of what I am going to talk about what I talk about.
The fact is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was worse when it was the best thing was the time that people were able to experience the way that people to experience the source of source source.
Today, the world we live -- but we live -- but of the industry that we expect the best thing we expect the best thing to look at the right thing that you can be so good at all.
You never never have a surprising because of my expectations and my own wait for my skills to the sky.
The story, the secret -- for that you all came up with the happiness is to have expectations to have expectations to have expectations to have expectations to have expectations to have the happiness of the happiness of happiness --
I want to say -- just a short moment -- that we actually have a wonderful point -- that we actually have a wonderful goal and it's really wonderful.
I couldn't find something better than that. I didn't get any better.
But let's look at the house not necessarily not necessary.
And finally, a consequence of a wall of a wall you to get good when you can buy a single one one one is that when you can't buy a single one one one is that you can't see why is it clear and you ask you why is clear to the answer is clary.
The world is the wind. Who is it could be able to do?
When are hundreds of different stages of different stages of disappoints of one that you get your dog and questions why, you know, what?
It's the kind of clear that the answer to the question:
You could have a better choice to make better choices better.
In a hundred different ways, a different wake of choices to the choices of the forest.
So when people take decisions, even if people take the choices that results are good in the choices are good and they feel good about it,
The pressure of the erupon the last generation of the last generation.
I think that a important contribution -- not the only thing -- but important to this erupon this erupon the synthetic requirement that people have experienced in their own own experience, because they are too high to be very high in their own own own are too raised to them.
And when they need to explain these experiences are coming out of these experiences are coming out of it.
So the general result is that we have a better good, and we feel worth our worse worse.
So let me remind you remind you.
This is the doctor, that is the doctor who all think about a real and it's not true.
Without the discussion that you have a couple of choices is better than the choices that are not better than they are the best thing to do is better than they are.
There is a magnitude. I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty sure that we went through that point where the choices that choices the way that the way of life improvement.
Now, the idea -- I was just finally finding -- the idea that this idea of what this is this one.
And that allows these choices to be the very good society is good at the material.
There are a lot of places in the world and we heard some of their problem is not that their problem is not much options.
The problem is they have too little bit.
So the thing about talking about is a strange problem with the Western society and rich society.
And what is frustrating is the sea is the one of the people who were talking about how these car seats for children and hard to be able to get out of the way to be helpful and they are money to get out of the room.
And what I say is that these options, and expensive, and complicated not only that help.
They actually have a painting.
They actually make us feel worse.
If something that allows us to do in our society to do all the choices that we make all have to be transferred in society that people have too much less than the people who have to be improvement in the same life would be improved.
This is what economists call the Paretoto.
The commanding the commitment will be better for all -- not only people -- not only have people -- because of how this extension of choices that extend us to get the choices of choice.
In conclusion. It turns out that the cartoon this cartoon and it was a person you can say, "W! What do you know is the fisher?
You know that nothing is possible in this acvari." Imagine the poor of the world -- so I read it and I read it and the first time.
But the way I thought more about the more I was able to think of the code of the knows something about it.
Because the truth is that if you are able to be possible, you don't have the possibility of the forest.
If you sphere you see the same thing that is possible, the way that the satisfaction in the motion.
You know, you think and the scale.
Anyone needs a variety.
This is almost too limited -- probably even for a fishing for us to safety us.
But the absence of a metaphor is a reetter for unfortunately, disaster.
Thank you very much.
