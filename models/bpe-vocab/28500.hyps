And I was just shown these two diamone; we were able to show that the polar polar that was the city of the last three million years was the size of the big sea of marine marine in the marine rate with 40 percent of the marine percent of the year.
But this morning, the serious issue because it doesn't look at the black hole.
The police is a police that the climate system, which the global system of system.
She is extended to the bottom and the flow.
The next thing I will show you the life that will be a very quickly ably above in the last 25 years.
The peak of the peak is the marcaught with the rose.
As you can see the blue of blue fear of the blue of the blue of the inchis.
This is the guy, the anuary for the near of the same.
And it's in the morning.
Asave the great guy, with a thousand and and years of a loud, you can see that it's almost like the birds of the body.
In 25 years of getting from this to this one.
This is a problem because the problem is the quote of the dead of the ocean.
where it's been a massive amount of carbon inghethetches that when they did, it's transformed in metan catch.
Comparing the pollution of the global pollution of global warming the amount of global warming could take this point of extreme point in the extreme point of the extreme point of the extreme point of the pollution of the pollution of the pollution of the pollution of the pollution of the pollution of the world in the way of the world in the world
Of course, a little bit of the Alasanka is in the Environmental illness is southern of the water.
The Katey Walter Walter Walter was on the University in Alaska little law to another teach in the past.
Oh.
And a reason is that I have a huge "wor" is the Grooms of the north.
This is a race that everywhere.
But volumes are much larger than ever before.
This is the Kangerlussuade Ground Ground Grooms.
If you want to know how the creative they are the sea level of the topier on the sea is where it gets to a big place.
These debate are growing very quickly.
And at the other end of the planet, Antarctica largest main the planet.
The Lone of the scientists have reported as the continent that the continent of the continent is negative of Antarctica, and the Western Antarctica is submarine remarkable of island in the rapidly of the islands.
This is the equal equipment in the street in the Genland.
In Himaya, the main the same way that marimes, the bottom of the new forms of the new forms of the new forms were guarantee of the world.
40 percent of the population of the world's population of the world watches of the water in these topirs.
In the day, this guilty is the source of the poor for this city of this one.
Of course, they raised up.
But when it gets to the water and the water water water water water and the water water water
In California was a 40 percent of the fear in Sierrra.
This is the water affection of water.
And predictions about it, as you read read and they're serious.
And on the whole global global warming of the dramatic creative creature.
And the disasters of the world has been grew up with a great great rate and fall.
four times more of the last 30 years, the 75 years of the 75 years of the 75 years.
This is a completely unusual model.
If you look at the history of you can see what happens.
In the last five years we added up to the past 70 dioxide every 24 million tons in every day in every day in the ocean.
Up to America's attack to to the rest of the American Pacific, and every part of the subject of the individual subcontinent of the ocean, where it's a radical report of the ocean.
The biggest because the global warming global warming global deep deep in the repression of the fossil fuels.
Petric is a problem and the goal is the most serious good.
The United States is one of the two big emerging of China.
And the proposition was to build a lot of factories.
But we start to see a whole change change.
Here are the people who have been aside in the last few years with proposition.
But yet, there is a police in your own political to us.
And the carbon industry and the oil, the oil and the oil spills of billions of dollars in the last year quenitic.
The good characters of what is a ranger.
This image of something that is a mind.
In the Cracial League in Tenness, a billions of the bookster was impairs.
You probably see it at the stars.
This is all the clean, the second big deals in America has happened in America in the preparing of the Crace.
One of the great reclams, about the cartoons, about the Cracya was this.
Video: ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫
He is from abundance, here in America, and help to help the economy.
Frostomy, the guns, it's going to get the day of the wherever it gets more and more curate.
He is also adorable and workers are reaching the south.
Al Gore: This is the cold of Virginia Western Virginia West.
The most of the great career on the largest character is the big board.
Video: Don Blankenz: I want to be clear to be clear to be the Pelosi, Harry Reihabar didn't know what it is.
Al Gore: so that Aliquid for Protection Climate Climate Climate has layer.
This is one of them in one of them in one of them.
Video: The book is the climate change in the climate climate change as a very serious threat of our business as well.
And that is our main is to spend a lot of money for the public forces that we can actually get into the public force of the good book.
The real thing is that, in fact, the cars is not did.
We think it's a curriculum -- and I have a lot of good.
So you won't get to the climate change for the climate change for change.
You have this in our way.
Video: The good news: You know, you heard a map about it.
So let's do a tube to do a tube of this kind of crash of the cartoons.
Wat! Masita. Masia is about noise.
But this is the sound of technology that cool.
And while the cartoons are the magic of the main of global warming technology of remarkable global technology to cover the technology of the goal that you can see the whole thing.
Look at the same time, this is the technology of the goal.
Al Gore: In the alternative advantage of the positive economic challenges and with nation-challenges.
Video: Narrator: America is in the crosis, economy, economists, the crisis.
The rate that lead to all the dependence on the bottom of the carbon of carbon carbon on the basis of carbon:
But now we have a new solution to the new solution to the wrap in to the cat.
You probably have America with the power of 100 percent of the power of 100 years ago.
A plan to put America to get to the third of the goal and to help us to stop the cross of global warming.
In the end, a solution that is to help us solve our problems.
You probably America. You have America.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: Narrator: It's about re-energy-powered the report of America.
One of the fastest ways of the fastest manage of old old old old old lesson of our old didnapped disorders that we have didn't, the Like is here.

Narrator: Ruel America. It's time for actire.
Al Gore: The Gorement of African old African hour of you want to go down the bottom of the water,
If you want to get back back to the hit you go to the husbyard.
We need to get back back back and forth.
Thank you very much.
And the year at TED I did a introduction to LHC.
And we were promised to give a data about how the device about how this works.
So here's the beginning, for the people who didn't have been here, LHC is the largest experiments that was certainly intired by 27 kilometers or is to recreate the concent or is to create the consistent of a billion a fraction of a billion a billions of a billion second.
It's extremely quote.
This is the device under the Geneva.
We are photographs of these minds of "Big Bang" in the decades.
I work on this one. It is called ATLATLAS -- Lnowden Tameter -- 22 meters of ATLATLS here is a construction of ATLATLALS building.
And the 10 of the year I went to the first time.
And this image was a ATLAS.
It caused a huge celebrity in the control of the control.
It's a picture of the first cross of particles that quote over the third of the LHC, cross of LHC in LHC deliberate in LHC deliberate in the LHC and particles.
In other words, when I saw that image of the 10 pbringing that the device is a huge successful of functioning as a huge success.
I don't know if this was the largest own, or that, when somebody went to Google and Google went on on the first page.
It means that I did a cultural impact on the street of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the ending.
And after a bit of a smoke, I had a problem with the machine, which actually had these days.
Those are transporting 13 thousand ampers of the massive power function to the maximum of power to the maximum of power power.
Now, engineers from the wall of these days, and I said, "I'm not transport." They are being. They're bed."
But I can do this because when they're at the temperature of scaling temperate that is called the superconductive fire to be a superconductive bees.
So in the 271 degrees of the cold, and the hospital of the switches can transport that they can transport the box.
At one of the laws of the layers of the '90,000 of the market.
So the company was inquote and the 13 thousand ampers have innate the electricity of electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impression, that magnetic account of the magnetic accounting, and they move about 30 seconds.
So I have a deteriorate about 50 magnetic maked.
We had to do the door, which we have.
I was convicted to the everybody, I repair
And now we go back and then in the subterms.
The end of his website at the end of the LHC camera.
We're going to start to start with us and applies, and we can keep the data in the husband we will continue to find out the universe.
Now, of course, the kind of a way, those accidents of the discussion of the important scientists and engineering and engineering to the extreme to be rejected.
I think that it is that it is so much more difficult to figure out how we have young young inalso, this is the important thing to the experiments like LHC.
So I'm going to leave the human science of a man scientist, Humphilanic, Humphrey Davy, I think that I think of the experiments of the protection of the protection of the desire to say, "Nimico is not the dangerous progress for our minds of human minds are not that our human beings are not the concrete of the human being."
Thank you.
I want to start with the kidney of childhood, when you play with the board.
And on the main the first invade and get them to the rub-code and they actually learn how to get them and give them the shared issues of intelligent and manipulating relationships.
The vision of the hospital is profound a lot of the world that we understand a lot of the world in the world of the world in the world of the world in the world of the world is debate in the world of the spatial correctness,
So, in the way of the IT who inspired the IT inspired by this kind of physical interactions with the physical objects, and my physical objects, and my collaborator and my collaborator -- I would start to get into my own -- I was starting to use a computer -- I would be able to use a computer to be when we use a computer to get a computer that we can be a whole digital trouble with a mass that we could be a lot of information that we would have to have a lot of information and put these treat the next to be a lot of the mass to be a digital maymile to treat the data to each other informed a computer to treatment of the maymale and then we have a computer to treat this untauplus to be a maymile demand then use of maststststepisown, and a computer and that is a computer
Stutudent?
And this is the question of the fascinating thing that we would hook the researcher I had the answer to Stable to do Stable Stttable to Sttable to this Sttable to do Sttttable to this was so much of the fascinating was so much of the fascinating was so much of the fascinating was so much of the fascinating we had to do the research to be so that we were going to be
And in the short of a Siftable is a computer interactive computer and the size of a biscy.
They can be manufacturing them, they can be perceived the proceeds of one other one of the other one and a screen and a radio wireless of the wireless of the wireless of the wireless of it.
The most important is that they're palpable. They can also like the game, you can just like it just like to get them as much applied them.
And Sifts office the examples of an ecosystem to be the digital instruments of digital manipulating information of the digital process.
And on the main the instruments become more palpably of their mission, their missions of other, and the consists of our nutritions of our nutritions and destructive new and destructive new people.
I'm going to start with simple.
This Stifting is configuring the video to present image, and if you include the movie the movie, it leaves the other part, they get into the other part, they get back back back.
These are the interactive interactive are the ones that are the other ones that are the other side.
So, if I put one of the other other people are getting interested.
If they're inconceived and that, they can be a little bit of confused in confidence.
They can also feel the mission and inclining.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of interactive interaction is that we can use the databases of the disorders, like we were to manipulate a liquid of a liquid liquid a liquid liquids.
In this case, we have three Siscamps, that you have to use them to kill them and they can use them to the center in the center of the center, where they want to be fun of the center.
If we can get too much, we can cover the door.
There are also interesting possible for education, like the more possible for education, mathematics and logical, mathematical games and logical things that we want to see the results that we are able to see the results in the outcome.
So here I -- this is a Saharan Fibonace, which are doing with a simple program.
Here we have a game game game game game of the words of Scrabs and Boggles,
And so that in each other of the first first of all, and the sun on every Siftable, and the main to forget to formed, they are grew with a dictionary.
And then you take a 30 seconds of the letters, and you have a new set of letters, and you can have a new set of letters.
Thank you.
These are the people who came to the Media, and I received the Media, and I returned them to try and turn them and filmed a material.
They like to die to crazy.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of applications is that you don't have to give a lot of instructions.
All I need to say is "From words, and they know exactly what to do.
Here are other people who are asking people to get out of them.
This is the most tangible testing the river in the right.
It turns out that everything wanted to do was to do was to do one of the other.
So for him were just bounded by the boundaries.
This is a animal application of animal animal animal animal kings.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who invent the language of the language that invasion.
And this is Felix.
He can introduce new characters in the scene, just raise the main of the main that they are the persons.
And that's where the wire is where the hared.
Video: The race.
David Merrill: Now he introduced a tractor in the scene.
Video: The portrait of the portrait
Very of the y!
When Swetable and asthy the slavery chcheck can make the characters -- Video: Wideake -- Video: Ham!
DM: It creates and your narrative.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a finished story with how it will be a very deeply of how it will be a debt.
Video: Hello.
DM: The last example I have time to show today is a tool, and interpretation of the music I was a lot of the people that we built the role of sounds, and the sound like the role and everywhere.
Each four different variations of those different variations, you're choose to you want to use it.
And you can get the sound of the sounds of a successful of the people you want.
The sound of the sound touches the sounds of sounds of successful sounds.
There are effects that we can control the lights, like the reverberal and the film.
You can see the sound of sound and then you include it to help him to help him to help it.
It's general effects like the general and volume that are applied of the buildings that are going to see it.
Video: DM: And I can then in the second Sify camp in the second Swe'd be a serious routinely expensive, we have a lot of dealing of the rhyok.
Now I now put a basic line.
Video: DM: I was a clear.
Video: And now I'm going to add the top, to the top, to control the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect.
Video: DM: You can get the password of the inclining and another part of a part of or else.
Video: I will now be going to get the movie for more expressive time.
Video: DM: You can resequencing while the amount of time.
So I don't have to do the planet, they can improvise, previous or short towards the methods of the word.
Now, in the end, I can avoid the split of the Siftwitzerland, in the switch.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is my passion of new interfaces that are better to the more they are the better way to our brain and our bodies.
And today, we had time to show a coordinate coordinate this new text of design, and how we try to get out of the labor that we tried to get from the layer.
The Ganda that wish is that we are at that we are at this new generators of interacting with the environmental interactions that will bring the digital rules in our world of rules.
Thank you very much.
This is the dead of nervous nerve to you all of you know.
I'm writing out.
He wrote the books is my teacher, but of course, more than that.
It's all my mother, and fascinating a list and fascinating a life.
And I don't expect that to ever change it.
But that's what it was safety was really unbelievable in my career and in my career that determined me to rerecently.
And the strange thing is that I wrote this recently that is that the theater of "Manana, Roage." And Iubest" -- which is a dealing of my ancient as a map of my world for a little bit of a little bit of a simple reason, and became this important sensory of of the international position, and became this very important, and this consensus that is this very important synthesis.
The result is that the rest is that people are going to go right now, people who are being convicted by the way,
Serio, the convicted -- I was confused to be a loa!
Vin fact in the jorgan and say, "You don't have the question -- don't you know, you can't you have any more dead than you can be able to do this?
You don't have the theory of you writing your life to create the time that you ever create a lot of cars that ever get the world that you ever have the world that ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever do?"
It's very linked to the truth.
But it was also more likely to remember if I didn't know that 20 years ago, when I started from people -- I started to marriage -- I want to be writing -- I want to be writing the same thing that I want to be written by the same thing on the same way that kind of African reaction on a kind of a kind of African answer to a kind of African answer to a kind of African answer to the same to a kind of African reaction on the same African reaction of the same rate as a rate as a rate African answer to
And people would say, "You don't have any theory as you had no longer success?"
I don't know that humility to reject your rejection will kill you do?
You don't have the framework in this field of life in this field, and nothing will be going to be in here and you can get a dream of dreams of the flu flamor-bored board bodied with the eye of the scream?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the short answer to all those questions is """"""Da."
Yeah, you get theater of all those things.
And he always finished me.
And you have a lot of other things that people are still not going to get to the macry.
As an example of the big algorithms that are cross.
But when it's about the work I was still thinking about the last thing I was in the last time I was "Why is it "Why?
Is it something rational?
It's the logic is to do it is that they feel like to do that they feel like they were destroying on this Pame.
And what is that the specific specific fic fic fic fic fic matters that is really true of the health of a health care in a way that other teachers don't do it?
Tately, for example, was chemistry and I remember the chemistry and you don't remember that in the 40 years of the engineering of chemistry to be a chemist.
It didn't happen -- John, how does the block the chemical?
It's just not happening.
But we are accurate chemists, as group as many of them don't really quative in the reputation of the reputting manipulating manipulating manipulating the depression.
We are writing in the insa, and we don't only have this reputation, and not just writing all the kinds of things that are straight to be straight to be straight and unable to be strong.
And we all have to do is to look at the numbers, the number of dead dead in the 20th century, in the 20, in the 20, which they died by young people who died with their own man's own man.
And even those who didn't have the own thing that has been cross of their own own destruction.
Norman Mailer, even before I was in the last interview, he said, "Each of my bookers killed me a little bit more than I did a little bit more than I had,
A great great great news about the work of a life of a life of a life of a life.
But notice not the clients we hear that because we hear this because we heard these things that we heard of things that we have absorbed and we would have the confidence, the idea of the collective and suffering, the idea of the creative and as an infinite to the suffer to the suffer and like to throw it always a little bit of suffering.
And the question I want to do this is that I want to do you all of this is you all of this idea?
You are comfortable to do -- because as they see the library of the library of the library of this cat.
I think it's like it is odid.
And I also think it's dangerous and I don't want to see it in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage to the great artistic to the great artists.
And I know about my case, in my case, in my situation -- would be very dangerous for me to the store of this kind of a consequencing, particularly about the teaching of the circumstances.
As for example, I'm pretty tantana, we just have a 40 years.
We probably have more than four decades of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the workforce.
And it's very likely to be able to do this moment to be judged by the way, that the work that was the time of my last career that was the core of my footprint, right?
What would be to say to the mention of the people here we are the friends -- it's probably very larger -- it's probably very largely successful to be happened.
Oh, God, what gand!
This is the kind of the gas to get to the end of the day in the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I do to do this is that the message that message that I love
And then, then, then, the question of the question?
And so I am a lot of meditation, as you have to work now, to do now, to try to keep a kind of a building of my own manufacturing product in my own building blocks, right?
I had a way to find a way to step a safety of a safe, and my father who write, and my graduate from what will be before you were going to be before I write
And as we all went into this senior in this sense, we started to look at the time, and I tried to find other society to see if they could have better ideas and healthy and healthcare about how to be helping people to be helpful emotional risk of how to be a emotional risk of emotional risk of emotional risk of how to creative risk of how they are they going to make people creative.
And the research, this led to Greece, and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Rome.
So you can get the circle of the sketch is inchitable.
But in Grection and Roming Roming Angas people don't think that the creativity of the people who don't think that the creativity of the human being in the human being?
People thought that the creativity was a spirit was a spirit of people who are going to get people in a surgery and unintelligence, and united in the remarkable reason.
The GDDames were called the returns of the faithy of the terrorist "prove the terrorist of "Twent" --
Socracked was the fair to think has a demon which is a department of the department.
Romans were the same pared, but they were called the synthetic nervous create, genius.
What is great, because they were really crazy because they were actually saying a huge genius of the disappearing of the same.
They thought the work that a genius was a kind of magnitude in which the way of the artists, in a way that Dobby, a Dobby, the snapshot and obby, the snasses, and unable to see the workforce, the pattern, modeling the result of the workforce, the pattern.
Absoldied -- this is the distant is the distant that I talked -- that the conquanting of the workforce of the workforce of the workforce.
And all the world as they have the world work?
So the artist was protected by some of the things that are protected by the way, and so much narrative?
If you have the work was straluca, you couldn't get the whole world the worst of the world as you had this genius as a trouble genius that helped it.
If you work was criticized by your work, it wasn't completely the lead to you go?
Everybody has the strength as your gender was a bit ignorance.
So they watched people from the Vest creative for a long time.
And then Renasting and everything has changed, and everything was going to be a certain idea, the idea of the main the center of the universe on the center of the universe of all the mystery of the mystery of the mystery of the credit credit to the diving.
It was the human writing to create the inition, and people started to create the creative of the individual creative that the creative of the individual individuals.
And for the first time in history of people started talking to one or another one of the artist or the other artistic of the artist in the genius.
And I need to do what I think was made a huge error of a huge error of a huge error of it.
You can see the task, a simple person to create the receptor is actually the receptor, as it is actually the receptor and the mysterious and the mysterious psychology is a little bit too many of the living in the early ''0s, the early forward for the fragile psychology of the fragile psychic emotion.
It's like you have a cooking hit the hared.
It just incovered and decreates all these things that are equally invisible to each other of those asteding astetemples.
I think that the pressure of this kind of the artistic artistic in the last 500 years.
And if it's true, and I think it's the question is, what do we do with it?
Can we do things different?
You can go back to the sensor of the relationship of relationships of people and the mystery of the relationships.
It might not be it.
Maybe we can't just want to stand a hundred years of a rational, in a rational,
And you probably are there in public people in the audience that would raise the layer of the scientific questions that are actually going to get people present people to the present people and everywhere.
It probably not to cocooption to this idea.
But the question I want to put it is -- why don't we want to do it?
Why don't we think about that?
Because it has sensible sense of any other I heard of something else I've heard about the crossy of the creative process.
It also also also also also also also to create something -- basically all of the people here -- you know, the whole thing that doesn't always have the behavior.
And in fact, sometimes it can step out of the paranormal.
And I had a chance where I met in the American I met the American poet American poet Mr. Rutch Stone who was now in the '90s and that was the bridge of the country that was going to happen to be when she was a story to the wishing of Virginia was going to work on the camp, and I just heard a poet and I just heard a poet and he would hear a poetry and you just heard a poet a poetry and you hear a poet and you hear a poetry and he would hear and he had a poetry to work on the camera out of the camera out of the camera and he heard of the camera and
The story as a dream like a vast vast of the air.
And it's a lot of the roads.
The feeling the idea of the falleries are sicking under the legs.
At that point, it has a single thing that is face, and some of the bed, "Wait as a toil."
And the running to the housin to the mark of the stage of the map and the idea was to get a big bunch of map and a fast fast for when it went to the map and to get a lot of it.
Sometimes it was not enough enough to put and also, and running and running and running and running into the housin and the poor and the poor and the poor the poem and the poor the bridge of the room, and I read a poetry on the roof of of the bridge.
They were now in which -- and this is that I will never forget -- the moments that story of the story that the story of loss.
The other lead to home, and the map of the map and water, the credit card the credit card on the other hand, and the story of him with the other man's other's other's and through the other man's and through the other and through the other and through the other.
And he was just the code and he took the body and he took the main the main the main of the map of the math.
In this situation, the poems of the perfect map of the perfect and unexpected and the last time at the first word.
When I was hearing -- it's just the sured, it was just how my own creative process.
My design process, not the creative Professor -- they're not leak!
I'm a catching and the way they work to get every day and I would get to the same thing and trick, and I can travel and go out and go out and go out and go out and go out and forward to the same thing.
But even though I was like, in my own I was asking to me, and I was asking that phenomenon.
And I would imagine that kind of like you are and many of you are.
And I was a project or ideas that they were going to be a source that I don't know what it is.
And what do you present all this?
And how do we should report that we should report the minds of the mind, the same, the more we don't want to reach the sample of the sample of the sample of the same?
For me, the most relevant examples, which we have the other day that we can do is make the musician that I took a piece of the revia with the revivil of review.
I was talking about this subject and all of this was almost all the way to the modern artist contemporary of the contemporary of the Chinese artist to control and gestablishing these impulsations that are controlling completely integrated inside the creative and gain.
With the time and the time it was linked to a story as a day in the base in the street to Los Angeles and then everything has changed.
Whereas the lead, a short age of a short page that comes to mind, and magnetic field and magnetic and the magnetic and a little bit of inspiration and a little bit of the bed, it's not how to go and somehow to get the bed.
It has no retired, it's no creative reported in the room.
The fact that the other people are growing up in the end, "Pollor" and the song of the time.
I'm not good enough to reveal."
And instead of the panic in the shot of the back.
It was the same thing that he would do something with everything with a new new new new way.
He was raised to say, """You see that I'm not looking at the volan?"
"Are you there to write a track of a crump?
If you want to really exist, you know, we can actually get into a moment of you and in the right thing to do.
If you don't get to another today.
Go to Leonard Cohen."
The truth process has been changed the way of this.
It's not the operating to be the same way that always happened.
But the process of it, and the whole thing that was in the time of the time he took the same, and it was in the time he was in his wild's shoulder, and then they gave it to the way to come back and then where it didn't have to come back and Chinese and China.
It could be this collaboration and the bizarre, and the bizarre and the external talk, and the external ability that was not too much like Tomanic Toman Tom.
And after I heard the story I was starting to change a little bit of the way I was going to be a little bit of the time.
This approach me when I was at the middle of "Manca, Roage." And Iubestyle, Iubestyle, and I have in a kind of disappearance to all of the disappears to be a disaster and you can find out a disaster to be a disaster, that will ever be a bad thing that you ever would ever be a concept.
Not just the more profound that the most propositive.
I would have to think that I should just abandone.
And so I was talking about the opening hospital, and I tried to figure out and I certainly enough.
I got my head of manusis and I got to my comment and I got a colleagues a colleagues of camera.
I said, "Asculpture, and I would like that you and I can see that if this is not just going to be great to be the great thing to do is not just the good?
Because you can see that I can see the battery all the way to the bed, and more than that.
So if you want to be better than you want to be able to do the apartment and you can do the same thing.
OK. And if you don't do that, you know, you know, you all of it.
And one thing to write because this is my message.
And I want to consistent that I did this on my side.
Because -- the Conclusion is -- with hundreds of years after the North African people have to admit to the poor people who have to do the battery and music, and music music to the wrist.
And they were always wondering, because the dancing were teaching and they were remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be so wonderful and they were all awesome.
But sometimes the things that happen, and one of the things that are really going to really get from the community.
I'm sure you all know what I mean is about what I mean by the way, a certain moment,
It's like time is the time and the dancing is a kind of portal portal ports are not doing anything different than the other 1,000 serts,
And in a time seems to be in the third of the same way.
It's light and gone in and gone of the bottom of the forest of the forest of the forest of the forest of the forest of the world.
And then when they were trying to get what they know was called and they would say to it.
and even though they were the hands and they were to get the "Alllah, Alllah, Gamh, Gamh, Gamh, Gamh, Games, Games, Games, Gamame."
It's God.
A interesting interesting interesting historical historical historical -- when the main Spain in the Spain in and the pronounced in "Allaunched in "Allah, Allah, the wlah" in "Allah" in "older, wood, y,"
and they hear about the time of the winds and the flowers and the flowers.
In Spania, when a concept of something impossible and magic and magic and magic is a "Allah, magnificent Adves."
It's unintelligent -- a God of God's Goda.
It's wonderful because we need to need something like this.
But the side of the second day in the morning when the dancing is that the big thing is that the big thing is that the big scale.
It's a dirty that is and the genome, and that is the genome, and they could not be able to do not worse of it.
Would you like nobody to do the name of Dome, so what the name of the Domat the rest of the rest of the life?
It's hard.
It's one of the most pain of the most pain of creative activities.
But maybe it doesn't have a big chance of if you don't think about the beginning of the beginning, that the most extraordinary part, you know, the most extraordinary of your eyes.
You can just if you think about it was improud of a source of a crimination of the life of the earthquake of life from the next to the next thing is to be a different task.
If we think about it is what it is going to change it.
I started thinking about and I was thinking about the last few months of the last months of the last few months of the book, a split of an astonishing and crisis of my strange success.
And what we do is, what you lose when you lose the cloud of the bed, you don't be theater.
It doesn't be saved the job. It just like the Continy Continy the Continy of the Contintiny of it.
If you get dancing your dance.
If the gene of the divity of the disorder that you are repartied to the great arm, and even for a missing with a missing with the forces of the forces of the forces of the forces of the forces of the disorders and the word to the force of the disorders and the center of the disorder.
And if no, they don't dose any way.
And with all of you say, "You're a lot of you.
I think in these things and I think we should prefer them.
OK.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We talked about some of these projectome, and what would be the human genome, and what could be the present of new genes.
Now we start to start new point: we have been digital technology, and now we try to start to start to start to start to start in this digital code and try to get into a new phone-new for-the-life forming force and dying and dying forward to life.
We tried to do all the time to ask our important questions.
"What is life?" It's something that I think many biologists tried to understand the variety of variety of variety of variety of levels.
We tried different approaches, simple approaching the lives of the basic components of the basic components.
We are already about 20 years.
When I sequenced the human genome of the man walked from the world of the analogical technology in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world.
Now we're trying to regenerate it: Can we regenerate new forces of life, or we can create new forces in this digital universe of this digital universe of the digital university of this digital universe of the digital university of this?
This is the map of a little bit of a little genitalive genitalive, which has the most of the species that can replant in the laboratory of the layer.
We tried to see if we tried to come with a genome and smaller genome and smaller people.
We managed to get to the order, a hundred genes of the city that are there.
But when we look at the metabolic map of metabolic map in our compared to our compared to us.
Two me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can get the first time it is probably a little bit of a life that is probably a little bit of life that a life cell.
So we decided that the only way we decided to do this is that the crosis, we can see this crosis, so that we can get some of the most most of the world's worst questions.
And so I started to start the catchromosomes a cross cross of a cross of a cross of the cross?"
Can you chemistry allows these molecules that we never had a lot of the molecules that we never ever haven't ever done before?
And if we can yeah, if we can a cross of a cross of it?
A crosis, by the poor, by the way, it's just a lot of chemical.
So, our speed speeds up to a life of an exponential ritation.
Our ability to describe the genetic code, but it was very beginning, but it was growing up.
The last time he was at a exponential curve exponential curve.
I started this on a 15 years ago.
I went through a few days of the bottom of the bio-etal examination in the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis that the DNA is very difficult to do.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that make small DNA little bit of DNA, but it's a 30-letter, but it's a general process, so it's a lot of longer, so much longer.
So we had to create a new way to put these little little little pieces together and the right of the errors.
This was the first tentative of the information of the digital information of the duty of Ph.D.
It's a virus that kills a little bit of the human being.
We did the gorgeous design of errors, and we got a molecule of the DNA molecule of DNA DNA in 5,000 letters.
The interesting thing that I took this piece of chemical materials, and I put it in bacteria, and I put it in bacteria, and the bacteria began to read this genetic code, and to produces the virus and to produces of the virus.
The viruses were to be then released from the cells and they released the E.
I was talking to the oil oil industry and they would say, "We understand that this model.
They have laughed more than you are.
And so we think this is a situation where the software can build their own mad's own system.
But we wanted to do something larger
We wanted to build the entire cross of a bacteria.
This is about 580,000 letter of the genetic code,
So we said, we were to put the chance of the size of the virus to the virus to can actually understand the size of the size of the remarkable that are the components of a cellular cells.
And the design is critically, and if you start with the digital information in the computer information, that information has to be very presented to be very presented by the way,
When I sequenced this genome in 1995, the standard of the precision was a choice to a 10,000 payments of the walls of the walls of the walls of the walls of the first steps of the first century of this genome in 1995, the first genome in 1995, the standing genome in 1995, the standing of the first time in 1995, the standard in 1995, the standard was a lot of
I found it in the reference, 30 to report the inition, if we were used to be the original sequence, that couldn't be activated.
The design is from design to design is a lot of letters, which has to be a lot of the other pieces that have to build 50 letters to build 50 letters to build the sub-skills to build some of the very small things that are to compatible some of the television that piece with each other.
We are unable to do unusual elements of things.
You can read that I read "mark" in the hous." Groud. We have a genetic code, we have a genetic code in four letter: The T.
Trike out of those letters, those letters of the coffee of about 20 remember a single text -- a single letter account each of the acid.
So we can use the code of the genetic to write, the proposition,
And the reason we did was to hear the code of the code.
Some of them were disappointed that it's not poetry.
We designed those pieces so that we can see them was with enzyme.
I'm asking them that they are all and they are something.
So we started to do the guns, starting with five to 7,000 to 7,000 lets them to do these to get through the 24,000 lets the water and then put it in the other ways, and then you put it up to 72,000.
Every day we have to do these little bat to abundant them to have sequences to sequence, and we try to create a extremely rich processing in the mind, as you can see in a minute.
We try to get to that point the automatizy.
So, this is what a basket.
When we get to the big pieces, over 100,000 wallons of the walls are not going to grow up E.
It is all the modern molecular molecular biology molecular biology.
So we went to other hand.
We knew that there is a mechanism called the recombination of the biology that biology is using DNA to reach the DNA and that is also a lot of joint.
This is a example.
There's a organism called Deinocockroaches that can be the cavel millions of radiation that can be the radiation.
As you can see in the cross of his diet, the cross is is destroyed.
Two to 24 hours later, he took the other leaves of the other way that was starting to start the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be often often often all of the habits of it.
They can live in the life.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the space of extraterrestrial space, to move a new environment to get a new environment.
In fact, NASA was shown there.
This is a micrographic micrographs that we build these procaves, using using just -- in fact, using the advances of the design of the market, which we put the market.
Drodian automatically put together together
This is not a picture of the microscope, but just a micro-graphic found.
It's so a big molecule that we can see a microscopcope.
These are images collected over a second, of about six seconds.
This is a publish that we had a little bit of time.
These are over 580,000 letters of the genetic code,
It's the largest molecule made of people, with a definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely the largest structure.
It has a molecular molecular molecular ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar system.
If we take a look at 10 and no space of the space, 142 pages to acquire this genetic code,
So, how do we start a cross cross of it?
Evil with a virus is pretty easy to do.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
And also, more easier when you get to eucracy, you can just take the nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear -- and that's something you heard -- and that's something you heard -- cloning -- cloning the -- cloning of the bed.
With the chain, the cross of the cross is has been integrated by the cell, but we showed that we can make a very transplant to a crosis, from one crosis, and we can activate it.
We got a crossed of a microbial species.
And this is the same way as people and the same.
We added a few genes in the plus to this crosis.
I had a dealing with all proteins.
And it was pretty amazing when I put in the cell -- you will apply the sophisticated grafts -- and cross the chosen into the cell.
In fact, we thought this is how far it can go, but we tried to design the processing process.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are all sorts of species that have been able to do a second crosis, or a third of the tree, or a third of the treatment of the specific fic fic characteristic characteristic characteristic
So the people who think about evolution just as a single gene of change in biology.
I'm sorry, called the restrictions of restrictions that were actually dealing the DNA in DNA.
Cromosome that was in the cell that was in the cell not a lot of it.
The thing -- the cross we put --
It was exposed and recognized the other cross of the giant material, and so we were just by the cross of the cross of the cross of the new cross of the new cross of the new cross of the new cross of the cross of and graduated and recognized the other cross of the crossing of the cross of the cross of the crosomology of the cross of
It became blue, because of genes that we put in crosis.
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristics of a species have lost in a new species have lost in a new species on the software that we put in the cell software that we put in the cell.
All the proteins were shifted by -- when we found, the genetic code, it's exactly what we transferated the genetic code, is exactly what we transfer.
This can sound like alchemistry as alcis, but we can move the DNA and change the same thing.
Now, we would support that this is not genessed, but half of the three billion years and a half of evolutionary evolutionary of the TV to create a new version of the Cambridge Cambridge Cambridge Cambridge of the magic of the magic of the magic of maintenance on the digital project.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obvious about it from the point of use.
We're on the way to go from six to six to nine billion people over 40 years.
To put this in context for me to me, I was born in 1946.
There are now three people on the planet, for each of us there that have been in 1946, they will be four.
We have a hind, we have to remove the potons of potttable, comfortable to the treatment of six billion and a half of the six billion and a half and a half of the forest.
It will be difficult to do for us.
We use over five billion tons of books, more than 30 billion barriers of oil bars.
This is a hundred million barriers in the day.
When we try to think about procing biology or any process that will replace to do that, it will be a huge challenge.
And then of course, it's all the CO2 from this material, which is that it gets in the atmosphere.
Now, from our discoveries of our world, we have a basic data, and I like to think about these kinds of genes, and I like to think about the components of the future.
The electronic electronics has just a dug of a bunch of components that has been in this wave of the components that came out of it.
We are limited here, in the first biological reality and our imagination.
We now have the techniques, and we have these kinds of things that we call what we call the genuine gendering gender.
We have the ability to build a big robot that make a big robot that make a day.
When you think about to process these 20 million genes of these 20 million genes or try to make the opportunity to produce the chance of the pharmaceutical products, or products and new vaccines, we can change with a small team of molecular than the number of technology, to do more biology than the rest of the science.
And that's just the standard.
We can select to viable viable for chemical substantial or of the fuel or production production of vaccines,
This is a design design design design that we work in design that we are working on and work to wait to these species in the computers.
You know, we don't know how it will show you.
We know exactly how the code the code of the genetic code,
We now focus on the combat to four-generation.
You see the people of the people in the ethanol is just a big experiment that was just a consistent.
We have the second to be the second and the third generation that will come out of the very soon as soon as the aircrafts as much larger than the opportunity or different kinds of fanol.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without the cost of food and the cost of food and the cost of their food and the way of the CO2 as the maternal cells to design the system of the goal to design to this go, and we are going to have the next two months.
Loto the solar and CO2 is a methods -- but in our discovery of the world around the world have all kinds of ways of the world have all kinds of ways of the world have all kinds of ways of the solar and CO2 and the S2 and CO2 and CO2 is a solar and CO2 is a and CO2 is a and the CO2 is a minutes -- but in our world is in the world around the world we have all the world.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It gets into the deep ocean, about two kilometers and half a half of the deep temperature,
Transform CO2 in metan use of hydrogen molecular as a surveillance of energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 captured, which can be able to transport that we can be able to get that CO2 back to the base in the bustble fuel leaves to the provide.
So in a short period of time, we think that we could have the basis of the basis that the basic questions "What is life?"
We really know -- we have the patterns of the same chemical industry of oil industry.
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where another park in the TED, where another park of this?
Let me get a major source of energy.
But also, we are now to use these same same source to invention in the vaccine that is immediately.
You see this year with the bottom of the bottom and a dollar in the minus when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think that situation can be built by building vaccines that are going to be built any of the time of the before.
And here's how it could be watching the future is now going to look at the evolution of evolution with bacteria, accelerating evolution with bacteria, and finally, initially, and finally, finally, infinally, and finally, finally, finally, and finally, finally in the world.
We're just to improve people.
Our bank is just to make sure that we have a lot of time to survive pretty much long, so much.
What I want to show you first, it's very quickly, a new technology, a new technology that I added up to Microsoft as part of a year, this is a year. This is a year. This is a year. This is the load.
It's a average that can interact with a lot of visual data that visual database.
We are looking at a lot of digital pictures and magnetic pictures and marriage of the digital and fear through this rescuing in this report.
It doesn't matter how much information is the meaning of the big information are these colors or how big they are the images.
Most of the people are pictures of the user camp, but that's this one of the Bible Middle is a Congress, the ort of 300 megapixels.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that should limit the performance of a system of your monitoring systems of your monitors, it's also a very flow.
This is a bunch of non-imaginative analysis of a non-imaginative example.
It's about "the letter of Charles Dickens. Every colored is a colored capita is a chapter is a capita is a chapter.
To show you that it's about text, and not a imagine, and not a imagine, we can do something that is a real represent of a text; it's not a positive text; it's not a position of a textbook.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read a book in form of electronic book.
I wouldn't give you a recommend.
This is a real case of "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian
Each image is the beginning of a second.
This is really a piece of plant experiences of a plant experience, the park of a revil or a revil of a revia or a multi-dimensional environment.
We also did something small with a little bit of this number of this number of "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian of the Gardian of the Gardian and we did something small and we did something small and we did something small small and we did something small small small small little bit of the little little little little bit of this number of the number of the "Gardiandee"
We created a false reclaim to solve very much larger -- much larger than any claming -- and we got a very large contains of a contains of it.
If you want to see the properties of this machine, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the techniques.
And this is actually by the idea, the leading of the limits of a monitor.
We hope that this is to be significant pop-based phase and other kinds of like this -- which are not necessary.
Of course, the mapping is one of the applications for a kind of like this.
I'm not going to be a lot of time on this one.
These are all the roads of the United States of the United States of the United States of NASA.
Let's move to a different different things like this.
This is actually active on the Internet, you can see the great.
This is a Photosynt, which is the two different technologies.
and Rick Szelisiscki at Cert.
So this is active on the Internet.
You can see that when we create these kinds of perspective, when we can navigate through images we can have this kind of experience.
But the space of space of these images of these images that really really really really really true.
Algerian visual visual alience have recorded these images, so that to code the real place where these pictures -- all of the Grases of Grases in State Canadians and the Canadians of Canadians here are -- they were achieved.
I'm not sure if I could show you other media.
There are some of the space that have much more space of the other space.
I want to go to the original of Noah -- this is the original part of the original prototype of Pdeciosype that I worked in the vast -- to show you what I think is the piged Posyna. It's not just a bit of vision, and it's not just a obvious project-based projects, not just visions that we put on the web.
We had to worry about the layer aspects of the things that they are.
This is a Cateur Cateur Catel Damis a college of Flickr. GDamr. GDamis Damis Slickro and you find something like a camera in the trouble, from the trouble, and every one of these conported is a picture that was found that the cooks of this pattern is that the coded of this pattern of this model.
These are pictures on Flickr, and all of the space of space, and all of the space.
We can just to navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I would get to work at Microsoft is very great to Microsoft is very much a part of a first here.
I don't have to say that I'm a lot of the camera, all the rate of the cameras in the professional games, even a very big numbers.
If you can see it more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more dat
There are so many mass of feeds, and so on.
Where is this is a series of photograph.
This is a Sea ADamer who was recorded the right record.
You can get to a lot of the physical medium to this environment of this environment.
The idea is that I can do some things with the social environment. This means to collection all the world -- from all the world -- from a collective memory of what the Earth visual -- and to interconnect the Earth have been connected to them all those pictures were connected to the larger of the whole whole whole whole bunch of parts.
You have a model of what the entire Earth is the entire Earth.
Think about that as a long as the next month of Stephen Lawler "Earth Virture."
And this creation is how the world the use of as the world as much as the benefits of benefits.
The design is the pictures of meters that other's meeting with the same thing.
If somebody would ethiches and say, who would say, who are the picture of the Nowl Deng Deng Deng Denk, and I could use it to use it as a traveling to the social interaction to the whole social interaction with that space, to realize that a kind of social experience.
And of course, a second product and the rich of these are the huge models and the virtual models of the Earth, the interesting of the Earth -- collectors of the Earth and images of the village and images of the village and images of the village.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood correctly, what will allow your software to do is that a moment in the next few years, is that all the pictures of somebody who is that all shared by somebody from the globe to be interrelated?
ARA: Yeah. What does is really do is to be able to good.
It creates hyper-connected to the image.
And it does this set up on the containment of the images.
And this is going to be reading the significant information that they have those images that have those images.
As you do a lot of image, you know, you look at the Internet, and you can drive after a lot of the Internet gives you a lot of information that is the picture.
Now, what if that picture does the connection to all the pictures of all the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of it?
And so the amount of connectivity and the boxes that we have the disease that is where the classroom is where the classroom.
CA: Blaws, it's really incredible. Felics.
ABAA: Thank you very much.
One of the traveling trips and one of the traveling of the crash is is to live in the old old man, which they don't look at the old board, who don't feel the last selling of the bank slaws, they still feel in their leaves of plot, they are the leaving roof of plants.
You don't know that the Jaguary Jaguary luser and that the Lacthered the lessons of the old lady of the people who are still resonate or that in Himalaia is to have a revealing of Dhard, is to reminded the world that we live in a revelation that we live in a sense that the world that we live in a sense that we live in a sense of the real sense, but this is a real model of the reality.
The consequences of a certain set of choices that our struggle that our struggle with a lot of generations in the next generations.
And of course, we all share the same kind of adapties.
We are all born. We all bring kids to the world.
We are going to get through the inition.
We need to do the separation of the death of the morning, so we should not surprising that all the songs, we all have to have art.
But what is interesting is the great dealing of songs, the dance of the dance.
While is that it's tribes from Borned, or the woo, or the walls, or the war or war or war or war from the northern Kenya, or a Currab in the northern of Andern And, or a carried from the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the Sahahai.
By the way, this is the kind of traveling now a month or even a month, or even a long reporter of the Quesearlier of the mammoth of the world of the world today.
All of these people are learning that there are other ways to fly other ways of thinking, other ways to think of the origin the Earth.
And this is what you think you can think of hope, maybe not to get to the hope of hope.
Now, the miridors of the world with the world of the spirit of spiriting and cultural life that cover the planet, and it's as important for the human health care as the biological remote of life, known as the biological resident.
And you might think about this network as being the whole life as the ethnose, and you can definitely deeply the sign of the myths, intuition, the intuitial human imagination from the human imagination of the conscience.
Etnosphere of human being.
It's the symbolt of what we can and everything we can be as a surprising specific specific species.
And as the biosphere was the heroe, and so the nosphere -- and maybe a lot larger scale.
For example, no matter how we don't really near to suggest that half of all the species, or more of all the species, because it is not true, and yet, because it is not true, and yet, and yet, and yet, and yet, the most optimal time, it turns out that we know the scenario -- it's about the most optimistic in the field of the cultural cultural diversity.
And the largest indicator of this is designing is the emergence.
When you were born you with you, the people in this room, there were 6,000 languages speaking on the planet.
Now, a language is not just a voice or a set of layyyer rules.
A language is a language of the human spirit of human spiriting.
It's the vehicles that the soul of the trees of particles are going to get into the materials.
Each language is a old languages, a lot of mind, a debt, a correctly, a clever ecosystem to be spirituals.
And of those 6,000 languages, like we are now here in Montered, a half of them are not the treatments of the children.
I'm not a baby is not about babies that means that they don't change something that they are already going to be a language of move.
What can the only one of the only ones that are to be the last link of your own way to talk to your language that you will not have the language of your own death to presence the choice or to anticipate the treatments or to ancient the kidness?
And yet, that hurt is something that is really unknown to the Earth somewhere in the Earth is about each two weeks because every two weeks, a old old old old lady and he leaves the last bank of the old languages.
And I know that some of you would say, "You wouldn't be better.
It wouldn't be a better place if I all talk to a single language that I say, "Grozav, that was the language of being the And, or Canesthesis.
Or to Kogi."
And then you will discover how it would be able to be able to talk to your your language to talk to your language
So, what I want to do today with you is a kind of traveling -- a short journey through the dnosphere to try to give you a understood understanding of what they losing about what they lose to be losing.
Now, there are many of us that they can look at the different ways to being, I really understand how different they really understand how different they really understand how to fly different ways to fly out of the bees.
Let's take the example of this kid in the tribing of the northern Amazon the northern of anaconded, the mythological -- they were in the room, from the wind of the right-hand of the rights.
This is a popor that with the blue is not distinguish because the leader of the sky of the sky of the forest of the forests that people depend on the forest of the people who are dependent on the ground.

And finally, at the end of it, I think it's obviously the one of us that we had traveled in these kinds of planet, we understand that they are not very much dealing in the world.
They are the payments of people.
They are the huge amounts of human imagination that come from the early wars. And for all of the time of these children, as the dreams of the children, they become part of the hography of the hography of hopels.

And because if people are free and every one of us can act and make things that are going to make things that are going to be our good and no one need to decide in our own place.
The world of maximum is the freedom, is the maximum of choices.
The more people have choices of the choice, the more people have more freedom of the freedom, and the more freedom of the more freedom of the more wood.
So I think, that is so well that we are so well in our system that wouldn't be able to do anybody to get to the sun to the sun to the sun to the sun to the sun of the headline.
And it's deep deep in our lives.
I'll give you a few examples of what made for us to do is what it did for us for the last time.
This is a supermarket. It doesn't have a very big market.
I want to say two words about the snoses for save-belling jobs.
175 snoses for the supermarket, this is the supermarket, and the 10 different kinds of water-routinely different from the hopels and the 12 of balances that you can buy the sample of the balance that you can buy a very large numbers for a very large numbers of the 175 that no one of the 175 that no one of the 175 that no village in the 175 to the first 175 that they don't have the village that you can buy the village the villages.
So it's so much at the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronic components to confy the electric components to confident -- CD system, the shape, the shape, transforming the shape, which is the shape.
And in this room room room of electronic components are a lot of the system system.
We can confident six million people and half million systems that are stereo systems that are in office.
You have to recognize that this means a lot of options.
In other domains -- in the world world in the world world of communication.
There was a poetry was a kid, where you could get any kind of a service service as many of the service as much as it was offered by the MBell.
The eyes of the phone.
By the way, one of the consequences of this is that the phone was never the straight of it.

And the result is that the result is that they do this question.
And you know what the answer is the answer to question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to buy a phone that you don't know a phone that you don't know too much.
And in other areas that are much more important than bugs, there are so much more important than the number of options.
The health care systems -- in the United States is not worse that you go to the doctor and this is what to do.
Instead, you know, you go to the doctor and you say, we have the various variation of the B.
It has these advances of the risks.
BBy has these advances and these risks. What do you want to do?
And you say, "Doctors, what do they do?" And the doctor has these advantages, and these advantages, and the risks and the risks and the risks and the risks and the risks of the risks and the risks of the risks.
What do you want to do?
And you say, "But if you were in my place you do?" And you know, your doctor says, "But I'm not in your place is -- you know, the result is -- I mean the patient is -- I mean to do a good thing.
But what is actually is a transition of responsibility and decide to make a lot of the choice of somebody who knows something -- in this case, and it's almost certainly not sure for the best form to take and it's almost certainly the best form to take a form -- in this case.
There's a huge level, for public health care for the medical medicines that I think is that you can see people like this, which you can think of a lot, and you think it's not a lot, because we can't buy them.
Why do we add the adjusting if we don't be.
The answer is that the people who are doing this is waiting for the next morning and we are the next morning, and we can change the network.
Something that our identity has become a problem of choice, and this transition of choice, and this transition to look at this.
And that we don't worry about a identity but we have the ability to invite a ability to invite it.
And we can we reinvent any of us we have check the chef.
And this means that every day you get to the point you need to decide what you want to do.
With the respect for the condoms and family was a conclusion that was the prepared of the people who had to get the way of the earthquake you to start to get the kids as quickly as quickly.
The only option was with dinner, not when you do those who you will have the same thing that you can do after it.
But we are all of our daily is very close to the food.
I prepared to unlike intelligence and give them to 20 percent less than I do.
And this is not a little bit more dealing and not because it would be less made.
What do you think of the questions "Are you going to be able to travel to do it?
Would I have to be loud to be a kid, or a card or a card questions that consume.
And they will answer the questions, whether they do not that means to not do all the bonds that means to be a good note to the goal of my currs.
And that's also what you need to do. These are the important questions that we need to answer them.
Mount -- we are the bees and Carl and Carl and Carl with technology that allows us to work every minal mind, in every single minal life -- a little bit of the Earth -- a little bit of the Randphonus.
By the way, there's a region in a cold, which we don't revealing anybody in the convey of the wireless of the wireless of the wireless of the bed,
I don't want to tell you about it because I want to use it.
So this is that incredible freedom of choice that we have to choose with worker, is that we need to do a decision, and if we don't have to do and if we should not work and if we should not work and if we should work and do it for work.
We can go to how we can play our football and we have the mobile and the Blackberry, and the Blackberry, and the laptops, and the laptops, probably the genes.
And if all of the way there are every mind, where we look at the forest of us as a football of the football of the water --
Would you answer this email? You should write the theory? You should be written in the question is that the answer is that the answer of your little bit of your little bit of your little bank you for your little bit of how it would be without any different from how to be without them.
So in the order, different things and small things that are and small things that are the stars of life, is a lot of the things that are a lot of options.
And the world that we were living like this.
To say that, we had some some choices that we had some choices of the choices that was a different issue.
And the world we live now looks like this.
And the question is, is good or or us?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what I'm good at that, so I'm going to talk about what is going to be safety
All these choices are two things that are two negative effects on people.
One of the effect, the paradox, is that it produces of paralyzing than release.
With so many options that can choose people who are very difficult to choose to do something very difficult to do for something.
You give you a very significant example of the investment of investments in the investments in the private pleasure.
A colleague was my work to be access to Venezude TVake a huge amount of mutual forest that has almost a million of the walls and 2,000 sees.
And what he found is that for every 10 10 foundations that offered office the employees of the employees of the employees.
You have 50 foundations -- they are writing with 10 to 10 percent less you like to get less than you offer than you offer than you offer than you were supposed to be why?
Because 50 foundations of mutation of the naid of the naid to choose the way to choose what you can do is so a law to choose and so you can see the door of the doors.
And then the poor and then the fat and the hope, and the cloud, and of course, the cloud and of course, the hope, and of course, it never come in.
You understand that this doesn't just mean that they don't just mean that the people will use the food for door of the food for the being, because they don't have enough money to put money on the beach, which means that the stable thing to do is so hard to make the big compensate of compensation that would give the employment of the computational compensing.
By to participate with the leg from the employees from the employees of the employment of the employees of the employees of compensing.
So the credit is a consequence when you have too many options.
And I think that does this mean by the world to show like this.
You want to take the best choice the best thing if it's for everybody's everybody?
You don't want to choose the forest of the wrong investment of the wrong or even the wrong thing to save the wrong
So this is a second is that and if we can actually get to the strength of the store and to do a little bit more satisfy to the result of the choice than we were a little bit of choice.
And there are some of the reasons for that.
One of them is that we had a lot of snoses for the people who are going to choose if you buy one and it's not a perfect -- and you know, and it's not -- and you know, you know, and the so-called it hits for the west?
It's easy to imagine that you would have to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better than the alternative that is that the alternative that you can imagine the regret of choice that you have to do and these regret regret and these regret that if this was a good decision-making that it was a good decision.
The more you have to have the easier of options, the more of the more you know, the more of the option that you have the option that you have the option that you have alpha that you have the more you have.
Second, which economists call it cost cost of opportunity.
Dan Gilber demonstrated very clear in this morning in the morning of how we are things that we are dependent on what we compare to what we compare to them.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative alternative to have a lot of the alternative to imagine the characteristics of the alternative alternative to the alternative alternative of alternative alternative that you break the alternative of alternative that you have less satisfied alternative to you who are other-based on that you have a little bit of alternative to you have a lot of satisfying of alternative that you have a little bit of the alternative
Here's an example. I am a great excuse of people who are not New Yorks.
But here's how we should be about.
We have this in Hamps.
A very expensive properties.
The superbonds. They have a wonderful day day. They were all going to do.
What could they want to be more it? "Well the drug is thinking.
Everybody in my bookster in Manhattan are leading to the book.
I could be like in front of the office in front of two weeks of the idea that the idea that the idea that the snapped of the bed, to have a place to be a place of parking parking parking parking thing.
The food store of the satisfed in that we have to be on the election of choices that we are except for what we choose is extent.
And the more they were in the way that the more characteristics of these options of these options are going to be perceived as we are perceiving the opportunity to be ownerships.
Here's another example.
This cartoon television.
He says we should be living and we should live the south and probably we should be able to do the right beginning.
But one of the things that tells you is that any of the things that you don't do other things.
And all other things can have a lot of things that are going to have a lot of things that you do what you do you do the little bit of attractive.
Third, the third of the wave of waiting for expectations.
This was when I wanted to replace my blind.
I see a little bit of the time.
And there was a way that the people were a single kind of a single one and you buy them and they were incredibly unknown and they were incredibly unknown to be unable to get to the spread of the long time and they were getting to get better and the spells of the safety of the beginning.
So I went to to my bluggled after I had been good for the old and I said, "Look, I want a wall of the blue, I want to be a bunch of bedded by the same, lights, the right lights, right?
Do you want to be nasty or with farm or the wild or the beat or the beat or the beds?
Do you want to be the gone?
You want to avoid them, you want to flowing the bed." And not the bank --
And he painted his face after I said, "I want to be able to be the guy who were the only guy who were no idea that I had a idea that I had a idea that I spent a city of the walls of the walls of the walls -- with the right -- the real thing -- the true -- the real thing -- the thing that was the right -- the best of the ones I had been able to have the right of the right of the ones I had been
I have been working better. All these options have made possible to choose better.
But I was feeling worse.
Why? I wrote a book in which I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt worried about is that I was worried about these options of these expectations about how I should be a wall of the good people have grown to be raised by the good ones have grown to be raised.
I had very souths very low-fear waiting when they were a huge expector a single wait of a single way.
When I'm 100 sorts of of his mother, one of them should be perfect.
And what we got was good, but it didn't go.
So I compared what we did and what we expected and what the result is that I was disappointed in the comparison with what I was hoping is that I was hopefully in the comparison of what I was hopeled to do with what I was I got to do with what we expand what I did was in the way we expected what I expected with what I expand what we expand what we were
The rate of options in the lives of people can't do something else.
And the right will take this to the more satisfaction if they get a good thing that if they get good results.
No one of the marketing world doesn't know that.
Because if you know if you don't have the idea of what I am really going to be a idea.
The real thing is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was worse when everything was worried that when everything was worse of the people to be able to experience.
Today, the world we live -- we live -- we live -- we have industrialized and we have the perfect thing that we expect the best thing to do is that the best thing to do is that the things that are so good to be so good as you expect to be so much of the things that you can be so much of the people that you can be so much of the people that are going to be so much of the way we expect to be that
You never have surprised because the expectancy and my expectancy and my reefs and my reach.
The happiness of happiness -- this is the secret -- the secret of happiness is to wait to have redded expectations.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- that I actually have a goal and it's really a great house.
I couldn't find something better and I didn't have any better it.
But let's look at your house not necessarily not necessarily
And finally, a consequence of buying a wall of the bears that you don't like to buy a single one one one is that you can't buy a single one of the question of you can't do the answer to is the answer to is the correct.
The world is going to be coming. What could you do it?
When are hundreds of different stars of black-and-disorders and buy one that you rescued the bees and ask you why are you who are the bee?
It's just like the answer to the question of the question of the question of the question.
You could have to choose better.
With a hundred different kinds of things that you don't have any scary to choose no scale.
So when people are doing decided, if people are doing the results of the choices are good to do with them, they are good to get to the beat them.
The deep of erupon the world of industrialized in the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not the only important thing -- but the important thing to do is depression, is that people have experienced in the syndrug that people are very high on their arms that are too high to be too high in their own areas.
And when you have to explain these experiences I think they are the bedded of the experience.
So the general result is that a better leader good, and we feel better and feel more worse and we are worried.
So let me remind.
This is the doctrouble, that we all all think and it's really true and it's not true.
Without the discussion that you have a few choices that are better than no matter that many choices are better than others are better than others are the better than others.
There's a magic numbers. I don't know that
But I'm pretty sure that we went to the point where the point where the choices of the choices of life.
Now, the idea -- almost we almost finally finally finally -- the idea that you can think of it.
What allows these things that allow all of these industrialized choices is good at the materials.
There's a lot of places in the world and we heard of some of them where they have no lot of options.
The problem is that they have too little bit of it.
So the thing about talking about the Western societies, modern societies, modern societies.
And what is frustrated and suffering, is Steve Levitting about how these chair of cars on how these chachair and hard to get out of the gap.
What I mean you is that these options are expensive, expensive not just helpful to help them.
They actually have pain of pain of pain of pain in of the pain of the pain of them
They are really going to do worse.
If something that allows us to do that in our society to do all the choices that we are going to be transferred in the society that people have too much more than the lives of the same people are going to be improvement of the amora.
This is what economists call the Pareto.
Redwanding the windness will be better and all -- not just people -- not just poor people -- because of how this excess excess choices are to sell.
In conclusions. They have this characterized that characterized and a sophisticated person you can say, "Wo! What do you know about the fish you are the beat?
You know that nothing is possible in this acvarious acvarious actor." Icelcelebration on the world -- so I read it and I read it and I read it and I read it and I read it in the world.
But the more I thought I was the more I thought I was to think something like this.
Because the truth is that if you are the same thing to be possible, you don't have the freedom.
If you are the active active that everything is possible, the vast level.
You are crew and the scale.
Anybody need a task.
This is almost not too limited -- probably even for a fishing for us.
But the absence of a metaphor is a deeply of unfortunate and precision.
Thank you very much.
