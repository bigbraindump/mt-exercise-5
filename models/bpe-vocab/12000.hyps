The first year I went to these two report to the two of the main the rainforest that the pollen in the last few months of the last few months of the last decades of the last two million years of the year of the two percent of the two percent of the two percent of the two percent of the earthquake.
But this moral -- the most important issues that the problems is not the most important thing that the genome.
The pollen is the policy of the left of the systems of the system.
It was the time of the end, and the end,
The next next few minutes that I will be a very good way to be a very good way to what happened to happen to the last 20 years.
The wasting is the fun is the flow.
As you see the High Horgan of the High St.
This is the fossil of the time of the same.
And they are the morning.
About the code of the froge, a little bit of a little bit of a long time you see it is like a wild of a flow.
In the 20th century was at this time to be here.
This is a question because the incident of the insursurface in the middle of the ocean.
where it's a number of the most important thing that will be the most popular -- when they were able to be able to be a different molecule in the microbes of microbes of micro-cell-cell-cell-cell-cell---cellular system
The most important with the policy of the gene of the global global warming in the atmosphere, you could reach the same as we could reach this for the forest of this in the country.
In some of the flowers in the Alanderson, the Hikko is in the mixed of the rainforest.
The Big King's Hallie in the New York City in the New Yorker was a kid in the middle of a day.
Another ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ we're going to be done.
And a really important thing that is that the word "th" is the werror is Gend's in the Alex.
This is a little bit that they were all the time.
But the role are much more like that.
This is Krain Krain in the West Gendlless's Gending.
If you look at the most parties of the forest of the forest of the west of the waste.
These are very quickly.
And at the same same same same kind of the planet, the most popular in the planet.
The last last year, people have the role of the coffee of the code of the code of the West is going to be the High Science of the Science is the coffee of the same way.
This is the role of the most powerful shapes like Gending.
In Hugh, the code of the coffee that you see the new way of the new ways, that they were in the room, which was in the room, which was going to be the cool.
In the decade of the population of the world of the world in the room, the water in these rooms.
In the cash of the wasting of the water for the water to the water for this room.
The other were required.
But when they were uncomfortable with the water and the water and the water and the water
In the California was a requirement in the middle of the west in Sahara.
This is the properties of the wise.
And the same thing you know, as you know, they're very excited.
In the whole new remarkable to build a frow to a frogs of the incident of the income
And the most important thing that the population has been a very small flowing with a very small and the same kind of remain and the room.
And the few of the last decades of the last decades of the '80s.
This is a system that has been remarkable.
If you go into the context in the context that you can see what it is.
In the last three years I went to the last 50 million dollars in the plane of the 24 million dollars in the middle of the country,
The problem is going to be with the Paction of the Pacive in the U.K. and in the U.K. and in the middle of the country, and the requirement of the oceans of the oceans are requirement in the oceans of the ocean.
The most important thing that the patient of the global national corner of the natural gas of a remarkable to 20 percent of the forest of the wisdom of the code of the coffee of the core of the core of the core of the biosphen of the most omoscience of the most most different genomes of the most most
The second is a good story and the most powerful system is the most dangerous.
The United States is one of the two different types of China.
And the requires were to build a lot of the deep for the good for the good for the good for the good for the good for the good for the good news.
But we start to see a change the right change.
And here are the same that are actually in the last few years,
All the old, there is a lot of the policy.
And the first generation of the west and the wild was a different plane in the last two billion dollars in the last year.
The best way to the best thing is to do is a sea of a frog.
This is a picture of a little bit of it.
In the Democrats, at the Menderson, a billion selling of the wild of the skills.
You know, you can get the wall of the wise.
This is the same on the front of the wild of Science in Science,
One of the maps of the map of the map, so they were all the way of Congress, it was so excited.
TV: The song is ♫ the song of the eyes, it's a little bit of your eyes and you love it.
He is the end, in the U.K.
The coffee with the eyes, they will get the best way to the best way to the best way to the right way.
He is also also the end, and the people are requirement in the room.
Give this is the most important strength of the Council in the Council GD.
The most most of the most parties is the good newspaper of the Gend's own.
TV: The Ghana Benjjew: I want to be the Hank, Gove Sancia, Sha's Homas I was not about what I was going to talk about what I was going to be a lot.
Give the Occo to the Count's called the Council of the movies.
This is one of the one of my life.
TV: The OO: The DDDA new change, we see the new changes, like a very different ways to the environment.
And the fact that our minds is the requires of a great group of people who are enoughing the audience that we have to be true.
The next is the coffee is not the good news.
We believe that it's a love, and they were very excited.
So you don't don't have to be the requirement for change.
You know that in our way to do.
Ver: The song of the Homa little bit of a little bit about it.
So you can do a very role to do this by the sea of the wild of the code of the corner of the corner.
Yes, Mork! Morgan is about the wildn't.
But this is the great ideal technology.
And as the best best of the code is to be a new kind of global warming systems of technology, which is to change the technology that you can see here in the way you see here you can see here in the right here.
The problem is to be with this technology is that the good technology is to be the good news for the book.
The New York City in the moral will be the same kind of the structure of the biological structure and the governments.
TV: The National National SA in the economy, the economy, the economy of the economy of the economy.
The thing that is that the wall of the resident, the requires of the code of the corner of the corner of the rooms of the same, but they were a little bit of a flow.
But now we have a solution to the new product to the new remain the room.
You know, you have a system with the energy in the energy in the space of a year ago,
One of the American go to America to do the same as we will make the requires and return to the global warming of the global global warms.
In the case of a solution that is that the solution to help us to help us understand it.
You know, you have the American nost.
Go is the last year.
TV: The An is about the citizen-Americans
One of the most most powerful ways to go to the wall the code of the coffee of the corner of our plane that we had to return to our own Bard's wife to the new idea.
Barmy shassss' studies to create the remains to create the TV
Nex: The human being. It's all for America. It's for the time for the enough.
Go: The first one of the great biomaterial of the American said, "You want to go to the only waste.
If you want to go to the same, you go to the wis!
We have to go to the way.
Thank you very much.
The first year at TED, I went to the LAS:
And I was going to go and get a new way to make a new way of the remarkable to make this happen.
So the end, I love the people that were not -- the most important is that the most important thing that was the most important thing that was the High Science or the High Science or the rare of the 21st century of the 40,000 dollars a year from the U.K.
It's very excited by the way,
This is the corner of the Gending.
We have two two two words "Come on the Big Banger's gyppt.
I work at this point. It is called the ATTTT, JA -- 99/14, 14th century of the 40,000 feet, this was a couple of years old, you can see the ATTT, to be able to be able to require the rereveget.
In the Chinese cartoon the front of the first first first time for the first time,
And this was a picture of ATTT.
Because it took a very different from the front of the planet.
It's a story of the first first pppping of the coffee that the LL, the CCC, the HH: the L, the LEED, the LIT is in the West Science,
In other words, when I was looking at the end of the next 10 to the forest of the forest of the forest is a very quickly.
I don't know that if this is the most dangerous or when you went to the end of your own eye and you go to the first place.
The answer is that I was a democracy, the environment of the environment in the context of the environment.
After a little bit of a little bit of the problem with the problem that had had to do with these -- these are these days, these are these days, these days, these are these days.
The same kind of the product of the surface of the forest of the power of the products of the product.
Now, the engineers of the room, and I said, "You can't be the reach of the remain the room, I can't be the sample of the fis."
But I can do this for when they are now in the plane that they have been used by the same kind of code.
And so at the 21st century, because the same, the frogs of the fingers can reach the inner of these days, these are so that you can recover the insurance of these required.
In one of the most populations of the 90,000 CCCCCCCC, was a soup of the flow.
And so the result of the coffee and the 116 million people have been required by the way,
This was the result of the result.
This is more interesting to think about the properties that are the same kind of about 20 times and the end, and they were in a long time.
So I went to about about 50 percentage of the planet.
It had to go to the wise, what we were doing.
I have the reported the sit, I went to the wise.
And now we go into the mamimic in the mix.
The next to the end of the World BBBBBBBT: Tike Talk.
We are now to be a load and we have to go into the data or of the work of the work of time and we can get to the universe.
Now, of course, as a lot of the end, those requires of the conversation about the engineering and engineers and engineering and engineering and engineering to get the same thing.
I think that the end, I think it's a very difficult to be able to have the end, and we have the discovered that is that the L.
I will go to a little bit of a Corphanthropy of the Higgs of Capt Corgan of the West West William House Bard's not for the remains of the remains of our remains of the resisisidents, and we don't have to be better than the revealing of the resisidents are not as much as we are not as much as we required, as we don't have to the revealing the red, and we can be the red, and our fine to our fine that we have to the ended up to the red, and our remain our own wislate and we really well as our fly we have no longer as much as much as much as much as much as much better gloadmmactive
Thank you very much.
I want to go to the end, you know, you have a child, when you look at the bottom of the kids.
As you get the requires to go to the end, you know, you get to the ensure of the end, you know, you can see how to get to the end, and you can see the extension, and you can see the initial accomplishes.
The deep of the west is the requires of the way we receive the world of the world
So in the case of the requirement of the Digners of this kind of our human beings with the human beings -- the human beings -- and my incident of Havor and I started to be a kid -- I could be a kid to reach the Tian arrian and when we can get a little bit of a remarkable to the Turglege of the people that we can be a kid to be a release of a few people to the people to the Timmit could be a couple of years to the Tikney of a couple of these two to the time to the reach, and I could be a couple of people to the Tallivan act, and I can be a couple of these two very few daily ily reach, and then we get a couple of these two reach to the Trate to the Timimpyppp
She's a what?
The question was that the question was that I was able to recover the explained to the explore the West Science.
In a little bit of Science is a computer is a properties of a corner of a corruption.
They can be able to be able to be the required, you can get the required, and they have a radio and a product and a product of a product of water and a product of a product of a product of a product.
The most important is that it's like the waste, like the same, you can get it as a little as you can get the money.
And the coffee of a new example of a new new new new structures of structures of the intelligence.
In the most effects of the products are more efficient, the patient to their own own own own own own and a lot of our own income and we can start with a lot of us to reach their injuries and requires and return to their own inforforces and requires and requirement and remaining their own experiences.
I'm going to go to the end,
This is the requirement to be the result of the question, and if you look at the bottom of the movie, if you look at the other hand, they are the other hand.
These are the same data are being a lot of people are a lot of a lot of the same thing.
So if you go to a lot of people have been doing it.
If they are required, they will have this kind of remain and they can be remain and they can be able to be the required.
And I can tell you that the requires and the commercial and the public public public
We found that one of the most important experiences in the experiences of the structure is that we can use the requires of the end, how we could be a requirement we have a little bit of a dish.
In this case, we have three requires that the coffee of the waste, and they can use the pollen and the left of the left of the left of the left of the left of the left of the left of the left of the left of the wall.
If we were very uncomfortable in the room, we can get into the wise.
There are also also also great opportunities for education, how to be the language, and the language, and the language, and we want to see the possibility of the way we can see the things that I see the things that they are looking at the time, and see the results.
So this -- I was a soup of the Honewoke that we do with a properties.
This is a good news of the words of the words of the most powerful and the Sabababove Bennan and the Bennan and the Babbe.
And then the first phase of the first income was in the wild of the Science and the requires of the bed, they are the right of the deep and the end, they are requirement with a remarkable to a return to a fit of a remarkable to a remarkable to a require of a fitself.
And then the sea of a year in the 20th century, and you have a new new new structures and a new way of the required.
Thank you.
These are the same code that they were in the Long Long Long Long Long Long Long Lincience and revered, and I would have a huge material.
It was a little bit of the room.
And one of the interesting thing about this kind of a very different kind of people don't have to get people to people to get people to the structure of the structure of the structure of the structure of the structure of the structure of the structure of the structure of a lot of one and one of one of one one of one of one of one of one of one of one of one of one day and one of the one of
All of you have to say, "Wom," and they are really true, and I am going to do what they do.
This is the good news is to be the people are in the same.
This is the most exciting of our finger, in our head.
It turns out that all that it was to do a BBBe was a lottttonight in the room.
So it was just a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
This is a huge amount of community.
We wanted to build a new ideal tools for the people that are in the language.
And this is called the Tike.
He can take the visual vision, it was a little bit of the BBBBB, the High Low that they are required.
This is the walls of the bed.
Ver: The museum.
David Pert: A requirement of a fingera.
Ver: The museum of the wise.
Very --
When the West Science and the wall of you and a bunch of people can make it a requires --
DM: And you start with the own own own own income
TV: Ga! Ba!
DM: It's a story with the story of how he would be the visualized will be the required.
TV: The Gowa,
DM: The New York City that I was to reach a project that is a result of the music and the music and we had been able to return that the code of the coffee and the walls and the coffee and the sample of the walls.
Each of these two different different different types of you who you want to use a lot of you want to use it to use it to use it to use it to use it.
And you can remove the code of a lot of the deep that you get the road.
You have the coffee of the High Science of Science of Science of the wise.
It's the same that you can get the power to be able to be able to be the mapping and the map.
You know, you look at a certain kind of a lot of them and then they get to the die to be a lot.
The same same kind of the developing of the surface and the coffee and the frogs that you can see the Higgs of Here, you can see you see it.
TT: The ide: T: Two to a second in the Nigeria in the Egyptia -- I have a little bit of a lot.
Now I have a little bit of the wall.
TV: The museum of the sample of the flow.
TT: The ide: And I'm going to reach the movies to the stage to be the requirement to the require of the remarkable to be the remarkable of the remarkable of the ide:
TT: The alking can be the sample of the moral reaches of a remarkable or in a way of a remarkable or in a way of a dow.
TT: The ide: I will tell you that the movies for the most parties for the most expensive cortex.
TT: The ide: You can do it in the moral way.
So we don't have to do the planet, the required, the more and the more and the west or the woke of the wall of the wise.
Now, in the morning, you can recover the requirement of the rainforest in the west of the wildlife in the corner.
Thank you very much.
As you see the vision, my own own own computers that are better and the computers that are better and the brain's brain's brains.
And I had to go to a lot of this kind of new new new new idea, and the new idea, and you can get the ability to the end of the city.
The way that I want to go to the coffee is like this new and the new generation of this new generation of the city, which will react with the world that will be able to return our own world.
You know, I have very much.
These are the genes of the required.
I'm a lot.
He says you can see my teacher, but the more is more more than a lot.
It's the same sample and the movies and a little bit of a little bit of a car.
And it doesn't have this kind of change.
But these things like this, the best thing that was that the first time and the movie, and my father was a kid that was a load, and I love with my own own own own own own own own own life.
And the same kind of the result is that I wrote a book called "Han," the Hone," he said, "Look at the Rago," which is the required to the world for the world to the world that was a very simple idea that he had a great idea that he became a great organization of the Internet, and the organization of the Internet, and the Internet has become a remarkable idea that he became a very complex and the organization of the organization of this technology that has been discovering and he became a very of the Internet, and he had a very of the world of
The first one is that the most of people are still working on the people that are going to be the end,
Ser's revenue, the code of the wis!
in the case of a scientist and you say, "You don't know that it's not -- you don't know that you can get it in the way?
You don't know how you go to the focus on the room, the west of the sea of the world that are going to take the world to the world that was so fle?
It's very exciting the deep truth,
But it was more like if you don't have any any of you have been able to go to the end, I started to get the people -- I was looking at the time, I was able to tell you that the same kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a fear of the city.
And they said, "We're not going to be better than you don't have any other experience?"
Do you don't know it your eyes your own ide?
You don't know that you're going to be the same as a conclusion in this room and you don't have to be in the moral and you will be a coffee with the wasting of the wall?"
Something that is like this.
The answer is, the answer -- the answer of these questions is ""Why is the question."
Yes, it's the little bit of all these things that are doing things.
And it always happened.
And you know, it's in the room, the other things that people are not the people that they can't even find them.
As a result of a new typical signals that are the things that are required.
But when it's a talk about the work that I was talking about the last thing I was looking at the last time in the last time of the last thing that is that I was a question of my life, right?
Is something something that is a straight?
It's a very simple as they are going to be able to be able to be the work that they were in the Nigeria to do this in Pub.
And what is the very important thing that the requires that the requires that we have to be the own of the own income in a way that you do a lot of people who are not a lot of the people who are not a lot of the people who are not a lot of the people who are not a lot of the people who are not a lot of the people that doesn't do it without a lot of the other people who are not a lot of the other question?
I mean, my time is a scientist of social engineering and you don't have the three years of the four years of engineering and engineering that if you were going to be a person to be a computer to be a computer is not a scientific engineer.
It was not -- what was like like a TV in the brain in the brain of a genome?
It doesn't have something that doesn't have this happen.
But as we are also the neurons of neurons of the group of the group of the citizens of the city, the enemy of the injury.
We also write a lot of you have this kind of a conclusion of audience, but the audience of all the other hands of the requires that they have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the require of the remarkable of the remarkable.
And all of us is that we have to be the cooker of the coffee of the 20th century, in the 20th century, they have been required by the world that they were slowing and the world that they were slowing their own own own own income and the world.
And even the same thing that doesn't have to be able to be able to be the own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own
The New York Times in the last room, the first time he said he said, "In the first time he said, "My parents my song of my song of my song of my song of my song of love my song of my own little bit of my own little bit of the New York Times a Leoneman of the New York Times a New York City of the New York City of the New York City
A big big big base of the work of a new project.
But they don't have no fear when we have no idea when we heard this things that I heard of these things like this, and I was able to have a lot of people in the audience and the idea of the idea of the fact that they are just like the person and the person will always be able to return to a place to the end, and he just receive a place to return to a place to the ensure to the ensure that he just to the ensure you just to reach a a place to the reveget.
And the question I want to be able to return to the things to this problem with you guys in this context with this ide?
You can be able to be -- as the way to the code of the west -- I don't have this to be the end,
I think it's like a lot.
And even though I think it's not to be a remarkable to give you a second second second.
I think it's better if we look at the audience of the audience to get the audience.
And I know the good news in my life, my life, my work -- my work -- my work for me to go to me to the end of the wise, in this room, in this case, in this case, and I have the time that I was looking for the time that I think about the time that I was thinking about the time that I was working on the time that I was working on the time that I think of the teacher.
As a little bit of a little bit of a decade of about 30 years.
I have probably probably probably four million people in the world of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the people.
And it's very difficult to tell you that what I will tell you that this was to be a lot of the people that were working on the front of the morning of my favorite of my favorites of my life, right?
What would be a little bit of a finger, because you get the most of my friends -- we're still going to be very different from my best -- I would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the most important thing to do.
Oh, yeah, what is yeah.
This is the kind of a way that he could do it to make it in the morning to go to the morning, and I want to be able to be able to go to this and I want to be able to be that to be able to go into that way.
I mean, it will be in the front of this is the answer.
And in fact, the question of the question of that?
And so I was looking for a lot of the finger, like that was to talk to me to me to be able to go to a kind of a human being?
I had a lot of you to go to a way to the reach of a finger, and my father and my father and my father and my father would be able to be able to be able to be able to explain what he was going to be able to be the end of what I had to say to the end of what I had to say to the end of what I had to talk about what I had to say to the end of what I had to talk about what was in the end of what he had to talk to the end up in the audience
And as we all have all the last few is in this case of the history of the time I started to go to the time and I was able to find how many society if you could be better and better and if we could be able to create better decisions and how to be able to create the way to be able to be able to make the receive the remarkable to make the receive the way to make people to make the react of the way to the people to be able to make the react to the react to the way to the people to be able to the way to
The scientific was in the Homo and Romorrow.
So the prototype, you know, the idea.
But in my Global and Romorrow and Romantic and people don't have the way to the people in the way of the werror of the wis?
People have thought that the power was a good way that they use their own people who are in a way of people and the people and the end, and the end, and the end, and the end,
The name is the called these these are the people who are using the maps with the Cythths of the Come of the Come of the Come of the Come of the Come of the Come of the Come of the Earth.
Since was the conclusion that he thought that he was a froger of the incident of the incident of the reportion of the remain the corner of the west.
The first of the same same and the same called the same code that they were the genome, the genome,
What is very beautiful, because the scientific is that they thought it was a gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene.
They have a gene of the gene was a very simple structure of the coffee of the corner of the audience as a resident, the requirement that the coffee of the arrow of the audience that are actually requirement and the result of the people who are working on the result of the results of the results of the first projects.
Again, this is still -- this is the kind of a kind of a kind of about human beings that I was able to build the data that we are going to build the data and the world of the world of the world are going to build the world and the work of the world
And the world is that the world as well.
So the artist was a series of the work was too much for example, as a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the --
If the work was the work was not the cool, you could have the wise, it could be the world as a die of the world that they remain the rooms that they required.
If the work of the work was not the required, right?
All the world as the gene of the gene was a bit like this.
They were looking at the people in the GDP for a long time for a long time.
Then they came from Russia, and the very change and the idea of a very interesting idea that we receive the most important part of the universal cortex, and we have the most important to the world's worth life-up to the first time that I go to the first strength to the first time you get the first strength of the first time to get the first time to the first strent of the first time that I was the first red.
It was the human beings was the human beings, and people started to reach the power of the people that are all the way of the people in the corner of the people in the corner of the city.
And for the first time, the first time, people started to be able to be a teacher or a physics of the human gender.
And they have to be the required, I think it was a very different way.
The pest of a good person to be able to reach the person is that the requirement and the requirement and the requirement and the requirement of the finger, the rate of the gene of the genome is a very good way of the human beings of the genomes of the human beings of the genomes of the human beings.
It's like like you have the sample will be the wild.
We just have the coffee and the required, and the genes of these genes are requirement in the required.
I think that the most parties of a computer in a childhood in the last decades.
But if it's true, I think about the question is, and what is the question is, what do we do we do we do we do this?
Can we do things with other things that are it?
Maybe we can go to the most extensive people and the people of the people and the extensive.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't not just about the human beings of human beings of human beings of a couple of minutes of minutes
And it probably probably as the audience that would be the question that the question of the question of the incident of the people that I would have the people that are in the end, and the people that are all the way of their own and their own income and their own own and their own own experiences.
It probably probably doesn't like a coffee to the idea.
But the question I want to give you a -- what I want to do you not?
Why don't we want to be the best way to do this?
Because the effects of any kind of a lot of you have heard of what I heard of the human beings of the human beings of the incident of the effect.
The reason why is that the end, the way to reach something -- you know, you know, you know, the things that are not in this way.
And in fact, even though it can be the sample of the waste.
I had a conclusion where I met the great I met the American American American Russia, the American Human and the Lawke, and that was about 400 years ago, and he was looking at the first time and he was a song of his own song and he went to his own his father and he went to the first time and he was a little bit of the moved and he was a little bit of the movie, and he was a little bit of the moved and he was a kid's going to go to the first and he was to the front of his own my own my own my own his own his own his own story of his own his own story of his own book, and
The first one was like a wall of the coffee of a bit.
And they are also the sample of the room.
I mean, the movie, because you have the cooker to the wild of the wild.
In fact, the time that it was a single thing that I love the person and said, "Look at the bottom of the wis."
And the wall like the wall of the sea of the wild was to go to a little bit of a fear and the sea and when he was a little bit of a froge, and when he went to the wall to the way to go to the wall to the wall to the way to the wall to the wall the way to the wall to the wall to the way to the wall to the way to the wwe.
All the habitat was not as the sample and they were in the wild and the wild and the wall of the water and the wall the water and the wall of the road, and I was a little bit of the sample of the walls of the room, and he said, "I'm a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a different les."
There were the time in the time, and I will not just like to be a love, and I will be a little bit of a story that he was a little bit like this.
The first time of my home, the code of the code of the code and the code and the end, and the person that was the one of the other hand, and he was the other hand.
It was the cooker and the coffee and then the wild of the code of the code of the wise.
In this case, the most important thing that the coffee of the coffee and the last time of the last time of the last day to the last day of the last day of the last day of the last day of the last day of the last day
When I saw -- I saw -- it's the ancient of the world was the right right of my own own own idea.
My father doesn't have the opportunity to be able to be -- not the require."
I'm a little bit like the people who are going to be able to go into the same and I go and find out and find out the same and you to see the same thing.
But even in the arm, in my arm and I was in this ended up to that I was able to be able to be the end.
And I remember as I was looking at the same time, and you have been a lot of you are going to be the right now.
I had a little bit of the ideological or that they were in a way that they didn't know what they are.
And what you do you do that?
And how the end, we should be able to return to the end, we don't have to be the end, we have to be the end, and we remove to the reach of the incident of the incident of the genome?
For me, the most important example of our daily in our life, we can do about how the music can do is the music is that we took a computer to a computer in a computer in a reference in the audience of the arm of the arrow of the end,
I was going to be the kind of the coffee was just a little bit of the artist of the policy of the policy of the policy and requires and rered, and the production of these products and requirement rererequirement and requirement requirements of the productive of the products of the resisisisidents.
In the time of the same, and you have a story of a story of the coffee to Lincoln in Lincoln and Lincoln and so that it was able to change it.
As a result, a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the arm that they are required with the presence and the end, and it was a lot of them to be a lot.
It doesn't have a little bit of the Higgs are not remain the room.
The fact that he was the sample of the sample of the wild of the waste, and he would go to the right to the wall to go to the wall for me to go to the wall.
There are no good for a good thing,
And in the way to go into the same, and it was a lot.
It was the same kind of the system and the system that they do with something that is all the new and new new way.
He went to the right of the same, and said, "You can see it in the mix?"
"You have it as a kid to say a lot.
If you want to be true, you want to be the right right to be the right to go to the right to be able to get the right to the right now.
If you go to a lot of them and a lot of different ways.
You know, you have the Bonewo Bond's Bonkk."
The third is the system that has been built this by the building that was so forth.
It doesn't have the surgery to be able to be the same as a remarkable to be a way that it was a lot.
But the same same efficient, and the same, and the same, they were able to go into the wise, and the wall the code of the wise, and then they would have to reach the way to the end, and then they would have to be a way to be a way to be a way to be a way to be a brilliant to be something that we had to be a lot of the money and the money to be a bit of a pollennies and they don't have to be a lot of the money to be a lot of the money to be a lot of the money to be a lot of the money
It could be the developing development and the very small and the requires of a conference and the end, and the end, and the incivil of Tiky was so that he was not so that he was not too much like TV and he could not have a little bit like to be too late.
After what I heard is the story of a little bit of a little bit of what I was doing was a little bit of a lot.
This is the required when I was a Channounced by the Kia, and I was the end, and I met the end, and I went to the end, and I was able to know something that I was able to get a better way to be a good way to be a good way to be a good good good at the end of the most beautiful story of the story of the story of the story of the most important thing to do is to be a good thing.
It doesn't just like this, but it was the most important thing to do.
I mean, we have to be able to be able to be able to be a remarkable to be the project.
And I looked at my life, I was talking about the arm and I was looking for the audience.
I went to the sea of the wall and I was able to return the roads of the wild of the roads of the room.
I said, "Why did you know what you call them ""You know, I love you if you were not just if you don't have any great thing to be a great thing.
Because you see you see one of the time I go to the sea and I would have no longer to go and more and more and more and more and
So if you want to be better than you want to be able to know the right and you have to know the right to you see the right of the right right now.
And if you don't have to do that, you know, I am a lot.
I would take a whole school, because this is my song of my son.
And I want to be the same for me, I was the day I was the day I was the day of my daugh."
Because the Middle Castern -- with thousands of years in the U.K. Long Africans have to return to the body and the museum and the music and the music and the museum and the museum and the museum of the muscles of the war --
And the very beautiful thing for the other income for the teachers were the teachers and they were the uncomfortable and they were the unusual iness and not?
But the very small finger, and one of the reason, and you can see one of the community.
I'm going to be the same, because you look at the point, you know, you can see a lot of you see a lot of the intervention.
It's like like the time and the end, and the requires of a kind of a kind of a different kind of a different ways, and they don't do it in the other size.
In a long time he didn't have a little bit of the sample of the room.
It's the same in the room, and it's the sea of the west of the wilders.
As a little bit of people who were talking about what they were called "We were called called me and they were called it and they were called it.
And I have the same same same and they were requirement and said, "Ham," -- James, Muslims of Gia, Mushamin."
It's God
One ancient -- when they have a question -- when they were remain Saharan Scotton had this in the Mexico of the New York City, Musher, Mushamia, "Hel," he said, "Hol, "Holly,"
and they have the ended up in the time of the sea and the wild of the wild of the wild.
In the South Africa, when he was a very simple structures and he was a very simple and said, "Mush," and the Alzheimer."
It turns out -- a little bit of God of God Give Give Give Ghana.
It's very beautiful, because we need to do something that we need to do it.
But the left is the next couple of days when you get the morning of the arm of the code of the morning, and it's not a little bit of a moral of the Science is not a remarkable of the Science of the CCCCCCCCCCC.
It's a little bit that the frogs and the gene that the genes could not be able to reach the way to the end,
I could nobody nobody body knows how to say the name of the name of the Washington that we should be able to do with the life?
It's pretty simple.
It's one of the most expensive sits in the requirement of the rule.
But it could not be a great person in the if you don't think about the most part, you know, as the most important as you have the most important in the best way of the wise.
Maybe if you don't think that it was a required, it was to explore a remarkable to the end, you know, the end, then the end, and when they were able to be more and when they were able to be a lot of the time and the time they were all the time.
If we were able to be able to be able to change the change.
So I was trying to figure out and that I was able to require the last few months of the first time that will be a conclusion of a remarkable of the forest and the incident of my incident and my initially intimate of my incivic of my own incident of my innocent of my insurance of my incident of my intuitial
And what I was looking for the presented when you get the word "th" is not the word "no.
It was not a remarkable and you can get the Middle of the Iraq would be done.
If you get the incident of the beach.
If the gene of the genes and the policy is that you get the way to the end, and the end, and the end, then the end, then the end, "Yeah, then the end."
And if you don't have any any way.
And this said, "Yes, for my daughter.
I think that these things should be able to get to the people to be able to do.
"Women, for you, you know, it just just like a bunch of the fingeral and the end, and the ends of the end,
Thank you.
Thank you.
June of the West Homa Hol!
I have a little bit of these things about the genomes of the genomes and what he could be able to discover the things that we could have a gene of genome.
Now we start with a new place at a new ideology of biology, and we try to reach this to the reach of this new and reach to a new report of our minds and requirement and requirement and rements of the experience.
We tried to find all the time, what we looked like we can do the problems.
"What is the life is something that I think about the biological biological biological and you start to understand different from different levels of different levels.
I tried to figure out the structure of the life of the life of the data.
We have already been able to be about 20 years ago.
When I went to the genomes of the genomes of the world in the world of the world in the world of the world of the world of the world
Now let's try to ask the gene of the gene of the gene of the universe, in the universe, in the universal universal universal --
This is a small electrical electrodes of a small genomes that the genomes that the most important thing that can be the only one of the city that can be the only one of the water that can be the only only only the first step into the surface of the water is the only of the corner is the corner of this is the electromomomomomomomomomomomomomon this is this
We tried to see if we tried to go to a little gene and we can get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of gene.
We had been able to be the first of a group of genomes in the genome that are now in the room,
But when we look at the opposite of the metal coral is very simple,
I mean, this is a simple.
But when you look at all the genes that we can use a lot of people in a little bit of a cell.
So we decided that we decided to go back to the only way to the reach of this -- so we can get to the most important to the most important thing to do to the most important questions about the most important questions of the most important questions.
And so I started on the left of the wise, "Can we see a philosoph?"
Maybe it could use the gene that these molecules that we didn't have any different types?
And if you can see, you have a code of the genome?
Another of the finger, it's just a little bit of social networks.
So our fear of our own life in the life of a brilliant to a remarkable to a remarkable of a remarkable of a remarkable of a remarkable of a remarkable to a very fossil of our planet. So our planet. So this is our planet.
Our own is the power of the product that the coffee of the waste.
The last time he went to a fly to a remarkable of a remarkable of the instructure.
I started this little bit more than 10 years ago.
I went to a couple of days of a lot of the end, in fact, he was trying to do it in the first time, he was trying to do the first experience.
But it turns out that they are very difficult to be very simple.
There are four million people in the world in the world that are are are going to make a little bit more than 30 percent of the human beings, but it's a lot of the developing of the product of the forests of the more expensive and more and more and more and more and more than a lot of the more and more than a lot of the more and more and more than a lot of different way.
So he had to rebuild a new way to make these new new way to make these little bit better and they have all the way to the eyes.
This was our first first incident of the world of information from the real world of the genomes of the genomes of the genomes of the High 1.
It's a little bit of the genomes that the High Science.
We did the design of the wise, I went to the west of the genomes of the molecule that we have been able to be about 3,000 feet.
The interesting thing was the interesting when I went to this is that the gene of a society, and I went to the poor and the wall, and I started to go to the focus and reach the the role of the gene of the gene of the planet.
The role of the genes were were in the gene of the cellular system.
I was going to be the first of the surface of the wall the way that they thought they were very excited to know this idea.
They have the eyes of your your your your your body.
And so we think this is a very important in the environment that can use the own community.
But I wanted to do something more than we wanted to do that.
We wanted to build the entire biomomomomas a phenomenal of the West in the West
This is the decade of the gene of the genome.
So I was able to get the water in the rooms of the rainforest of the gender of the most popular that we can understand the code of a gene that we are able to understand a cellular cell.
The properties is the interact with the information that when you start with the computer, that we have to be very excited.
When I went to the first conclusion in the first time, the Council was a couple of miles from a decade of a little bit of a month.
I had a little bit of the requirement of the incident of the original cortex, if we had had no idea of the original cortex.
The next part of the project, which is the most powerful way that we have to be 50 miles that have to be able to get the other six-up to build a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a lot of the people that we have to be a lot of the deep of the same thing.
We are requires of these are intuitive.
You can look at the road said, "You know, the code of the wise. You have a fear of the code of the disorder, and I have a couple of weeks -- and Tur, and T.
Tric in those rooms -- these are about about 20 percent of a little bit of a very role -- a single one of the income in a single room.
So we can use the code for the good news for the question,
I have all of all of the things that we had been able to recover the wise.
Some have been requirement is not that the same.
We have these been requires so that we can get the end,
They're all the things that they are requires and they were uncomfortable.
So we started to do the sample of the same, with the west to the sample of the wall to do these 1,000 feet of them in the 14,000 feet, and then you go to the row to the 14,000 feet, and then they go to the 24th to the 240,000 feet.
Every day we have a lot of these falls in the room, to the reach of the requires to try to figure out how to make a very complex -- like a remarkable to see a remarkable to see a lot.
We go to this to the reach to that the reach of that the reference.
So this is a bit like a wall of the coffee.
When we go to the row very small fills of the wild of the wild of EEvery time in Egypt.
It has all the different genes of the microbial molecules.
So we have been doing this for all the other income
I know that there is a structure called the incident of the biological red, and the biology, and that is the DNA to be a DNA that is the DNA that is the DNA that is the brain.
This is a example.
There is a system called the Crainforest that can be the electrical products that can be the policy of the product of the product of the product of the product
As you see in the middle of the Hombiomas is the Hombike is in the room.
By at the age of the time he went to the new row of the new box.
We have thousands of social that we can do that.
These organizations can be the same kind of remain the dies.
I can live in the room.
I am am that the life can be in the life in the space, and they are required, and they get a new way to the environment.
In fact, NASA was the right there.
This is a micro-called a molecule that we have to build these molecules that we have to build a frow with the resix-in-in-in-re-in-in-re-in-re-in-re-in-ended up this is that we have a required.
Drhhhing them to reach them to the reach to the reach to the reach to the return to the reach to the reach of the wise.
This is not a little bit about a small small small room, but it was a little bit of microbes and micro-cellular microbes
It's so a molecule that we can see a little bit of a little bit of a microscope.
These are the first result of a long time in the last decades.
This is a audience that I was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of this is a child. This is a child. This is a child. This is a child.
These are over 4,000 feet of the gene of the genome.
It's the most important molecules that you have been a structure with a structure.
It has a number of different molecules in the billion.
If we have a little bit of a half of a million and a little bit of a 40-year-old girls.
So how do we have a chose? How do you know what?
The deep with a gene is very simple.
But it's much more difficult to be able to be the bacteria.
Even though it was more like to go to the wow, like you can just go to the gene and you can see this is something that you saw -- and you know, this is a bit of a lot.
The other people of the code of the genomes is in the genome, but we got a cell that we can do a very role in a gene of a cellular cell.
I have a required of a different species in a different microbes in a microbes
These are the two of the most important people like people and people are required.
I have a couple of genes in the gene of this genomes to require this phenomenal for this phosphere,
I went to the end, with the genomes for all the genomes of the genomes.
And it was pretty much of the one of the gene -- you will remain our genes are very different -- and the code of the genomes of their cells.
In fact, I thought that this is that the way that they could go to the way to talk about something that we tried to be a better world.
This is a structure of biological structure.
We all know all the different species that have been a new species that are in the second or of the genome, or a different types of of of a different kind of a series of a series of a year in a second.
So the same thing that we think about a single gene that a new gene to a lot of energy in the biological structure of biology.
There are the made, the requirement of the incident that had been been working on DNA
The genomes that was not in the gene of a cell.
The Hollywood -- the Hombiomas we have --
It was the first time and I was a lot of the other genomes like the genome, and I went to the gene of the genome, and so I went to the new genome.
It became the Hollywood because we have been able to remain that we have had in the genome.
And after a very small time of life, all the time, the result of a new species of a various species of a new species that was a new species that I was looking at the planet.
All the genes were not about the new new new new new ideas, when we have been able to change the gene of the gene of what we have we have to do is that we have the same thing.
This can be like like the genomes of the genome, but we could also be able to change the DNA to change the gene of the DNA that we can be pretty much different.
Now, we have been able to do this is not the gene -- but it was a half years old, and I was able to create a new way that we can use a new way of the report of the West is a new kind of a new kind of new project, which is a new project, which is a new project,
Why do we do that?
I think it's very excited about the presence of the end,
We are in the way to go to a half billion people in the decades of the decades.
As I go into this context for me to me for the conclusion.
Now there are three people in the systems for every single in 1969, in the 1949, in the 1940s.
We have the very complex in the water water water water water water water and the water and the patients and the people are two billion dollars and the people and thousands of different and thousands of different and different and different and thousands of different and different and thousands of different and different and
It was a good way to do it for us.
We have three billion people in the room, more of the most powerful than 30 billion dollars a day.
This is a number of million pounds of the rooms of the room.
When we try to think about the biological and biological or to be able to be able to be a very important that you can be a very interesting that that is that it will be a very interesting that that is that
And then of course, is all the NNAAA, which is the atmosphere, the atmosphere.
Now, the most important thing about our world, we have a new new ways to all of about 20 million genes, and I love to think about the future of this technology.
The electrical electrons of the electrical system has a lot of the things that is so exciting and the issue that the problem in this way.
We are in this case, in the first human behavior and the biological structure and our imagine.
We have now about these different types of different different ways of doing what we call this genome, we call the genomes of genomes of genomes of genome.
We have to build a huge social network that allows a million of them on a little bit of a day.
When you think about 20 million people to be able to be different from genes, or to try to find that you can reach the product or requirement and we can use a lot of things that we can actually be a lot of the different molecule to the other molecules to do the other problems of the most important thing to do with the other than 20 years,
And this is just a little bit of the resion.
We can also use it to be able to be able to be the genes or intuitially red, and the product of the product of the product of the disorder.
This is a remarkable of a team of thinking about the project that we could have to be able to work and see it in these countries.
You know, you don't know how to say it will be true.
We know how their own genome.
Now we're all the way of the patient to the planet.
You saw the first time, the end, the code of the coffee is just a conclusion.
We have the role of the generation of the number of the same that will be a very good fear and the fear and the frogs of the mirror or of the year or of the year or of the year or of the number of different types of different types of different types of different types of different types of of different types.
But the only way we think that the biological structure can be a lot of information that can be used by the way, and their own innocent and the Nigeria, we start to be able to work with the Nigeria, we can actually get the plane to be able to be able to be the only one of the time of the 21,000.
The patient and the NAAAC, the most important thing -- but our world have all the world of all the world of the world of the world of all the world.
This is a system that I started to say in 1999.
It goes into the middle of the oceans in the middle of the sea and the sea and the flowers of the wild of the wild of the wise.
Tro Craied -- in the microscopes that are used to use the gene of energy to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the genomes of the Craig is the Praig Craraig of the Crararaft.
We all know if we can take the NAACC, that can be a very role in the Egyptians to reach this for the Every few to the focus for the Science, to reach this to return this into this and required.
So in a long time of life, we could have the questions that we could have the question of the questions of life, is the question of the life of life.
We know the truth, you know, we have the structure of the microbes of neural genome.
Yeah. If you can't do this to TED, where you can do the other worth?
You can get a lot of energy in the energy
But we also have to work together to create these things and requires for the people to reach the patient.
You saw this in a year of the wall, we still have a year and a little bit of the wind of the forest is the planet.
I think that can be able to be able to build a new product of all the divide of the disorder.
Here's how to go to the future to the future of the future of climate change, the global economy, the remarkable of the evolution of the income -- and in the corner, and in the room, and the welder.
We are just to be able to be a people.
Our own is just to be able to reach us to be a lot of us to be a lot of them to do that. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you a little bit more -- it's a new new technology, a new technology that I was a new technology that I was in a little bit of a year in a year ago.
It's a group that can be able to be able to be the only only of a different kind of information that are the kind of information that is the structure.
We look at a lot of the money of the forest and the forest and the forest and the end, and the end, we have a little bit of this in the end, we can reach it to the end,
Not as much as a lot of information that are also the different ways of being different and the patients are about how much it is about how they are the best of the rules.
Most of the people are made with a new project, but for example, is a little bit of the Kian Francisco is a Cake of the Kiband the High Tiky of the coffee of the walls.
It doesn't have the only thing because the only thing that we should be able to make the system system system is the number of the code of the surface of a very simple architecture. It's very difficult to be a very simple structure.
This is a little bit of a little bit of a scientific example of a scientific example.
It's about the Come of Give of Michael Hambian arm of the Science.
To tell you that it's about the music and I can't imagine that we do not want to do something that is that the arm of a conference is a very simple thing.
It can be a good way of looking at a book in the corner of a corruption.
I don't don't have to be recover it.
This is a little bit of the remarkable of "Poriss"
Each of the first project is the beginning.
This is the right thing that you have a lot of the conclusion of a re-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-structures that is a huge amount of time.
We did something and have have a little bit of the patient with the Hollywood of the West Hollywood
We created a little bit of a very large requires to a lot of the most important -- and I have a little bit of a very fear and a remarkable to return it into a deep fine and a remarkable to return it into a deep fine and the requires of the requirement had created a frow created a ft.
If you look at the power of this object is here.
Or other or intuitially or different species.
And this is the same as a very complex structures of a corner of a bunch of the corner of a corner of a top.
We are to this to reduce the residents of the wild and the sample of the things that we don't have to do -- that we don't need to do it.
Of course, the frogs is one of the technology for a technology for a lot of technology for this technology.
I don't don't have a lot of time to tell you that I love to tell you about this in the country.
These are all the the popular in the United States has been a picture of the NAAASA to NAAASA
Let's look at this for a different way.
This is actually the Internet is the Internet of the Internet.
This is a project that he was the Possy of the two technologies that are the two technologies and the other technologies and the other people in the other language, the museum of the computers of the Muslims of Give Savin Muslims of Global Russia,
and Rakya Craig of Microsoft Lo: A very quickly.
And this is the Internet called the Internet.
You can see that when we create the way that we reach the requires we can use this for a lot of information that we can have this kind of a lot of different experiences.
But the horrible of the space of the ideal process.
The other hands of the visual structure of these things have been required, so that they would reach the person to the Linn and the Lincience and the Lincience is -- you know, these were in the Middle and you can see these are in a remarkable environments, and you have these inequality and the requirement of the alone.
I'm not sure if I was going to show you the other countries.
There are some more powerful space.
I like to go to a look at a strength of the Earth's book -- this is the kind of a very different kind of a very few years ago, I was going to show you what I think is that we had to show you what we had to show you the Sciencement of this technology that we had a new model of the technology that we had a remarkable to be able to return that to the technology to be able to be able to be able to require that we had to be able to reach to the technology that we had to be able to tell you to tell the Soscient to the Sowneromomomomomosphonic to do not
It had to be able to be the most important thing about the presence of the bed.
This is a system that is a Tiky Clacial Council Cl, you know, the BBBy Cl, and you have a Tike of the Huher, and you have a coffee of this conclusion that was a remarkable that was a cool, and they said, "This was a remarkable that they were received by this conclusion that he was the required by the same that he was the red.
These are the Black of the Cl, and all the molecule in this space.
We can only be able to be in this room.
You know, I didn't think that I never would be able to talk about Microsoft to talk about a little bit of a very first time to be here.
I have no idea that you know, I'm a lot of the coffee of the TV to the TV to the PPS in SSS:
If you look at the bottom of these things that are intimately
There are so many of the elements of the elder.
One will will be a whole whole whole photograph --
This is a little bit of Duha was called Come --
You can get the fall of a lot of the society in the context of this context.
The idea is that the technology can do with social networks. It's going to do the same data from the world -- the world of a world -- the world of a world -- and the world -- and the Earth is that they have been able to reach the same thing.
You have a system of what the first generation of the Earth
And then you look at this at the bottom of the BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBl:
And this is in the complexity of the world, as they use the world and the world are also using more different ways to use their own use use use use to use them to use their own brains.
The other people are slowing the fossil with a metal corner.
If he would have all the coffee and he says, "You know, my mother, my mother's song with the Congress of the Council to use it to use it to use it to be a very difficult to use it for a very powerful and requirement to the social networks.
And of course, a prototype of these are very different from the corner and the products and the new products of the Earth are actually the Earth in the world in the world of the world in the room, but in the room, in the room, but the kids are remain a school.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: What I know is the power of the power of the muscle of a moment in a certain time, is that you can see a couple of years olold, so many of the require?
BG: What do is doing is what it is.
It turns out that the required, if you look at the example.
And they actually have this kind of requires the imagination.
And this is the answer is that when you think about the structure of the information that they have been working on these things.
As you do a little bit of the Internet, you have the Internet, and you have the Internet of the Internet and the Internet to the Internet to the Internet is that the Internet is about what the results are the kind of information that is about what happens.
Now, what would be the picture if you do with all the questions of the photographs of all the questions of the question?
As a result of the interface and the requirement that the west that is a very simple remarkable to the movie.
CA: Okay. The very very simple is really incredibly incivic of the biomass.
BG: Thank you very much.
One of the most effects of the inner of the coffee and the people of the map of the movies that they have to live in the moral that they have no idea that they all have the coffee of the row of the room, and they have the coffee of the coffee of the frogs of the coffee of the water in the rogate the core of the flowing of the plane of the coffee of the water in the rogate of the room,
You don't have any of the James were always going to go to the Clending Congress, or the Lincience or the West High Sathola High Saharan Francisco is that the economy is that the idea of the architecture of the architecture of the architecture of the architecture of the architecture of the architecture of the architecture of the architecture of the architecture of the idea that is that we are not only one of the architecture of the architecture of the architecture of the architecture of the architecture of the architecture of the architecture of the economy, but we are not only is that we still not only one of the economy, we have a clot, we have a system that
The most important part of a lot of the people that are requires of our own income and the inner that they have a lot of time and in a lot of time in the beginning of the time of time in the beginning.
And of course, we all all have the same same and we are remain and remain and required.
We are still still died. We are all the children on the world.
We are in the role of the income
We have to do the same on the road is the waste, so that we should have any kind of a love, and they have all the time.
But what is interesting is that the incident of the incident of the policy of the human being.
And the code is the North Carolina, or the Bard's or the Horgan or of the Higgs or of the Higgs of the High Sa's in the middle of the Higgs or of the High Saharan Francisco or in the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the the New York Times or the South Porgan Francisco or in the middle of the middle of the New York City of the New York City of the middle of the middle
The third is the same with the same that we were in the room, or a little bit of a little bit of a pocket of the wild of the West Sold, the world of the world of the world, and the world is the world of the world.
All these people are all the people that are all the different ways of thinking about how many of us are the way of the Earth's Earth to the Earth
And this is if you think about it, you can't think about your own your own eyes.
Now, the most of the people of the world are requires of the world and the expensive world and the requires of the population of the city, and the way to the human beings of the human beings.
And you can think about this in this case, as the people of the life-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-minded talk,
The Hosphenomenal is of human being.
It's the very simple idea that we are all that we can be a very simple ideal specific fic species.
And as the metal was that the role was so far, and so that can be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit more fast to a little bit more fast than a big big big big
For example, not not not the hardwe, that we would have a lot of people in the whole whole lot of the different ways, and it was not just the best of the fear -- and the most important -- and this is not the most important thing that we know the most important part of the most important part of the most important part of the most important part of the most extensive ended in the most extensive, and we know what we know in the most of the encial report of the most efficient of the extension of the expensive ency of the most of the most of the extension of the encient of
And the most important thing is the result is the remarkable of the conclusion.
When you go to the other hand, the people in this room, they were 1,000 language.
Now, a new language, it's not just a little bit of a flower or a fingeral or fallery.
It's a language, it's a human being-in-human genome.
It's the system that are in the roof the wild of the corner of the world has been used in the world and the world of the world
Every time is a little bit of the sea of the deep in the reside, a re-in-in-in-struction structures of the structure of the structure of the structure of the structure of the brain.
And over those of the language, how we look at the World World BBBushy, a half of the earliest of their children.
There are no longer the same, which means that if it's not a change, it's not going to change the language.
What can be more than to be able to be able to be the most of the last pure of the last part of the language, you don't have to talk to the brain, and you don't know the reach of the insursurance of their own initial and the residents of their own cars of their children's restricted and the people of their children's reveget?
And yet, that the code of the frogs is the right is going to be the Earth in the Earth will be two weeks, because every week and a couple of weeks ago, a little bit of a very small brain and the moral language.
And I know that many of you will say, "What would it be more likely to be better than you do?
It was not a better way to talk about if I was a very single language, "I'm a language, or the language, or the language, or Ghana, you would be able to be a Ghana
Or to Kow."
And you can see the arm of the requires to be able to tell you you you to tell you about the language.
So what I want to do today is a kind of a very small road -- a little bit of a little bit of a very small fossil to you to try to figure out what it is.
Now, there are many of us to be the way that I say "I'm going to tell you that they all know about different ways to know about different ways to know about different ways to do.
Let's look at this example of the Barbo in Bard's in the Alzheimer's the Honewo -- that they were -- they were -- they were --
This is a poor that the wall of the water is not the blue of the water because the west of the coffee of the people who are required.
I have a little bit of the language, and the brain called the wall the coffee that we have to be a lot of you have to say to a different language.
And all these are the coffee in the last last decade is a little bit of the long time, and I talk about three or four or four languages, and I didn't have a little bit of a language, and he didn't have a language.
They just start with your eyes and start to talk about the language.
Since a most of the most important thing that I went to the West West West West West Sa's Law in the Alexander in the first phassn't required, in the 1970s.
In 1979, the first pure of the requirement and they did it and they did it and they have a conclusion.
They were recovered in the photograph of what they were going to be a little bit of what I wanted to be a kid, and you know, these days, and they saw them in their own own own own innocent in their own country.
They took these two photos of the patient, they tried to get the wall the way to find the wind or to find that they found it that they have been able to return that these these disorders of these three days, so they were the same results of the results of the kids who have been required by the same three of those who have the same three of the children.
But Wathanks not only the road with the corner of the habitat
They have their ideas.
2,000 feet in the moral cortex, the requires of the wildlife
I went to the corner of the corner of the developing of the developing of the human beings and I found a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a very small task, so I went to the same time that they were all the way that they were all the way of the same time that they were all the way that they were all the same as a result that they were the same as a resulted with the same as they were the same as they were all the same as they were the same as they were the same as they were the same as they were the same as they were the same as they were the same as a result of the same
They can be the most important of the animals in the country, and you say what you say is, and you say to the work of the work of the work of the work of the beginning.
In the beginning of the '80s, I had a great person when I was a question of my teacher at TED, I was going to be a very interesting and if I was going to be able to be able to be the same as the first strength of the same and the same as I could use the same as a relaw to create the same for the same way.
To understand what the way they do is where the forest of the forest of this conclusion of this kind of God and the God of God is not a requirement of the required.
Disly, it's a little bit of social social networks.
It's true.
If I would ask you questions that are the people who said, "Why do you do?
I mean, the Dake Dake Dake Disn't.
It always took a little bit of a very early requirement that the Scotton had not been able to be a great idea. We had no longer a good ideal ideal ideas.
But what the GPS dog is that the most important thing is the most important and the answer.
So the most important thing to do is that in the remarkable to the end.
The role of the code of the Middle of Mism, like the West to the west to the west of the waste, so that it was the cool, so that it was the right right to the right right right to the right right of the front of the right right of the right right right right to the end of the right right right right right to the end of the bottom of the right right right to the end of the right right to the end of the end of the end of the end of the bottom of the end of the end of the right to the right of the top of the top of the right to
This is the result of the Government that people are in the eyes, and you see the God of God and God and God and God and God and God and God God God
We are in the way of God and God and God and God and God God and God God God
And because you're a lot of you are in the struggle, how do you have to be the remarkable to be the require?
So you see these are the properties of the Porse to the wall to the way to the west to the reach of the power of the power of the power of the body that is the way to the brain is requirement in the brain is in the way that the required, when the forest of the forest of the forest of the forest of the forest.
Now, in the rooms of the eyes that I met the Higgs of Sahara Nigeria in the North Sa's Barrian Francisco in the North Carolina.
You have the olderal of the East Tony Tony Tony the coffee of the Hollywood of the wood of the wild of the wild of a frogs that required of a slap of a froger that they requirement in the rogs of the frogs of the froge.
In a young school, this was a bunch of the flowing is not the sample of the wall of the wild of the wild.
Every time there are been a lot of a fossil of the incident to be a very good for the right to be very quickly.
The patients are the patients are in their families, at the age of the world of a year -- you go into a world of the world in the world in the room, for the forest in the room, for the west of the code of the walls for the wild of the wild of the earliest and the wilder.
The time of the whole bunch of new species that would be used to reach the new group of their own income in the corner of the nanogenius in my own genomes in my mind.
And the entire entire country, they are required in their society that are the human beings that are also the incivil of their own income and their own incident -- and they could tell the requirement --
In the last last century of this kind of a love, a and they were the first time and the first time and the first time of the time of the time of the time of the first time that they were in the first time to get the first strength of the wild of the wild of the wild of the remains of a -- and the end, and the remain a very few days, and they were a little bit of the remain a very few reeffort of the resion, and they were the rooms of the wish,
and say, "You know, it's all that I was so excited as I love it.
It's all very quickly. It's so easy to be to be able to build the plan."
They call them the most most people and I say that we're all the things that we are all the way of the human beings, we are also the world.
Now, this is the amount of energy is very important to be the same thing.
Many of us think about the fish of the same, and we remain Russia, and we can reach the blue of the code of the corner that we can get a simple idea that we can tell us that we are also the same kind of the Earth are still in the Earth and the Earth are now that we are still in the Earth is that we are all these things that are more than than than than these are all sorts of things that are more than than these things that are more than than than than than these are people that are doing
Well, the bank you very quickly don't have the unusual accurate the wildlife
It's not too much for a long time in the wall of the code of the Science, in the room, and they have been a Tike of Tike and the system has been a love, and they created a new idea that the idea that the idea of the idea that the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea that the idea is that the idea of a lot of human beings, and the idea that we can be a lot of human being.
Now, what is that?
It's a little bit of the BBack in the New York City that was the movie, which is the required, which is going to be a lot of human being, and it will be a different way to the world with a different way to the world that was a lot of the BBBBy is a little bit of the BBy is a little bit of the BBBBBBut, the Tig is that he was a little bit of the BBBBBBBBBBBy to the BBy to the Give that he had to be a kiddy to the BBy of the same way to the same way to the BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBlack for the very small small
It's the only one of the most parties or a little bit of the deep of the reside.
The incial is the metal of the efficient of the gene and the new ways of nature.
I was a very small in the U.K.
This made me a lot of human beings than my song of my song of Kina, which I think of the Hollywood High Kiky and the High Lowner and the Huko and the Hubike of the Washington and the Bams of the Lamin the Bams of the Bams of the Baminjection of the Lubike of the Law to the Lab the Bamigh Law the Law of Cake of the Lake of the Law of Clacive of the Lamin the Lamin the Washing's La's La's La's Lapapapaphthis road, which
If you start to explore the idea that these are able to create different ideas, you can see the ideal ideas.
It's a picture of me in the New York City in the Alex, in the October of the Oxfor.
This is the High -- you know, I love you in the way you saw the gene of the gene of the human beings of the waste.
This is not just like the structure is not just the structure of the incident of the incident of the innocent of these different types of different types.
The first is that the fact that he was a series of the map of the mapping of the corner of the biomas as the policy of the genome.
It has just just just a better way to be a little bit of the High Lowner that the people who are all the people that are all the way to the college of a wild of a coffee called the Plllller of the Pllllller of the Plorse called Plllllllllacy.
This is the requirement of the coffee very very different from the brain, the brain in the brain, these brains, 114-kynnets' sampps.
If you saw you saw it in the Hancient of the Hancient of that they have the code of their owners in their own skills that they were used by these different types of different species that are requires of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee.
He went to that the slap is actually that you have to be able to be a remarkable with a frow of a frow of a lot of the energy and requirement of a very efficient, which is a coral structure of the reality of the reality of the realities of the realities of the reality.
In fact, I talked about my teaching at the Middle Eastern San Francisco was the Dan Apple of the 19th century in the 1960s.
I was the hardware not that you can't be the corner of these fossil in the corner of the genome that you are going to go to the right to be a required, and the requires that they can be a very rare of the corner that you can be a coolly required because they can be a required because they can be receive the received that they can be a required because they are not because they can be receive the requirement in the rement that they can be the same same same same same same same same same same same way that they were not because they can be a red, they are not because they don't have a series that they do not because they have a representigained that they
They can be able to be just with the patients with the patient and social that they are MI.
Now, the things that happened is that the code of the incident are in that are actually a remarkable to be a structure of the structure of the structure of the corner of a series of a new system, which has been used by the way, they have these two different types of people in the same places, which they have these two different types of of people that have have been a lot of the same kind of a lot of the disorders of of of of of of people who have have been different from the same system.
Well, we use that women -- the great women and trying to figure out what is that the required, and they are not as they remain without any any any expensive doesn't work.
But you ask the question: "Whot and the West is to talk about the West and talk."
Well, what does it work?
This is the Craig of 140s, and you know, and I love them in the waste, and I see them in the room, and we see it in a very different different different level.
And then you ask the how they use their own own and they said, "You know something about about their planet.
I mean, it doesn't know what? I say now." And I say, "I'm not going to tell you no.
Well, we are now that every 11,000-year-old girls, and you get a lot of you and you get a different different different way.
Now, this is not a good friend's song of Harvard, but it's more than the next two than the next two to the number of them are the number of them are the number of the planet.
Now, the problem with the things that are also the results of the patients with the eyes of the bees and see them and see how they can see the requires and the requires of our own income from our own own own income and our world of our world is our own world.
The only thing that is that the 20th century, not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to return to the return to the reach of the biological process, and we could actually return the social networks, and the biological system that is not the system not not to be the system not to be the system not that it's not not not not the react of the system.
All of the most of the time, they were the people who have been able to be the very complex and the other structures
And the problem is not in the real world.
The Chinese had no fear to be the Brig Bang, and they were able to reach the American and the American school, and when they were received to the American and they were in the city.
It doesn't change the behavior of our incivic structure. It's going to be remade.
The fall of the code of the corner of the corner of the corner of the corner of the corner of the corner of their own
In the end, where you get the world, these are not that they are requires and they are required.
These are people who are working on the town of the beaches and the instructions that are all the way that they are all the way that they are all the way to be able to be the way of their own own own incige.
And the is the wasting of the woke of the wall of the Higgs -- a blue -- a frow of in the South African hour in the Saharan in the Bake of the wall of the way that you can see the BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBy and the gas and the gain, and you can see in the round and in the round of the row, and the row the ggs of the roge, and the row the row of the wise of the room, and the rogypose and the gypose and the road, and the rogs of the ging of the ggggggggg
where the wall of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild.
Or in the middle of the Hancies are are the patient who have been working on the wests, in the corner of the disorders of the disorders of of the beaches of the beaches of the wild of the West in the middle of the west of the wisdom.
Or if we go to the Luther Tike Tike in the last time you can see the middle of the policy of the policy.
You know, the gene of the human beings of a human beings, the most powerful strengths, but the most important thing to the end, it's not only a way of a war -- not only a lot of the universe, but it's not the right -- not the most important --
And you can't see the flowing the TV to the wall the way you go to the water to the water in the corner of the water
I went to the Nike of the Kian High Lowner in the U.K. BB, the His to BBBy to Law to Law the Law and I was able to get the people in the Law to the work that I was looking for the people in the Law of the people that we have the work that I was in the world to do the work that we were in the world in the world of the work that we were in the world
3,000 feet of the forest and the forest and the walls.
144, two million people and the patients in the U.K.
I was the young woman was a kid was a Ghana BBB.
This was the ideal ideal idea, when the Chinese people have been remains to Tike the patient.
One of the coffee with Pakistan in Law Linkenna.
My mother was the coffee for the sample of the walls.
He was the samed on the wall in the room, to the wall to the time to go to the sea in the room, because he couldn't be a little bit of a habitable to be without a remarkable to be a not not to be a remarkable to be a remarkable to be a remarkable to be a fled.
The reason that he did that was that he was a little bit of a little bit of education.
One day my father was the coffee of a code of a waste, and he was a kid to this week of my daughter.
The TV will be possible to be impossible to be impossible by the way, but the people is a fear of the people is something that is a slow.
And in the end, all the way of a door in a car.
So I want to live in a world of the world or the world to reach the world or to reach the policy of the polic?
Martin Minke, Mexico was when he said when he was the most parties that was the most powerful and I was a great time to see this in the world of the world is that we can actually be able to see the world that we can see the whole thing that we can see the same as a result of a very complex and requires of a lot of people that were able to think about the most important thing that we can be the people that we have to think about the same way that we can be able to think about the same thing.
And it's the flowing of our work that we are in the Nigeria -- -- the 40,000 years ago.
The evolution of the Science -- which we have been used by the developing of the city, we have the wall the way of the wild of the requirement of the inner of a very different level, we had a huge amount of money --
The first is the economy of the United States has been been able to be 50 years ago.
Now, this is a huge amount of reason, I was thinking that I had all the questions we have all the questions that we can reach the next few million people in the next million people in the next million people in the next few months.
When this little bit of the policy of the world are about human beings of human beings with a different ways.
And in that rooms you can reach the structure of what the possibility is a huge huge amount of species that people are already in the corner and all the way that you see in the way that I see the best way that I have a great way of the presence of the things that are requirement of the deep in that way.
This is a photograph that I went to the New York Times in the BBBBack in Bard's arrive with some people in the Milo and the Milo of the story of the story of my song of my song was a little bit of my song was a little bit of my song was a little bit of my son.
The governments of the Science was not so the Back the Middle of the 1960s, and in the 19th century, we went to our school, we went to the school.
The way of this is to be able to be able to be able to be a lot.
The Huke, the people had had all the people had all my own and all the time.
Now, you have to understand that the way you don't have the code of the eyes are using their own income in their own homework in their own home.
The gyppppping the first thing that were made in the room,
So the good news was not the conclusion of the coffee or the west of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wall.
He just just just required the same, he took the wild of the wild of the wild and he started to get the roads of the wall the way of the wall the way that he started a little bit of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a very different way of a very different kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a way of a very disturbed of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a single way of a way of a single one of a very different way of a very different kind of a bycafterrole that he
He took the falls on the wall the code of the west, and when he went to the wall the coffee with a little bit, and he was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a few few few few few few few few few few few few of this
He went to the hurt and his visual and his visual required, he took a lot of the innocent and he went to a few of the forest and he went to a few of the sample of the arrow of the sample of the walls of the waste, the reach of the requirement of the wall of the frow of the sweaten to the wall of the flowing of the rescue of the required of the rement of the rement of the fillusion of the deep of the deep of the way to the way to the red, and the red, and the dead of the red, and he was the red,
And I think about the very small flowing -- but it's a lot of the things that is a very good arrow and the wild of the world and the wild of the world.
In the lacking of the government, the government of the government to be the requires of a lot more than Tike and Tex.
It's our new required. It's called Nibbb.
It's a remarkable experience.
One amazing example of a person can see a code and requirement and requires for the west of the wide.
And in the moral time I think it's a little bit of a little bit of our own own own own own own own own own planet, we have been able to know that they don't know that they don't have the same way.
They are the trees of these people.
They are the prototypes of the presence of the families of the family, and we are all these kids like their children, and they have their children, and they have their own carries of the walls of the walls of their own cars of the walls of their own lives.
What I tried to do in the NNNASA is the Higeria is that we don't have to be able to do something that they will never be able to do something that they will never have to do something something that they will have a bit of a human human human being.
We believe that the policy -- we think that the policy is not the genomes are the question of the world can change the world -- so we can be able to change the world that we can be the best world of the best world is to be the best best question.
We have 30,000 million people in the row of our home.
116 miles of our own conclusion of our own conclusion.
The great news are of our children,
And what we do is a lot of the coffee in our eyes, where we can use our own own own own own own own income to the human beings that we can reach the world that we have to reach a remarkable of the world that we can get a little bit of a remarkable world to have a lot of the world that we have a lot of the world of a lot of the world of a lot of the world that we can be a lot of the world that we have to live in a frow to a lot of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a b
where all the way of the west of their own own own income to the west of our own community.
Thank you very much.
I will show you some things about a little bit of my song that will be the other things that you would have to do with some things that I would like to try to do it in the case you get the last time you get the last month to the end of the history of the history of the history of the time you can get the end of the end.
I want to start with what I mean by the listening to the arm of the argue.
The deep of the corner of the disorder.
The report of all the human beings of the human being.
And this is the audience of the forest is that if we are requires to reach the inner of the incivil of the income from a remarkable of the city, the enemy of the corner of the corner of the city.
The reason is that that the most most expensive is that the best way to the end, the incially, the ence, the innocent to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the right to be able to be a good way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to the reason the reason for the reason for the reason for the reason for the reason to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the right to be the right to be the fact that the fact that the way to be the fact utract for the fact that
And because people are also the people are also using the individual and we can do things that they will make it as we have to do it, and we don't have to reach our minds to the future of our decisions.
The other side of the forest is the forest is the forest is the wilders.
And the more you have more and people have more than people in the most of the people and they have a lot of the most people have a lot of the best of the same.
And I think it's so hard to recover our ffee system that doesn't have to go to the system to go to the wise.
And it's the ends of our own life.
I'll give you a couple of examples of what we did was able to be able to be the last time in the last year.
This is a small small small thing.
I want to say two things about the words for the same.
17th century for the water for the water for my mom and the coffee and the four different types of of these two different types of sample and the forest that you can get the whole bunch of the people that you can get to the same amount of falls in the 117th century of the 111,000-year-old girls, which you can get a very quickly.
So it's a huge amount of flow.
And then you go to the water to the pollen the electrical system that are going to be a system -- the coffee system, the movie, the dish, the requirement of the requirement of the red, and then the required, then you can recover the required and then you can see the required and then you get the initially and then you get the injury.
And in this room, in the electrical system has a lot of system.
We can actually receive the number of systems and a different systems of the systems that are going to take a place in the water in the water in the water in the water in the water in the front of a single wall.
We have to find that that this is a little bit of the fossil of the maps.
In other countries, in the United States.
It was a little bit of a child, when I was a child, you could have the first strength of the brain and you have a little bit of a BBBy Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Gl.
You have the phone phone phone is not a little bit of it.
The third of the most important thing that was that the cars was not that the called the "High was not the "
And these are all a lot of them in a lot of it.
Now, we have a lot of different types of TV shaps, the world in the world of the world of the world
These are different from the future of the future
My name is the most important in the middle of the MPP, the first same, and the wall of the code of the wall of the strength of the wall of the strength of the wall of the strength of my own waste.
And if you were not in the room, you know, you can see in the wall the way you can see it in the wall to you to see a little bit of a wall.
And the result is that the people are going to do the people in the room, and he would give you some questions.
And you know what the question is, right?
The answer is ""I'm not sure you that you don't have a phone that you don't know that it doesn't know that it's too much to know that it's too much better.
And in other countries, the people who are more important than the people are not just the same kind of a series of the surface of the number of the number of the number of the number of days.
The third of the genes -- in the United States is not the most important thing you can do is to do you want to do it.
In fact, you look at the English and you say, "We have a lot of the different types of of St.
It has these innocent and these are these products.
Is these these a lot of the gene and these are the genomes to do this?
And you know, "Dake the eyes to do what I do you do these two miles and the waste, and these are the injuries and these are the trees and these are the trees of these are incigarettttonight and these things are required.
What do you want to do you do?
And you say, "But you know, if you go to my own muse?" And you have the museum, you don't have the answer." And I don't have the same -- I don't have a requirement to make a remarkable to do a very quickly.
But what is actually a properties is a remarkable to the choice and the requires of a -- the answer -- the story of the history of a story of a -- and it's not just a good way to get the best -- and it's not to be the best of the most important --
There is a different level, and the audience for the patients with the patients as I was looking at me as a love, and I don't think of a lot, because you don't have a little bit of a lot, because we can't even get a lot.
Why are we all the power of our audience if you don't have a lot of you can get them to the eye?
The answer is that the answer is that the people are actually trying to figure out how we are the first one of the morning of the next to us to change the next to us,
Sometimes so that our own own own ideas, and this is a problem and this is the kind of a remarkable to show this this is about this.
The new doesn't have a lot of the structure of the structure of a possibility of a reality.
And so we can reinvent the end, we have the unusual required.
And this means that every day when you have to be able to tell you what you have to do you want to be able to do you want to be a lot of you want to do it.
And the way to the wall of the family, and the family's been a bunch of the residents that was so much more to get the way to get the way to go and see how they had to go and see how they were trying to get more and then you get them into their children.
The only one of the most part, I didn't even know what you want to do you get it to do with it.
In the day our parents is very much more to the right right now.
I love the women are very excited about how to do you get a better than 20 percent of them as a little as I was a little bit more than I was doing it.
And this is not because it was a little bit more finger, because it was not a little bit more than the movies.
You know, because you have the end, you know, what would be the question of my questions or not?
I should be the same, I would have to be my kids or children or a kid or a kid who are the question, who are the question.
And they will tell you the question of these questions, if you think that this is not to do the same as they don't have a good way to get a good way to get a good way to get the forests.
And this is to do it.
My mom -- we're in the waste, like the High and the Higgs that we could use the movies in the law of the Earth's been a little bit of the Clular in the West Cola BBBlack of the West Sol.
It was a love, there is a school in a school, which I had to know that the work that they are actually doing the same thing.
I would like to tell you about it because I want to use it.
So this means that this is a very important way that we have to be able to work with the work that we need to be a talk to you for a talk to you to think if we should be able to work and if we should have to be able to work for them.
We can go to the person that we see the code of our fingers and a frogs and a blue of the House and the other genomes in the genomes of the genomes of the genomes of the genomes we can use the genome.
And even though there are all the time in the moral that we look at the bottom of the wild of the wild of the door we should be able to tell you that this is this to the answer this is this kind of this disorder?
What should we be able to say to the arm of the audience should be my song of questions? And if the question is that the question is, the question of the question of the forest is very different from the walls will be very different from the front of what it was doing is not just how it was very different as they were not really hard to me.
So where we are also -- the big things that are different and the things that are the people who are a lot of people who are a bit of the life of the life of the life-of-the-the-the-the-the--in-the-of-the---the-in-minded future.
And in the world I was talking about it.
As I said, "You know, I was doing some of the people that was not a bit about the ancient of the national park.
And in the world we live there is now a bit like this.
And the question is, or not?
And the answer is that the answer is it.
We all know what we know about this, so I will talk about this is that I talk about what I do.
All these are these two types of these different types of people in the new ways of people in the people.
One of the most effects of the expensive that is that the innocent is that the west.
And as many of the most extensive, you can see people are very difficult to be able to reach this for a reason.
I love a very simple example of a very quickly, a lot of researchers from the plane of the planet.
One of my colleagues had to return to the development to the TV to the TV and so that the patients that has been a million people who are just 1,000 feet, and you have a million people who are still 2,000 feet.
And what happened because it is that every half of the forest that are the people who are also requires the people who are just two different types of of size.
The number number of them on the road -- they were at the time to be about 10 percent of the money if you go to if you go to if you go to the end, you know, you have a little bit of a lot.
Because with 50 percent of the poor of the people that are going to be able to reach them to the way to go to the end, and you can see it and you get a little bit of my hand.
And then the fall of the sample and then the sample and the same, and so that you always have this kind of fear and so that it was not the same.
They are not that you don't just that means that they will be able to get the water that they will be able to reach them to the money to reach a lot of people to reach a little bit of a little bit of a different way to the return to the law of the walls that they could reach the the way to the return to the south to the focus that they would return to the money to the money to the receive the return to the same and requirement to the money to the return to the surrounded up to the same out of the surroun
And the time I go to the row of the wind is at the bottom of the water in the room, which he would have a fear of the wild of the forest of the forest.
So the reason is a conclusion of the consequences.
And I think that this is what it is.
You don't have to know the best questions is to all the way to the wise, right?
You don't want to be the requirement or the required, or the wild of the wall for the wild.
So this is a big flower. This is that if we were able to remove the requires and to make a little bit more and we are going to be a little bit more than we were able to be a little bit of the result of the kind of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a remarkable to the way to make it for the way to do to make the way to make it for the time to be a little bit of the way to make it was more than if we were to be a little bit of the requote to the same thing.
And there are two different types for that.
One of the most parties of a little bit of the wild of the wild that would be a good person -- and you don't have a love, and you know, what is the wild for the wall?
It's going to be able to imagine that you could do a different way that it was better than the fact that it is that the fact that you can actually be able to be able to explain that you have to do these as a remarkable to do that if you have a little bit of the people that had a good way that they were a good way to do this if you have a good way that was that they were a good way to do this for a good question.
As you have a lot of you have so much better to require you to make something that is the requirement that you have a fear that you have a fear that you have a fossil that you have a lot.
In the second of the economy is called the economy is called the opportunity.
Dan Gamber of the project would be very quickly to talk about how we talk about how we are the way that we are all the things we have to know what we are doing and what we are doing with what we have.
Well, when they are a lot of the materials that are actually trying to figure out the way to show you the reach of the instructure that you can do it as a little bit of the same that you can do it as a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a very effect that you can do it as a little as a remarkable that they require the same that you can do it happen.
Here's a example. I love the New York City is not the New York City.
But here is how we should be able to be revealing
We have this fall of Hambikes.
A very different structure.
The small small small room. It's a very beautiful.
What could you want to want to be better at the fear of the same, you know, "It's a good thing.
All of my own of the left of Brian are going to go to the wall.
I could even even even in the front of the waste. And I was two weeks of the idea that the idea of a little bit of a very quickly required, which was a great thing.
The role of the opportunity to return the residents on the way that we have the way to know what it is.
And as much more than the most important in the way of the sample of the falls of these are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be better and more and
Here's a different example.
This is the map of a little bit of things.
It means that we should have to be the sample and they should be better than we are going to do it.
But one of the things that says, you know, the people is that you can do a lot of things that you don't want to do other things.
And all the other things that can have a lot of the different types of people and that will make it as you get a little bit more efficient.
In the third of the code of the resident.
This was my mom when I was going to go to the wall to go to the welcome to the welcome on.
It goes up with all the time.
And there was a little bit of the wall of a single one of a single one and you have a very difficult to get you to the end, and you know, if you were very excited to get them and if you have to get them to the row and they were better and they were able to get them to get them and they were better at the bottom and they were better better and they were better at the bottom of the way.
So I went to the back to the slap of my song that I was like, "We were the mountains and said, "We want to be a little bit of a lot. And I would like to be the right to be the right right to be the right right right right to be the right right right right right right right to the right right right right right right right right to be the right right right right now,
You want to do with the gally? You want to be the insurrounded or you in your eye?
You want to be the right to be the reveal?
You know you want to know the same, you want to go to the wall of the same. And not as well.
He went to the front of the arm, and said, "We would be able to be the same kind of the same thing that was not a single one that I was a conclusion of the wild of the wild of the right -- and I went to the right -- and I met the right -- I was the right -- I met the most important -- and I met the most people that I was a lot of the most of the worth of the right -- and I was the best --
We have better better better better than these are requires to be better than they would be better than they are.
But I was really excited by the way.
Why? I said, "We wanted to explain this story in which I wanted to explain that.
The reason that I was the best because I was that the sample of these are so that I should be a lot of the forest of my own carried with the wall of the room.
I had the very quickly unusual shape. I didn't have a very good person when they were a lot of the same way.
Now when they're about 100 feet, the movies, one of the movies, one of the things we have to be a very simple thing.
And what I was going to have been wrong, but not true.
So I was the thing that I was able to know what the results and I was able to be a conclusion of what I was looking for what I was looking for what I was looking for.
The way of the role of people in the people can do something that we will be able to make sure people like people who have to be able to be able to be able to be these these things to be able to be these things that we have these things to be these things that we need these things to be able to be these things that they need these these things to be these
And the most important will go to the more and more fear and even though they are all the way they do they do it.
It's a world of the world doesn't know that.
Because if you know that you have to be a idea of what I talk about what I talk about.
The only one is much more like this.
The reason that the most important thing that when it was the time when it was the time when they were still in the way that people would have been able to find out that they were able to be able to reach them to the enjoy and they reach them to the way to be able to be able to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to
In the last time we live in the world -- we live in the world -- you know, the patient and you know that the most important thing you can be able to be so that you can be so much better to get the best thing to do is that they will be so much better to get the way to go to the to.
You don't never have never been done because the people are required, and my own and the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right to be the right right to be not going to be never going to be never going to be never never never happen.
The world is the good news -- for this is -- for the audience -- you know, the audience is to be able to require the intuitive.
I want to say a little bit about the human beings -- I was just a little bit of a very simple and it's really a great thing.
I was to be something better and I was able to be a good thing.
But you go to the homework is not so much like a really flow.
In the last century, a remarkable of a frow of a blue that you can get you to the one person you can see if you don't know what you want you to know about what you door and what you doing.
The world is the right is the right to be the doing?
When there are hundreds of different types of of fills and you get a lot of you and you know that the person who are asking and you know what you do?
It's just the best thing that I mean, the question of the question of question.
You could be better better at the better.
It has a different different different different from the way to the reach of the requires for the end.
So when people have people people people are better at the people who are better at the people are all the way you are all the way you are looking at the bottom of the back.
The most exciting of the world in the first general world in the first generation of the first generation.
I think that a very important important -- but not the only thing to the most important thing to the return the deep and the people that people are also the people that they have a lot of people who are very quickly.
And when we have to explore these experiences of experiences are being a lot.
So the result of the result is that we have a good thing that we feel better and we feel better than we have.
So let me give you the end,
This is the museum that the arm, which we believe in the real real and we don't believe in the same way.
There are also some of you have a couple of people like this, but it is not better -- but it doesn't have better than you know that they are better than you are.
There is a number number of things that I don't know that
But I'm really sure that I was really a lot of that I was looking at the end of the life of life.
Now, the idea -- I was looking at the idea of the idea that you think about this is to think about that.
What allows all these people in the human beings of society is the microbes is the structure of material.
There are a lot of people in the world in the world and I heard of the question of the question of the question of the question is, they have no longer a lot of the habite.
The problem is that they have too much better.
So the examples of the problem is a very simple problem of society, and the physics and social and our own and social and dies.
And what is the fear and the requires and the requirement of the Linson, and I say these kids like their children, and they don't have to be able to be able to get them into the road.
What I love is that you think about these struggle, and they don't have any different and they don't have no no longer it.
They even have the challenge of the remain the way.
They all do it with the good news for us to be better
If something that has allowed to create a society to do with the human beings that we are also used to make a lot of society that people have too much more and more people who are not only in the same way that we could be able to be able to be able to remain our own eyes.
This is what the economy is called the Pl.
The role of the rainforest will be better -- not just people -- not only have the people -- because people are in this way of the end,
In the end, they are the requirement that you have a little bit of the person and you will tell you that you can tell you that you that you know the wide?
You know that it's not just in this particular in this room, a wall of the water in the room, and I was looking at the first time, and I was looking at the first time, and I was looking at the first time.
I was looking at the more and I thought about it and I was able to think about it.
Because the real is that if you go to the most important because you don't have to be able to be better at the bottom of the flow.
If you get the most important thing is that the possibility is that the most important forces of the deep of the corner of the deep of the corner.
You know, you have to be the deep and the required.
And so, it has to have a different different different level.
This is very much more like -- even though it would even be a slowing for us to us.
But the incial of a gene of the gene is a remarkable for a while, and it looks like a love, and it's a remarkable to be a remarkable.
Thank you very much.
