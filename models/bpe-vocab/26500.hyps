And the year we showed these two diassignment to demonstrate that the intree of the country that was the most of the last three million years of the last three million years of the last few hundred million years of marriage in 48 percent of the marriage of 400 percent of the size of 400 percent of it.
But this morning, the serious problem because it doesn't show the size of this specific issue.
The police is in a way that the heart of the climate that we bear the climate system.
She was extended to the extension and the contraction of the same.
The next slide that I'm going to show you going to show up about what happened to the next 25 years.
The peak is the marcage is marcled.
like you see the blue of blue dogs.
This is the anual anual for the lady of the time.
And it is the morning.
Asad guided the guy, with a thousand years or more than you can see that it's almost as the sea of a body of a body of a body of a body.
In 25 years of doing this at the same time, at this one.
This is a problem because the inquality of the desire of the ocean ocean's ocean.
where it is actually a massive amount of carbon oxygen that when it comes to define the meter, is transformed in the metaphor of micro-organisms.
Comparing with pollution of the pollution of global pollution in the atmosphere of the atmosphere can go to if we go to this extreme point in the extreme point of extreme thing is that we can go to this point in the atmosphere of the pollution of pollution of the pollution of the pollution of the pollulution of the pollution of the global pollution

In Himalaya, the third of the third thing that was going to get the new formats, you know, the new formats, that was in the way that was the guarding.
40 percent of the population of the world's population of the world of the water of the water of these all the water of these topier.
In a day, this guild is the surface of the water water for this year.
The fact were growing up.
But when it goes to the same way that it is happening.
In California was a 40-percent of the Sierr's Sierrra in Sierra.
This is affecting the water soul.
And predicting, as you read it is serious.
On the global global warming has taken a dramatic creative creature.
And the desire on the global warming has absolutely extraordinary rate with a conference.
four times more in the last 30 years in the past 30 years of the 75 years of the 75 anxious people.
This is an absolutely unusual model of it.
If you look in the history of you can see what happens.
In the last five years we have added 70 million tons of dioxide in every 24 hours of carbon dioxide every day in the ocean.
Up to the Pacific area of Pacific Pacific OOlympic of America, and every part of the Indian where the oxygen of the oxygen oxygen in the ocean.
The biggest because the global inquiry of global inquiring global warming, which is the present of the revenue of the fossil of the fossil of the fossil of the fossil of the fossil of the biggest one.
The peak is a problem and the cars is the most serious thing is the most serious one.
The United States is one of the two big emerging of China.
And it was going to build more factors for a good facility.
But we're starting to see a change.
This is the ones who have been assumed in the last few years with alternative alternative consistent.
There are all the political policy in our political country.
And the carbon industry and the oil industry has spent a billion dollars in the last year of a billion dollars in the last year of the end of the last year --
and the good forest is about what is a rich oil.
This is a picture of something about something that is about something that I was looking at it.
In the Cracial Cracial Tenness, a billion gallons of styles was imprastounished of the skin that was improud of Cracial Cracial Cracial Cracial Cracial Cracial Cracial Cracial Cracial Cracial Tennes
You've probably seen at the stir.
This is all the room, the second big deal. It happened in the presence of County, the Country County.
One of the great industry of the cards, about the Cracial Western Western was this.
Video: You know, â™« Frosy, the book is a blue page and you see it.
He is abundant abundance, and helping to make the economy.
Frosty, the gymy, it becomes more on the way of the more cleaning the more cleaning out.
He is also a lot of work and workers are removed the slopes.
Al Gore: This is the great source of Virginia.
The biggest on the biggest map of Massey is the Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenn: I want to be clear the Pelosi, Nanders, Fore, FPelosi, Harry Reihabar didn't know what I am going on.
Al Gore: So Aligentlone for the Climate Climate Climate has launched two campaigns.
This is one of them, one of them in one of them.
Video: Actor: At COALergy we see the climate change in our business change.
So our main is to spend a big money for the money for the public force of public forces that we want to help us show us about the book.
The point is not the goal is not dirty is not did.
We think it's curved -- and we think it's curved -- and you know,
So you won't get to the climate change for change for change.
You have this in the way we find it.
Video: The good news about it is a degree about it.
So let's make a tube in this chart of this cycle, of course, the cartoon the cartoons.
Woman! Masinaria is about noise.
But this is the sound of the technology of the technology of the book.
And as the good cars is one of the main the global causes of global inquiring technology of remarkable technology to change the whole thing that you see the whole thing that you can change everything that you can change all of the good news.
Look with this is about this is the technology today is about the covering of the good book.
Al Gore: In the final positive advice to the right thing about the right problem with national security and with nation-scale security.
Video: Narrator: The Mary economy, the nationality, economists, the crisis of the climate crisis.
The thing that they want to get all the dependent on all the carbon combat the bottom of the carbon on the basis of carbon on the bottom of the mountain.
But now we have a new solution to the novel solution to the incubic of the incities.
You can potentially take electricity to 100 percent of the power of 100 years ago, in a hundred years before.
A plan to put America to put it up to the third of the world and help us stop and help us to stop the global warming global warming.
In the end of the solution that is actually a big solution to help us solve our problems.
You can be American. You have a lot of it.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: It's about re-powered America.
One of the most faster of the fastest way to the old polymes of the old combat that our planet dirty dirty of our planet, is here Vicy, the Viitan Barby, a new remote of energy reduction.
Barble.2: We invest to create good jobs.
Narrator: Ropophets. It's time for action.
Al Gore: The race of African hour African who says, "If you want to go fast, you go fast, you go up right there?"
If you want to get back to the wide you going to get out of it.
We have to get back to it.
Thank you very much.
And the year at TED I did a introduction to LHCHC.
And we were promised to give a data about how it works.
So here is not about the ones who have not here in the biggest experiment, the biggest experiment, which was the biggest experiment, which was the biggest -- the 27 kilometers or is to create the consistent of a billion in a different fraction of a billion in a billion in a billion a seconds to a billion in a second.
It's extremely quirling.
This is the Genevely.
We do photographs of these minds of "Big Bang" in the decades.
I work on it. It is called the ATLS -- Lunged -- Lunged -- Lunged 22 meters of 22 meters of ATLATLS image.
On the 10 sediments we went out to the first time.
And this image was made of ATLATLAS --
He caused a great celebration in the control of the control of the control of the control of it.
It's a picture of the first piece of particle particle that has been looking at the LHCH.C, crying the LHC, crying with a part of LC in the HC of freshing in the HC of the HC of the HC is now detector.
In other words, when I saw that one of the 10 sediments that the device is a huge successful of functioning is a huge success.
I don't know if this was the biggest or the biggest or that, when someone went on on the paga Google and see it as the first page.
It means that we did a cultural impact on the street of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the cultural impact on a cultural impact on a cultural impact on a cultural impact on the street.
And then about a little bit of a problem with the device, which actually had to do with these days, that it actually had to do with these days.
Those are a transportation of a flaw of the power of the power of the massively functioning at the maximum of the power of the power of the power of the power of a little bit of a little bit of a few hundred thought-fund transportation of 13 thought-thousand-foot-fund fit as a matter of a couple of thousands of amperforming 13 thousands of amperses.
Now, the engineers in the back of these people are looking at these days, "can't transport." There are no no loth," I'm a song."
But I can do this because when they're at the temperatures become what the viruses are called the superconductor.
So in 271 degrees of the hospital, and more of the window can transport this is a box, that the box.
At one of the layers of the CHCHC, was a define of facility.
So the company has been a little bit of a little bit, and the 13 thousand-amperity resistant electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressive, as they are about 20 tunes over 20 ton, and they move over 20 ton, and they move beyond 30 cast.
So I was deeply about 50 magnetic math.
We had to take it to the end, which is what we would do.
I had reconvicted on the top, I repart.
And now we take magnetic magnetic in subterms.
Pn at the end of his marine Mars will be like new loud.
We will start with you again, and we have to get you in the unfortunate data in the world, and we'll continue to find out the tools that are the tools of the universe.
Now, of course, that in a way, those accident accident of the important accident about important and engineering the signal of the extremely unit is rejected.
I think that it is that it is attached to is that the fact that we have young young people like LHC. This is important experimenting as LHC.
And so I will go to a human scientist a scientist scientist Humphilans, who I think about the experiments that I think of the protected experiments of the protecting the protect the protection of the protection of our minds protect the human mind to previous progressively uncled for our minds are not finally finding our natural gareas, and as are not finishing our farming and as a mysterious and as a lot of our new cycle, and so our new things are not that we don't even more unge-like our unge-like natural disk in our own inkicymaccount."
Thank you.
I want to start with the rush of a child, when you play with the box, when you play with the box.
On the sursurface of them to get them to get them and take them to move them and take it to the disease, you actually invest the way to solve the problem, and you solve the waste and solving the welderly the back.
The hospitals is profoundly about how we understand a lot of the inconclue.
So in the way of doing this unlike IT inspired by this unit of our interactions with our physical objects -- impression, my physical objects -- impression, my Pator, and my college of Jewan Kalananan-en-en-en-en-the-the-computer computer computer that would be so much more digital smoker that we would be so much more about a computer that if we use to take a lot of information that we could have so much more information and ask for a lot of information to take to take to take to a lot of information to a computer to take a computer to screenemy with a computer to a computer to screenemerging with a computer to screenough, and so much more informed with a computer and then go avoid a computer and then go of this ungorphilosoption with a computer to treattempymatic
And so how do we want to now?
This question was about fascinating this is about fascinating as we were trying to figure out the Stttable to build Stttable to do it.
And in a short, Sttttable is a computer interactive computer interactive in a bism.
They can be manufactured, they can perceive the desire can perceive the way of other, and they have a screen and a radio of a wireless of the radio of a wireless of a wireless of a wireless of the frame.
The most important is that it's palpably palpably like the game, you can just get it as applied them as they just get them out of them.
And Sif, the Sisisisistic of a new tools of digital sending tools of digital sensory information of digital data from the digital process.
On the main the surface of these tools become more and more and more and more and more of the other side of the nutrition of the nutractions of our nutractive and desire new new new tools and funding new ways to interact with interaction.
I'm going to start with simple.
This Swedable is configuring out the video, and if you include the movie, it gives the movie state, if you include in the other side of the other part, they are going to go back to the other hands of the other hands of it.
These portraits are the ones that are the other side of each other.
So, if I put one to the langa lovely interesting thing.
If there are inconcluded and they can become a little conclusion.
And I can also feel the risk and inclinic.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of interacting is that we can use the data is that we can use the data to manipulate data, how we would be able to make a liquid of a liquid of a liquid of a liquid of the interactive of the interactive implications of the interactive implications of interacting with interactive actions of interacting with interactive action of interacting
In this case, we have three Switwitzerlands like the voice gas and can use it in the center in the center of the center in the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of this --
If we can get too long, we can get a little bit of back.
There are also interesting possible possible for education, as a vision of education, mathematics and logical logical logic and logical sense, and we want to see people who want to see the outcome.
So here I -- this is a little bit of a simple program that makes a simple program with a simple program that's a simple program that's very simple program.
This is a game game of the words of the words of the right combination between Scrabs and Boggles.
Basically, every one of the first one of the first Stttable, and the main every Sttet, and on the main the words, they are green with a dictionary, they are greenhouse gas a dictionary, and they are green with a dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds of a second where you get a new set of letters, and you have a new set of inccleaning and uncleaning and uncled.
Thank you.
These are the kids who came to the kids who came to the Media, and I went to try and figure out what to do and remote them and movie.
He wanted to die to crazy.
And one of the interesting thing about this kind of applied this kind of applied people to give them a lot of structure.
All you have to say is "Fellow Yet is right right now.
This is another cycles of people who are trying to get them to get them.
This is the most tangible testing of our right right in the right right in the right right in the right way.
It turns out that everything that wanted to do was to do one Swedding one of the other.
So for him were just a cuby.
This is a applied application.
We wanted to build a instrument for those who invest language.
And this is Frix.
He can introduce new persons in the stage, just a rubber of those Sweb Switwitness that they find their persons.
This is the soil is introducing the sound.
Video: The force of the race.
David Merrill: Now he introduced a tractor in the stage.
Video: The pigeon the portrayer.
Very y! Yes.
When Sttable and the Stttags and asthanks him to interact -- Video: Wow!
DM: It creates and your own narrative.
Video: Hor: Hello.
DM: It's a open-finite story with how it will be deeply to the food.
Video: The peak -- peak --
DM: The last example I was going to show you today is a device of created and interpretation and interpreted music and interpreted the role of the soil that we built the role of sounds like the role of soil, and all bad.
Each has four different variations of these different variations that you want to use it.
And you can get to a succession that kind of successful that kind of a poor you want.
The soil sounds the road of the soil of sounds of successful sounds.
There are some effects you can see the shape of the way that would be reverberal and the movie.
You can see a certain soil and then you include it and then including it to help it off.
They are about general effects like the truck that are applied in the Hungarian that you can see the His to see the His to see it.
Video: DM: We start with a riting rhythming in the second Switzerland, we have a serious serious serious expensive, more than a serious amount of desire.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: DM: Now adadd add a dangerous.
Video: And now I'm going to add the movie, to control the whole thing to control the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect.
Video: YM: And I can get the inclined inclined in the inclinic in a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of a part of it.
Video: Now I will take it to the bend of the band-to-to-to-to-to-to-power.
Video: YM: You can resecure in the long time.
So I don't have to do the planet, can improvise, improvise, and they can improvise, or a quote of the word.
Now, in the end of the Sweden that we can reach the Sweb using the Sweb camp by the volume of the volume of the volume of the frozen in the stages.
Thank you.
As you can see my passion is the creation is the creation of the computer that is really worried about how it works and our body that is functioning and our body of our brain and our body is working on our brain.
And today, we had time to show you a coordination of this new hope, and you know, the opportunity that we try to make it from the lab that I try to get out of the launched them from the launches that we had to go out of the lab.
The Gand's going to retiny is that we're at the free of this new generatory tools that will bring together to the interact with the interface of the rules that will bring information to our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of the rules of our rules of our rules of the rules of the rules of our digital rules that are going to make the new tools of the new instruments that they will bring of the new general
Thank you very much.
And these are the nervous to talk to you all of you to all of you and you all of you are.
I'm a writing one.
He described the book, but I think about it, but of course, more than that.
It's all my mother, and fascinating a life and fascinating a life of a life of a life of a life of it.
And I don't have this thing to do is going to change anything.
But this is a little bit of a little bit of a life of my career and in my book, which is my inner who released me to the work of work with work.
And the wrong thing is that I wrote this is that biography, this self-desire "Manancy, Roage," which is the Ragesteste," which is a big death and he became a very important thing that is the reason that is that motivated in a way that motivated signal sense, and it became this important sense, and it became this important thing that motivated to the International act.
The result is that the way that they go now, people are going to be convicted by the way,
Serio's not, I confussion, I was confussion.
Would you be able to get in the people who are telling you -- you don't have a question of -- don't you know, you want to stop the performance of performance performance that is going to be able to do that?
You don't have to write the whole thing to write your life on the third of the way to create a better book that you ever have a book that ever ever ever do it on the world that ever ever ever ever do?"
It's very linked to true.
But it was more likely to remember if you were not going to be able to do it as a 20 years ago, when I was a teenager, I wanted to become the writer, I wanted to become the same thing that I wanted to become the same thing on the same way that I had a kind of African reaction of the same same same way that I was not going to get the bottles.
And people were saying "You don't have a lot of you don't have any success?"
Do you don't know that the humility of the desire will reduce you to reach out your require?
You don't have the frames of your life in this field of life in this field of this field of here and not going to be a frog of of a dreamed of the flight of the flight of the flaw of the flag of the flag of the wild?"
Something that is the kind of thing.
The answer -- the answer is a short to all those questions is "Yes."
Yes, you feel the theme is the theme of all of these things.
And I always got to me.
And it's a lot of other things that people are not going to get the macrushs.
As an example of big algorithm that are cross;
But when it's about the work that I always thought about what I was in the last time I was like, "Why is it is "Where is "What are the most of the time I was "Who is "What is I was in the last thing I was talking about, what I was going to do about what I was going to do with what I was going to do with what I was going to do with what I was I really thinking, "What was I was I really wondering what I was "Where I was "What I really ask?"
Is this something ration?
It's the logic that anybody to be able to figure out that they feel like that they feel like the Pame.
And what is the specific initiatives that seems like the nelinic is really true of health is really in the support of health care about the health professional teachers don't do it?
My father was a chemical engineer and I don't remember as a chemical engineer that you have in the 40-year-old engineering is not asked anybody if you don't have a chemical.
It wasn't happening, what was going to happen with chemicalistic?
It's just not going to happen.
But as we are to be honesty by chemicalists as many groups of the reputation of the reputation of the manipulation of the manipulating of the manipulating manipulating the depression.
We write this reputation, we have this reputation, and not just writing in all the way of all the way that they have been a powerful reputting it as a great reputation to be a powerful reputting in the real real real time.
And we all have to look at the number of the number of dead, just in the 20th century, in the 20th century, in the 20th century, who died by the way they died by the way they died by the way of the people who died by the way of the way we have a range of the way we have to look at the same time.
And even that didn't have to be able to really get the own way of your own own own own own own own own destruction.
Norman Mailer, even before I was in the top of the interview, said that he said that he was a little cartoon me in the books of my book-lawyer has a little bit more and more of the book.
A great great great about a life of a life of a life of a life of a life.
But we don't have a clip when we hear anybody knows that because we heard this is because we heard this is that we have to have a lot of times and unacted and unconsciously uncomfortable, and the idea of the creative and the suffer, and it will always take it to the end of the way, and it will always take it to a sense of happen.
And the question I want to give you a lot of today is all of this is all the impact of this idea?
You can comfortable with it -- because of how it is it that the world -- I don't think about this is a little bit of the styles.
I think it's okay.
And I also think it's dangerous. And I don't want to see it in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage to make the artist to take the artist to take the artist to go ahead and think about it.
And I know about suffering -- in my situation -- I would be very dangerous for me to start to start with me to try and get the one of the neighborhood of this is a circumstance.
As a result of the tank, we just just have a 40 years of a year in a 40 years.
We may be able to go back to four decades.
And it's very likely to describe this moment of the end of this moment of work as a work of work that was the work of my work that came up with my last few daughter of my mind of the last book, right?
What would be going to say to the mention of those who are already the ones here is very likely to be the most successful of my existing is very much more successful of my hair.
Oh, Doame, what I had,
This is the kind of the kind of thing that could do anybody to go to the nine ine the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I mean to do it in continue this message that I love it.
And then, the question of the question of that?
And so I was south, after meditative I have to work now, I have to work now, to try to continue to try and make a kind of a biological construction, is by building protective production, right?
I had to find a way to find a way to go to to to a distant distant distant distant that I described and my absolutely writing that will be in the law that will be in what I wrote in what I was writing in what I was writing is.
And as we all looked in the last year in this year of the time, we started looking at the time, and I try to find other society to see other society to see other society to have better ideas about how to make people creativity, how to make people creative.
This is the scientist this is in Great and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Romerrow this scientist this is about the Great Romer's Romerrow this is about the Great Bomerry.
So you know, you get the circle.
But in Grecrecently, and Rom's Rome ancient Rome ancient is not that the human nature of the human human being in the human human being, right?
People thought that the creativity, was a spirit was a spirit that they were to go through a source of people in a source and ununderstood and ununderstood and ununderstood and ununderstood and ununderstood that the creature.
They were called these spirits of these spirits of creativity, the term of the term of "Ree" is "the terroris."
Socrimphase was a demon that he was a demon that the department of the department of the department of the department of the department of the department of the department of was immediate to be the immediate of the immediate was a department that he was a desire that was a demand that it was a demon the department that it has been a departner that the waste of the department of the department of that the depart
Romans were the same pared, but they were called the perform, the perform, the income --
What is great, because they don't think that a note as a genius was a special individual genius was a very strong.
They thought that a genius was a kind of magnitude that is a way of doing the wall of the way that Dobby, the Mobby, the journey that Dobby, the journey that the machine was a consistent of the work of the work of the work of work of work that the worker of work that the works, the result of the workers of the worker work.
Absoldiers -- this is really the distant thing that I was talking about -- that I was talking about that way to protect the results that protected the results of the worker works.
And all the world is that it has to work that is correcrecrecrecently, right?
So the artist was protected by some things, like this is protected by some kind of a lot of narrative?
If you have the work was strictors, you couldn't get the worth of the world that was all the way to go for the style of the round of that helped the trouble that helped it.
If you think about the work was critical, it wasn't completely income was completely wrong, right?
Everybody as the style was a bit ignorant ignorant.
So they looked at people in Vest creativity, for a long time.
Then he came up and he came up with a certain idea of a certain idea of main a very main and we put the man in the center of the universe, and the mysteries and the mysteries of the universe that first steps that first style to the debt.
It was the human beginning of human art, and the people started to create the creation of the creation of the individual creativity.
And for the first time in history of people started talking to one or others like the genius that is the genius in to a genius.
And I have to marriage, I think it was a huge error.
And you can see a simple person, a simple person, or it is actually the receptor, as it is actually the receptor, and the dynamic and the mystery and the mysterious of mysterious psyche is a little bit of a psychic emotional immersion of the fragile of the living in the fragile of the living in the street of the world.
It's like you have a little bit of the wife to get the wire.
It's just about incovering and deforms and reforms all these astonishes of these astonishes that are in the performance.
I think that the pressure of this is a little bit of an artist in the last 500 years of the past 500 years of the past 500 years.
And if it's true, I think about it is, what do we do we do now?
Can we do things different?
You can go back to the greater relationships between people and the mystery of relationships.
You can't be it.
Maybe we can't just stand to stand for 500 years of a rational thinker in a 200-minute talk.
And you may find that there are no question that would raise us to be absolutely assumptions that are actually connected to the theory of the people are present people in their projects around the design of the projects around the projects around the projects around the projects around the projects around the design of the design of the projects that are going to be able to get their projected projects in their projects.
You probably don't want to go to all of this idea.
But the question I want to put it is -- why don't I want to do it?
Why don't we think about that?
Because it has a lot of as we heard about anything else we've heard about anything else about looking at the expensive endance of creative process.
And for any of the one who was trying to create something -- basically to create something -- in fact, that doesn't always change the range of the one of the range of the same rational resisides.
And in fact, sometimes maybe it can actually go to the right paranleymal on the right paranleyal.
We had a little bit of the innight, where I met the American American Ruth Stone, who has been on the NSStone, who has been on the 90 years and that was the way that he was going to work on the waste of the room that when he was going to work on the room, and just felt like a poetry and get it out of the room.
The story was like a venture of the rist's sticks.
And it was a rooms of the room.
The symbol of income and as you can see the fish.
In that moment has a single thing that has a single thing that is about the applied as a applied like the applied of the applied of the one thing that is that the one thing that is that the point of the point of the one thing that is that the point of the one thing that was a single thing that I was doing is, and that is a single thing that is not a single thing, and that I was doing is a single thing about it is that we do and in a single single single single single one of the
And it goes to the housin to the house and the third of the housin and the idea of a map of map and a frow of the map of the map of the map of the math.
Sometimes it wasn't enough enough to be a lot of it and running and running and running and running out and running out in the house and the poem and the poems and the poemissions and the poet it goes around the room, and I read a different poets.
They were also in the way that -- and I will never look at this time -- moments -- moments -- moments that the story of the voice.
Although the driven, the mother, and the math, and the way it is the way it was just when the teaching was the way to the other person with the other person and the other man was going to get the other man and through the other man's one and through the other man,
By the code and the code and then the tragedy of the surface of the main the main the math.
So in the situation, the applied on the right applied and unless and unfortunately, from the first wording.
When I was hearing -- it's just the only thing about how my own creative process.
My design is not not limited to this -- I'm not driving this -- I'm not leading it.
I'm a catching that work that work in the way I work on the same day and transparency and go and transparency and go out and go out and go out and go out and go out and go out and go out and to go out and go on.
But even though I was like, in my good's not, and I was asking that phenomenon.
And I imagine that as I was as you can have been and many of you are.
And I had had the idea of a design of what they were able to do with a source that I don't know about a source.
And what are you going to do that?
And how do we should be able to report that we should be losing us to lose our minds, the right thing about the same thing we can help us remote to remote to remote our healthcare enough?
For me, the most relevant examples of our days, that we can do about how we can do is the musician that we can do a interview with the interviewer in the demand in the demand in the demand in the demand of course of the most of the time.
I was talking about the subject of this subject was about the contemporary artist was about the contemporary artist of China, what they started to control and see the credit and gestablished and gentlemen.
With the time it was linking out the story of the story of the story of the Middle Angelpes and then everything has changed.
As you drive a short age of a short living living in a piece of the pig that comes in minds that the earthquake and the magnitude and the arrives of the desire and it is not the ending, but it doesn't have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a living room.
It has no focus on the math, has no reporter reported report.
The fact is the one of the old that ecrights were in the "An on the Middle to the moment's base this for all of this for always always to work.
I'm not sure enough to revealing a lov."
And instead of looking in the shot, just just went out and it just stopped up.
He stopped the process and he did something with something that is all about it.
He was looking at the end of the end, and said, "You can't see that are at volaners are at volaners of the volaners of the volaners of the volaners of the cats of the cats of the end, and he was looking at the bottom of the way of doing it is a catch.
"Do you have to write a chance of a note?
If you want to really exist, you want to be in a moment of you can do with you.
If you don't get it and you get a different things.
Get and you get to the Leonard Cohen."
The truth process has changed the way of doing this.
It doesn't have to be able to continue to be able to be a single one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one another.
But the process of synthetic process, and it went around and it was in the moment that he took the mouth, and he was going to wear the same, and it only had to come back and forth to go back to the way to the city, and then it doesn't have to be something that has to be something that has to be something that was going to be able to be able to go through the city.
It could be collaboration and the bizarre, and the bizarre on a conversation between Tom and the exterior the external exteria, that was not just like Toman-man.
And then what I heard is the story of how I was working on a little bit of the way I was going to do a data.
This approach me when I was at the middle of "Manhancy, Roaged Swed," and I have in a way of doing it in a way that we all know when we work with something that we all know when we work with something that we hadn't ever thought about it was a disaster to think about a define that I never thought of it would be the most propose.
Not just about this, but the most proclever that he never ever shared it.
We just would think that we should just think about the project.
I remember all my time I was talking about the open-up and I tried to try and etc.
I went to see my way on to ethush and I got my commercial comments of the cameras in the rooms.
I said to vote with voting -- and you know, and I know that if this book is not going to be the amazing thing that is not going to be the great book is not just going to be the wrong thing to be the wrong thing to do,
Because you can see that I put one on the table to do it anymore.
So if you want to be better than you want to do the device and you can do the same thing you can do the same thing.
Okay, if you don't want to do that, you know, you know, to all of a naid with all of it.
And I'll tell you that I was going to write my message.
And I want to consign for this today that I did with my tren."
Because -- the Conclusion -- with hundreds of years ago, in the North African people get in North Africa, and they would be to get the wild to the wild muscles and the musical muscles that were redying in the war, the waste of the waste of the waste of the way they were looking for.
And there were always wondering, because dance was teaching and were teaching and were remarkable, right?
But sometimes the things happening, and one of the interpret of the communication of the community of the community.
I am you all know about what I mean about what you do is about what you think about in a certain point of interpretation.
It's like the time is the time and the dancers is through the portal state, often often often not doing anything differently, in the other 1,000 other 1,000 ser, all of the other 1,000 sers, all of the other 1,000 sers.
And in a time it doesn't have in the third of the desire of the people.
It's all the inside the bottom and the bottom is the air is the applied of the foundation.
And as I was as a thing that was the people who were saying to the number.
and they were the hands and they were able to get the "Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, Game, Gamming, Gamming, Gamn God's and and they were untains and they were undepressions and they were undetails and they were untains and they were ununtains and they were "layers and they were "layer to get
It's God's God's good.
A interesting amannounced -- when the main Spanish had invaded in Spania Spanish has been in the Spanish has been transformed over the "Wal" -- the Allah," and "Hello, Mr. Ohh All's, and yeah, and older, "Leain the wood, wood, and the wooden --
and they hear the time in the time of the debing with the skills and dancing and dancers and dying.
In Spania, when a interpret and a massive inter-re-magic and magic and a "Allah, mage, thlah, magnificent Allawyer Allaw, you know, the argues of the Spani's and in Spania, voiceld in Spania,
It is ununderstood -- a God's God's God's God's going to be a God's dying.
It's great, because we need that.
But the second one day is the second morning, when the dancers are going to be the consistent is the marriage of 11 in the morning is not a scale.
It's a diet that is also the genuines that are not going to go to the genomes and they may not be able to stop in the time.

It's hard.
It's one of the most painting of the most painting in life in life creation.
But maybe it doesn't have a big chance of if you don't think about it as a great part, as you know, as the most amazing parties are coming from the most extraordinary of your father.
Maybe if you just think about it was a proud of a source of a source of a source of a moment of time in the next few days, when it was data and when the moments, when they were more than the time.
If we think about it is all the beginning of change.
I started thinking and I was able to think about the last month of the last month of what will be published by this is going to be a confused and crisis to be able to think of my successful success.
And what we did is by doing when you lose the cloud of the cloud -- you know, it's not a the-the-the--the-the-the-the-the-the-ended when you get to do it, you know, why I was doing it in a little bit of doing,
It doesn't be the sell. You just just just go to the Continy the Continy to the Contin,

And with all of these "layer for you.
I think we should have to think that we should pretend to prevent them.
"Oh!" for you, you just because you have a loved loved loved for humanity, and the capital to participate in continuing.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We talked about some of these projections about the genome and what could be interested in predicting, and what could be interesting to discover of the genes.
Now we start with a new point of point: We are digitized, and now we're trying to start to start to start to start in this digital code and go into a new biology, and to go through the biology, and by looking for.
We all tried to put our time to put our questions in order to give us questions for us to the point of the time.
"What is life life that I think many biologists have tried to understand to understand different levels.
We tried different approaches, simplified life to the basic components of the basic components.
We already have about 20 years ago.
When we sequenced sequencing the humans of the human human biology in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world.
Now we're trying to ask question, can we regenerate new forces, or we can create new forces of life in this digital university of this digital universe of this digital universe of this digital universe is the digital universe of this digital universe of what is we want to ask for questions.
This is a little organism of a little organism that has a genome that has the most genome for a little genome that can replied the only one species that can replant to the only lab in the lab.
We tried to see if we can go to a genome and smaller genome and smaller people.
We were able to get the surgeon by a hundred genes of a gene of 500 that are there.
But when we look at his metabolic map is pretty simple, it's pretty simple, is a compared to us to our compared to us.
So that's what I think is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can get the first time to make a bit of a single cell phone.
So we decided that the only way is to be able to learn this crosis, we can see this crose, so that we can see the equipment of the most fundamental components to add some of the most fundamental questions.
And so we started on the room, "Can we have a cross-cross-gray cross?"
Can you allow the chemistry allows these molecules that we never did before,
And if we can do a cross-cross-cross-?
A crosis a crosis just a chemical piece of chemical material.
So, our speed to digital life has been a ritself to a rit-up ritself to exponentially.
Our ability to describe the genetic code that they move pretty much more and more grown up.
The last time he went to a confy of exponentially.
I started this is about 15 years ago.
We went through a few dogs, actually, with a bio-et-et-et-et-et-et-et-based experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make little DNA that are doing little bit of DNA to 50 letter 30 to 50 letter, so it's a generative process, so what you build a long piece of a long piece of the car that you build a little bit more error.
So we had to create a new way to put these little dots together and correct all of the errors.
This was our first tentative, portrait from digital information from the digital information of Ph.D. . Ci 24.
It's a virus that human omobacteria.
We did the design of the skills, we went through right right through the right of the DNA with a molecule DNA by about 5,000 little.
The interesting thing that I took this piece of chemical material, and we put it in bacterial material, and we put it in bacteria, and the bacterium has been to read this genetic code of the virus of the virus of the virus of the virus that the boat that the virus that the whole whole whole whole whole bunch of chemicals that I took this piece of this piece of chemical material, and we got this piece of chemical material, and
The viral virus were then released from the cells and they went back and went back and forth of E.
I was going to see the oil industry and they said that I understand that this model.
They were laughing more than you are.
And so we think this is a situation where the software can build their own mad's own madis in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the entire cross of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 guns of genetic code.
So we said to put the walls of the streets in the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of a cell cell that are the size of a cell cell phone.
And the design is critical, and if you start with digital information from the computer to the computer has to be very accurate.
When I was sequenced this first time in 1995, the standard standards in 1995, the standard standards at 10,000 walls of the rules of the basic basis of the basis of the basic basic basic basic basis of the first time of the genome we sequence in 1995, the first genome in 1995, the standards in 1995, I was in 1995, I was a standard.
We found it in the reference, 30 to the erroric itself of the original original century, that would never be activated.
The design is designed by designing is designing by the 50 gas has to be a little bit of a little bit of a little byards to build more and more and more small units to build some little little bit more small stages.
We are able to make tools.
You may read that we have put "waters" in the homework in the hometoo: We have a genetic code in four letter: The four letter: The T.M, and T.
Trike up in those letters, those letters -- those surrounding coffee -- a literally literally literally acide every voice of a literature of acid.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, the proposition, food.
And the point of all we did was to hear the code of the code.
Some were undeadly ununfold that it's not poetry and out.
We designed those joined so that we can define was with enzymes.
I'm going to repair and they are all going to be anyone and everything.
So we started doing the joint, start with five to seven to seven to 7,000 letters, waiting to do it in these little bit, and then put it in these little little bit, and then put it in the way to 7,000.
And every single one of the husband of these joines in the abundant to sequence them can make a very cool of a very robust process.
We try to get to get to that the automatized.
So, this is a basket of basket.
When we get to the very large market, over 100,000 walls of the walls of the wall of the way to E..
It is all the modern molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecule.
So we were going to get to other hanisms.
We knew that there is a mechanism called recombination of the biology that is used to recombines to recombining DNA that is useful DNA that is also a lot of joint.
This is a example.
There's a organism called Deinococcus that can be the radio of radio race of radiation that can be the radiation of radiation.
As you can see in the cross of the cross-frozen is frozen in the joint.
12 hours to 24 hours later, he put it in the back of the lawyer as was at the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms, we can do that.
These organisms, these organisms.
I can live in life in life.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the extreating space in the extreatment of the extreatment of a new environment of the environment of the environment of the environment of the environment of the environment of the life can be treated,
In fact, NASA showed that this is happening.
This is a micrograph that we built with a molecule that we built these procle -- actually using the food -- actually using the design of the design of the design of the skin that we put in the design of that we put in the market.
Drojjjan automatically set up to the automatically automatically automatically automatically put them together in it.
This is not a microscope with electronics, but only a micro-to-to-micrographic to-micrographic to.
It's so much larger molecule that we can see a microscope with a microscope with a microscope of a microscope of a microscope of a microscope of a microscope of a microscope with a microscope with a microscope with a microscope with a microscope with a microscope with a microscope with a mic
These are collected images of about about six seconds of about six seconds.
This is a public that we had a little bit of time.
These are over 58,000 feet of genetic code genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule made by people, with a definition of definition.
It has a molecular molecular molecular molecular over 300 million of a million of million.
If we get a foundation of 10 and no space and no space in the 142 pages to recognize this genetic code --
So, how do we start a cross-cross-gray cross-it?
And I was a virus is pretty easy to be a virus is pretty easy to do.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
Estate, more easy when you get to the euck, you can just take the nuclear nuclear nuclear and put it on the other things that you all heard -- cloning -- clones.
With the bacterial bacterial bacteria, is integrated in the cells, but we showed that we can do a completely transplant to a completely completely completely transplant to a single crosis to a cell to be able to active, and we can activate it.
We had a crossed of one of the microbial species.
These are about as as people and so much as people and the people and the way that people and the way it is.
We added a few genes in a long gene for this cross-gene cross--cross--cross--ended up to this crossed a few genes of the crossed of a few genes of gene gene in a few genes of genes in a few genes in the full of gene gene gene in this cross in a gene of gene gene gene gene to this crosis to be able to make
I had desided with the enzymes to the use.
And it was pretty amazing when we put in the cell phone -- you will put it into our very sophisticated -- and the cross of the cell -- and the cross of the cells end.
In fact, we thought this is as far as far as we went to go and try to design the process of something more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more than we were trying to do it is how we were going to go through the design process.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We all kinds of species that have been able to get a second crosis, or a third of the tree, or a third of the other new characteristics of new new characteristics of new characteristics of new characteristics of new characteristics of a second.
So those who think about evolution just as a single gene of change in biology have lost a long time in biology.
I'm called enzymes, called the DNA restriction that were actually desire of DNA.
The novelist that was in the cell that was not a one.
The crosis -- the cross-on that we put --
It was expressed and recognized the other cross of the cross of the street, and so we went with the crosis to only the new cross of the crosis.
It became blue of genes that we put in the cross-ended in crome.
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristics of a species have lost and converted a new species on a new spectrum that we put in the cell that we put in the cell.
All the proteins were changing, membranes were changing, the membranes -- when we do is exactly what we do is the genetic code of the genetic code of the protein that we were able to do is the profly of proteins were changing,
This can sound like al-genome, but we can also move the software of DNA to change the DNA that are pretty dramatically dramatically change things pretty much of the dramatically soon as we can die as a dramatic chemistry as a dramatic chemistry as a genome,
Now, I suppose that is not genuine -- but a half billion years and a half years and a half years and we support that we can actually get a new version of the website that has a new version of the Cambridge Cambridge on the digital project, which has a new specific design of digital project.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obviously obviously about the need to be nearly nearly nearly to have a needs.
We're on a way to go from six billion people around 40 years of people around 40 years.
And to put this in context for me in the context for me in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet, for every one of us there in 1946, in 40 years, will be four.
We have a hint issue of sea and services, drug-free issues, commitment to the tree and a half billion and a half billion and a half of the six billion and a half of the forest.
It will be difficult to do for new.
We use over five billion tons of books -- more than 30 billion bars of the oil bars of oil oil oil oil bills of oil oil oil in the oil of oil is.
This is a hundred million bars per day.
When we try to think about to think about profoundly biological or any process that will be a challenge.
Then, of course, is all that CO2 at this material, which is actually going to go to the atmosphere.
Now, from our discovery of our world, we have a data data data with over 20 million genes, and I like to think about these design components as a component of design of the design of the design of the future.
The electronics has only one of the electronics has only a double-component, and this is the diversity that has been out of this.
We're limited here in the first biological reality and the imagination and the imagination and the imagination.
We now have these techniques now are the very quickly of these ways to make what we call the genic genicycle genic combined.
We have the ability to build a big robot that make a big cross that make a million cross on a day.
When you think about to process these 20 million genes of gene gene 20 million genes to try to make the check proctical to produce the pharmaceutical products that we can change more biology than the last 20 years, we can change more biology than the last 20 years, all the science.
And this is just a standard selection of standard.
We can select for viable to connect chemical substance or fuels, producing production and citizens of vaccines, the citizens.
This is a design of an ecology of a design of design that we work and work in order to expect to work with these species in the computer in the computer in the computer of these species in the computer
You know, we don't know how it will show you.
We know exactly how their genetic code is their genetic code.
Now we focus on our combat to fourth generation.
You've seen that from the porumb is just a needle is just a needle of it.
We have the second generation of the generation of the third generation that are going to be able to get pretty soon as a lot of values that are often often often often as the occupipied or different types of button.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact on the food and the food cost of food and the fall of their limited and the CO2 as CO2 as CO2 as we start with CO2 is to design the cells to design the next few decade of the generation of the generation of the generation of the next month.
The solar and CO2 is a way of the way -- but in our discovery of our world, but in the world around the world around the world around the world have all sorts of other way we have all sorts of other way we have all sorts of the world have all sorts and CO2 is a solar and CO2 is a way of CO2 is a way of the O2 is a way of our world we have a way of our world is we have all the way we have all sorts of our world.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It goes into the ocean ocean ocean's ocean's oceans, and half a half a million in deep temperature, at the temperatures of the farms.
Transform CO2 in metan used molecular molecular molecular that surgery as a source of energy as a source of energy as a source of energy that surgery CO2 S2 ransentic form of CO2 S2 ransends CO2 S2 in O2 metan immersive molecular male in the CO2 in O2 in the CO2 in the O2 in 22 in the O2 in the O2 in 22 in the O2 in 22 in the energy of the O2 in 22 in the O2
We try to see if we can take CO2 captured, which can be transported in the country, and converted that CO2 to the CO2 to the CO2 to the base in the combat that the produce.
So in a short period of time, we think we could have the question of what is the basic question, "What is the life is life that is life is life life that is life is life that is life is life that is life is the worth of a short periphery of time, we think we could have a short period of time, we think we could have a lot of time we think we could have a lot of what is the question is we can we get out of what is the question,
We really know -- we have a chemical model, you know, the whole industry of the chemical industry.
Yes, if you can't do this at TED, where else in other parties?
Let me become a major source of energy.
But we also work now now to use these same source surveilled by vaccines immediately.
You see this year with the botpy, we're always a dollar in the minus and a dollar in mind when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think the situation can be changed by building vaccines that we have a combined vaccines of any of the before.
This is how it could go back to the future change the future of evolution now is the evolution of evolution, accelerating evolution, and the theater, and finally, the income and finite of the bacterial bacteria.
We're just going to improve people.
Our conference is just to make sure that we have a lot of a long way to survive pretty much long, thank you very much more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more than we can do this. Thank you so much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much longer.
And what I want to show you more quickly, is a fundamental work that I added up with Microsoft as a part of Microsoft as a part of a year. This is a year. This is a year. This is a year. This is a year.
It's a average that can interacact with a lot of vision that is a big amount of visual data from visual data.
We now look at a lot of digital -- many gigabs and subject on the digital and the saming through this and rearguing it by this rearranging anywhere in this room.
It doesn't matter how much information is the initiatives of the big data is these colors are the images of the images.
Most of the people are made with a common digital camera in the U.K., but this is a scanning scanning of the Big is a fly of the Big Blesels.
It doesn't have important important because the only thing that should limb is the number of your skin is the number of your skin of your monitoring monitoring on a very fly through a very fly of a very flexible.
This is a book of a book that is a nonimaginative example of a nonimaginative example.
It's about "Chan Hungarian is a colored colored capita is a is a capital.
To show you that it's about text, and not a imagine, and not a imagination, we can actually do something that is a real represent a text; it's not a position of a text; it's not a positive text; it's a pose.
This is a artificial way to read a book in the electronic book in form.
I wouldn't want to recommend it.
This is a more real. It's a "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian of a husband is a word.
Each one is the beginning of a second.
This is really a piece of a piece of experience of a loyal experience, or a revia or a revia or a revia a multi-dimensional environment.
We also did something little with a little bit of this number of the Wardian of "Gardian of Gardian of "Gardian of the Gardian of the Gardian and we did a little little little little little bit of our small small small small small small little little little bit of our colleagues with this little little little little bit of the world in "Gardian of this number of the number of the number of the Hunlist of this number of "Gardian of the number of the number of the number of the number of the
We created a false reclaim to a very large resolution -- and we got a common clear -- and we release a common conclusion.
If you want to see the properties of this car, you can see here.
Or other models, or even more techniques of technical specifically
And this is really through some ideas, the expensively round of a monitor.
We hope that this is to be able to endynamics and other people and other people and other people are not necessary.
Of course, the mapping is one of the things that are for a kind of kind of like this.
I won't say a lot of time on this, but just to tell you that we have contributed to this field of contributed to this field.
These are all the way in the United States suffer on a ge-scale of NASA.
Let's go to a bit about something else.
This is actually active on the Internet, you can see green it.
This is a project called Photosynth, which is a different technologies of different technologies. Some of them is Sealoung and the other other scientific paper in the perception of the visual perception of the universe in Washnarroads of of Washon Sex is a very cool.
and Rick Szeliski at Cer's Cer's Researt. A very beautiful college.
So this is active on the Internet.
You can see that when we create this kind of perspective, when we can not have this kind of imaging through images of imaging in many ways.
But the space of the space of these images of these images that really matter.
Algerian visual vision of these images have recorded these images, so that to rear space where these things are doing with the Grassment of the Grassment of Canadian and the Grassment of the Canadian projection here are the signal projections of a projection of a projection of a space of space.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There are some that have a lot more space of space.
I'd like to go to one of the original rights of Noah -- this is a part of the Photter -- that I worked in a vast way that I worked in the way that I think is that the pioneering of this technology, the GPhotosynnnine of this technology, we have just a little bit of vision.
We had to care about the layer of the things that are layer.

BAA: Yeah. What does is really to look like.
It creates hyper-per-based hyper-to-to-time.
And it does it based on the consistent of the image.
And this is going to be reading when you think about the significant information that have these images that have these images.
As you do a little bit of imaging imaging on the Internet, and you can take some words, and the text on the Internet, and the Internet gives a lot of information about what is the pose.
Now, what would be the connection to all the connection to all the pictures of all the picture?
And then the amount of interconnection and the disease that is the weight of this is where the classrooms of the country. It's a classrooms.
CA: Blaise, is quite incredible. Felich.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of the intense journey and one of the research research research is that the scientific is to live in the old people who don't look at the old man who don't feel the last few of the old boxes that they still feel the past, and they still feel in the room, and it was in the rooms of the planet.

The consequence of a certain set of decision-makers that our ancestors were to do with their own generations, and with many generations in the next generation.
And of course, we all shared the same adaptive and imperative adaptive and imperative
We all are born borders. We all bring children on the world.
Those are about the initial rituals.
We have to do the separation of the whole whole thing that we should be surprised that we should all have a surprising that all the song we all have a little art.
But what is interesting is that the unit is the same, the rhythm of the rhythm in every cultural in every culture.
This is that the Penn Borne's tribes from Borneo, or the Voododoo in Haiti, or the war in the north Kauna Curander, the Kauna Curanderander's Curano in the middle of the Sahara meeting of Sahara.
By this is the guy that I had traveling a month, or even a month, or even a long hill, the Quensions of the Queen of the CEveils of the world.
All of these people are learn that there are other ways to think about fly of thinking about other ways to think about the Earth to think about the Earth in the Earth.
And this idea, if you think about hope, maybe not to get you to play the hope.
Now, the miridge of the world with the spirit of the world is form of spiral life that rooms and cultural health cooking as a significant network like the biological network as a biosphorus as a biosphorus as a biosphorus in the biological culture.
And you could think about this retied network as being the ethnosphere and you could define, and you could definely defend up with all of the dreams, my idea, artists had to be the human imagining the human imagination of the conscience.
Etnosphere of humanity.
It's the symbol, and it's the symbol, and everything we can be like a surprising spectrum of iscoding.
And as the biosphere was the heroe, and so maybe and the nosphere, and maybe a much larger scale.
For example, no one of the most of the human beings that half or more of all the species, and more of the species of the excaught of the excuse -- and yet it is not true, and yet this is not true, and yet this stage of biological biological field -- the most optimistic in the field of what we know in the context in the way we know the most optimistic in the context of the cultural diversity.

A language is a spinal nurses of human spirit of human spirit of human spirits.
It's the vehicle that the surgent of particle particle has come to be in material.
Every language is a old language, a lot of mind, a basic based on the receptor, a corner, a consistency.
And from those 6,000 languages, how we are now here in Monterey, a half of them are not the opposite of the kids.
There's no more learning, what it means is actually what it means is actually changing something, that they are already going to be mountains are mountains of mobile things.
What can be more likely to be able to be the last line, to be the last few of the most of you want to talk about your language, not have the way to prevent the way to prevent the wisdom of the kids or the truth of the kids that are going to be the same thing that you want to be the same thing that you can be able to be the same thing that you can be the last night?
And yet, that soon a little bit of a little bit of the Earth is actually where the Earth is about every two weeks because every two weeks ago, a little old old old old old old old languages.
And I know that some of you would say, "Well would be there anyone else would be better?
It would not be better at a better place. And I all talk about one language? And I said, "Grozavo language, that will be the Cantonewelf. Or it would be Cantoneously.
Or to be Kogi."

The Docchopping all the Western society of Western industry.
And this doctor, it was like this. If we are interested in a good way to maximize the right level, the way of the good news is to do is to do a massive amount of freedom.

And because if people are free then people are free and individual and make things that are going to make things that are going to make our good decisions and our understanding of our place in our places.
The only to maximize the freedom.
The more people have to have the more choice, and the more freedom of the freedom of freedom and more freedom of the more freedom of the more freedom of the more and more of the more of the way they were more coming.

It has these advanced advantage and these risks.
By has these advances and these risks. What do you want to do that?
And you say, "Dock," what do you do?" And the doctor has these advantaged these advantages and the risks and the risks and the risks and the risks and the risks and the risks of these things are the risks.
What do you want to do?
And you say, "But if you were in my place, what would you do with you?" And the doctor says, "But I'm not in your place is -- I say "You know, the patient." And the result is -- I tell you a bit about what a good thing.
But what is actually a transition of responsibility and decisions and decisions about somebody who knows something -- in this case -- in the case -- in this case -- one of the doctor, and it's almost not sure and the best form of the best form of the choice -- in the patient.
There's a huge level of public public health for medicine to the medical medical medical debate and as I think about it, if you think about it, it has no love, that if you don't buy it.
Why is it reveal to the audience if we don't have any of the public if we don't buy them in it?
The answer is that the people who do this is expecting the doctors in the morning of the morning, and to change our next morning, and to change our networks.
Something that our identity has become a problem now has become a role of choice, and this transition of the role of explaining this.
And that we don't want a identity of a identity of a invention of a invention.
And we can reinvest to reinvent any of us we have a check of us as we have a check.
And this means that every day when you go to the way you have to try to figure out what it looks like.
With all the desire for the truck of the contains of the ones that the pig that the pig was that the pig was that you have to get the kids as much as it gets to have children as much fast.
The only one was a little bit of a while, not when you do it after it.
In our days, we everything is very close to the food.
I give you incredibly smart students and give them to 20 percent of the things that I was doing more than I did it.
And this is not a little bit more desire and not because it would be less maps.
Do you think about the things that are the questions that we should be able to do with the questions that we should do it or not? Do we have to do it or not? Do we have to do it or not? Do we have to do with all kinds of questions that are supported to all sorts of the way of the questions that we have to do with all kinds of questions that we would be able to do with all sorrying the
Do I should have to go back lat? Do we have to receive the children, or a cartoon? All the question that consumption that consumption you have to do it.
And they will answer to these questions, no matter if that means to not to do all the things that they want to do and not take a good note to the base of my jobs.
And this also has to do it. These are important questions that we have to answer them.
Most of the wind -- we're blending and Carl and Carl and Carl and the Carl to work every mind, every mind, in any of the planet -- less than the Hotels -- less than the Hotel's Randphenomenon of the Walpha Randolphenomenon of the Wal-French and the Carl and and the Pandolyan and the Carl to the Candol
By -- there is a corner of a color, that I didn't want to reveal out of the wirelessly to the wireless of the wirelessly.
I don't tell you about it because I want to use it.
So this is that this incredible incredible freedom to choose with workers, is that we have to take a decision, and we have to take a decision, and you should not work and we should work with them.
We can go to see how our foforest and we can go and have the mobile in a buzzzypes and Blackberrype and the laptop, and the laptop, and the laptop, and the laptop.
And if all are closed every mind, where we look at the way that we look at the football is a bball, what is we should respond to this else?
Do you have to answer this email? Do we have to write this letter?" And if the answer is "no," and if the answer is "not that the question of your bank account of your little bybits of how it would be a different way of how it would be a different way of how it would be a different way of how it would be a lot of what would be it was completely different.
So in the origin and little things that are also the things that are the style of life, life is a little bit of options.
And the world that we were living in a bit like this.
And as I was like, we had some choices that we did not have a matter of option.
And the world that we live now looks like this.
And the question is, is it or or revenue?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what I'm going to be good at this, so I will talk about what is going to be safe of what is going on.
All these choices have two types of things that are negative effects on people.
One of the effective effective, is that it produces is that it is that it is actually release than release.
With so many options that can choose to choose people are very difficult to choose for something that is very difficult for something to be able to do something for something like something that is very difficult for something.
I would give you a very significant example of the investment of privacy in the privacy of privacy of privacy in the private of privacy of the privacy of the privacy of the privacy of the privacy of the investment of you in a very significant example of you in a very significant example.
A colleague had access to the data of the investment of the investment of the investment of the foundation of the foundation that has about 2,000 sees that has about 2,000 sees.
And what he learned is that for every 10 foundations that will be the hidden to the employees of participants in the rate with two properly produced two properly produces of the properly one percent of the properly 10 founds.
50 foundations -- they just describe 10 percent -- they described with 10 percent less you get more and more than if you give you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the sky. Why?
Because 50 foundations of mountains between who are going to choose you to choose you to choose what you want to choose the way you want to choose and so a lawyer and so on.
And then on the room, and then and then on the room, and then the fun and the unit all the way on the road, and of course, it doesn't see.
You can see that it doesn't just mean that they will only take the consumption of the food after many of them are not to put it in the pensive, that means that the intervention is so hard that it is that the way that the intervention is so hard to make the big compensants that would be able to engage that they would get to the engagement that would be engaged to the engage that would be the engaged to the engage that would be the engage that they would be used to the engage that they would be the engage to the consumption of the consumption of
We were looking at the bottom of the left-hand is until 5,000 dollars a year from the employees that would take a lot of happiness of compenses.
So the credit is a consequence when you have too many options.
And I think that does that make the world like this.
You really want to take a good choice if it's for all the ethernity, right?
You don't want to choose to choose or not even the wrong thing to say.
So this is a second is that we can also do it for the strength of the station of the choice and make a little choice to be less satisfy to be less satisfied with the outside.
And there are some reason for that.
One of them is that we had a lot of snoses for a lot of that to choose if you look at one and it's not the right -- and you know, what is the perfect -- and the wife that is the right thing to say?
It's going to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better choice. And what happens is that the alternative that is that the alternative that is that the voice you can imagine that you have to imagine that you have to imagine that you have to imagine that you really have a good decision-making decision-making decision.
The more you have a little option, the more options, the more you want to regret with the option that you have a way that you have other-novel that you have otherwise you have a little bit of the option that you have a lot of options,
Secondly, what economists call it cost cost cost cost cost cost cost of opportunity.
Dan Gilber demonstrated in this morning, talking about how we evaluate about how we can compare things that we compare things that we compare to compare to what we compare them.
Well, when I'm a lot of alternative to have a lot of alternative is to imagine the potential of alternative characteristics that are going to be a little bit of alternative that you break it up less satisfy that you have a little bit of alternative that you have a little bit of alternative that you have a little bit of alternative that you have a little bit of alternative to imagine that you have a little bit of alternative to imagine that you have a little bit of the potential
Here's an example. I assume that there are no New York City.
But here's how should be able to raise it.
We have this is about Hampions.
A very expensive properties.
You get a superbit. They have a wonderful day and they have all of them.
What could they want to want to want to want to think about the drinking -- it's aughter: It's aughter.
All of my neighborhood in Manhattan are helps.
I could just like in front of the office." And what was going to do two weeks of the idea that the rats of the idea that the same.
The news news news is that we have in the village that we have on the election that we have a choice is even the except of the choice is except for what we choose is except is except of the news is that we are actually going to get on the streets of opportunity to get to the village of the satisfaction that we have in the village we have in the village that we have a choice.
And the more options of the options of the options of the same characteristics of these options will be perceived as we were perceiving the opportunity of us as a opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon a lot of things.
And he says that we should be living in the lack and maybe we should be able to do things even lower and we should do things even get more slow.
But one of the things that tell you is that anyone who is that you want to do not do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of the people can have a lot of the people are going to do what you do you do what you do you do what you do you do about what you do you do what you do you do what you do you know about what you do you can have a lot of things can have a lot of things can have a lot of things can have a lot of things that are able to have a lot of things that are doing you doing you do what you do you do what you do you do what you're doing is doing is going to do what you do the right right right
Third to the end of expectancy expectations.
This was when I wanted to replace my bluegies.
Port about all the time.
And there was a single one that the people who were a single one and you buy them and buy them as a crack, and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you had to get it and if you had to stay and they were starting to stay more and more than it was going to stay more and more and more than it was going to stay and safety and they were starting to stay and safe.
So I went to my blueprint after I had to go out of the old ones and I said, "Look, I want to say, "Look, I want to ask the base of my wall, I want to have a little bit, and the windows of my beet?
Do you want to have a nasty or with fertilizers or your farm?
Do you want to be the notion of the nothing?
You want to eventually eventually, you want to get the bank and -- not fine.
He painted his face and he said, "We want to come up with the guy who was the only guy who was the only guy who was not a idea that I spent a city that I spent all the wall of the wall of the wall and I went out of the walls -- and I went out of the right thing -- the truth that was the right thing about the right thing about the right right of the right now I had the right of the right I had the right of all over the way we had the right of all over the way of all of the right --
We have better good. All these options have done to choose to choose more well.
But I was feeling more worried.
Why? I wrote a book in which I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt more worried about is that we had all these options of these options about how I should be a wall of these things have grown to be a wall has been raised by the good enemy had grown to be a good wild of what I was going to feel the more of the way I felt worried about how I was going to feel that was that I was going to feel like to be a good options about how to be a good options of these options of these options of these options of these options about how to be a wision.
I had very close expectance. We didn't have a huge expectancy of when they were a single way.
Now now I'm 100 surged by 100 sisters, my mother, one of them has to be perfect.
And what we did was good, but not perfectly perfectly not.
So we compare what we were able to expect what we expect is that we were deadly dealing with what we were hopeled in the comparison with what we were hopeled in what we were hopeled to do with what we were hopeled to be what we were looking at what we expected with what we expected with what we expected with what we expanding is that we were actually re
The option of options in the lives of people can't do something else to make expectations that people have to make the expectations of how people have to be those options.
And it will take this into a little bit more satisfaction that even if they get good results are doing good result.
Nobody in the marketing world doesn't know that.
Because if you knew what I would never have idea about what I am I going to talk about.
This is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was worse when it was worse is the more that when people were actually more likely to be able to experience the people to experience the source of source.
Today, the world where we live -- we live -- of course, the industry and we look at the right -- the best thing that you can expect -- the best thing that you can hope that things will be so good that the things that will be so good you can see how it would be so good to be.
You never have surprised because of the expectations and my expectations and my way to try to try and figure out the way to try and try to try and figure out the way to be a surprise.
The real real real happiness -- for this is all the happiness of happiness is to expect to expect to expect to expect to expect to expand of the real thing.
I want to say -- just a short time -- that we actually have a lovely lovely simple and it's really really really really wonderful goods.
I couldn't find something better and I could not have one. I had no idea before.
But let's expect to expect to be so unfortunately not necessarily
And finally, a consequence of a bubble of a wall that you can't buy a single one one is that you can't buy a single one one as you can't buy why you can't see why that is it is clear why that is the answer is clear why that is clear the answer.
Would you be able to come up with it?
When are there are hundreds of different styles and disappointed to one that you get a little bit of a whip that is the door you ask the what?
It's just like the answer to the question that answer,
You could have to choose better choice.
With a hundred different waves of the choice of choice to choose to the choice.
So when people take decisions, even if people make decisions are good to make sure that the choices are good enough, they are all sorts of them, they are all going to be able to see them.
The press of erupon the final industry in the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not only important -- not the only important thing to do is that the erupper synthetics, is that people have have been disappointed to the standards that are very high startles.
And when you have to explain these experiences are coming out of these experiences are coming out of it.
So the general result is that we have a better object and we feel better.
So let me remind you to remind you to remind you.
This is the doctrina, which is that we all think is really true and it's in the whole bunch of the whole by. It's not true. It's not true.
Without a few choices that you have a few choices more choices than no matter of choices are better than the best choices are better than the best of you.
There's a magical. I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty sure that we have been able to think about that the choice of life that the choice of life.
Now, the idea -- almost we went out -- the idea of release that is this.
What allows to allow all of these choices in the society is good material.
There are a lot of places in the world and we heard about some of them is not that they have too many options.
The problem is that they have too puzzzle.
So the thing about talking about is a strange problem of Western society and rich society and rich and rich of the Wal-rich thing about it.
And what is frustrating is this: Steve Levitt talks about how these car chairs for children and hard to get the kids to exist and hard to make it a little bit of a little bit of a gent.
And what I say is that these options, and you can just make it a bit of a not only help.
They really have a pathway of path.
They really do even make us feel more worse.
If something that allows us to make it in our society that we do all the choices that we do would be transferred in the society that people have too much more than the people who have been improved the lives of the same thing that would be improved.
This is what economists call the POto.
The desire will be better to do better than people -- not only have to be the poor people -- because of the way that this exexcess of choices that is the excess of choices that we are enjoyable.
In conclusion. With this characteristics and being a person that you can say, "Wo! What do you know is the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fishers? What is you know?
You know that nothing is possible in this active active active active of the world -- so I read it and I read it and the first time I read it and the first time I read it and the first time.
But I thought more about it to think more about it with it as I was to think that the fish knows something something that I had.
Because the truth is that if you are willing to be possible, you don't have the freedom of the freedom of the desire.
If you are the active active active that is possible to think about the satisfaction in the village.
You think about the credit and score and scale.
Anyone needs a timeline of acquise.
This is almost too limited -- probably even for a fishing for us to be safe for us.
But the absence of a metaphor is a reetter of a red, disaster and printer.
Thank you very much.
