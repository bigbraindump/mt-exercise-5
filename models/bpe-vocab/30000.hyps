The year we were shown these two diamone; to the third of the polar that the main polar that the main of the last three million years was the size of the main was a small size of the march of the march of the march of the march of the march of the mayor in the map.
But this mornity is the serious problem because it doesn't look at the size of the size of the fossil of the size of the size of the size of the cosmic midges of this mornity of the mornity of this mornity of this mornity of the problem of this specific issue of the specific issue because it doesn't look at the specific issue because it doesn't look at the r
The polar polar is in a way, the heart of the climate of the climate system.
She is extend to the fall of the flow.
The next thing that I will show you a little bit of a slide will be a little bit of the last 25 years.

And the disasters have been on the whole global rate with a whole range of the world and the fall of the time.
four times more of the last 30 years of the 75 years of the 75 anteriors.
This is a completely unsustainable model of it.
If you look at the context you can see what happens.

This picture of something about something like this.
The previous Cracial Cracial Cracial gallons of gallons of gallons was imprast.
You can see the stirony.
This is, the whole thing about your clothes, the second big deal. It happened to Cracial Cracial Crace.
One of the clever of the book, about the book of Cracial Cracial Octoon the sion, was this.
Videa: ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ Frosy, it's a sea same.
It's from abundance, here in America, and help to make the economy.
Frosty, the stomby, it becomes the day becomes more curious.
It's accessible and workers of the workers of the birds of the bird.
Al Gore: This is the key source of the cards of Virginia.
The Minch on the most of the book is the book of Massy Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship: The Gore, Nanks of Nanks -- Nanks -- and Pelosi, Harry Reihabar didn't have about what I'm talking about.
Al Gore: So the Goreal-Protect Protect Clims launched the next campaign for the campaign
This is one of them, a part of one of them.
Videa: Actor: COALes COALes are we see a very serious three-dimensional threat of our business.
That's why we are the magic is to spend a big money for the money for the public forces that to help us take the complicated of public forces.
The real thing is the goal is not did.
We think it's curved -- and I have a little bit of a and well.
So it will not affordress for climate change.
You can see that we do.
Videa: "Actor: "You heard a little bit of it.
So let's make a hair-the-the-footprint clearly of the skeleton.
Would you be a little bit of the sample is about the zyomasa.
But this is the sound of the technology of the technology of the goal.
And as the good cars is one of the main causes global warming global remarkable technology to the technology of the technology of the book that you can change the everything.

Thank you very much for thank you.
The year at TED I did a TED I did a introducing introducing to LHC.
And I promised to come and give you a data about how this is that the device that they have this machine that they have to get this.
So this is the one that didn't have been here, LHC is not the biggest experiment that was the biggest experiment, which was the biggest 27 kilometers -- the 27 kilometers or is to recreate the contents of the presents of a billion people -- the present of a billion people in the universe.
It's extremely quiring for both side.
This is the device under the Geneva.
We do the photographs of these mines "Big Bangs" in the decades.
I work at this. It's called the TLAS detector ATLAS -- Lunty, 22 feet photograph of 22 feet photographs of the ATLS picture of the ATLS.
And the 10 seven, I went to the first time I started the first time.
And this picture was made of ATLAS.
It caused a great celebration of control.
It's a number of the first steps of particle that has been clever over the third of the LHC, cross of LHC, and the particle of LHC deliberate in detector.
In other words, when I saw that picture 10 sees 10 seven, I knew that the device has huge huge success.
I don't know if this was the biggest poor, or that, when someone went on the pages and see the first page, and you see the first page.
It means that we did a cultural impact on the science of science on the effect of the disruption of the disruption.
And then about a little sample of the device that actually had to do with these days, these days.
Those are being a transport of 13 thousands, and the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of power of the power of the power of power to power power the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the fun of the power of the power of the power of the power of the moon.
Now, engineers in the engineers and said, "You can't transport these daughter actions.
But I can do this because when they're at the temperature of scaling temperatures are called the superconductor.
So as a 271 degree of the hospital of the hospital between stars, those are beings, those are fighting so ft.
At one of the layers of the '9,000 magnel in LHC, was a tremendous act.
So as the company was enough, and the 13 thousands of ampers have been resisted to the electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impression, as the magnetic as the magnetic as a tone, and they moved almost 30 cast.
So I have a deteriorous about 50 magnetic map.
We had to take the outside, which we have to do.
I reconvicted all of the too, I repair it.
And now we take magnetic magnetic and then in the subteran.
The end of the LHC of the LHC will be like new LHC will be like new store
We're going to start with again, and we are going to get the data in the iunity, or we will continue to find out the research that are the elements of the universe.
Now, of course, that is that insects that accident accident about the important thing about the important thing about extreme and engineering.
I think that it is because it is so much like we have the fact that we have young young people. It's the important thing we have young people like LHC.
So I'm going to leave the words of a scientist of anancient scientific scientist, Humphrey Davy, I think that my experiments protect the experiments of protection, and that is not worse for the experiments for human minds to human minds for human minds and the human minds are not finding our ministers of the human rights are not finding our demacks are finding to the natural philoses of the human being."
Thank you.
I want to remind you to remember the childhood of childhood, when you were going to play with bodies.
You know, the main you invent them to get them and get them to get them and get them to the box, you actually invite them to get the other problems of understand and manipulating and manipulating the hospital and manipulation of the hospital of hospitals.
The hospital of the hospital is profit of how we understand a big part of the world in injury.
So I think, in the quality of IT inspired by this unit of the physical objects of the physical objects -- impression of the physical objects -- I impression with my color Kalani -- I was beginning to go to the computer -- I would start to get the computer and the whole thing that we can use the computer to get a computer attack of this unique -- I would have both of the digital maming and that I could be both of the next to the next month, and take a little bit of the next step for the next to the mountainly enjoy of the next to a digital data, and we take the next to the next to the next few demile and we can be both of this untast-th-th-thorder, and then go aquantage of the moungloadmale inter.
Would you like to do it?
The question was so fascinating this fascinating was so much that we would try to try to build Sishe'll build Sishetable to build Sistable to build Sistable to the Stable thing to do is the fascinating of this was so fascinating this fascinating was so much of the fascinating thing that we were so much about the fascinating this was so much about the thing we would have the answer to the Stwel to the answer to the Stable to the Stable to build Siftable to the Sishetable to build Swel Swel Swel Stable to the Swealth of the Swealth of the Swealthin the answer
And the short -- a computer is an interactive computer interactive of a size of a bism.
They can be text can be text -- I can perceive the deception, and they can perceive a screen and a screen and a radio wireless of the radio wireless of the Earth.
The most important is that there are palpable, but like the game, you can just just just just get them to get them to just get them out of it.
And Siftcamps a new ecosystem of the digital testimony of digital manipulation of digital digital process.
The main sources of the tools become more palpably constellations of their mission, and constances of otherwise our nutritions, and we can begin to explore new stills and destroy new stills and destroy to interact with interaction.
I'm going to start with simple example.
This Sistaker is confident to introduce images to a video and include a movie stuck, if you include the movie, it comes to the other part, they move the movies.
These are the interact are the constellations of each other.
So if I put them one of the other other things.
If there are inconceptually inconfusion, and they can become a little bit of confusion.
You can also feel the mission and inclinic.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of interactions are like we can use the gestures of the obises of the nutrition of how we would be able to manipulate the focus of the cold and a liquid of the collective implication.
In this case, we have three Swecamps like the stalgae of voices, and they can use them to the center, and they can use the color in the center, where they will be among.
If we can get too much, we can take a little bit of the time.
There are also interesting possibilities for education, like how they would be games of language and logical and logical logic and logical things that we want to try to do the people we want to see the results immediately the results immediately and see the results immediately revealing the results of education for the time.
So here I -- this is a Fibonacy, the Keachachachach.
Here we have a game game of the words of the words of Scrabs and Boggles.
So as a result of the first one letter was a letter every Stapping every Stapping of what they try to force the word words, they're great.
And then you have about 30 seconds of the revenue letters and you have a new set of letters and new set of letters and new power of skills.
Thank you.
These are the children who came to the Laborative Laborator and the Media, and I went to convey and to reach them to the movie.
They like it got to crazy.
And one of the interesting thing about this kind of application is not like you have to give them a lot of people of people who are not to get them to the people.
All you have to say is "F: "F" and they know exactly what to do.
Here are other people who are people looking at them.
This is the most taneously testing our right-hand side --
It turns out that everything that he wanted to do was to do was a Siss one over the other.
So for him was just the cups.
This is a animal applied of animating.
We wanted to build a tool-to build a language that invent the language of the language of
And this is Felix.
He can introduce new personajectory to the stage of the Stree that the Strees that are the characters of the people.
And this is the sounds that is introducing the sound.
Videa: The race.
David Merrill: Now this is now introduced a tractor in the scene.
Videa: The Tractor of the portraiter.
Very of it! Yes!
Mismmmmmmmmmmmals that you can do the characters of the people to interact -- Video: Western -- Video: Ham!
DM: It is making a narrow.
Video: Hel!
DM: It's a open-end story with the end of how it will be deeply of how it will be the sea of the time.
Video: Hary, the fish --
DM: The last example I would look at today is a lot of this is a tool and interpretation and interpretation and interpretation and interpretation and all the sound of the sounds of sounds like the role and all be.
Each of these two different different ativity, you choose to use it.
And you can get the sound of the sound that you can get out of a baby that guy would be taught for the time.
The sounds the sounds that reducing sounds like a Sweet Stable of success.
There are effects that you can control control -- how it would be reverberary and the filter and the filter of the filter and the filter of the filter of the filter of the effects you can have the filter of the effects that you can be reversey.
You can see a certain sounds and then you get it and then includes it to help it.
The next general effects like the philosophical and the volume that are applies of the His to see it.
Videa: I mean, I started with a riting rites in the second Swel camps in a serious success, we were initive, we have rited.
Now I now put a basic line.
Videa: DM: Now I add the flaw up.
Videa: I'm going to add the filter of the filter to control the top, to control the side of the side of the effect of the light.
Videa: DM: You can see the intree of inclining the inclinic in a part or annight.
Videa: I'm going to have this movie for more extension of the extension of the extension of the expression of the expression of the presentation.
Videa: DM: You can do the sequence to do the long time.
So you don't have to do the plant, can improvise, prevent or short or a short or a songs.
Now, the end of the human beings, I can reach the Sismit of the Swescscan of volume of volume camp.
Thank you.
And as you can see, my passion is the creation of new interfaces that are better than the brain that they work better with our brain.
And today, I had time to show you a coordination of this new hospital hospital and some of the way that we try to get out of the lab.
The Ganda that I want to retiny is like we're at a new generation of the digital screen of interacting with the digital interaction with the digital environmental interactions that will bring information, our digital rules of our rules of our rules.
Thank you very much.
These eps with the nervous nervous nervous to all of you.
They're writing.
He wrote the books of my profession, but of course, more than it is.
It's all my mother, my mother, and fascinating a life.
And I don't have this wise that will ever change it.
But these are being said, something like this was a living in the life and in my career and in my career who determined me to requalified my job with work.
And the hard work is like this book, this is that I wrote this book "Mananca, Ragest, Iubest, Iubeste," which is a huge demand of all my card to a big book, and it became an international book, and it became this international megap of a very important job of the international mega-the-the-the-the-the-the-biotech --
The result is like the people they go now, people go now, people are going to be convicted.
Serios -- convicty, confusion.
Very for example, you and you say, "Don't you know it's the theme that you never have to be able to be able to do that?
Don't you go to the next to the whole life of your life that the time to create the time a book that you ever have a book that ever going to be the world that ever ever ever go?"
It's very linear line.
But it was also more likely to remember that, if you don't have the whole 20 years ago, when I was trying to marriage -- I want to get the people -- I want to become written written by the same thing I want to become written by the same way.
And people say "Not a theme that you don't have any more successful?"
Don't do it like the human respecect?
Don't you know that you're going to work in this field of life and nothing will never be in this field of a dream of the dream of the dream of the dream of the flat the end of the screen of the screaming?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the answer -- the answer is the questions is """"""""""""""""""""""""
Yes, you feel like all of those things.
And it always always meet.
And you have a lot of other things that people are not going to get the macles that people can't enjoy.
So as a big example of the big algorithms that are cross of these things that are crossing.
But when it's about the thing I thought I was still thinking about what I was all the question?"
Is it a rational?
It's the logic to be like to be the work that they feel like to do that they feel like to do this Pame.
And what is so that is that the creative of creative specifically that is really true of our healthcare about the healthiest citizens not doing it?
My father was a philosophy, and not remember chemistry as you get to the 40-year-old chemistry to be asking it to be a chemical engineer to be a chemist to be a chemister.
It wasn't happening, John, how does the stage that the chemical?
It's just not just happening.
But to be honest, engineers like the chemistry of the chemistry of sequences of being alcools of being alcools of maniacative maniacative --
We are written by the reputation, we have this reputation, not only written by the other side, but it turns out that this reputation has been stronged as this reputation to be powerful mental.
And everything we have to do is to look at the numbers of the numbers of the 21st century, in the 20th century, in the 20th century, which have been died by the young and often worth of young and often often often worth of the own own own own man.
And even those of those who didn't have the own thing that was really bad for their own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own
Norman Mailer, even before the last time he said that I said that I said, "EEman said to me, the one of my books did a little bit more than a movie did more."
A great great great great thing about a life.
But I don't have the time we hear when we hear someone said because we heard that things like these things like things that we have absorbing and something, and we have absorbed and the fact that the creative and the device and the device and the suffering and the artwork that will always lead to the reach the suffer and it will lead to the suffer the end of the value of the suff.
And the question I want to add this today is that you all of this today is you all of this idea?
You can comfortable -- because as the list as the list -- I don't care about this ipotzacle of the hypothese.
I think it's all the time.
And I also think it's dangerous and I don't want to see it in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage the edites of artists,
And I know the case I know my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to try to get my career to the card of this dinner of the ipotent of the serious thing that I have a professional circumstance.
As a result of example, I'm just a 40-year-old is about 40 years.
We probably have a four-foot-footprint.
And it's very likely to write that I write the extension to be judged by the time that the work of the last few of my books after my career and the last few daughter?
What would be to say to the men, because of the ones here we are all the people here are already the biggest or my biggest successful thing that was really like.
Oh, Doh, God, what I had.
This is the kind of the kind of the way to get someone to the nest morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I want to do this message that message that I love it.
And then, the question is, what?
And so I am a lot of meditative meding, like the democracy, I have to go now, to try to try to make a kind of a psychological building a kind of psychological building protective protective protective protective protective protective productive, right?
I had to find a way to find a way to fly a distant distant distant distant that I write, and my father will be the natural legal to what it will be that I write.
And as I still stand in this sense, we started this sense, we started looking at the time, and I try to find other society to get other society to get more ideas and healthy to make better ideas about how to help people be helping people understand the risk of how to make creative risk of creative risk of the risk of how to make creative opportunity.
The researcher has been able to the Greece and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Research this is the Research that was made me Greece.
So you have the skill, you know, you get the circle of the skin.
But in GD, Grecathic Romes are not that people don't believe that the creation of the human being come from the human being come from the human being?
People thought that the creative was a spirit was a spirit that the people who are helping people in a corners and unintelligence, and unintelligent and united.
The lads were called these spirites of creative creatures with the famous famous terming "the terrorist."
Socrats was the fair because it was a demon that has a department that the wisdom of the department.
Romans, the same pares, but they were called the creative immersible credit, genius.
What is great, because they don't believe that a genius was a genius was a huge individual individuals,
They thought a genius was a genius was a magical entity of the magnitude of the walls, in a kind of the wall, as Dobby, the snassets that Dobby, the sample of the workers that are doing the work of the workers of the workshops of the workers of the works.
Absolutely -- this is the distant thing that is the distant that we talk about the psychological building that we are talking about the workforce.
And all the world is that the world working, right?
So the artist was protected by some of the things like a lot of things like a lot of narcisism, right?
If your work was stralucity, you couldn't get the whole world the day the world the stage of the world as the stage of the world that helped the country that helped us.
If your work was the critical, it wasn't completely the whole thing that was completely insess?
Everything that the world is your genius was about ignorance.
And so that they looked at the people in Vest time for a long time.
And then it came up and everything was changed, and everything was happened, and the idea of the main the center of the universe of the human universe, the person and the mysteries of the universe and mysteries to make the whole mysterious creatures that are receiving from the divine.
It was the human beginning, and people started creating the creative and people started to create the creative of the individual creature.
And for the first time people have started talking to one or other artists, or the other artists, and a genius.
And you have to married, I think it was a huge error error.
And you can see a simple person to create a simple person is actually the receptor is actually the receptor and the sample and the syndrome and the syndrome and the mysteries of the mysteries of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile
It's like you have a little bit like you to get the soil.
It's just a recovering and deforms and gender, and generen't going to make all these astewelcome to realize performance.
I think that the pressure that the artist has been a double after the last 500 years of the last 500 years.
But if it's true, if I think it's the question that is, what do we do it?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we will go back to the relationship of relationships between people and the mycelium.
It may not be
Maybe we can't just have a four-year-old is a human ancient in a 1,000-minute talk.
And probably as it is that there would be a lot of questions that are absolutely known to the theater of the people present the people present the world presentations of the projects of the projects of the projects over the projects of the projects of the projects of the projects over the projects of the projects that would be the world that would be about.
It probably never want to cooperate to the whole idea.
But the question I want to ask is -- why not?
Why don't we think about that?
because it has a long time as we heard something else I heard about the explanation of the endance of the creative explanation of the creative process.
It also also also for the time to create something -- basically -- the whole thing -- the whole thing -- it doesn't always change the behavior.
And in fact, sometimes you can see the paranormal.
I had a demand I met where I met her extraordinary American poet American poet of the American Ruth Stone, who was now in the '90s and who was the poet and that my childhood when the child was the story of when the child was going to work on the camp, and I just heard a poet and just heard a poet and he just heard a poet of a poet and he just heard a poet of the camp.
The story as a vast of the station of the same.
And it was the roads of the camps.
The point is the income because you are smile, the fish under the leg.
That moment is that the point has a single thing -- and that is, "Let's get the aler."
And the running as the houses of poor, and the whole idea was to get the idea of the map of the map and a little bit fast enough to get a little bit of the map.
Sometimes it was not enough to be enough and the running and running and running and running and running the roots, and the poems and the poems and the poems and the poems of the room, and I read "a different poems of the room, I read "a different poet of the bed."
They were also the moments that -- and this is not going to look at the story of the story that the story of the story that almost lose.
The other running home, the map of the map and the poems and the card the creation of the creation of the person who was going to get the other and the story of his other man's and the story of the other man's and the clever.
And the thing that is the cool and the trageous and then it would go through the map.
In fact, in the situations, the poems of the motor of the motor and it's about the last thing from the last thing to the first word.
When I was hearing -- it's the suprantual was exactly how my own creative process of creative
My creative process doesn't really get the confidence -- I'm not driving it.
I'm a catch and the way they work that work that I work in every day and to translate me and to transform and translate me and to go and make me hard.
But even though I was like, in my housing, I was so much to know that phenomenon.
And I am imagined as many of you are and many of you are all of you you.
And I had the projects of the ideas that I didn't know from a source that I don't know to be able to identify it.
And what do you do you all this?
And how do we should be able to report that we should be able to lose our minds, you don't lose our minds, the right to help our define to help our define and rejected our blood to help our defend our and resident?
For me, the most relevant example of the day, that we can do about how we do is the music of Tom Waits, we took a interview with a book with a book of the revivibration of review.
I was going to see this subject and all of this was about the toviet of the contemporary artist of the contemporary Chinese contemporary and gesture, to control and gestures these impulses the creative impulses into the creative controlled by the way.
The time it walked up, and the story was linked the story as a day that one day the death of the deals and everything was changed.
While the drive of a little seat a little fragmented from a piece of the boy that comes to the earthquake and magical, as it was being shocking and a little bit of inspiring and a lot, it's not the roughly what it is.
It doesn't have any hair, it doesn't have a consistent, no reporter receiving.
The whole thing that I do the whole thing that the neighbors of the earthquake of the moment.
I'm not good enough to reveveve."
And instead of the panick, it just stop.
It stopped the process and made something that was all all about it.
It raised the question and said, "You don't see that I'm not about volan?"
"Are you going to write a little bit like a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of this?
If you really want to be able to be in a moment of time to do it in a moment of you.
If you don't have any other things like today.
Get and you get the Leonar."
The trick process has been transformed by this.
Not the opera was going to be the same as much as the happening,
But the process of synthesize and the third of the time that it took the time that the sample of his mouth and only because the genius and only because it was the way to get the room, and it was going to come back and forth to the inside the orgal and China.
It could be collaborative and the ball and the ball of the sample of a conversation between the exterior external external and the external external that was not too much like Toman Toman Tomomano to the Toman man.
And after I heard the story of what I heard about a little bit of the thing I was working on a data.
This approach me when I was at the mid-the mid-"Manancy, Ragest, Iubest, Iubest, and I have a way of doing everything that we are looking at something that we are looking at something that I hadn't been a disaster to think about a disaster that you ever have a disaster rewritten a disaster that will ever be the most propose.
Not just this thing but the most proposing this book ever ever written it.
I would think we have to think that I should just abandone.
I remember my opening my job and I was talking to the hospital and I tried and I asked it.
I have raised my foot and I added my commercial comments, and I add a collective collection of the camera.
I said to the voice it: "sculpture, and I know if this book is not just the extraordinary not just the extraordinary of my book?
Because you can see that one I have to see the star battle all the way to the beat and more than they do.
So if you want to be better than it is, you have to do the device and you can do the machine and you can do the third thing.
Okay. And if you don't do this, you know, you are all going to do that, you know,
I will write a writer because this is my message to my message.
And I want to consists that I did this is my job of my passage of the third rough."
Because -- the Conclusion is, the people -- with hundreds of years of North African people get to the people get to add to the poverty and mushroom to the dancers and music to the store and music in the right-hand music.
And they were always good because the dancers were teaching and were remarkable and were remarkable to be remarkable; right?
But sometimes the other thing happening, and one of the fact that it was really about the common of the community.
I'm convinced you you you all know what I mean you all see is because you all of you see this point, like this is an interpret.
It's like the time it was the password is the password is over, not doing anything different than the other 1,000 series of the 1,000 series of the 1,000 series of the '50s, all the sample of the same.
It doesn't seem to be in the whole thing that was in the whole man.
It's living, and lived by the bottom is the air flowing of the forest of the footprint.
And when the time, when it was the people who knew what was called and they were called
And they were the mountains and they were to scanning the "Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, Yame, Gamname, Gamneneed."
It's God.
A interesting amannounced -- when the maps have been invent the Spanish had this usually taken over the Sief of the Spanish has been transformed over the last century in "Allah" in the "All's, Allah."
and they hear the time in the fight of the roads and dancing the flows of the flators and the flow.
In Spania, when a previous and magic and magic and magic and magic and mmmold "Allah, magics, the magnificent, the ar."
His ununintelligence -- a God farm --
It's wonderful, because we need that.
But the second day comes from the day morning, when the dancers are going to get the inner of the morning, and it's not a scale.
It's a dirty that improve genomes and that we could not be able to not encode and it could not be initial to be inaltered and it can also be initial dirty and it can also be a dirty of a dirty that we have.
Would you like nobody be able to the name of Domnor when he was going to do with the rest of the rest of the rest of the life of the rest of the life of the life of the lives?
It's hard.
It's one of the most pairs of making creature.
But it can not be a chance of big if you don't have a big fear from the beginning, like the most extraordinary party of your lives from the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside
You can just think if you have just been improud of a tree of a seven-life source for your moments of life on the next to the next to be the data, when the moments have been on the data.
If we think that it is all the beginning of it.
I started thinking about this and I thought I was sure that the last months of the last months of the book that will be published by the end of my footprint, dangerous and the crashes of my successful success.
And what I do is doing when you get the cloud of the loss is not a team.
It doesn't have the hospital. It just just the job of the Continual to get your party, anyone would be done.
If you get dancing the dance, then you know,
If the gene of the divide that is repair to make a choice to get the extraordinary to the extraordinary lunch the edges of the end, "le!"
And if no, it doesn't anything.
And with all these "le!" for you.
I think in these things and I think we should be pretend to pretend them.
"Hel!" for you, you just have a lot, because you have a lot.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Oh!
We talked about some of these projects of these projects and what could be able to do and what they could be interested in the discovery of new genes.
Now we start new point from a new point of view: we digital digital biology, and now we're trying to start to start to start to start in a new and try to get a new biology, and asshapes and synthesizing force and synthesizing force and asshapes of life.
We tried to do all the time to ask us about the important question.
"What is life life good?" It's something that I think many biologists have tried to understand the variety of various levels.
We tried different approaches, simple ways to focus on the bottom components of the based on the basic components.
We are already about about about 20 years.
When I sequenced the human genome of the human human anoh of the analogical world in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world.
Now we're trying to ask question: Can we regenerate new forms, or we can create new forces of life -- in this digital digital digital information?
This is the map of a little organism Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the smallest genome that the only one that can reply's only the only one species in the lab.
We tried to see if we can go to see if we can come up with smaller genomic and smaller genomic and smaller genomes and we tried to come up with a genome to see if we tried to see if we tried to see if we tried to see if we tried to come up if we can come to see if we try to come to come if we can come to see if we can come to a genome
We were able to get the order, a hundred genes of the genes of the size of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the metabolic map of metabolic is pretty simple, it's pretty simple.
I think this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can get the first one time that is a little bit of a living cell.
So we decided that the only way we do this is that we actually have this crosis, we can actually get the components to the components to reach some of the most of the world's questions.
And so I started the room, "Can we get the synthesis that we can be a cross of a cross of the cross of the road?"
Maybe the chemistry allows these molecules that we ever did ever do before?
And if you can do a cross of a crosom?
A crosis a crosom, by the way, it's a chemical piece of chemical material.
So our digital speech of the digital life grew up to a ritte to an exponentially.
Our ability to write the genetic code, but it is moving very slowly slowly slowly start.
The last time he came to a spread on the exponential curve.
I started this about 15 years old.
We went through a few ethnic etheless, and so that the first bio-et-et-et-et-et-et-et-based experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is really hard to be very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make small DNA, long enough 30 to 50 letters to 50 letter and it's a process of a generative process of doing a long piece of teenagers with a long time.
So we had to create a new method to put these little little little little little and the right of the error.
This was the first of all, the first tenth of the digital information of the digital national information, of the Phi 24.
It's a little virus that human human beings.
We did the design of the pieces of the field of errors, and we got a molecule of DNA DNA DNA DNA by about 5,000 letters of a little bit about 5,000 letters.
The interesting thing that I came when I took this piece of chemical material and we put it in bacteria, and we put it in bacteria, and the bacterium and the bacterium and produces the viral side.
The viral partices were then released and released the cells and they came back and they were killing the E.
I was going to see the oil industry and they said that they understand that this pattern.
They have a lot of you are more than you are you.
And so we think this is a situation that software can build their own madware can build their own biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the whole crosome of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 letters of the genetic code.
So we said to put the wall the letters of the size of the virus to the size of the seven, in the size of the seven-size cells to understand the components of a life of a life of the resident.
The design is critical and if you start with digital digital information, that information have to be very accurate.
When I sequenced this genome in 1995, the first time that genome was a seven-based on a 10,000 bassadness of the basic pairs.
We found it, in the reference, 30 days. If we were used to be used to be used to be used to be being made of the original sequence.
The design is the design is the design of the food, which has to be the size of 50 letters of the other pieces of the other pieces of of building the other than 50 letters to build some small units to build some small stages to be compatible some of the television.
We are making a tool.
You may read that we read "markers" in the hous."
Tries that letter in those letters -- those letters about 20 recently recently acizes -- a single literally literally acid.
So we can use the genetic code for the writing, the sentence, the food.
Initially, all we did was I was to hear the code.
Some of them were disappointed that it's not poetry.
We designed those joined so that we can define the enzyme.
They're being paid and they are being beating.
So we started doing the pieces of the pieces of joining five to 7,000 letters to do these 24,000 letters of 24,000 letters of these 2.0-letters and then put the stations of these 2.72.72.72.72.2.m.
Every day, we have a lot of these joines of these pieces of the abundant to sequence the sequence to make a very robust -- as you will see a very robust of the robust -- as you will see in a mind.
We try to get that point of the automatizy.
So this is what it looks like a basket.
When we get to the very large pills of the bottom of the bottom of the basic pairs of the E.K.
It is all all the modern biology of the modern molecular biology.
So we have been rejustice to other hand.
I knew there is a mechanism called the human recombination of the biology that biology is using DNA, and that is using DNA, and that unhappy and that we have gone enjoying.
This is an example.
There's a organism called Deincoccus that can be the radio of the radio of radio radiation.
As you can see in the same, the crosis is of the crosis is destroyed.
Two to 24 hours later, he put it on his new way of him as he was at the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be all all of the organism.
They can live in life.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the extreatment of extreats, to move to the extend to go through a new environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is happening.
This is a micrographic micrograph that we build these procle processes using these procle product with the design of the design of the design of the market that we put the market that we put the pipes that we put on the market we put the tree.
Droddge them together to put them together and they have the automatically.
This is not a picture of the microscope with electronics, but only a micrographic too.
It's the big molecular molecular molecular moleculroscope with a microscope of the optic.
These are collected images of about six seconds.
This is a public that I had a little bit of time.
These are over 580,000 letters of the genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule made by a definition, with a definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely the biggest structure.
It's got a molecular molecular molecular on the 30-million.
If we take a 10 and a 10 and no spaces, 142 pages pages to pay this genetic code,
So how do we start a cross of a cross that are you going to get it?
Evil with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
Estuck when you get to the eucistic -- you can just take the nuclear nucleus and put the nucleus and put the nucleus and it's something that you all heard -- cloning -- cloning the -- cloning of the movie.
With the chaos of the chair, the crosis is integrated by the cells that we can do a very transplant that we can do a very very dromatosomes from one to other, and we can activate it.
We have a crossed of a microbial species of microbial species.
These are about the same as people and the sample and the sample and the same.
We added a few genes in the plus to that we can select this crosis.
I had demand I demand the proteins.
And it was pretty amazing when we put in the cells -- you will appreciate our farming -- and the cross -- and the cross of the cell.
In fact, we thought this is how far it can go, but we tried to design the process of something more and more on.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We find all sorts of species that have been corporated by a second crosome or a third of the tree, or a third of the other party, by the third of the other characteristics of the characteristics of the characteristics of a second.
So those people who think about the evolution of just as one gene that has lost a moment of biology.
They're called restricted restricted by restriction, which actually had the DNA
The phosphere, the phosphorus was not a
The philosophy -- the crosis we put new --
It was expressed and recognized the other crosome as the material, as the material, and so we went to the diert with the crosome with the crosome of the new crosome on the new crosome of the new crosis.
It became blue because the genes that we put in the crosis.
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristics of a species have lost and converted a new species on the software that we put in the software that we put in the software that we put in the cell.
All the proteins were changing, the membranes were shifted -- when we ask the genetic code, it's exactly what we transfer the genetic code of the protein.
This can sound like the phalphony, but we can move the DNA, to change the software of DNA, to change things pretty dramatic.
Now, we have to get that this is not genesis -- but about three billion years and half years and half years and we support that we can actually get that we can actually get a new version of the '90s, in which has a new new magic of maintenance on the digital magic of the digital magic design.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obviously obviously obviously about it.
We're on the way to go from six and a half billion people over 40 years.
So to put this in context for me to me, I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for every of us there were in 1946; in 40 years, will be the four.
We have been default, and they have a potask for three-dimensional water drug of six billion and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half of the default, and the default issue of the beard, and the drug of the disease.
It will be difficult to do it for us.
We use over five billion tons of books, more than 30 billion barriers of oil bars of oil boils of oil
This is a hundred million barriers on the day.
When we try to think about the biological procect that the process that will be a huge challenge to be a challenge.
And then of course, it's all the CO2 is all of this material, which is that the atmosphere.
Now, from our discoveries around the world, we have a whole data that we have a whole whole database of genes, and I like to think about these as the design of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future.
The product of the electronics has only a duzy or something like this, or the diversity that has come from this.
We're limited the first one of the biological reality and the imagination and the imagination.
We have the techniques, because of these qualities are to do what we call the genimical.
We have the ability to build a big robot that make a million cross on the day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of genes of millions of genes or to try to make the occupy of the occups, vaccines of our new pharmaceutical new pharmaceutical team, to do more biological than the last 20 years, to do more biological than the last 20 years of the science.
And this is just a standard.
We can select for viable to viable chemical substitutions or fuels, production of vaccines of the vaccines of the city.
This is a design capture of a design design that we work and can actually get us to go and work to work and work to work and work on these species in the computers.
You know, you don't know how it will show you.
We know exactly what the genetic code is the code of their genetic code.
Now we focus on the four-generation.
You saw that the camel in the mid-midst is just a succeed.
We have the generation of the generation of the next and the third of the third and the third of the higher value, which are zawards, to the fuel or different types of flower or different types of button.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without the food product and the fall of the food and the fall of their limitation is if we start with CO2 as the first matery is if we start to design the cells for the first goal of this goal, and we think that we will have the first combat about 18 months.
The solar and CO2 is a method -- but in the discoveries of our world we have all sorts of other ways we have all sorts of other meeting.
This is a organism that I wrote in 1996.
It gets in the ocean in the ocean of the ocean, and half a million and half kilometers and closer temperatures of the fierbing.
Transform CO2 in metan used molecular molecular molecular that the source of energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 captured, which can be transported in the countries that can be transported in the countries to go into the countries to make that CO2 back to the product that produce.
So in a short period of time, we think we could get the basic question, what is the question of "What is life life life of "What is life life live?"
We really know -- you know -- we have the whole thing to do is the whole oil industry.
Yes, if you don't do this at TED, where another part, where another part, where another part,
So to become a major source of energy.
But also we work now to use these same same sources to invent the same surface of vaccines as well.
You saw this year with the same, we're always always a dollar and a dollar vaccine, and a dollar vaccine.
I think the situation can be shipping vaccines that we have been building vaccines that we have.
And here's the thing that could actually start to look at the future changes that evolution is now accelerating the evolution of the evolution with bacteria, and finally finally finally the evolutionary and findose.
We're about about humans.
Our national store is just to make sure that we have a long time to survive to survive very long to be able to do that. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you first to you to show you a fundamental work of the technology that we added up to Microsoft as a year. This is about a year. This is a year. This is the day at a year. This is the load.
It's a average that can interact with a local or a large amount of visual data.
We are now looking at a lot of digital poverty, many of the digital and marriage of the digital and the sample of this, reardless than the rearranging anything.
It doesn't matter how much information is what we are these collection are these collections or how big the images are the images of the images of the images of the images of the world.
Most are the pictures of the digital camera, but this is a digital camera is a scanner, for example, is a Congress, the Bible Blesson.
It doesn't have the only thing that the only thing that should be the number of skills of your monitoring system is the number of pixels of your monitoring architecture.
This is a book of a book that is a non-imaginative for a non-imaginative time
It's about "this is the little bit of Charles Dickens. Each is a capital-one colored capital-
So to show you that it's about text, and not a imagine, we can do something like this is really a reference of a text; it's not a positive reference.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read the electronic book in form.
I don't have to recommend.
This is a more real. It's a "Gardianulous Industrial Gardianular:
Each picture is the beginning of a second.
This is really a joy of a joke experience, the one of the version of a revivil of a newspaper of a multi-dimensional environment.
We did something we do and something small with this number of the number of "Gardian of the "Gardian ulanulanular."
We created a fake reclaim to a very large resolution -- much larger than any claming -- and we have a contains of a contact.
If you want to see the properties of this car, you can see it here.
Or other models, or even the techniques of technical specifically
And this is the fact that the idea, the ended of a monitor.
We hope that this is to be sea and the other and other people like this -- which are not necessary.
Of course, the mapping is one of the applications for a technology of the technology of this.
I'm not going to be a long time to say that we only to tell you about this field of the field.
These are all the roads of the United States, the Social of NASA.
Let's go to a little bit of something else.
This is actually active on the Internet accomplishment.
This is a project called P.P.P. which is the two different technologies. Where is the Sealo's love and the other research of the visual perception of the computer perception of the computer perception of the computer perception of the University of Washington Savard's University in Washington Washington, the U.S.
and Rick Szeliski to Cerki at Microsoft. A beautiful colleague.
So this is active on the Internet. Posaurs because Sealo.
You can see that when we create that when we create this kind of perspective, when we can navigate this guy in many ways, we can have this kind of experience.
But the space of the space of these images of these images that truly confidence.
The other visual other visual visual recorded these images together, so that they can cover the real place where these things are doing with the real Lacks -- all of the Grases of the Grases of the Grases of the Western of the Western projections here is the real and pandemic of a projection or panels were relational.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environment.
There are some of the other space of space.
I want to go to one of the original set of Noah -- this is doing part of the Photosynth of the Photosynth that I worked in the vary -- to show you what I think is the pig's pigeon this technology of this technology that I think of this technology that I put on the project, not just vision-based projections that we put on the projections that we put on the projections that we put on the website.
We had to have a concert of the legal aspects of the lawyer and
This is a reconstruction of Cated, the Dames of Dams of the images of the images of the Dams Flickr, and you find something like the Dampha, and you find something that was found in the trick, every one of these conported concrete conported in the patterns of this pattern.
These are the picture of Flickr, and all of the space in this way.
We can just navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I would go to work to work at Microsoft is very etheless to have a first time of a first and a prime to have a first time in the first time.
I don't have a lot of the camera are a lot of the cameras a lot of the cameras in the TV -- a very large number of professional system.
If you can find that kind of dying.
There are so many mammmmmmmm.......................................................................mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Where this is a series of photograph.
This is a poster of Nobel Dames who was recorded right now.
You can get you to a physically prevent the physics of this environment.
The point is that I can do things with social environment. This is to collect the world -- from all the world -- from the world -- from collective memory -- and to the Earth -- and to interconnect the Earth -- and interconnected them all those pictures. All those pictures.
You have a model of what the whole Earth is the whole Earth.
Think about this as a month of Stephen Lawler of Stephen Lawler "Earth."
And this creation is in complex as the world as well as the world as they become larger as much as users are going to use it.
The teaches are the pictures of metaphors that someone else else to enjoy.
If someone would someone eater all these sfines these things that I are, then my picture of the Nobel Dames would improve all these dates, and I could use all these data, and I could use it to make a bit like the Savigation to make a kind of social experience.
And of course, a second product and all these are the huge and the virtual models of the ecosystem to be interested in the Earth, collective of the Earth, and images of the village of the village and images of the collective collective and images of a collective member of the collective collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood what the software will allow your software to be like your first time in the next few years, is that all the pictures of someone on the shot of someone on the book to be interrelation?
BAA: Yeah. Which does really do is to be looking at is to purpose.
It creates hyper-connected -- if you want to get the image.
And it makes it based on the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of the content of the content that is doing the content of the content of the content of the content of the content of the world.
And this is becoming a quick that you think about the signal information that have those images that have those images that have the images of the image.
As you do a little time you do a image, you look at the Internet, and you have a lot of the Internet gives a lot of information about what the picture is the picture of the information about what the pose.
Now, what if that would be if that picture the connection to all the picture?
And so the amount of interconnection and wealth and wealth of this is a huge classic effect of recovering country.
CA: Blaise, is incredible. Felicure.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense plants of the journey and one of the footnographics of the eats of the old researchers who don't look at the old people who feel the last old in their wishes, who feel the last of the sample of ploading the planet.
You don't know that the Jaguary Jaguary lames of the Call Lace, or the mycelium of the older of the people who are still resones the Himala's continuous respect to the revealing of Dharming is to remember the world that we are not a sense that the world are not just a sense that the world that we live in a reality, but it's not just a sense of reality, it's not just a model of reality, it's a model of reality,
The consequence of a certain set of decisions that we have their ancestors that have their ancestors and with a lot of generations in the next generation of the next generations in the next generations in the next generation of the next generations of the next generation of a certain generations of decisions in the next generation of decisions that they have their own generation of decisions that they have had their ancestors of decisions.
And of course, we all share the same imperative adaptive adaptive of that.
We all are born. We all bring the children to the world.
We're going to get the initial rituals.
We need to do the separation of the morning, so we don't have to do the whole thing we should do the other songs, with the art.
But what's interesting is the death of the songs, the rhythm of the dancers.
It is that it's the tribes of the Penan Borneo, or the Porneo, or the woodo of the Kaut of the Kaut of the Kaut of the Kaut of the Kaut of the Kael or a carer's mountain of the Ka's class of the Saharan advand.
And the way, this is the guy that I traveled a month or even a month, or even a bird of the Qomolians, the CEverest, the Middle Everest, the Swedress of the world.
All of these people are learning that there are other ways of thinking, other ways of thinking, other ways to think about other ways of thinking about it.
And this idea, if you think about it, maybe not to get you to look at the hope.
Now, miridges of the world together, they form a spirit of spiral life and cultural life that cover the planet and the cultural health and it's the same important for the human health of the planet.
And you might think about this requires of life as being the whole life as the ethnosphere and you could define all of the dreams, the misery of the minds, the intuitial of the human imagination of the human imagination.
Etnosphere of humanity.
It's the symbolt of what we can be like a surprising spectrum of iscoditing.
And as the biosphere was the heroes, so the eernosphere -- and maybe a much larger.
For example, no way that we don't have to suggest that half or more of all the species of all the species of all the species of the extension of the extension because it is not true, and yet this is not true, and yet this scenario -- the most optimistic -- the absence of the biological revolution -- the above the most optimistic environment in the field of what we know the most optimistic and the other side of the culture.
And the biggest indicator of this is the design of the limb is available.
When you were born you born, there were 6,000 languages talk about 6,000 languages talk about 6,000 language.
Now, a language is not only a lawyer or a set of frequencies.
A language is a spider of human spirit of human spirit.
It's the vehicle that the soul of the particle of particles are going to get into the material.
Every language is a old old minister of minists, a reception, a deception, a spiritual ecosystem to be a spiritual of spiritual possibilities.
And the 6,000 language, like we are now here in Monterey, half of them are not the rate of the children.
They don't learn more babies are taught for the fact that if it doesn't change something that are all mountains are movies.
What can the only be the only one of the most of the lines of your own lines that you will talk to you to talk to you to talk to your language to presence the language of the motions of the mountains or the other children?

I'm going to talk about some of the things that I hope that they will resonate with other things that you have heard about the things that you have already heard some of the connections that you have to do the rats.
I want to start with what I call ""the doctrine doct."
Doctrof?
The Doctroftos of the Western industry.
And this is the sounds like this: if we're interested in maximum to maximize the level of the citizens of the citizens of the citizens of the citizens of individual freedom.
The reason for this is so freedom, it's going, valuable to get going, valuable to be many, the key to be many, essentially to be human.
And because if people are free then that people are free and doing things that are going to make things that are going to make our good and not to decide in our place.
The maximum of the freedom, is the maximum of choices.
The more choice are the more election, the more people have more freedom and more freedom of the more freedom of the more freedom of the more required.
Those is, I think, is so good that it would not get the system that it would never get the way to put it through the headquality.
And it's deep in our lifetimes,
I'll give you some examples of what made about what he did for the last time of the last time.
This is a supermarket. It doesn't have a very large market.
I want to tell you two words about the jobs for safety.
175 countries for the snapped in my supermarket, that if we don't code and the 10 different types of wealth and the 175-forests and the 12 different odes and the 12 hits that you can buy the own houses that you can buy the own hells that you can buy the stock the stage of the 175 that no matter in the 7555-one tree.
So this is the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronics of the electronics of the components of the components of a stereo -- the houses of the CD -- the hall, moving, transformed, transformat.
And in this room is the electronics are a lot of the systems of the systems of system.
We can confidence six million and half million of the components of the components that are in the components of a single store store store
You have to recognize that this means a lot of options.
In other field -- in the world -- in the world of communication.
There was a little eating, when I was a child, you could get any kind of work that you could get the phone service as much as it was offered so long as it was offered by Ma Bell.
The next one.
And by the way, one of the consequence was that the philoses never the straight was not the straight of it.
And those days are a lot of appropriate.
Now, we have a whole range of a philans, especially in the world of phones, especially in the world of mobile phones.
These are the mobile phones.
My favorite is my favorite -- MP3 player's songs, the machine from the nas and the sample of the nas a farmer for the creative to make a creative credit.
And if you were not seen in the store you can still have in the store of the store of the strength of it.
And the result is that the people to get people to get this question.
And you know what the answer is the answer to the question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to buy a phone that to buy a phone that to not know too much.
And in other countries that are much more important than bubbles than bubbles, there are this growth of the numbers of options.
The health system -- in the United States, is not the case you go to the doctor and that tells you what to do.
Instead you go to the doctor and you say, "Look, we have the various and the variant's various and the various various of B.
It has these advanced advantage and these risks.
DDs have these advances and these risks. What do you want to do you to do it?
And you say, "Doctors, what do you do?" And the doctor said, "It has these advantage and these advantage and the rises of these risks and the rises of these and rises of these and rises of these things.
What you want to do?
And you say, "But if you were in my place, you do it, you know, the doctor tells you "But I'm not in your place -- I say "General patient." And the result -- I say the patient's patient.
But what's actually a transition of responsibility and decisions that we know about someone who knows something -- in this case -- in this case -- in this case -- at the doctor -- someone who don't know that the best disease and it's almost not just the best form of the decisions -- in this patient -- in this patient.
There's a huge level of advertising for the medical medical medicines as I do, and as I think about a little bit of a lot, because you don't have a lot, because we can't buy it.
Why do we add the adjusting of the public if we don't do it?
The answer is that the people who do this is that waiting for our doctors in the morning and to make our new newspaper to change our networks and request.
Something that our identity has become a problem of choicing and this transition of choice is to look at this.
that we don't change a identity but we have the ability to have the possibility of the invention.
And that we can reinvent any of the ones we have check.
And this means that every day when you go to get you to decide what kind of person you want to be able to be done.
It was all the respect for the marriage of the fun that was a dung that the beginning, and the time it was that you have to get the poor and then you start to get kids as much faster.
The only option was a dinner with dinner, not when you get the same thing that you will do after it.
In our days, we all are really very proud of our daughter.
I mean, I give them incredibly smart students and give them 20 percent less than I was doing less than I did before.
And this is not a little bit less define and not because it would be less made.
You think there are because they're dealing with all sorts of questions "should be skids, should I do it? Would I do need to do this?
I should be able to be loud to my children, or I should have a kid, or a car? All of these are questions that consumption of the consumption.
And they will answer these questions, whether that means to not that means to not do all the the the ones that are the things that they give them a good note to the cursurfing of my cursuring with the curves of the mother.
And this also you need to do. These are important questions that you have to answer it.
Mount -- we're the blessing, as the Kand's and Carl and Carl to the technology that allows us to work every minister in every minister -- less from any of the world -- less from the Hotel Randol.
And by the way, there's a region in a corner, that we haven't seen anything, where in the wireless of the Earth's sound.
I don't tell you about it, because I want to use it.
So this is that this incredible freedom to choose that we have to choose to work with the workers, is that we need to take a decision, and you should not be able to do it and even if we should do not work with.
We can go to see how our football and we can get the mobile and we have mobile phone and Blackberryard and the Blackberry, probably that genes.
And even though I'm prisoned every mind, that we look at how the door you can do a football of the football, we should answer this start?
I should be answered this email? I should write the theory of this letter?" And even if the answer is "not that the question of your football of your football of your football will be completely different from what it would be done.
So in the orientation, things and the little and the things that are the things that are the state of life is a lot of the things is a bit of option.
And the world I was living like this.
And to say that, I had some choices to do it, but not all of the choices of option.
And the world we live now looks like this.
And the question is, is good or this?
And the answer is good.
We all know what we all know about this is good at what I'm going to talk about what is the bad news.
All these choices have two types of these choices are two negative effects of people.
One of the paradox, it's paralyzed, it's that produce paralyzes than release.
And so many options that can choose to choose people can choose to choose for something very difficult to opposing for something that is to be very difficult for something
You ask you a very significant example of a very significant study about the investment of privacy.
A college was about the data that had access to the blood from Vary, which is a huge forest of the mountain of the mountains of the mountains and about 2,000 sees of employees.
And what it has been that for every 10 philes that give the employees that give the employees of participation with two percent.
Teen 50 foundations -- they are written 10 to 10 percent less you get to employees than if you give you a what?
Because with 50 foundations of mutually translated is the naid is the naid to choose what you want to choose and you can choose and you all of the hand.
And then then on the potttours and then the sample and the tunneling and of course, the whole thing that the mountains and of course, not worth come.
You know, you don't just mean that they don't only do the people will consume the food for dozen after the food, because they don't have any money to put the money to put a decision-making is so hard to put a decision-making is so hard to make the compensation of the compensation of the compensation that would give the employees of the compensation that would help the employees of the compensation that would be the employees of the employees of the people will be that they will be the death of the death of the consumption
I was looking at the left-hand leg from 5,000 dollars a year from the employees of the employees of the employees of compensation.
So the credit is a consequence when you have too many option.
And I think that does the world to look like this.
You really want to take the good decisions if it's for all the eernity, right?
You don't want to choose the foot of investment or not even wrong snapped for the wide.
So this is a effect. The second is that if we were able to get the strength and make a choice and make a little bit more satisfy to be less satisfy to the election of the election of choices.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that you take a lot of snapses for the people who are going to choose one and not a perfect -- and it's not perfect -- and you know, is perfect -- and you know, what?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better choice. And what happens is that the alternative that is that the alternative that you can imagine that alternative to require you to the election that you have to do and these rescues that you get to the satisfaction that you get to the election of the satisfaction that it was a good decision.
The more option you have the more options to require something that is the more that you have in the option that you have alese.
Secondly, what economists call the opportunity of opportunity.
Dan Gilber Gilber shot in this morning, and the way we are talking about what we are seeing things that we compare to what you compare to what you compare them to what you compare them.
Well, when I'm a lot of alternative alternative to have a lot of the tremendous amount of measurements that you have to imagine the characters that reject you to the alternative and that makes you less satisfy the alternative that you have a little bit satisfy that you have a little satisfilled by the alternative that you have a lot of satisfy of the character of the charged with the characteristices that you have to imagine the characteristices.
Here's an example. I ask the people who are not New Yorkes'
But here's how we should be able to raise it.
We have this box in Hamps.
A very expensive properties.
You can get the superbit. They have all the time. They have all the time.
What could you want to do more and less than the drug is thinking, it's auging it.
Everything from the book of Manhattan are leading to the box.
I could actually look at the office in front of the office two weeks of the idea that the rats of the idea that we had a place to have a place of parking parking place to have a place of parking place to have a place of part.
The water store and in the satisfaction that we have on the satisfaction that we have to choose is exceptional.
And the more options of them are being done in the way that the characteristics of these options are going to be perceiving new opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon a lot of things.
It tells us that we should live the mission and probably we should be doing things even even even the things begin.
But one of the things that they tell you is that anyone who are going to make other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things that you can have a lot of the facility of the factory and that will do less and so that you can do less and active.
Third the third route of expanding expands.
This is what I wanted to replace when I wanted to replace my bluegies.
I see almost all the time.
And there was a little eats that were the same as a single one and you buy them and you buy them and they were incredibly unlikely to be incredibly uncomfortable and if you get them to the long time and they would switch them staring better.
So I went to replace to replace after I got a few years of the old and I said, "Look, I want a wall of the beetles, I want a wall of the soul said, "You want to be the snaps' "Would you want to be the stretcheck for me?
You want to be with farmers or with farm or farming? You want to prevent or the beet?
Do you want to be the unit to be the require?
You want to avoid them, you want to rightly bright -- not fine.
He painted me after the shot after I said, "I want to be the guy to be the only guy who were the only guy who were the only one who was the only one who was a hour all the wall the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the right -- the truth -- the truth of the people I had.
I have a little better. All these options have done better for the options better.
But I was feeling worse I was feeling of it.
Why? I wrote a book I wrote a book that I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt worse is that I felt worse is that we had all these options of my expectations of my expanding walls have been a wall the goal.
We had very fast expectancy. I had no expected expectancy when they were just like a single sample of a single way.
Now when I'm 100 sorts of the times, one of them have to be perfect.
And what I got was good, but not perfect.
So I compare what I got to expect what we expect is that we were demanded in compared to what we were looking at what we hope to hope that we hope to hope that we hope to hope that we hope to hope that we hope to hope that we hope to hope what we were looking at what we expected what we were expected to do with what we expect what we expanding and what we were expecting to do with what we
The option of options in the lives of people can't do something else than to grow expect to grow on the expectations that people have to be those options.
And the right will lead to the higher satisfaction of satisfaction that if they get good results.
No one of the marketing world doesn't know that.
Because if I knew if you don't have the idea of what I'm talking about.
The real thing is about it.
The reason that everything was better when it was worse was worse that when everything was worse was worse than it was actually possible to experience the people to expert was actually going to be able to be done.
Today in the world that we live -- but we live -- but we have the ection of the countries that we expect the perfect thing -- the best thing you can hope that things will be so good thing you can say that things will be so good as you expect to be so good as you expect to be so good as you can say that the best waiting to be so good as we expect to be so much of the world that we can be
You never have a surprised because my expectations and my expectations and my expanding and to the end of my time.
The happiness of the happiness -- this is the secret -- the secret of happiness is to have expectance.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- that I actually have a logic and it's actually a wonderful hole and it's really to justice the green goes.
I couldn't find something better than it is. I didn't really have any better.
But you can expect your house not necessarily united.
And the end of a consequence of a bubble of a wall you can buy a little bit of a single one one is that you can't buy a single one one one one as you don't have a while, and you ask what is the answer.
The world is the bed. What could you be able to do you do?
When are hundreds of different stars of blueprints and buy one that you are disappointing and what?
It's just as a clear that answer.
You could have to choose better.
A hundred different kinds of flows of different waves to choose no scale.
So when people make decisions are making making the decisions are the good results of the choices are good enough.
The desperately errying the world in the last generation.
I think a big contribution -- not the only important thing to do is the only important thing to do is that people have been disappointed for synchrony because the standards are all that are all that are too high to the standards that are too high to the standards are too high to the state.
And when you have to explain these experiences are the houses of these experiences are her.
So the general result is that we do better, and we feel worse and feel worse worse.
So let me remind you to remind you.
This is the doctraveling, that all we think is really really really really really believe that really is true.
No discussion that you have a few choices better choices than nice, but here not the results are better than the choices are better than the others.
There's a magic. I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty sure that we have been able to do this point where the choice is the power of life.
Now, the idea -- almost we almost finally finally finally -- the thing that is this.
What allows that all these elections in the society is good at the materials.
There's a lot of places in the world and we heard about some of them where their problem is not that much of the people that have too much option.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the thing I'm talking about a strange problem of Western societies and rich modern and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich and rich issues of the thing about a range of the thing about a horse about a problem of my mind, is a terrible problem of the Western issues of the Western societies of
And what is frustrating and the south: Steve Levitt talks about how these chair car for children and hard to install these chair and hard to install the way you can get on the gap.
What I'm saying is that these options are these options on and complicated not only help.
They actually have a pair of pair.
They even do it worse we do to feel worse.
If something that allows us to do in our society to make all the elections that we do all the elections that are too puzzzle that people have too little that the lives of that people have been improvements of the lights of the amora.
This is what economists call the Pareto.
The Redwind will make us be better to be all the -- not just the people -- because of the way that this extension of the choices that extend to make sure that extend to make sure that extend us to make sure that we are more of choosing us.
In conclusion. It precles that book are the cartoon-and a sophistication of the fish you "Wo! What do you know?
You know nothing to do is possible, not in this accounting, a range of city, a mid-migration -- so I read it and I read it and the first time.
But the thing I thought I was going to think about it as I came to think of the caves of a lot.
Because the truth is that if you hope that everything to be possible, you don't have freedom to be freedom of the wild.
If you are the active of the active that everything is possible, the village of satisfaction.
You think about the credit and the village of satisfaction.
Anyone is that we need a variety.
This is almost too limited to a little bit of a fish -- probably even for a caves for us.
But the absence of a metaphor of metaphor for unhappy unhappiness and precision.
Thank you very much.
