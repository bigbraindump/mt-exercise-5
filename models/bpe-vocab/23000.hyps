And the last year, we argued these two diamoney, to demonstrate that the range of the last three million years was the last three million years ago was the last 48 million years ago was a little bit of 48 million status in the last 40-percent of the year.
But this moral moral morality because it doesn't look at this specific issue because the fossil of the flower of the fossil of the fossil of the flow.
The police is in a way, in a way, the heart of the global system that we have the global system of climate change.
She extended to the extend to the contracy.
The next next positive mountains will be a range of what happened to the next 25 years.
Give the pitch is the marine of the mice.
And as you see the blue of blue whole.
This is the anuesthesis in the time of the near time.
And it goes to the bottom of it.
About of the fall of a blue of five years or more than you can see is about five or more than a box.
In 25 years of this has come from this one.
This is a problem because the inner of the quality of the extension of the ocean's except of the ocean.
where the carbon is actually a massive amount of the ammed carbon oxyhated in the metal canopy of micro-catch micro-organisms.
Comparing the pollution of the global pollution of global pollution could take this flow of the atmosphere can take this extreme way that we go to this point.
In some of the wind of the Alaska metal disease is in Alaska is at the same.
The Katey Walter Walter at the University of Alaska was on the Alaska a little bit of a little tedly of the other side of the past.
Abes: Oh, yeah. She is OK --
And a reason why this enormous "wor" is Grow's Grow's Grows.
This is a range that all over the anual.
But the volumes are much more than they never have.
This is the Kangerlerusina, the Growin the Groadland.
If you want to know how much we create the whole bunch of the toilet is where it is where it is where it gets a big place.
These are debate are very quickly.
And at the other planet of planet, Antarctica of the largest planet.
The last people have reported as a result of the continent of the continent is the continent is the negative of the Antarctica of British in the British island of the Antarget on the top of the range of island in the past.
This is the equal equipment of the size of Genland.
In Himalaya, the mountain as the marriage of the glass of the new force of the new cycles, which was a few years old.
40 percent of the population of the world get half of the water from the water of these all of these all of these topians.
In the day, this guy, this guy, this guy.
They have ground.
But when it goes to the water and the water water water.
In California was a 40-percent of the Sierra wider range.
This affect the water is the water of water.
And predictable, as you read read it.
And on the whole global global creature's made to a dramatic creative creature.
And the dealing of the world have grew up with a huge range of the flower and flow.
four times more of the last 30 years of the 75 years of the 75-year-old girls.
This is a completely unusual.
If you look at the history of history in context you can see what happens.
In the last five years we add from the last five million dioxide of carbon dioxide every 24 hours of the oceans of the ocean.
Up to the About of the Pacific area of the Pacific area and every part of the American subject of the Again, and every one of the oxygen of the oxygen in the ocean.
The biggest way of the global warming global global warms, which represent of the global warms, which is the represent of the fossil of fossil fuels.
The Petrin is a problem and the cars is the most serious cars.
The United States is one of the two big empowerment of China.
And the proposal was to build a lot of factory for cars.
But we see a whole change.
Here are the people who have announced in the last few years, which is the produced produced.
Everybody is a fighting of our political political in our country.
And the carbon carbon carbon and the oil industry has spent a hundred dollars in the last year year of the last year --
The good character of what is a rich owned of the air.
This image of something like that.
In the Croute Crimes in Tenness, a billion gallons of style was impairy.
You can see the stir.
This is all the way of the board, the second desire in America has happened in the preparing Country Country Country COOOs.
One of the reamong the cartoons, about Country COOO, was this one.
Video: Yes, Frosy, the book with the cars, is a blue where, and you vessel.
It's from America, and it is in America, and help the economy.
Frosty, the gold with the book, it becomes more curve.
It's available and adorable work of the workers of the workers of the same.
Al Gore: This is the source of Virginial CCO.
The biggest one of the great career is the big chart of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blan: I want to be clear the clear of the Gore, Nani, Harry Reidwar of the Pose, Harry Reihabar would not be about what I am am I going to talk about.
Al Gore: So Aligaina Climit for the Climits of Clims.
This is one of them, a part of it.
Video: Actor: At COALi we see new new changes of our climate change.
So our main is to spend a lot of money for money for the public transportation that we can help us explore the real world of the sky.
The idea is the quote is not didn't.
We think it's a curious -- and you know,
So you don't get to the climate change for change.
You know, that's where we are.
Video: The good customer: You heard a map of it.
So you can do a tube to do a tough terrain this poem on the cartoons.
Us! Masininner is a gyponey.
But this is the sound of the technology of the book of the book of the character.
And as the cartoons are one of the main the global causes global remarkable technology of remarkable technology that you see the whole technology of the technology of the technology of the whole whole thing.
Up to the assumption, this is technology to the cartoon the cartoons.
Al Gore: In the last positive positive emotion of the economic challenges of the economic challenges and the problem with national security.
Video: Narrator: With America, the economy, the economy, the security of national;
The remen's law on all of the pollen on the bottom of the carbon carbon disorder: the good forest, but owned by the way,
But now we have a new solution to the new solution to the unemployment.
You can see, in America with electricity 100, in 10 years ago, in 10 years ago,
A plan to put America in America and then go to the third of the world is to help the stops and help the world the world of global warming.
In the end, a solution that is to help us solve our problems.
RB: You can be America. You can get more of it.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: Nove: It's about re--powered re-energy.
One of the most fast ways of encourage of the old policies of the old combat our old disorders that we have disorder, the Viagra is Vanic, a new request.
Barble: We invest to create the money to create the good platform.
Narrator: Ropopathletes. It's time for action.
Al Gore: The Gorean African African African which says, "If you go fast, you go fast?"
If you want to get to get to the hus!
We need to get it to get it out.
Thank you very much.
And the year at TED I did a TED Fler to LHCHCHCH.
And I promised it to give a data data about how they work is what they work on the device.
So for the people who were not here in the LHC is not the biggest experiment that was the biggest experiment that was the biggest experiment or 27 kilometers or is the Street or is the Stree or is to recreate a billion of a second to recreate a billion of a sequence of a second.
It's extremely this:
This is the Genevela.
We do photography these minds of the Bangs' inside of the decades.
I work at this one. It called ATLATLAS -- Lunger -- Lunnelephants, the mountain of 22 feet photographs here of ATLS photo.
On the 10 pppump we started the first time on the first time.
And this picture was a ATLAS.
It caused a celebration in the control of control.
It's a picture of the first picture of the number of particles that quote the LHCHCHC, the LHC, the LHCHC is LHC is a free in LHC is a lot of it.
In other words, when I saw that the picture of the seat 10 sex that the device that the device is a huge success.
I don't know if this received if he had a biggest oils, or when someone went on the Google and I see the first page of the first page.
It means I did a cultural impact on the langle of the impact of the impact of the evolution.
And after about a little bit of a story with the device, which actually had to do with these days, that was actually doing with these days.
Those are transporting 13 thousands of amperforms when the device is working at the mobile power to the moon.
Now, engineers from the arm of these days, "You can't transport the farmer and the transport." I'm not a lot of the amate."
But I can do that when they're at temperatures become what they call what the galls called the superconductor.
So as a 271 degree, there are more cold than the flower of the strength of these stem and can transport these guys.
At one of the layer of the CHCHCHCHCHCHC, was a cross of factory fact.
So that the company was enough, and the 13 thousands of amperforms have initially innostic resilience.
This was the result.
That's more impression, I think that the magnified of the magnify of 20 tone, and they move about 30 pocket --
So we deeply about 50 magnetic magney.
I had to get to do it, which we have it.
I reconfidented it all of the way we repart.
And now we go through the subterm and then in the subterm.
Pn at the end of the MagC campaign.
We will start to see it, and we get to see the data and we will get the data or the researchers and we will continue to find the tools that are the tools of the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, those accidents of discussion of scientists and engineers and engineers have to be able to break up to the extreme to break up the extreme to respect.
I think that the fact that it is that the way that we have young people that we have young young people like LHCHCHCHCHCHC.
And so I'm going to be the words of a man man man man man Humphrey Davavy, who I think that the applications of the protecting of the protection of the desire of the human rights of human human minds of human human human beings, and it's not more natural gas a human rights, and as a mysterious human beings, and as are not finding our natural phumps.
Thank you.
I want to remember the rate of you remember your childhood, when you play with your kids.
On the top of the source of the source of them and get them from the skills of the skills of the skills and -- you can also solve the problems of the hospitals.
The visual hospitals is profound about how we understand a lot of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the spreading of the hospital of the hospital of the hospitals of how we understand a lot of the way of understanding of how we understand a lot of the world of the world of the world.
So in the way of the IT artists who inspired the artists of our interactions with the interactions -- impressive people -- impression, my cold of Jeevan Kalan's collaboratory -- I was starting to be a computer -- I would be able to do when we use a computer -- I would be a computer to a computer that we can be both of the next few days, and we would be so much to the magical to be to the dive if we can be both of the magnitude and apple to the magical to the magical of this ununcomposition to the next to the next to the data to the magical interviewilience of this ununununtable to the magical efficiangratory of this ungains of this ununununununununununununununununununununununununst
She's looking at how we want to not?
This question was so fascinating was fascinating by the fascinating scientists to research, we put Swedly building Sissipells.
On the short Siftttable is a computer interaction of a bunch of a bit.
They can be manufacturer -- they can perform the reference can perform a while, and they have a screen and a radio and a radio and a radio of the radio of the radio of the radio of the Earth.
The most important is that there are palacably palacably like the game, you can only get the water.
And Sifer the example of an example of an ecosystem to the digital tools of the digital tool.
And on the top of the source of the tools become more palpable to the other, and the consistent of the other, and the things we can start explore all of our nutritions of new interactions and fall of us to interact with interaction.
I'm going to start with simple.
This Sifting is confidented to the video video of the video, and if you include the movie of the movie of the other part, if you include the other part, they include the other part,
These are the interactive interactive connections are the other side of the others.
So, if I put one of the other, they become interested.
If there are inconclusion, and they can become a little confussion.
You can feel like the mission and inclinic.
We realized that one of the interests of interactions of interactions is that we can use the strengths of the games, as we would be a lot of the light-to-to-the-hour of a hydrogen and a hydrogen pothese.
In this case we have three Sifweet spending up the style of voices and can use them to use the clothing that they will be among the center of the center, where they are going to be amed.
If we can get too much -- we can get a little bit of water.
There are also possibly interesting, for education, like education, like the mathematical language, mathematical language, mathematical and logical logical and the things we want to see people that we can see the results that they can see the results of the results of the result of the results of the visual education,
So here -- this is a Kbonacy, the Kbonacy, which I do with a simple cancer --
Here we have a game game game of words -- a kind of combined -- a kind of combined and Boggles on and Boggles.
So every single one of the first steps a letter in the end, and the map of the same, and they are very grew with a dictionary resident.
And then after about 30 seconds of the letters are residents, and you have a new set of intimate and we can have a new set of intimate.
Thank you.
These are children who came in the exhibition in exhibition of Media Media, and we reach them to work a material.
They like the craft.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of applications is that you don't need to do it.
Everything I need to say "From words -- they know exactly what to do.
Here are otherwise people to get it.
This is the most tangible testing -- the right of our right.
It turns out that everything that he wanted to do was to do with the Sifttable of the one of the other one.
So for him, for him.
This is a animal application of animal interactivity.
We wanted to build a tool, for those who invest language.
And this is French French --
He can introduce new persons in the stage of the strength of the Sweb that they can see the person's personalities.
This is the soil.
Video: The force of the end.
David Merrill: Now he introduced a tractor in the stage.
Video: The map of the portrait
Very y!
I mean, when Sifting and the Sifting one of the wind of the other's person, Video: Ham!
DM: I crew it up with narrative.
Video: H!
DM: It's a story with the end, and he decided, and he decided.
Video: Zobo, peak!
DM: The last example I would show you today is a device of created and interpretation of the music that we built the musical museum that we built the role of so-called the Sif, and all of the soil of soil and all be.
Every four different variations of these different variations that you want to use it.
And you can actually get a successful of succession that you can see the guy who guy.
You know, the sound of the sounds of the so-called Siftweet Swetweet Swettwed.
There are effects that we can control control control and control of the videos and the filter and the filter and the filter of the file.
You can see a certain sounds, and then include it and then include it to help hit for help.
It's the general effects like the general plant and the volume that are applied of His to see His to see His to see His to see Hip the size of the general effects of the general effects of the general effects of the general effects of the general effects of the general effects of the general effects.
Video: DM: We start with a rito rited in the second Sweb of success, we can argue a serious bit of a serious range of the rityer:
Now I put a basic line.
Video: YM: Now add advertising the dangerous.
Video: And now I'm going to add the video of the filter to control the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the green of the filter of Video: "YM: And I will advertie: I will add to you hear the filter of the filtraffic filter of the filter of the filter of the filtralized the top,
Video: DM: Power the third of the inclined inclined or something.
Video: YM: Now I think of the filter of the band and more expresent.
Video: YeaM: They can resect as much as much as much as a little as a little as a little as a little as a result.
So I don't have to do it, you can improvise, you can improvise, or the short or a long bread.
Now, in the end, I can find the enjoy of the Sifware using the Sif-shelter volume,
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is the interface, the passion of new interface, which is the right way that they work better with our body and the body body of our brain.
And today, I had time to show a coordination of this new hospital hospital of design, and as a design that I try and make them out of the lab.
The Ganda who wants to retiny is that we are at this new general tools of interacting with the new tools of interacting with the law of the rules of our rules of our rules.
Thank you very much.
These are the exciting of the nerve to talk to you.
I'm writing.
He wrote the books is my teacher, but of course, more than that.
It's my mother, my loads and fascinating, and fascinating a life of a life.
And I don't think that this is to change it.
But this is that it was like, something that was really grew up and in the book, which I tried to reach me to my own intreatment of the country.
And the fun thing is that I wrote this chart methow, this map of "Manan," which the Roage," which is the way that the main which I was really important for any of my brains, and it became a very important thing that we become this important piece of a very important piece of the world that we become this important piece of the International seller of this character of the International skill.
Research is like historical history, people go now, people are being convicted as they are being dead.
Serano -- confidence -- confidence.
In fact, if you get the example of the asked, "You don't know is the theater -- you don't have the theme that you can't even do that?
You don't have the theory of you write the life on the boy of the life of the life that you ever do that you ever do that every one of the world that ever ever do this?
It's very linked line.
But it was even worried if you don't have any of the time that I started to marriage 20 years ago, when I was adolescent people -- I want to be written by the way, I was written by the same kind of a African response of the same terror of the African reaction of the dead interface of the deep dead of the interface of the interface of the deeply of the interruption of the interact on the same kind of a range of interact --
And people said, "Don't have no one of the one of the success of success?"
I don't know that humility will be worked?
You don't know that you're going to work in this field of life and nothing will be in this field of a dady of a range of a dream of a dynamic fear with the one of the wild of the gy?"
Something like that.
The answer -- the answer -- the answer to all those questions is "Yeah."
Yeah, you have the theory of all of these things.
And I always reached me.
And you get the theory of the inner of other things that people are not able to do not have to do it.
As an example of the big example of the magical algorithms.
But when it's about the work that I thought I was all the question I was like, "Why is it "Why is it "Why is it "Why is it "wh?"
Is it something rational?
It's a lot, and it is to be able to be able to do that they feel like the Pame.
And what is that the specific specific initial creative is really true that we are really true of the health of the health of the health of the health of the health of the teaching of the teachers don't do it?
My father was a engineer and a chemist chemistry of the chemical engineer that you have a chemical chemical chemical to be asking if you don't have a chemical engineer to be a chemist.
It wasn't happened -- John, how does the chemical strength in the chemical?
It just doesn't happen to anything.
But we are also honestly chemical engineers that are not very clearly in the 20th century to be alone of the phrase of the phrase of the manipulation.
We write this innocent this reputation, and not only writing, but the artists are all sorts of things like this reputation to be strongly strongly and so on.
And all of us is to look at the numbers of the number of deadly deadly in the 20th century, in the 20th century, which they died by the way, and they died by young people and often often often died of the light.
And they actually didn't have the own thing that has no own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own light.
Norman Mailer, even though in the last time I was in the first interview, he told me that "EEach me a little bit more than my cart."
A great big big big data.
But we don't have any of the people that I hear anyone else that I heard that we heard these things like things that we heard these things that we have absorbed and cloud, and the idea that the creative and suffering, and the unfortunate of the artable and as arttty, it will always get a confidence.
And the question I want to advertising, you can all of this -- you can all of this idea?
You can comcomcomfortable -- because they see the eye of the eye -- I don't have the eye -- I don't have this state.
I think it's okay.
And I also think it's dangerous and I don't want to be a widely to be a curious future.
I think it's better if we encourage artistic to live artistic with the artists to live with the nasses.
And I know that in my case, in my case, in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to the card of this -- especially in the sky of this -- especially in which I think is a circumstance.
As a example, I'm pretty straight for 40 years.
I probably have a few decades of the work of the work of work.
And it's probably that I will write the incommonly with this moment of the things that came from the last thing that came from the last few days, and the last few days, right?
What would say the fall of the men, because of the whole thing that we are already friends, -- is very likely to be done.
Oh, God, what God!
This is the kind of gas to get someone to the win the morning, and I don't want to get that person to get that person
I mean to do this message that message that I love.
And then, the question of what?
And so I was looking at my meditation that I have to work now, for the manipulate thing to do is that by writing is by trying to write a biological construction of the psychological construction, right?
I had a way to find a way to step a distant distant distant distant to me, and my father who was writing, and my father who was going to be in the global law that I write a little bit of what I write about what I write about what I write to the thing to write about what I write it.
And as we all look at the last year of this sense, we started to look at the time, and we tried to find other society to find other society to see other society to be better and more healthy people about how we are creative people to be helping people are creative.
So researcher this has been able to Roma and Roma and Roma
So you know, the skills of the sky.
But in the Grerectent Roming Anoman Roming that creates people don't think of the human being being being in the human human gender,
People thought that creativity, was a spirit was a spirit of people who are coming to a source of people in a source and unintelligent and uns.
The name would be these are called the creative creatures of creative creatures "the term term terrorist "the ter" of the terrorist "the ter" of the human spirity"
Socrats was the fair that he thought has a demon that the intelligent of the intelligent of the department.
Roman were the same pared, but they call that spirit, the creative creature, genius --
What is great, because the romantic nounced as a genius was a black genius was a black hole.
They think a genius was a genius that magical entitself in the field of the field of of the artists, a kind of like Dobby, the journey of the artist's work and unknocked the original model of the work of the work of the workers of the workforce of the workers of the workforce of the workforce of the workers of the workers of the workers of the workforce of the workers of the working.
Absoldier -- this is that this is the distant that I was talking -- that I was talking -- that the building of the workers that we protect the result of the workers.
And all the world as it has to work -- right?
So the artist was protected protected by some of these things, like example, too much narcisely narratived, right?
If you can have the liallim was the strange of the world that you can get this as a genius that the world as well.
If the work was critical, it wasn't completely the drug was completely completely come from?
Everybody like the gender gender gender was ignorant.
I looked at the people in Vest creative for a long time.
And then came Renaster all of change, and it all of a certain idea, the idea of the map of the universe as a group of the university of all the way to the university of the universe, and the mysteries that are in the field of of creatures.
It was the human world at the rational rational, and people have started to create the creative of the individual creature.
And for the first time in history of people started talking to one or other, and the others as a genius as a genius.
And you have to marriage, I think it was a huge error error of error of the error of the error of the error to be able to marriage a bunch of big deal.
And if you think about a simple person, a simple person is actually the receptor is actually the receptor and the sweater and the surgical source of the mysteria, the four-the-the-rich music.
It's like you can see the sample of the so-called hareas.
And they just incovering and deforms of the genereas well.
I think that the present of this artistic artist's artistic in the last 500 years
And if it's true, and I think that is the question of the question is, what do we do?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we go back to the sensor of the relationship between people and the mysteries.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't just stand to control 500 years of human human rational at a talk of human rational at 18 minutes.
And that is probably in public public persons that would be absolutely unlikely to be absolutely the people that are actually getting the people that are actually going to the people present the people of the projects of the projects of the projects of the projects of the projects of the projects of the world of the world that would be done.
It probably doesn't want to be coopt on this idea.
But the question I want to do is -- why don't I do it?
Why don't we think about that?
Because it has a sense of how anything we heard about anything we've heard about the exexpensive explains the expensive process.
And the reason anyone who was trying to create something -- in fact, -- in the whole thing -- the whole thing that is that they always change the behavior.
And you know, sometimes can actually step can actually step out the right paranormal.
I had a lot of the enemy where I know that I met the American American American American Museum -- which has been in the American NSA, who has been in the case of the country that was going to be the story of the country that was going to work on the top of the road, and I just hear a pop of the cameras a pop of the cameras a poet on the room.
The story was like a vast vast vast of the air.
And it was the way of the campaign.
The point is that the income is the gyrich is the falls under the leg.
In that moment has a single thing that has a single thing -- "thanker."
And the wind as the water, and the houses of poppping the idea was to get a piece of map and a little bit like when he went to the map it through the map and put it on the map.
Sometimes it was not enough to the wind and the wind and the wind and the wind and the poor the poor the poem on the hole of the stem and the poems of the roof of the road, I read a poetry and a little bit of the room.
They were also the moment -- and the point of this is not going to look at the story of the story that the story as a lose.
Although the next home, the mountain and the poems of his own and the water, and the story of his own credit and the story of the other person was going to the other and the other and the other and the other.
The first thing of the code and the tragedy and then it was the map of the map of the map.
So in the situation, the poems of the application of the application of the first worst of the last thing at the first worse.
When I heard it -- it's the supranigner, was exactly how my own process of creative process of creative process.
My design design is not the limited to this -- I'm not drive!
I'm a catch, and the way I work on the same day and I go to the same and transparent and truck it and trick.
But even though I was in my inner and I was really excited about that phenomenon.
And I imagine that as you were like you with your you.
And I had the ideas of the ideas that they came from a source of the source that I don't know it.
And what do you all this?
And how we should rescue we should rescue that we should not lose our minds and we don't lose our minds, we can help us remote to use the range of the range of fall?
For me, the most relevant example of our daughters that we can do is what we can do is the musicians, I took a piece of the Waths of the reviewer with the resistant interview.
I was going to be about this subject was about the tool of his life was all the way to the artist artist artist, and to control the artist of the Chinese and gesting these impulses.
And when the time it was linked out of the story as a day as a day at the story of the work of Los Angeles and then everything happened.
While the driver, a lot of a short fragmented from a pig that comes in the minds of the shot and magical applied and magical and a while the re-endye, it's not about it, but it doesn't have to be like to the water, but it doesn't have to her, but it doesn't have to her, but it doesn't have to her,
It doesn't have a range of map, has no reporter in the map of the debt.
The whole thing that the screen of that ecanxiety of "About of the thing to lose the thing for the day for the day for the one thing to do.
I'm not enough to reus."
And instead of looking at the water, just wind up there.
He went through the process and he did something like something like this.
He raised the question of the sky, "You know, you don't see that I'm at the volan?"
"Can you write a check of a trump of a me?
If you really want to be able to be in a moment when you can do it in a little bit of you.
If you go and they get to another one.
You know, and they get the Leonar."
He was creative process of creative process.
Not the operation, not to be able to be on the same way that always happens.
But the process of the process, and the deep processing around the time, he was actually made the end of the day that the gene of the seller that the man was going to come back to where the road and then he didn't have to come back to the citizen and China.
It could be this collaborative and the great bizarre and the bizarre on the way of the external conversations that was not too as Tomanic as Tomano that was not too as Tomano --
And after what I heard the story of the story I started to change a little bit of how I was saved me a data.
This approach me when I was saved when I was at the middle of "Manan," and I was in a kind of a kind of a kind of disappearing that when I work with something that I was not a resisting to think about it will be a remarkable to think about it would be a lot of this is going to be a relevant to the end of this is that ever written to be a lot of the confear of the way to think of it was writing to be a report of the nowidely report that I ever ever ever ever ever ever written to be a lot of the repor
Not just that, but the most propositive I ever put it.
We just think of that I should just abandone.
I remember my dream of opening the hospital open-source hospitals.
I went to the look at the manuscrippled and I brought a computing of the cameras a cameras a cameras
I told you what you say: "Asculpa, and you know that if this book is not going to be extraordinary -- not just the great thing to be the extraordinary of my daughter?
Because you can see one of the one of the battery that I would have to say, and more than I can do.
So if you want to be better than you want to know the device and you have to do your own side.
Okay. And if you don't do that, you know, at all.
I would write that is my message to my message.
And I want to consensus today I did this thing I did was my third of my third of the hemer."
Because -- the Conclusion -- the Conclusion of African African people get to the North Africans are not going to add the people of the people of the ribbbs and music.
And they were always wonderful, because the dancers were remarkable teachers were remarkable and they were remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be a great deal.
But sometimes they are very roughly what the interpret of interpret with the community.
I'm convinced you you all know what I'm talking about, because you all know you see a certain thing, a certain thing, like this interpretation of interpretation.
It's like the time when the dance, the dancing is through a kind of part, you know, it's not different than the other 1,000 of the other 1,000 of them -- all of the other 1,000 countries, all of the other 1,000 sers.
So this time is not in the whole thing that was in the whole bunch of man.
It's the list of the right-hand is the air flows of the forest of the forest of the food.
And as if they were the people who have been talking about what they were called the name.
and they have the wind and they were able to scanning scans, "Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, GD, Game, Game, Game, Game, Game, Game, Gamam,"
It's God.
A history of the history of interesting, when the map -- when the Spanish had been invested with this blue and the pronounced in "Alle" in Alloa" in "Alle" in "Alloa" in "Alle" "Holh, Alleh," "Alle" in "Allehemispinal historic."
and they hear the time in the fight of the judgment of the flowers.
In Spania, when a interpret interpret something that impossible and the magic is the Allaw, Allah, the Allaw, Allah, magician, the ar."
It is intelligent -- a God of God's Goda.
It's wonderful, because we need that.
But the second part of the next day that the next morning, when the dancing is that the big thing that is that the big thing and it's not a lot of the Diver and the Diver of the Diver of the Diver of the Divenge.
It's a dirt that you get the genomes and the genomes and they might not be more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more dirato disorder.
Can you do not even more to the name of the Domas the name of the name of the word that we should be able to do with the rest of the rest of the list of the list of life?
It's hard.
It's one of the most paintings of the creative creature.
But it can't be a sample if you don't think of the big part, that you have no part, like the most extraordinary part, and the most extraordinary part.
If you just think if you were immense of a source of acumb a source of a few days. The next thing to be a database of the next few days, when they moment.
If we think about this is that we all start to change.
So I started thinking and I thought that I was sure that the last months of thing that will be publishing the story that will be publishing up on the stepping of my confidence of my suck.
And what I do, what I do when you get the clean water, you don't have any of the husband -- you know, you are not.
I won't spread. You just go and just the confidence of the Contintiny of your party, anybody else would be her.
If you get the dance, then you can dance.
If the gender gender gender is what you do is repartied to make the extraordinary decision, even for a great spinal to the deforce of the force of the force of the human force of the gence of the gene of the gene of the gender of the disorders of gene and the gene of the gene of the diritting of the gene of
And if no, they go anything.
And with you, "thle!" for you.
I think we should have to pretend to pretend to prevent them.
Yeah!" and you still have, because you can have a loaded loads and inforce and inforce the end,
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I talked about some of these projects, and what they could do is to predict the genome, and what they might be able to discover new genes.
Now we start with a new point of point: we digital biology, and now we're trying to start to start to start from this digital mastery, and we go into a new biologist, and to go to a new biologist, modeling force and encourage force and encourage force and force force of life.
We tried to do all the time to ask questions.
"What is life that I think many biologists have tried to understand how many biologists have tried to understand variety of variety of variety of various levels.
We tried different approaches, simplified life on the data.
We are already about 20 years.
When we sequenced the human genome, this is a man from the analogy of biology in the digital digital technology.
Now we try to ask the question: Can we resistance, or we can create new forces in this digital universe of life, in this digital universe of life, in this universal universal university?
This is the map of a little organism Mycodies that has the genitalian for a species that can replant species that can replant species in the lab.
We tried to see if we can come if we can come with a genome.
We were able to get a number of genes of a gene of a gene of the gene of 500 who are there.
But when we look at the metabolic map is pretty simple, is pretty simple, is pretty simple,
I think that's simple.
But when we look at all of the genes we can get the first time to a single single cell is probably a little bit of life that you can actually produce a life of life.
So we decided that the only way that we actually do this cross that we can do this phosphilosophical components to the most fundamental components to the most fundamental component to the questions.
And so I started on the road, "Can we have a cross-gene cross?"
Can you chemistry allows these molecules that we never made the big molecule that we ever did not do it?
And if we can activig a cross of a cross?
A range of the phosphantom of the chemical material of chemical material.
So, our speed life to digital life grew up at a ritself to a ritic.
Our ability to describe the genetic code, but it was really started, but it was ground.
The last time he came to a curve on a exponential curve.
I started this about 15 years ago.
I went through a few hours, starting to actually -- in fact, with a bio-et-et-et-et-et-et-the-the-to-the-the-ended experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult.
There are 10 thousand the cars that make little DNA, the little DNA, but it's a lot of DNA, but it's a general process, but it's a general processes, so that what you build a lot of ertain, with a lot of ertain.
So we had to create a new methods to put these little bits and the right of these little bits and the right of the error of the errors.
This was our first tentative, interact with the digital information from the digital information of the Ph.D. H: The phenomenon of Physical A4.
It's a virus that human gender.
I made the new new new new design of the sketches, and we have a molecule of DNA that we have a molecule on a DNA that only about 5,000 letters.
The interesting interesting thing that I took this piece of chemical material, and we put it in the bacteria, and we put it in bacteria, and bacteria started to read this genetic code, and to produced this virus.
The viral muscle was then released in the cells and they have been back and forth cells.
I was going to see the oil of the oil industry and they said, "We understand that this model.
They have laughing more than you.
And so we think that's a situation where the software can actually build their own map in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something more than that.
We wanted to build the whole range of bacteria a bacteria.
This is over 58,000 feet of genetic code.
So we said, we have to put the wall of the box of the virus to see the viruses to see the size of the size of the size of a cell phenomenon of a cell phones that are the cells of a cell phone.
And the design is critical to the digital information is critical to the digital information of the computer needs of the computer needs of being very accurate.
When I sequenced this genomine genome, the standard of the presence of the pells of a 10,000 of walls of the bottom of 10 thousand the basis of a bunch of different shape.
I found out of the remote revenue, 30 to the origin the original reef, this would never be activated.
The design is the design of the design of the forest of the 50 letters, which has to be a little bit of the other hands of 50 letting those other pieces of these other pieces of sub-stance -- so we can design some of the other other people.
We create elements.
You can read that I read "marks" in the house. GDP at this, we have a genetic code, we have a genetic code, and T.
Trike out of those letters, those little coffee about 20 remember a number of remember a literally laid -- a single opposes every remember every author of a lot of the free.
So we can use the code to write words, the quarter of the beets.
And the reason we did was to hear was a code.
Some of them were disappointed that is not poetry is poetry.
We design these joined so that we can deer the enzyme.
I'm sorry, and I'm reparing them.
So we started doing the gunt with the guns of five to a few little bit, and then we go through 24,000 letters to do it by 24,000 lets the wild of these laws, and then they go to 700.
Every time we have these joined joke, we can get to sequences them to sequences a very rob, and we try to create a very range of -- as you can see a very rough process.
We try to get to get that the automative.
So, this looks like a baskety of the basket.
When we get to the market stories, over 100,000 walls of the bottom of 100,000 walls of E.
They are all modern biology of biology of biology molecules.
So we were really right to other hand.
I knew there is a mechanism called recombination of human biology that biology using DNA, which is using DNA, and that they can reach the gain.
This is an example.
There's a organism called Deinocockkitchen radioo that can be the volcane of radiation.
As you can see in the panel in the cross is of the skills is frogs in the kitchen.
12 hours of the 24 hours later, he put out of the layer of the mountain.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be being stated.
I can live in light.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the exhibition in space space to move a new environment, to go through a new environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is actually happening there.
Here is a micrographic microbes that we build these propelled using these propellyfish law with the skilled of the skilled of the sky of the sketches that we put on the screen.
Drodia machine.
This is not a picture of a microscope, but just a little dolphins a microphone-micrographical phones.
It's so a molecular molecule that we can see a microscope.
These are collecting over a year of about about about six seconds.
That's a public audience that we had a little time.
These are over 58,000 feet of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecular molecule ever made people of people with a define structure.
It has a mass of the molecular molecule.
If we get a 10 and a half of space, 142 pages of a 142 pages to get this genetic code.
So, how do we start a cross of the genome? How do you do?
Since a virus is pretty easy to be a virus as well.
But it's much more complicated with bacteria with bacteria here.
And you also have more easy when you get to the eubique, you can only get to the other: you can just put the nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear --
With the archair, the gall-back, but we showed that we can show that we can do a completely completely different cross of a completely different cross of a cell phosphenomenon of a cell phosphenomenon of the stem cells to be able to activate the arm, and we can active.
We had a check of a microbial species of microbial species of microbial species of microbial species of microbial species of microbial species of the species of the species of a microbial species of the species of a microbial spectrum.
Those are about as much as people and the people and the cloud.
We added some genes in the plus to go to this cross for this cross for this cross of the cross of this cross--genome.
I was looking at the enzymes to the protein.
And it was pretty amazing, when I put in the cell -- you will appreciate our phenomenal philosophical -- and the the phosphorosope.
In fact, we thought this is how far it can go and go and I tried to design the process of something like something like something like this.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are all sorts of species that have been able to do a second cross or a second cross of the treatment, or a three-dimensional characteristic characteristic characteristic characterized in a second.
So those who are thinking about evolution that only one gene gender is that one gene of biology.
I'm called the restrices, called restriction, which actually had the DNA.
The human human genomes was in the cell phone is not a
The human genomes -- the human human genome.
It was except and I recognized the other cross that the other cross like the skyze, and so we came up with the phosososphorosope.
It became blue of genes that we put in the cross that we put in the cross of the cross of the genosis.
And after a very short time -- all the characteristics of a species have lost a new species of a new species have lost a new species of the program that we put in the program that we put in the cell.
All the proteins were changing, membranes -- when we think about the genetic code -- when we look at the genetic code.
This can sound like alchemistry as alpha genome, but we can also change the same stuff, we can change things pretty much like this.
Now, we hear that this is not genesis, but it has been genesis, and half years ago, and we suspect that can be a new version of evolution to create a new version of the Tuescala, in which which which has a new specific specific fic specifically a new specific specific design of the digital technology.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty obvious about it.
We're on the way to go from six billion people over over 40 years of people over 40 years.
I want to do that in context for me in the context I was born in 1946.
There are three people on the planet, for every one of us in 1946; in 40 years will be four.
We have problems of the rich problems of water water -- the drugs of poverty, commonly and a half billion and a half of six billion and a half of six billion and a half of them.
I will be difficult to do for a new one.
We use over five billion of the book, more than 30 billion of the boxes of oil oil oil oil of oil oil oil
This means a hundred million barrier boys.
When we try to think about properly biological or anything that is going to be a huge challenge.
And then of course, is all that CO2 at this material, which is all that it gets in the atmosphere.
Now, from our discoveries of the discovery the data we have a data data with gene, and I like to think about these kinds of things like this design as a design of the design of the design of the future.
The electronics has only a hundred electronics has only a hundred of the component of the various components that came out of that.
We are limited here, in the first step, a biological reality.
We now have the technical techniques of these kinds of falls of gender genuines, combined gender genimics.
We have the ability to build a big robot that make a million cross on the day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of genes of genes or try to optimize the profound property to produce the pharmaceutical trial, or product of our pharmaceutical molecules, we can only change the last 20 years, we can actually more biology than the last 20 years, the whole technology.
And that's just a standard of standard.
We can select for human beings, chemical production or chemical fuels, productivity, productivity production, which is the production of vaccines, which is the gone.
This is an ecology of a design design of a design of design that we can see and work at these species in the computers in the computer.
You know, we don't know what it will show you.
We know exactly how their genetic code.
We are focused on the fifth of the generation.
You see that in the Art in the Art is just a confidence experiment.
We have combat the second generation of the next generation that are going to be sweating, which are often often often often often are often often often as much as the canopy of the year, or different kinds of flow.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact on the various costs of food and the flower costs of the limited system, and we work is if we start with the cell phone to design for the cells to design the cellular of the next fourth of the generation of the generation of the generation of the next fourth of the generation of the generation of the next month.
The solar and CO2 is a methotic methods -- but in our discoveries of other ways of the world we have all kinds of different method.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It goes into the ocean's ocean, about two kilometers and half a millady of the temperatures of the temperatures of the falls of the farming of the farming of the ocean.
Transform CO2 in metan use of hydrogen molecular like the source of energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 capital that can be easily transported in the country, and we conversate that CO2 starts in the O2 stars to the CO2 to the process it.
So in a short time of time, we think we could have the question of what is the question of "What is life --
We really know -- you know -- we have objects of the chemical model of the chemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where in the other paradig?
So let me become a very energy source of energy.
But we also work to use these same sources to invest to invention the buildings that are just going to invest vaccines.
You see this year with the snape, we're always at a year and a dollar child is when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think the situation can be changing vaccinated by vaccines every dinner.
And this is how to look at the future of change, we can now look at the evolution of evolution, accelerating the evolution of bacteria with bacteria and finally, the enemy.
We are about people.
Our idea is just to make sure that we have a lot of enough, we have a lot of fast to survive. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you the first one, is a fundamental work of the fundamental technology that I add it to Microsoft a new part, a year of a year at a year ago, this is Sealo.
It's a average environment that can interact with a distant amount of visual data visual data.
We look at a lot of the digital poor a digital poor on the digital and the magical and the subject of this -- rearguing through this, rearized it.
It doesn't know how much information we look at the information and how big data is these columns or how big the college.
Most are doing with a virtual digital camera, but this is this one of the next year, for example, is a Congress of the U.K.
It's not important because the only thing that we should limitate the performance of a system of the skin of your monitoring the number of your monitoring at a very ffingly of your own month.
This is a book of a book for non-imaginativity.
It's about "Catheist" Charles Dickens. The Dickens.
So to show you is what the text, and not a imagine, and we can't do anything that is really a reference of a text; it's not a positive interface, it's not a picture of a text; it's not a picture of it.
Maybe this is a artificial way to read a book in the electronic form.
I would not recommend.
This is a word. It's a "Gardianult "Gardianned.
Every picture is the beginning of a second.
This is really a piece of experiences of a list of reading a parties of a revia or a resistant environment, which is inherent a multi-dimensional.
We did something smell with this little cold of this number of the Gardian of Gardian of Gardian
We created a reclear reaming solar -- much more than in any other than in any cloud -- and we reconfidented a confidence.
If you see the properties of this car, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the technical species.
And this really through some ideas, the dead of the limits of a monitory of a monitor.
We perform this is to be the pop-based pop-based popizing and otherwise that -- which are not necessary.
Of course, the mapping of the applications for a technology of technology that stuff.
I'm not going to say a lot of time on this, but only to tell you that we have to tell you that we have contributed to this field.
These are all the way in the United States of the United States images from NASA.
Let's go to now --
This is actually active on the Internet, you can grew up the Internet.
This is a project called Posynon, who are actually getting different technology. Once the two different technology. Where is Sealoon and the other other scientific research in the field of visual language.
and Rick Szeliski at Cerhel. We are beautiful.
So this is active active on the Internet.
You can see that when we create this perspective, when we can not have this kind of perspective, we can have this kind of experience.
But the art of space space of these images of these images.
Algald visual perception of visual perception, so that they can replease the real space where these things are doing with the mountains -- all of the Genforces of the Western -- they were made by the Country and see these elements, and these tools of a new ideal ideas.
I'm not sure if I just want to show you other media.
There are some more than the space.
I would like to go to one of the original corner of Noah -- this does a lot of the Posynap, the Playnth of Posynt -- to show you what the technology is the technology that we know what the technology that we have to do not necessarily except the technology of this technology.
We had to have a lot of the legal aspects of the legal aspect of the legal aspect of the legal aspects of the things that we had to have to be worth of the things I had to have to be worried about the issues of the legal aspects of the world.
This is a Crabyte Cityman of Dams in the Damr. Two Two Glicken Numro Flickr, and you find something with with the guy, and you find out of these conportraits of these conported images of these conportraits of these conported patterns of these conportraits of the skills of the skills of the Chadis that they were in this model.
These are the Flickr, and all of the relationship of spaces in this way.
We can just not not be in this moon.
You know, I never thought I never thought I will get to work is very great, is very great, I have a conceived here.
I don't see that I'm noticed that I'm a lot of the camera, all of the stem cells at the phones at SLR-R-LLR-R-L-R-R-L-R-R-LLR-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-L-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-L-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-L-R-R-R-R-R-L-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-L
If I think about these strange strange ways.
There are so many of fear, falling feeding to girl.
One will be here here -- okay.
This is a poster with Nobel was recorded the right of Denagager was record.
You can get the poster of the poster environment of this environment.
The idea is that I can do some things with social environment. This means to collect the whole data from all of the world -- from all of the world -- and to interact with the Earth -- and interconnected them -- and interconnected to the whole thing that is more stuck than the treatment.
You have a model of what the planet is the entire Earth is.
Think about this as a coast of Stephen Lawler Stephen Lawler of the Virtualle."
And this creative complexity as we use the world as well as the world as much as we use of the use of use of users.
The design is the poor are the metal of metaphor to the meter.
If someone would all these same, and they would say, who are the picture of my Nature with the NDs of NDs of NDs would improve the NDs would be using this space to get that the social experience.
And of course, a produced but all of these are the huge amount of virtual models and the virtual patterns of the Earth's interesting, collecting not only from the earth of the Earth and images in the village of the village of the village of the village of the city.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understands that allows you to vote the software of your software is that in the next few years, is that all the pictures of the pictures of someone in the world of the picture?
BAA: Yeah. Which is to depressed.
It creates hyperper-connected to the image.
And it does that based on the imagery.
And this is becoming a quote when you think about the significant information that they have these images.
As you do a look at the imagery of the image, and the text of the Internet of the Internet is a lot of information on the Internet, and the textbook is --
Now, what would be if that positive positive the connection to all the picture?
And then the amount of interconnection and the disease that we know from this is a lot of the remote of the remote of the network.
CA: Blaise, is really incredible. Felics.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of the intense of the journey of researchers is to live is the ancient of the ancient of the people who don't look at the old the old strength of the style of the road, and they still get him in the roof of of of plants.
You don't know that the Jaguary, Jaguary, or that I still want to the Lace, or that the old Middle Eastern Himalaia is to the Himalaharm of Dharala's revelation of the world that we live in a center of anthropology, and this is not just a sense of roughly -- but this is just a very sensitive modeling model of reality.
The consequence of a certain set of decisions that we have been doing the base of our ancestors and with some generations of the generations of the generations of the generations of the next generations of the generations of the generations of a certain generations.
And of course, we all share that we share the same adaptive adaptive adaptive adaptive and imperative adaptive action.
We all are born to all of us.
We are in the initial ritual rate of inition.
We need to do the separate of the moral dead, so we should be surprising that all the songs, with all the songs we all have the art.
But what is interesting is that the dealing of songs, the rate of the man in every culture.
It is that the Pennia Boro, or the jellyfishero, or the wall of Vooka or war or war in the Hisseat Cururt Curreathetics of the Antarres.
And then this is the guy who I traveling through the desire now a long style of the Quans, or Evered, Evered, Evered, the Evereign range,
All of these people are actually working on the other ways of flows of flows of thinking about the other ways of thinking of the Earth.
And this idea, if you think about it, you can't get your hope.
Now, the range of culture of the world together is a spiral life of spiral life and cultural life that code and the cultural health of the planet, and it's also important for the biological health, we know that the biological required.
And you could think about this review of life as being the ethical and you could defosphalanosphalanospherosphalanes, the intuitive of the human minds of the human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagination.
Etnosphere human beings.
It's the symbol of what we can be like a surprising spectrum of the ideas.
And as the biosphere was the heroes, so and the nosphalanospherosphalantom -- and maybe at a much larger scale.
For example, no biophical would not be happy to suggest that half or more of all the species of all the species of all the species of the except of the except of the range of the biological scenario -- the most optimistic biological scenario -- the most optimistic field of what we know in the field of what we know in the context of the cultural level.
And the biggest indicator of this is designing is a lot of this application.
When you were born you, the people in this room, there were 6,000 language.
Now, a language, not only is a voyage or a set of rules of rules of freedom of rules.
A language, a language. It's a human spirit of human spirits.
It's the size of the surface of the flower of the flower particles get into the material.
Every language, is a old language, a reception, a reception, a quote, a fishing ecosystem to the spiritual possibilities.
And in those 6,000 language, we now know that in Monterey, a half of the Turty, a half of the children.
I'm not learning about babies that means that if they don't really change something that is that they are already changing language.
What can be more than you are to be able to be the last link of the cloud, you don't have the last one of the way to prevent language, you don't have the way of presence or the human human beings?
And yet that soon as a soon is actually the unknown as a little somewhere in the Earth is about every two weeks because every two weeks ago, a week, a old old old old language.
And I know some of you would say, "Well, would be they say, "Yeah, don't be better?
I would be a better place if I all talk to a single language, I said, "Grozav, that was the language that is the U.K. or Cantica.
Or to be Kogi."
And you can discover that you would have to be able to talk to you to talk about your own language.
So what I want to do today with you is a kind of a journey -- a short journey -- a short journey in order to try and make a sense of what they lose to do with what they lose to do with what they want.
Now, there are many of us to look at that when I say "ways of being," I really understand ways to beaten different ways.
So let's take this one of example of the Barash of the House Amazon the north of the Middle of the His -- they came in the room, they came in the room, in the Cestycloud of the rights of the style of this kids's rights.
This is a popor that through the blue of blue blue blue because the blue of the skin is equal correct of the forest of the people that people depend on the box that people depend on the ground.
I have a language and the rules and the rules that they call the exoil: You need to get the whole thing with someone who talks about a language.
And all of these are deadly in the past, yet there's a big thing that is a lot of these days, where the long lights and seven languages where they are not hear on the interface, not hear a language.

Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some of the things that I hope that they hope will be honest with other things that you heard that you heard that you would have heard some of the things that you would have to do it.
I want to start with what I call "the doct."
Docchrony what?
Docchrony all of the Western society.
And this doctor is like this: if we are interested in the way we are interested in the good levels of the citizens, the quarter of the citizens, the quest of individual freedom of individual freedom of individual freedom of individual freedom of individual booms of individual wood.
The reason is so freedom is so freedom is so good -- the value of the bed, which is the key to be many, which is to be man.
And because if people are free then people can act with individual and make things that are going to be the good things that are going to decide to decide in our place.
The only thing to maximize the freedom is the maximum of choice.
The more choices are the choices that people have more freedom of freedom of freedom of the freedom of the most freedom of the freedom of the dead.
Then, I think it's so good in our castonishing the system that would not get to put it through the husband and and it would be able to put it on the side.
And it's deeply to our lives in our lives of our lives.
I'll give you a couple of examples of what made for us to do is what the last time in the last time.
This is a supermarket.
I want to say two words about the words for safe.
175 sample stem in the supermarket, that if you don't cover the 10 different kinds of watts and the 10 different kinds of falls and the 12 hours, and the 12 hours, the 12 hours, the 175-year-old guards that you can buy the next 75 of the 75 of the 75 of the 75-year-old stage of the 75-year-old stage in the 755-dogs that are not to the re-scale of the state.
So it's like the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronics of the electronic components to confused a stereo -- the box, CD -- the halls of the stereotype, which is the same, which is the remote of the skin and then you go on.
And in this process of electronics are a plastic component of the electronic systems of systems here.
We can confessed six million of systems and half million of the components of the components that are in the device.
You have to recognize that that means a lot of options.
In other ways, the world -- in the world of communications.
It was a poetry I was kids; when you first have any kind of service service as a result of the phonroof of of MBell's Leaker Bell.
The phones; you don't buy it.
And then the consequence of this consequence was that the phone is that never the sky.
And those days are a lot of water.
Now, we have a different diversity of phones, especially in the philosophical world of mobile phones in the telephones.
These are mobilizes of the future.
My prefer is at the middle -- with MP3 player, the apartment of the nam of the nose of the nose.
And if you saw you still have seen in the stage of store and you can see it in the curves of it.
And the result is that they do people to the people to get this question.
And you know what the answer is the answer to the question?
The answer is no "No." It's not possible to buy a phone that you don't know is too much of it.
And in other field of lights that are much more important than buy is the developing countries that are the number of options.
The health system -- in the United States -- in the United States is not worries you about what you do you want.
Instead, you go to the doctor and this is you say, well, we have the various and the various various of B.
It has these advanced advantage and these risks.
BBBy has these advantage and these risks. What do you want to do?
And you say, "Dock what do you do?" And the doctor, the doctor, has has these advantage and these drugs and the risks and the risks.
What do you want to do?
And you say, "But if you were in my place where you can do you do it, the doct?" And the word "But I'm not in your place -- I say, "You know, the patient is -- I say, "Min" and the patient thing that makes a lot of it.
But what is actually a transistent transparency, and decipheres of the decisions of someone who knows something -- in the case -- at the case -- at the best disease -- to do that is not just like the best form of the best form of the people of the best form of the patient.
There are a huge level, for public medical medical medical medical medical medical medical medical medical medical medical medical medical medical medical medical medical -- if you think about it, it has no no love, because we can't buy it.
Why are we add people are people that we don't have to buy them it?
The answer is that the people who do this is that we do this is that we are to be the doctors in the morning, and we want to change our country.
Something that our identity has become a choice, and this is a choice, and this transition of the role of the role of the role of of the role of of the role of the role of the way that the identity of the identity of our identity as a result of our identity as a result.
We don't really change our own identity but we have possibly have possibility to a invention.
And we can reinvest that we have any check.
And that means that every day when you go to the people who are need to be able to decide what you want to bee.
However, and the fall of the fall of the family that there was a pop that the concept that I had to get the way that the people who had to get the kids like the more likely to have the children of the children as well as the children as well as you reach the children to have the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children
The opposite was with the phones, not when you do that, and there are no one of them.
Our daughters is very much about it.
I remember the incredibly intelligent students and I give them 20 percent of the thing that I was doing it.
And that's not a little bit more desire to be less than the map.
You know, because I'm prepared with all sorts of questions "should be sell? You should be able to do it?
I should be in the way I would have to be my kids, or a card or a card or a card question?
And they will answer to these questions, whether they do not do not do and do all the strows that they don't have to do it, and they don't have a good notice to the source of my sources.
And that's also what they need to do. These are important questions that we need to answer it.
Munt -- we're blessed -- as the Kl and Carl and Carl and Carl to the technology that allows us to work in every single day -- more than any of the West in the Wester-AVV,
And then there is a country in a colleague, which I didn't want to revealing anyone who work on the so-called the French of the relationship.
I will tell you about it, because I want to use it.
So this incredible means that incredible freedom to choose that we have to choose with work, and it's that we need to take a decision, and in the world, and in the world, and we should be working on.
We can go to see how our games and we have the mountain and we have the mobile phone, and the Blackberryra and the philosophy of the genyones.
And even if there are all closed every mind, and all of us as a little bit of a football, we wonder what we should we say, "Can we have to answer this water?
I should say, "Would we be written to write the theory? We should write this meet?" And even if the answer is that the question of the question of the question of your daughter of the base of the sky of how would be a lot of about what it was going to be done.
So in the end, things that we are different and the things that are the things that are a style of life, life is a little bit of options.
And the world I was living like that.
So I said, I had some choices that I had some choices of option -- but it wasn't a different thing.
And the world where we live there.
And the question is, right?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what I'm good at that, so I'm going to talk about what I'm going to talk about what is going to do.
All these choices have two choices of these negatives, two negative effects on people.
One of the effect, is that paradoxically, is that produce paralyze, more than release.
So many options that can choose choice, people are really difficult to choose to opathletes for something like that.
You give you a very significant example of a study of investigations in the investment of the private investigation.
A colleague had access to the data from Valley of the participants from Valtel of the mountain of the mountain of a million of employees and about 2,000 of the employees of the employees.
And what it was that for every 10 foundations that they are moving, the employees of participants that are remote with two properly provides two properly profound two property properly profound two property property of each of the 10 commons of the next 10 to each 10 of the next 10 to the next 10 to each of the next 10 computations of the conversation.
Two 50 foundations -- they are now written with 10 percent of the employees than if you have to get the other side.
Because with 50 different kinds of movement that are going to choose is to choose the naid of the naid to choose what you want to choose and so on.
And then on the poor and then the clean and then the cloud, and then the cloud, and of course, the cloud and of course, it doesn't see.
You know, you get that that doesn't mean that they can only take the dogs that we have to eat the bottom because they don't have enough money to put money on a decision of a decision of a decision of a decision of a decision of the compensants of the compensants of the compensants that they would help the employees of the compensing.
And by by the way, I give you a little bit of the employees from the employees of the employees of the employees of compensing.
So the creature's consequence when you have too many options.
And I think that does that make a bit like that.
You want to ask the decision, if it's for all the best of the eternity, right?
You don't want to choose or choices of investment or not, or not,
So this is a second is that we can actually do it and if we were able to go ahead and do it a choice and we will be less than we were doing a little bit of the choices that we were going to be a little bit of options that we are choosing the choice.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of the people is that had a lot of snapped for a boss that if you go to choose if you go to the one -- but you know, what?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better choosing the alternatives that is that alternative is that alternative to regret you in the election of choices that you have in the village of the election of the election that you can actually do if this is a good decision-doing doing doing that if it was a good decision.
The more opposite of options, the more opposite to regret something that you have is disappointed with the option of the option that you have a little bit of the option of the option of the option of the option of the option of options.
Secondly, what economists call the opportunity cost.
Dan Gilber shows very very clear in this morning in this morning, we often see things that we see the things that we can see it.
Well, when I'm a lot of alternative alternatively to think about the potential analyze the characteristics of the potential applications that are made a lot of the alternative alternative that you have a little bit of the alternative that you have a little bit of a lot of satellitesot.
Here's an example. I ask, I ask, I'm not New Yorkers.
But there's some of the way we should be pleasure.
So we have this box in Hambers.
A very expensive property range.
You can get a superbit. They have a great day to them. They have to do.
What could you want to want to do it more sounds like the drug is aughte: "It's aud" --
Everybody in Manhattan is my card are left to be lot.
I could like in front of the office. And I spend two weeks of the first weeks of the idea that the idea that the houses that wonderful.
The rights of the opportunity of the village that we have on the election that we have the choices that we choose is that we choose is that we choose is that we choose is that we choose is to choose is in the road.
And the more options of the options of the opposite of these opposite options will be performing these options as we are being perceived as a opportunity.
Here's another example.
This characteristics tells a lot of stuff.
We would say we should live the caught and we probably need to live things right now.
But one of the things that says is that anyone who says anyone choose a choice is to do not do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of lightweight and that you do what you do you do something like you do about what you do you do something like you can do it.
Those three, except of ways.
That I loved when I wanted to replace my bluegies.
Port blueprint of the time.
And there was a poetry that they were a single kind of like you bought to be a single one and they were incredibly unclear and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you haven't seen it for a lot of time and they are starting to hear it.
So I went to my blind my girls, and I got a good day and I said, "Look, I want to say, "Up" -- I want to be the measure." And the word "You want to be the same, what?
You want to be with the farmer? You want to preper or your fear or your wealth?
Do you want to be a now?
You want to eventually, you want to get rid to the bblind --
He painted his face and she said, "I said, "I want to be a guy who was the only guy who was the only one of the guy who was a hurt idea, and I spent a city of the wall of the wall of the way -- the real thing -- the real thing -- the real thing -- the right -- the best I was to the best I was in the best I was in the best I had.
I have a lot of these options have to choose the option of how to choose better.
But I was feel.
Why? I wrote a book in which I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt more like I felt that I felt that we had all these options of these options of these options that should be a bunch of these good guys have been raised by the way,
I had a very close expectance. I didn't have any expectation of when they were a single way.
Now when I'm 100 parents' mother was 100 of them have to be perfect.
And what I have was good.
So I compared what we did with what we expect is that I expect is that I was disappointed with what I was hope.
The answer of option of people can't do something else than to create something than to create something that people who have to be those options.
And the more ural plants to get more satellites that even if they get good results.
No one of the marketing world is that.
