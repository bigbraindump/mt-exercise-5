And the year we were shown these two diaps to demonstrate that the polar polar in the city that was the most of the last three million years of the last three million years of the size of the 48 was the size of a little bit.
But this mornity is serial serious because it doesn't look at the size of the size of the same.
The polar polar is in a way, the heart of the climate crisis the global system.
It goes up and they are expanding and contracy.
The next thing that I will show you the cure that will be a very quickly remote on what happened in the last 25 years.
Gheat is the peak is the marine of the small.
As you can see the white white white white fish.
This is the anual for the nine time.
And it goes to the summer.
Asa's named the ice ice of five or five years or more than five or more than you can see that it's almost like the sangs of a body.
In 25 years of getting from this one.
This is a problem because the inner of the death of the ocean around the ocean around the ocean around the world around the world of the ocean around the ocean.
where it is a carbon quantitself that when it comes to the carbon dish, is transformed in the methane category of micro-organisms.
Comparing with the pollution of the global warming the world may be going to take this point of the amount of extreme way that we go to this point in the extreme point of view.
Over in certain lacres of a little bits of the metal effective metal samples is at the south of water.
The phessons Katey Walter in Alaska was on the University of Alaska a little lac of a little lac of a few tons of the past.
Oau! Ano. O. OK -- it's OK -- it's a question of whether we are going to be there.
And a reason is that a huge word ""the route is the Groenland.
This is a role that they all over the years.
But the volumes are much bigger than the one.
This is the Kangerussuain the Sussuain the Sround Groenland.
If you want to know how the creation of the sea level of the topier is the place where it comes to the big place.
These debate are growing very fast.

This is the equal in the high-level level, as in the Groenland.
In Himalaya, the main the third of the earliest you can lose the new slow, which was the new same.
40 percent of the population of the world of the world of the water in the water of these topier.
And in the day, this guarty is the source of the water water for this one.
The fact that they raised it.
But when it goes to the table water water water water water water water water
In California was a 40-percent of the sea in Sierra sea of the Sierra.
This is the sample samples of water.
And the predictable, as you read it.
In the whole global narratives has been to a dramatic creature.
And disasters on the global warming around the world has absolutely extraordinary rate with the rest of the country.
four times more in the last 30 years, the 75 years of the 75 years of the narrative.
This is a completely unsustainable model of unsustainable model
If you look in context in the context you can see what happen.
In the last five years we add in the past 70 million tons of the carbon dioxide every 24 hours of the ocean every day in the ocean every day in the ocean every day in the ocean every day in the ocean in every day of the ocean in the past five million toms of the last five million tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of the

Video: Actor: Actor: In COALergy new climate change in our business changes that we are very serious three-dimensional threat to our business.
And that's why our main is to spend a lot of money for the money for the public forces that are able to help us show us about the skin to help us look at the sky.
The real thing is that, in fact, the cars is not did.
We think that it's curated -- and we are grew up and good.
So you won't get to the climate change for the climate change.
You can see that in our way.

Thank you very much.
TED year at TED I did a introduction to LHC.
And I promised to come and give you a data data about how they functionally functioning this.
So here I go. And for the people who have not here in here, LHC is the biggest experimental science that was a sample that was a 27 kilometers or is to recreate the concent or is to recreate the concent of a billion on a billion-second fraction of a billion times a fraction of a second to the universe.
It's extremely quick of both sides.
This is the device under the Geneva.
We do the photographs of these minds "Big Bang" in the forest.
I work on this. It's called the ATLunger ATLunders -- Lunders of 22 feet photographs of a 22 feet photographs of ATLATLASS in the building of the ATLake in the building of the proportion of it.
On the seven, we went on the top of the first time.
And this image was made of ATLAS.
It caused a huge celebrity in the room
It's a picture of the first steps of particles, which has been looking across the LHCH, co-CH, CHC system is a part of the LHC is a number of LHC is a detector.
In other words, when I knew that 10 seals that 10 seven, I knew that the device has a huge successful of functioning as a successful of it.
I don't know if that has the greatest poisons, or that, when someone went on the Google and it was on the first page of the first page of the same.
It means that we did a cultural impact on the science of the scientific impact.
And after about a same. I had a problem with the device, which actually had to do with these songs -- these days.
Those are a transportation of the falls when the device in the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of 13 thousand and the fits of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the max.
Now, engineers in the roads and say, "You can't transport."
But I can do this because when they're getting south temperatures are called the superconductor.
So as a 271 degree of the south of the state, and the sea of the state, those of steps can transport this to.
At one of the laws of the lines of the LHC, was a She's a made of a factory of factory manufacturing of the factory of the factories of the law of the law of the law of the law of the law of the lines of the lines of the lines of the lines of the '9,000 CHC, CHC, was a F.
So the company has inquited a little bit, and those 13 thousand ample of the power of electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressive, that it's more likely to be in 20 tons of tone, and they moved almost 30 care.
So I deteriorated about 50 magnetic map.
I had to take it out of the way and doing.
We reconcusion, we repair it.
And now we go into the subterm and then in the subteran.
The end of the sun of the marine of the LHC is going to be like new as new as well.
We're going to start on again, and we get to get data in the emerging or or to go through the research or the research that are the elements of the universe.
Now, of course, that in a way, those accidents of the important accident about the important important news and engineering to be in extreme to break up to the respect to break it.
I think that it is that it is so difficult to have the fact that we have young young people like LHC.
And so I'm going to leave the words of a scientist in the British Davy, Humphrey Davy, who I think that the experiments of protected protection of the protection of the protection of the protection of the minds of human minds are not for us to prevent the human minds are not that we pretend to pretend the human rights are not the enjoy of our science are not the ending and that are not the endying.
Thank you.
I would start with the rate of the reminds of your kids' youth to play with box.
As you invite the release to get them and get them to go and get them to the disease and you can actually learn how to get them to solve and shake the task and manipulate the spinal cording to the hospitals.
The hospitals is a deeply of how we understand a big part of the world in inconclusion.
So in the quality of the inner of this re-inspired by this utility of the physical objects -- impresent with my own skin -- the Pattissue, and my colleague -- I started to inspire my inner -- I started to inate a computer, which is if we use a computer, in this unless digital curses, and what we could be so much more digital and more digital did, what we could be both of the next to be so much about if we can get to be so much of the next to be able to be so much of the next to be able to be able to be able to be to do to do to do to be so much of this untomage with a computer to do to do to do with a computer to be so much more digital ememememememememembedge with a mote this unununununununununununtag
She's going to want to do it with it?
And the question was so fascinated by the fascinating we hopped up to research Stttable to start to build Stagging Stttable to do the question of Stttable this question was so fascinated by this was attacked by this was so fascinated by the question of the fascinating of the fascinating thing that was so fascinated by the way we had to go through the end.
In short, a short computer is an interactive computer that is a size of a bism.
They can be manufacturing them, they can perceive the reef, and they have a screen and a radio screen and a radio screen and a radio of the radio wire.
The most important is that it's palpable, like the game, like the game, you can just just just take it out of the games of the game.
And Sif, the example of an ecosystem by the digital immortality of digital manipulating the digital intervene information.
In the first of these tools become more palpitches of their mission, the conference of the other ones that are the other nutrients of our nutritions, we can start to explore and new stages, we can start to interact with intervention.
I'm going to start with simple.
This Siftable is to present image, and if you were in a video, and if you can get the film, if you include the film, it comes to the other parrot -- the room.
These portraits are the basis of the other side of the other.
So, if I put them one langle their other things,
If they're inconconcepted and this is going to be a little bit of confusion.
They can also feel the mission.
We realized that one of us that is that we can use the interaction is that we can use the endless to manipulate the data, like we would be a color how we would be a liquid of a liquid lie.
In this case, we have three Sifwscscape as the glogging of the vote and they can use them to be a color in the center of the center, where they are going to be the top.
If you go too much, we can get too much, we can get the back.
There are interesting possibility for education, like education, like the language of language, mathematics and logical, mathematics and logical people we want to try to get people to see the outcome and see the outcome.
So here I -- this is a south-sizzzzzle that I do with a simple program that is a simple program in the equation.
Here we have a game game of the words of the words of Scrabs and Boggles.
And in every first one of the first first one of the first Sif, and the main the same, and the main the way to force the words, they're greenhouse gas a diction-the-the-the-the-the-the-ended by a diction-intimired diction-intimiely.
And then you go about 30 seconds of the same, and you have a new set of lets us a new set of lets us be a new set of incerties.
Thank you.
These are the kids who came in the cure of the Media Laborator and we returned to the Media material.
He liked them to crazy.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of applied is that you don't have to give them a lot of instructions.
All you have to say is "F: "Fellow exactly what to do.
Here's another people who are asking people to go ahead and
This is the most taneously testing our own right in the right in the right in the right.
It seems like everything that he wanted to do was to do was to do one over the other one over the other.
So for him, he was just cutttting.
This is a very animal animator.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who invest language.
And this is Felix.
He can introduce us to us to the stage in the stage of the Sif-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-shshe's characters to us to the strength of the strength of the stages.
Here it is where the sounds of it.
Video: Same the race.
David Merrill: Now he introduced a tractor in the stage.
Video: Tractor the portraiter.
Very of these Da!
And when Swettable and you get them and asive one of the skin can interact -- Video: Ham!
DM: It goes and your own narrative.
Video: Huna!
DM: It's a open, and he opened the end, and he will be deeply the shape.
Video: Hello.
DM: The last example I have time to show you today is a device and interpretation and interpretation and interpretation and interpretation that we built the role of sounds like the role of sounds like the role and all the by.
Every four different different variations of these different variations that you want to use it.
And you can inject the sound of a succession that you can get to the guy after the guy of the guy as you want.
The sounds the sound reducing the soil of a Sif-shirt Space camera.
There are effects that you can control control the lives, like the reverberary and the filter and the filter of the film.
You can put it in a certain sound and then it is the sound and then including it to help it off.
And it goes into general effects like the page and the volume that applied the sample of the Kaplug to see it.
Video: DM: We start with a riting rits in the second Sif, we arrive in a serious amount of a serious and we were rited.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: DM: Now adadd the cled.
Video: And I'm going to add the filter to the top, to control the top, to control the lives.
Video: DM: P: DM: P: She's inclining the inclining or angry.
Video: DM: Now I'm going to go for more and more present to more expression.
Video: DM: They receive the long time.
So I don't have to do the plan, can improvise, previous or short or short to.
Now, in the end, I can reach the intree of the Sif-using Sif, in the clinical trial to the volume in the stages.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is my passion of new interfaces that are better and how they are getting better and our body of our brain.
And today, I had time to show you a coordination of this new spatial of design, and some of the possibility that we try to get out of the lab.
The one that I wish I would retiny is that we are at the new general instruments that are going to bring the digital tools that will bring the information to our rule on our rules in our world,
Thank you very much.
These eps with the nervous nervous sky.
I'm writing out.
He wrote my career is my teacher, but it's more than it is.
It's all my mom lobe in a life.
And not that is that that to change that ever be change it.
But these are being saying, something like weird in the career and in the career and in my career who was really determined to remove to my work with work.
And the odd thing is that I wrote this recently this is the meat the book "Manancy, Roage," which is the Rage," which is a big bye" that was a very important that my career in the world for a reason, and it became this important piece of a reason that goes into a very important selling of an international.
The result is that anywhere in the way that they go now, people treat me now, people are being a convicted to be a convicty.
Serios -- convicted -- convictes;
So for example, in the end, "You don't say that it's the theme -- don't you know, it's the theme that you don't have the password?"
Don't you go to the end, you will continue to write the summer life that would be a book that you can get the world on the world that ever do it ever me?
It's very linked to true.
But it was even more likely to remember that 20 years ago, when I started to ask for 20 years, when I started to marriage people -- I was a teenager -- I want to become a writer, I was a writing of that kind of a kind of returing that kind of a way of release that kind of a way of doing the same way that the size of the size of the same way.
And people were saying "Not you" is the theme that you don't have any of success?"
I don't know that humility to reject your rejection will kill you kill it?
You don't know that you're going to work in this field of your life in this field, and nothing to do here and you have a role of a dream of a dream of a boy of a boy of the end, and the one of the flow of the screen?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the end, the answer to all those questions is ""Yes."
Yes, you get the theme is the theme of all of those things.
And I always hit me.
And you get the theme of the things that people are not going to get the macles that are not going to be able to intuitive.
As an example of the big algorithms that are cross that are cross-cross-cross of the big algorithms that are cross as well.
But when it's about writing the work that I was always the last thing I was all the questions is "Why is it "What?"
Is this rational?
It's the logic to be that anybody to be the work that they feel that they were so much to do this one of the Pame.
And what is that specific initiatives that seems that we are really true that is true in the support of healthier health care in a way that other teaches don't do it?
My attempt is the chemistry and I remember the chemistry and you don't remember in the 40-year-old engineering is a chemical engineering to be a chemist.
It didn't happen -- John, how it goes with the chemical?
It just doesn't happen to be happening.
But to be honest, the chemists that have not too cause to be too quatized to be alone to be alone of the maniacal qualities to be alone.
We are written in the reputation, and we have this reputation, but artists, but artists, it seems like this reputation that this reputation has a powerful way to be powerful to be a mental illness.
And everything we have to look at the numbers of the number of records in the 20th century, in the 20th century, in the 20th century, which have died by the way, which died by young people died by the way, and often died by the way,
And even those who didn't have the own inner of their own own own destruction of their own own own styles.
Norman Mailer, even before I get my first interview, he said that "Every last career that my career was a little bit more tomorrow a little bit more t."
An extraordinary ary ary ary work on your own life.
But they don't have a little bit of when we hear that we hear that because I heard this is because I heard about these things that we have to absorbed and somehow to absorbed and the signal and the suit of the creativity, the idea that the creativity, the idea of the creative that the creation is going to go on a hole in a sense of being a sense of the suffering that the suffering of the suit of the things that we have to do that
And the question I want to adred, all of you today is all of the things that are all the idea?
You can comfort -- because as it can see the list -- I don't see me -- I don't think about this Asn't the custome.
I think it's that it's a lot.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to see it in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage to the marriage to the nest strength to travel to the nest one.
And I know that it was my case -- in my situation -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous, to start to go to the career of this one of the circumstances that I know about a circumstance.
For example, I'm pretty straight for 40 years.
I have probably incident in the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of four decades of the work of four decades of the workers of the work of four decades of the workforce.
And it's very likely that I would write the end of this moment to be judged by the work that the work that came out of my career that was going to take my career of the last career and I have my career and right?
What would be saying is to be a way that we are all the way to do the people here are already the most successful of my mind -- it's very likely to be the biggest red.
Oh, Game, which is what gand!
This is the kind of gas to be able to look at the nine to go to the nine the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I want to do this message that message that I love it.
And then the question event: OK?
And so I would fit up, after my meditation, like the mania is in which I have to do now, to try and make a kind of a psychology that is by creating a kind of psychology protection, right?
I had to find a way to find a way to fly a distant distant distant that my father was a natural concept, and my father who was going to be in the way that he wrote to what he was written by what he wrote out.
And as I always looked in the last year models in this sense, we started looking at the time, and we tried to find other society to see if they were able to be better ideas about how to be able to help people create a risk of how to help people create an emotional risk to be held to be held to help people create emotional risk to be an enteding.
This research has been the research in Greene and Roma and Roma Anya.
So you get the inches of the sky.
But in the GDoms and Roming Roms are doing that people don't believe that the creativity,
People thought that creativity was a spirit was a spirit that the hell of people to a source of people in a straight of reasons and unintelligent and units.
The solutions called these spiritals are helping to the famous creatures the term of the terrorister's "the ter."
Socratic was famous because he had a demon which has a department that the intelligence of the wise.
The first pareas of the same pared, but they were called the immoral spirit of the initial spirit of the genius.
What is wondering, because they were really wondering, because they were a very exciting genius was a very exciting individual enemy.
They thought a genius was a kind of magnitude entitself that the excent of the wall of the wall of the artists, in a way that Dobby, the swallowed the arm of the arm of the work of the work of the work of the work of work of work that work was a way to release the work of work of work that work was a way of the workforce of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of
Absolutely -- this is the distant is the distant that is the distant that the psychology that we were talking about the outcome of the workforce of the workforce.
And all the world that this is functional, right?
So the artist was protected by certain things, like a lot of things, right?
If your work was straltruists, you couldn't keep the word, you could not have the world that you have this genius that the body has helped this genius to help.
If your work was critical, it was not completely the leading to you, right?
Everybody is the strength as your genius was about ignoring.
So they looked at people in Vest for a long time of time for a long time.
And then it came to Renasting and everything that was changing a real idea, the idea of the main the center of the universe as an individual in the center of the universe of the universe of the universe of the state of the mysteries that are first to creative creatures.
It was the human sample, and the people started to create the creative that the creation of the creation of the individual creativity.
And for the first time in the history of people started talking to one or one of the human human being as being genders in a genius.
And I have to remain is that a huge error.
Sographic -- a simple person, to create or it is actually the received of the received and the spring of mysteries and the mysterious survey, create, create, create, create, create, the fourth is a little bit of psychology is a little bit of a very responsibility of the fragile psyche.
It's like you would put it on the soil to get the wire.
And just incotton and deforms and deforms all these astonishes of these astonishes.
I think that the pressure of the artist has been a doubt of the last 500 years.
And, if it's true, and I think that is, the question is, what do we do it?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we go back to the older sensors of people and the mystery of the creativity.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't just stand to stand for the human rational-ring talent in a 18 minutes.
And it probably that is that there would be a very good question, the question of the scientific questions on the theme that in fact, which in fact, in the world press of the projects over the projects over the projects over the projects over the projects over the projects over the projects over the projects over the projects of the world that would be a lot of people in the audience that would be a very good questions of the projects over the projects
It may not be coopt to you all of this idea.
But the question I want to ask is -- why don't I want to do it?
Why don't we think about this?
Because it has a long way that I heard about anything that we heard about the privacy of the endless crazy of creative process.
It costs that anybody has to create something -- basically -- basically all of the here -- the strength of the one that doesn't always change the rate of the inner of the inner that is not a rate that roughly what the reach is that anybody has to do a lot of what it was doing something --
And in fact, sometimes it can seem to be the right of the right of the right of the right of the right of the right of the right of the right of the right to the right of the right in fact, it can actually seem to be the same, in fact, it can seem to be the paranorming of the right to the right to the right of the right of the right of the right of the right of the right-to-to-
I had a intalent where I met her in the American American Ruth Stone, the American Ruth Stone, which now has 90 years and that was the poet that was the poet that was the poet that she told me when she was a caring that she was going to work on the road in Virginide and it just felt a poet and I just hearing a poet and he just hearing a poet of the room and he just heard a poet of a poet in the room and he was a poet of a poet of a poet in the camelseven.
The story that was like a sea of the same.
And it has the way the roads over the roads.
The sense of income income same, because you are the sample under the leg.
That moment that it has a single thing that is, and that is, "get a little bit of a s" -- "get the applied as a s" --
And the runs like the house to the house and the whole idea of poor and the idea was to get a piece of map and a creative piece of map and a little bit fast, to get it through the map.
Sometimes it was not enough to be so fast, so the running and running and running and running out of the house and the poems and the poems and the poems of the robust and the poems of the room, and I read a "a different poet of the room, I read the other poet -- I read a poet of the poet and the hous."
They were momentous moments -- and this is not going to look at not a time -- moments in the story that almost loss in the los.
The whole house, the case of the main and the sea and the poems of the creation of the creation of the creation that he was inflated by the other hands and the story of he and he had the other hand.
And the first of the code and the top of the code and then it was the sea of the math.
In this case, the poems of the right and dark and dark and undogs of the last year at the last time in the first word.
When I was hearing it -- it's just the only way my own creature.
My creativity, it doesn't limited to this -- they're not driving yet.
I'm a category that work is to go to go into the same day and get to the same time and go to be able to trust and go wrong.
But even in my inner in my inner and I was attached to sometimes that phenomenon of the phenomenon.
And I would imagine that as many of you are a lot of you are.
And I had projects or ideas that were coming from a source that is not to identify that I don't know to be able to identify it.
And what do you do you all this?
And how do we should report us to report that we should not lose our minds, the right to help us lose to help us reach to the same?
For me, the most relevant example of how we can do about how it can do is the music of Tom Waits, we took a interview, we took a interview, and I got a revia with a revia revia revia revia revia revia revia revia relevant in the day,
I was talking about this subject and all of this was almost all about his inner of the contemporary Chinese artist of the Chinese contemporary Chinese contemporary control, and in order to control these impulses, and in the creative expensive.
With the time it comes up and immediately the story as a day as a day as a day as a day as a ride and everything that has changed.
As a matter of fact, in a short fragmented a short fragmented from a piece of the enemient and magnificent the inner as it was a little bit of injury, it's not about it, but it's not how to apply it is to the sample, but it's not about it to go to the sample.
It doesn't have any foot is not a creative of the creative --
The first thing that the old old old anxiety of the end, and the can, and the canvas a bunch of the banker to be a bit.
I'm not good enough to revealing a redit."
And instead of getting into the panick, just stop.
He stopped the process and he did something that is all the way to do with all of it.
He raised the skin and said, "You know, you don't see that they're a volan?"
"You know, you might be written a travel to the notice ack.
If you really want to be able to be in a moment of the right moment when I can do you do to be a little bit of you.
If you don't go and you get the other things that we have today.
Good and you get the Leonard Cohen."
The trust process has changed the creative process.
Not the operation of being being dealing to be in the dark as well.
But the process in the synapped around him, and he had the time in the time he took the same, the gene of the south and he was in his room, and he went back to the road and he went back to the way to go back and forth to the inside of the organ in the organ in and the Chinese and the China.
It could be this unique collaboration and the bizarre under a conversation under a conversation between Tom and the exterior that was not too much like Toman Tome.
And after I heard the story I started to change a little way I was doing this work and he had a little bit of a time.
This approach me when I was in the middle of the "Manancy, Ragest, Iubest, Iubest, and I have a way of looking at a kind of disappearance when we were all looking at something that I didn't think about something that doesn't have to think that it will be a disaster to be a disaster that it will be the most proposal.
Not just that, but the most proof this book ever ever ever written it.
I would think we should just be the end, I just have the project.
And I remember my opening Tom and I was trying to get and I tried to go and I tried to do it.
I raised my career and I added my commentary and I revealing a colleagues a round of camera.
I said to him, "Asculpture -- and you know that if this book is not the extraordinary book is not going to be the extraordinary not just my wife is not just my wife is not just a cool?
Because you can see that one of the battle everything I had to go to the battle and more than it is.
So if you want to be better than you know, you have to do the devices, and you can do your own part of your password.
Okay. And if you don't do that, you know, you know, you all of it.
I would write that because this is my message to my message.
And I want to consent me today that I did this on my passage of the trens."
Because -- the Conclusion -- with hundreds of years ago, with North African people are going to get to get to the poor mushroom to get to the die and music that was in the same.
And they were always a wonderful thing, because the dancing and they were remarkable and were remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be all wondering, right?
But sometimes the times, very soon as it happens, and one of the real people really really really are the real time.
I'm convinced you all of you know what I mean to do is what I mean, in a certain moment of the time that it was a certain point of interpretation.
It's like the time it stops and the dancing is the same kind of ports, often don't do anything differently, in the other 1,000 of uses, in the other 1,000 of them in the other 1,000 of them in the other 1,000 sers,
And it turns out in a long time, it doesn't seem to be in the field.
It's lightning and galls in the bottom is the sample of the forest of the footprint.
In the way, when it happens, when they were known to call it as well.
And they were the remote and they were to scares and they were "Alllah, Alllah, Gam," Gamus, Gamnew, Gamnew, Gamnew, yeah, Gamnew.
It's God's going.
A interesting mid-interesting historic -- when the main the Spanish had invent the Spanish in Spanish and the pronounced in the Allah, yh, the Allah, Allah, Allah, Allahin "All," "Holh, y," yes, olold, yes, les."
and they hear about the bats with the sample and dancing and dancing the flow.
In Spania, when a presented and the magic and magic magic and magic of "Allah y," the magnificent "Allah my ar."
And the unintelligent -- a God of God God Swood.
It's wonderful, because we need it.
But the second day comes from the morning, when the dancing is the south is the marine and discovered that is a big scale.
It's a diverse that ender is and the genuine that we could not get to be not enough.
Would it be that nobody more invoice when he was selling the name of Dome, so what he should do with the rest of the rest of the life of his life.
It's hard.
It's one of the most painful of being doing in creativity.
But it may not be a very big tin the right thing if you don't think about the most extraordinary people are coming from the most extraordinary of your own state.
Maybe if you just think that it was improud of a cave of a few moments of the moment of life on your earlier on your life and you are going to be dated data on the movie as if you moments have been sick.
If we think that it is all the way to change it.
I started thinking and so I started thinking and so I thought that the last months of things that will be published by the book that will be published by my inner and crisis of my successful and crisis my successful success.
And what I do is that by repetited when you lose the shape, you don't be theater.
It doesn't be selling the way and it is the Contintiny the Contintiny to your party, any would be
If you go to the dance, then they did.
If the gene come and the center of the die of what you want to late the choice to get the extraordinary force, even for a lack of the forces of the force of the force of the forces of the force of the did, "le!"
And if no, they don't do anything.
And with all of these "you!" for you.
I think in these things and I think we should pretend to pretend to be them.
"Oh!" She's just because you have a loaded lobe for the human beings and incaping to participate in the continue to participate in the continue.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I talked about some of these projects, about the human genome, and what it might be a present of new genes.
Now we start with a new point in a new biology, and now we are now going to start to start to start to start to start in this new code from this code of biology, modeling and synthesizing and synthesizing force and synthesizing and synthesizing forces and synthesizing forward and synthesizing for,
We all tried to do all the time to put our very important questions to do it.
"What is life life that I think a lot of biologists have tried to understand the variety of variety levels of variety levels.
We tried different approaches, simple approaching the life of the basis of the basis of the basic components.
We are already about 20 years.
When I sequenced the human genome of the human genome of the analogical world in the digital biology in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world.
Now we're trying to ask the question, can we regenerate new forces, or can create new forces in this digital universe from this digital universal universe?
This is the map of a mice, Mycoplasma genitals, which is the smallest genome that can replease the only one species in the lab.
We tried to see if we can come up with a smaller genome, and smaller genome.
We were able to receive by a hundreds of genes of the genes in the way that are there.
But when we look at the metabolic map is quite simple, it's quite simple, it's quite simple,
I think it's simple. That's simple.
But when we look at all looking at all the genes that we can get the first time to produe to produe to produces a cell.
So we decided that the only way that the only way we do this crosis to be interested in this crose, so that we can get the components to reach some of the most fundamental questions.
And so I started on the road, "can we can snit?"
Maybe the chemistry allows to be very large these molecules that we never ever did ever do anybody ever did ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever did anybody ever did anybody ever did anybody ever did it for the chemistry of the chemistry of the synthesization of the synthesizes of the synthesis really big molecules that we ever haven't done befo?
And if yes, can we have a cross-cross-cross-cross-cross-cross-cross-cross-or the, if we were like, yes, we can say, "Womano cross-cross-cross-cross-cross-crosis we can get a cross-cross-crosis a cross-crosom?
A crosis a crosis is just a little chemical piece of chemical.
So our speed speed to digitize the exponential rits.
Our ability to write code code and they move very much more and more grow.
The last time he got to get a exponential curve the exponential curve.
I started this on a 15 years ago.
I went through a few days of the time, starting in fact, with a bio-etal examination before he was doing the first experiment.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to do.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make small DNA in the world of 30-lets about 50 lets a generative process, so what you are building a longer, so that what you are building a much more and more erry.
So we had to create a new way to put these little little little little together and the right and the right of the error.
This was our first tentative information from digital information to digital this, by the digital synthesis of the Physicist Phi X4.
It's a little virus that kills the bacteria.
We made the end, we went through the right through the right of errors, and we got a molecule of DNA DNA DNA in a molecule.
The interesting thing that I came when I took this piece of chemical material material and put it in bacteria, and the bacteria, and the bacteria, and the bacteria, and the bacteria, and the virus started to produe to the virus that the boy of the virus came up with the virus came to the virus came to the virus.
The viral Partics were then released in the cells and they were killed in the cells and the column.
I was talking to the oil industry and they were saying that they were very clearly clear.
They were laughed more than you are.
And so we think this is a situation where the software can build their own madware can build their own biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the entire cross of a bacteria.
This is over 58,000 liters of genetic code,
So we said to put the wall the letters in the south of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of a cell cell.
And the design is critical, and if you start with digital information in the computer, that information must be very active.
When I sequenced this genome in 1995, the preserve the presence of the presence of 10,000 bass.
I found it, in the revenue, 30 to the inner of the original ernal sequence, this would never be activated.
The design is in design is the projection of enemy 50 galls, you have to be a 50 letter of the other hands to build a 50 letter to build a little bunch of smaller that join the way that join the way that joy is to be able to be able to be able to do some of the television.
We are also provides a unique elements.
You may read that I put "the marks" in the hous." Give your genetic code, we have a genetic code, and T. SA, C, GO, Governacy.
Tririries in those letters -- those letters about 20 amino acious acizes -- a single literally literally account of the account of the account of the end.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, the process, the forest.
Imition, all we had to be aughtened the code of the code.
Some of them were disappointed that it's not poetry.
We designed those joined so that we can deer it was with enzymes.
They are sent that they repair and they are them.
So we started doing the joy of the end, starting with five to seven toms by 7,000 lets these lets us do this by 24,000 lets us do this by a way to do the sample of these wilders, and then by 72,000 of these 2.m.
Every time we have these gap, we have these gas to abundant to sequence, to try to create a very routinely robust -- as you will see a very roughly robust -- as you can see in a mind.
We try to get that to get that automatically.
So this shows that a basket.
When we get to the very large market, over 100,000 samples of the basis of the basis of the E.
It is all that all the modern molecular molecular molecules.
So we were going to get to other hanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism, that is a human recombination of the biology that biology is using DNA, and that is the enjoy.
This is an example.
There's a organism called Deincockros that can be the power of the radio of radiation.
As you can see in the same, the cross of the cross-kit-in the kitchen in the kitchen in the kitchen pan.
12 hours to 24 hours later, he put it on his hand, he put it on his way to start on the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be often all of these organisms can be on the top.
They can live in living.
I'm absolutely sure life that life can be in the extreatment, to be moving into the space of the human environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is that this is happening there.
Here's a micro-grapher a molecule that we built using these procent provides using these procley proper to the design of the markets that we put the markets that we put the market.
Droja law together and they automatically.
This is not a picture of a microscope with electronic electrons, but just a micro-to-to-micro-to-to-to-to-to-th-to-to-th-to-she's image.
It's so a big molecule that we can see a microscope with a microscope of the optic.
These are images over a long period of about six seconds.
This is a published audience that I had a little bit of time.
These are over 58,000 liters of genetic code,
It's the largest molecule that ever ever done with a definitely definitely definitely definitely struck structure.
It has a molecular molecular molecular molecular in 300 million dollars.
If we put it on a 10 and without the space of 142 pppage of the genetic code, this code code of genetic code,
So how do we start a cross of the cross-grav? How about it?
Evivil with a virus is quite easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
Esty, even easier when you get to the euck: you can just take the nucleus and put the nucleus and put the nucleus and this is something that you all heard -- and that's something you heard --
With bacterial bacteria, cross is integrated in the cell, but I showed you that we can do a completely transplant that we can do a completely a very very very cold of a cell to be a cell to be active.
I had a chance of a microbial species from one of the microbial species.
These are about as people as well as people and samples as well.
We put a few genes in the plus to to be able to sell this crosis.
We were dealing with the enzed all the protein.
And it was quite amazing when we put in the cellular cellular graphs very sophisticated -- and the cross has come into the cell.
In fact, we thought this is how far it can work, but we tried to design the process of something that is about something that is about something that is about it.
This is a major mechanism,
We are all sorts of species that have been emerged a second crose, or a third of the third of the third of the day, by the other characteristics of the characteristics of a second.
So those who think about evolution just as a single gene changing in the biology.
I'm assyes, named enzymes, which actually had the DNA.
Cromosome that was in the cell not a one.
The cross -- the cross we put us --
It was extent and recognized, and it was the other cross as the material as the as the as the human cellular cell.
It became blueprints because of genomes that we put in the crosis.
And after a very short period time -- the characteristics of a species of a species of a new species of a new basis of a new basis of the software.
All the proteins were changing, the membranes -- when we put the genetic code -- when we put the genetic code is exactly what we have to be far.
This can sound like alchemistry as the genome, but we can move the DNA, to change things pretty dramatically change the very dramatic stuff.
Now, I support that this is not genesis -- but a half billion years and a half years and a half years of evolution -- and we support that we can think that it can be a new version of a new version of a new specific specifically a new species.
Why do we do that?
I think it's quite obvious about useful for use.
We're on the way to go from six and half to six to nine billion people over 40 years.
To put this in context for me in the context for me in 1946.
Now there are three people on the plane for each of us in 1946, in 40 years, in 40 years, will be the four.
We have problems that are released in the southern water drinking water to the road water and a half of them and a half of them and a half of them and a half of the way to be a couple of the road,
It will be difficult to do it for new.
We use over five billion tons of books, more than 30 billion tons of the boils of the boils of the boils of the boils of the boils of the water of the boils of the water of five billion tons of tons of potons of tons of cool.
This is a hundred million barils a day.
When we try to think about technology or anything that has biological procent that will be a big challenge.
And then, of course, it's all that CO2 is all the way that the material that goes into the atmosphere.
Now, in our discoveries around the world, we have a basic database of gene, and I like to think about these components of the design of the design of the future.
The electric electrons has just a doubt of the component or so something, and here is the diversity that came out of it.
We're limited there, first of all, a biological reality, and the imagination and imagination.
We have the techniques, because of the very quickly enough, to do what we call the genimicy.
We have the ability to build a big robot that make a million cross on a couple of day.
When you think about to process these 20 million genes of genes to try to optimize the occupied procent products of products and producing the pharmaceutical products, only with a little team of molecules that we can do more biology than the last 20 years, to do more biology than the last 20 years, to do it.
And that's just the standard selection selection selection.
We can sell for viable viable and chemical production or fuels or clever vaccines, production production, production of vaccines in the city.
This is a design of a design design design that we work in order to be able to wait and work in the computers in the computer.
You know, we don't know how it will show it as he would show you.
We know exactly what the genetic code,
Now we focus on the fourth generation to fourth generation.
You see the rectent that the piano in the end, it's just a big experiment that was a bad experiment in the end.
We have a generation of the generation of the generation that will come up with pretty soon as it is a rougher role as a role or different types of povertent or different types of button.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact the food is increasing the cost of food and the country is that their limited to the limest, and we start with CO2 as the maternal cells to design the cells to design the cells to design the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the CO2 months.
The solar and CO2 is a method -- but in our discoveries around the world around the world have all sorts of other ways that we have all sorts of ways of the world have all sorts of the way of the world are all sorts of terror and CO2 is a way to CO2 is a way to the CO2 is a way -- but in the O2 is a way of our world is a way of our world.
This is a organism that I wrote in 1996.
It goes into the deep deep in the ocean and half a million deeps of the deep, in the temperate temperature.
Transform CO2 in metan use molecular molecular hydrogen molecular energy as a surround of energy energy as a surround of energy energy
We try to see if we can take CO2 captured, which can be easily transported in the country, and convert that CO2 back in combbbbbbbbbbbble-up to the provide.
So in a short period of time, we think we could die that the basis of the basis the question of "What is the life is the like?"
We really know -- you know, we have the objective models to replace the entire chemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where else in another where else in another part?
So let me get a very energy source
But although we work now to use these same sources to invest the same source of vaccines immediately.
You see this year with the same, we're always a dollar in the minus when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think the situation can be changing building vaccines that are combined by any of the time before we were going to be changing the way to be changing vaccinated.
Here's how to start looking at the future of changing the future change that is now the evolution of the evolution of bacteria, the theme with bacteria, and finally, the inner of bacteria.
We're almost to improve people.
Our stage is just to make us that we have a very long way to survive to be quite remote to be quite a long long time. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you the first thing is a fundamental work that is a new technology that I added up to Microsoft as a part of a year than a year ago. This is a year. This is a year. This is a year. This is a year. This is a year.
It's a average that can interact with a large amount of visual data.
We're looking at a lot of people now are a lot of digital pictures and marriage in the continual and about it in this way, rearrived by this way, rearrived by anyway.
It doesn't matter how much information is the meaning of the big data, how big the images of the big images.
Most are pictures that are made with a common digital camera and this is a very common digital cameras in the Bible Congress, the Big By the meal of the 300 megapix.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that we should limit the performance of a system of the monitoring of your monitoring on your monitoring roughly an architecture very data.
This is a book that is a nonimaginative example of a nonimaginative example of a nonimaginative book.
It's about the "Cs of Charles Dickens. The She's a colored capita is a capita is a capital.
To demonstrate that is that it's about text, and not imagine, we can do that, to look at this is a real representation that is a real present of a text; it's not a positive position.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read a book in the electronic form.
I would recommend it.
This is a more real. It's a "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian of the "Gardian of the "Gardian of a met.
Every image is the beginning of a second.
This is really a piece of a piece of a loade of a revia or a revia or a revia or a newspaper environment.
We did and we do something little of the cold of this number of Ocean O."
I created a real cover of a very highly -- much bigger than in any other lines -- and I have a common required -- and I have a content content of a content contact.
If you want to see the property, you can see the property, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the techniques of technical specifically specifically specifically specifically specifically specifically specifically specifically specifically specifically or even other models.
And this really clever ideas, the injury of a monitor.
We hope that this is to be the pop-inch and other people like this -- which are not necessary.
Of course, the mapping is one of the technology of the technology of the same technology that one.
I'm not going to say a long time to tell you that we have contributed to you that we have contributed to this field.
These are all the roads in the United States of NASA ge-SA.
Let's go to a look at something.
This is actually active on the Internet accumulation; you can see it.
This is a project called Photosynt, which is the second different technologies. Where is the Sealovely and the other research in the field of visual perception of the visual perception of the music of Noah Savagtempted by Noah Savagoing See See the U.S., the frogs in Washington, the U.S.
and Rick Seliski at Cerki Microsoft. A beautiful colleague.
So this is active on the Internet. Ps because Sealo.
You can see that when we create this kind of perspective, when we can have this kind of experience, we can have this kind of experience in many ways,
But the space space space is really the real space of these images really true.
Algeries have visual visual recorded these images together, so that to cover the real place where these are the real pictures of the Grases of the Grases of the Grases of the Grases of Canadian and Canadian projection or panels here a new projection of a projection or panels were the related or panels were the related or panels of the images of the world that are the related or panelements of the world --
I'm not sure if I were going to show you other media.
There are some of the more space of the space of the space of the space.
I would like to go to one of the original stories, this is a part of a protool of the Photosynthetic Photosynthe, which I think is the skin -- to show you what I think is the market of this technology is the Posynthesis of the operating of this technology of the technology of this is not unvision, not only vision, and I put it on the sites on the site.
We had to have a care of the legal aspects of the legal aspects of the task of the task.
This is a reconstruction of Cated, the No-Flicks. The Dams of the Dame. Two Flickr. Glickr, and you find something like a little bouter in the trouble in the trouble in the trouble in the trouble is a picture that was found that he was found that he was a picture that was found that he was a picture that he was a picture that was found that he was that he had a cooled picture of the code of the Clickr.
These are a Flickr, and all of these are the related space in this way.
We can just not not to be in this way.
You know, I never thought I would get to work on Microsoft is very great to be a part of a table to do it in here.
I don't see that notice that there are a lot of the cameras in the room of the cell phones at SLRs LRs LRs LRs LRs in this environment.
If it was going to find these strangers.
There are so many maps of fear, I guess --
Where it is a series of photographs --
This is a poster with No-Dentel who was removed right.
You can get you to a physicist to a physicist environment.
The idea is that they can do certain things with social environment. This means to collect the world -- from collective all the world -- from a collective memoral -- and to intercontemplate -- and to intercontemples, all of those pictures, all these pictures were all interconnected to the world.
You have a model of what the Earth is the entire Earth.
Think about that as a long as the first of the things that Stephen Lawler Stual."
And this is growing in complexity as the world as the world as they are getting bigger and more of the users of users.
The teaches are the pictures of metaphors that somebody else has enough.
If someone would be the same kind of all these slowly and he says, who are my pictures of the No-Denter Denuel would improve all these dates, and I could use it as a travel to the same as a traveling experience that space to make it as a kind of social experience.
And of course, a product of a second but all of these are the huge models of the ecal skills of the Earth, collective parts of the Earth, and in the earlier areas of a collective member of the land, but a college member of a collective member member of a collective member member of a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I have the right answer? What will allow your software to be like a moment of data, is that all the pictures of somebody who is that all the pictures of somebody on the way to be interrelate to the interrelate to be interrelated?
BAA: Yeah. Which does really do is to be looking at is to be looking at it.
It creates hyper-connected -- if you want to do it between images.
And it does that based on the images of images.
And this is going to be a quick that you think about the significant information that they have those images.
As you do a little bit of images on the Internet, and you hear the word "We are the word on the Internet gives you a lot of information about what the Internet is position.
Now, what would be that the connection of all the pictures of all the pictures of the picture?
So the amount of interconnection and the box, which is a huge amount of this is a huge class of the country.
CA: Blaise, is really incredible. Felics.
BAA: Thank you very much.

You know, I don't know that the sample Jaguary lessons that the Lace, or the mysteries of the older of the older of the people who are still reveal or that in Himala's revelation is to remember the revelia's revelation of anthropology, and this is not a sense that the world that we live in a sense that the world that we live in a model of reality, but this is a model of reality, it's not a model of reality.
The inner of a certain set of decisions that are the very basic decision, and with our ancestors and successful generations in the next generation of a lot of generations in the next one.
And of course, we all share the same imperative adaptive action.
We are all born in the world.
We're going to go through the initial ritual ritual rituals in the initial rituals and go through the rituals of the initial rituals and we're going to go through the rituals of initial rituals of initial rituals of initial rituals of initial rituals
We have to do separate from the uniting of morning, so we should be surprised that all of the songs, we all have the art.
But what is interesting is the real cover is the unique of the same, the role of every culture.
And it is that the Penancy in Borneo, or the Sneound of Haitdoo in Haitdoo in the northern Kaut in the north Kaissa's Sahasis in the north Kahal in Sahahahai.

All these people are learning that there are other ways to think there are other ways to think about thinking about the origin the Earth.
And this idea, if you think about that, maybe not to be humility.
Now, the miridges of the world together is a spirit of spirit and cultural life that road is the same important for the health of the planet, and it's the biological network as a biosphorus of life, known as the biosphorus of life, known as the biosphorus of life and the biosphorus of the world is that the world together is how the biosphoral life is as a biosphoral redis as a biosphere of the world that the planet.
And you could think about this remote of life as being the one of the life as the nosphere and you could define all of dreams, intuitive intuitial to the human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagination of the conscience.
Etnosphere is the great human main human habits of humanity.
It's the symbol, and everything we can be like a surprising species of iscode of iscodits.
And as the biosphere has been seen, and so the etnosphere -- and maybe a much bigger scale.
For example, no matter how the real star would not be able to suggest that half or more of all the species of the extension of the extension because it just is not true, and yet this is not true, and yet this stage in the field in the field of biological field -- the above of what we know the stage of what we know the stage of cultural diversity.

Now, a language is not only a law or a layer or a set of freshency.
A language is a sampling of human spirit of human spiriting.
It's the vehicles that the soul of the slowing particles are going to get into the materials.
Every language is a old old old mind, a basic basis of receiving a clothes of spiritual possibilities.
And in those 6,000 languages, as we are now here in Monterey, half of them are not the more of the kids.
They are not learning to baby, which means that if it doesn't actually change something, that are already going to be a language.
What can be the only thing that is to be the last same, to be the last few of the most people to talk about the language of your language, not how your tomorrow or to the demand the inner of the mountain or the kids?
And yet that sounds like a little bit of a little bit of a life of the Earth on Earth in the Earth for every two weeks ago, because every two weeks ago, a elephant or the last two weeks of the old language.
And I know that some of you will say, "Well, would be better?
It would not be a better place if I all talk to a single language?" And I say, "Grozav, that language that is the Canta to be Cantoneee."
Or to be Kogi."
And then you will discover how it would be not to be able to talk about your own language.
So what I want to do today with you is a kind of traveling through the dosphere of the journey to try to try to give you a meaningful understanding of what it is that they lose to be losing you to be in the trouble.

And because you're a positive position, are dominated by spirit, how would you be the previous one?

Docky the what?
Docky all the Western societies of the Western societies.
And this doctor, this is a so-called a little like this: if we are interested in the same, the quarter of the citizens to do is to do is the maximum of the level of the freedom of the level of the freedom of individual level.
The reason for this is that the freedom is that the good end, the word, the word, the real thing to be human.
And because if people are free and people are free and individual and makes things that are going to be doing the good and our own grandfather and our own way to decide in our place.
The only thing to maximize the freedom is the maximum of choices.
The more choice as the people have have more freedom and more freedom of freedom have a more freedom of the more freedom of the more released.
So I think, it's so good that it's so good in our system that would not get to be doing somewhere in the same,

And in this room are in this electronic stereotype is a stereotypes of the system.
We can confidence six million and half million and a different systems of the components that are in the officer.
You have to recognize that that that this means a lot of option.
In other fields -- in the world -- in the world of communication.
It existed a little etheless where you could get any kind of you could get any kind of you could get the phone services, as long as it was offered by Mello Bell.
The table you to the car. Not bought it.

What do you want to do?
And you say, "But if you were in my place, you know, you were the doctor, the doctor, the doctor, "But the result of your patient is -- I say, "This is -- the author of the patient doing something that makes a good thing.
But what is actually a transition is a responsibility and deciding to be the decisions of somebody who knows something -- in this doctor, in this case -- someone who doesn't know anything and it's almost certainly not that in the patient -- in this patient -- in this patient -- in this patient -- in this patient to make the decision.

And the answer is yes.
We all know what I know about this, so I will talk about what I am going to talk about what is wrong.
All these choices have two types of things that are two negative effects on people.
One of the effect, the paralyze, is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that the paralyzes of the effect,

Two 50 percent of the mutual -- they were written 10 to get less people than if you give you a little bit of a why. Why?
Because with the 50 mutations of the earlier that are the naid to choose you to choose what you want to choose what you want to choose and the hand.
And then on the tuned and then the same, and then the same, and of course, the end, and of course, the end, and of course, it was never worried that this is never coming out of the same.
You know, this is not just that that they don't only mean that they are the food for dogs after dogs when they were not enough to put money on the skin is that the stable of a decision, that means that the stable of a decision, that means that the stable to do that the compensants of compensants that would give you the employees that would give you the employees that would be the hidden the employees that would be the employees of the people to go to the foot that they will be the death of the food,
And I was looking at the legs to the left-hand side, which would be in the employees, which would be please of compensants of compenss.
So the credit is a consequence when you have too many option.
And I think that does that make the world look like this.
You really want to take the best choice if it's for all the way to do it is it?
You don't want to choose to choose or dead investment or even wrong without any wrong wrong.
So this is a effect. The second is that if we were able to keep the strength and make a choice and make a choice to do a little choice to be a little bit of the choice than we have had a little choice than we were to choose to choose to choose the choice that we are to choose the choice.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that you had a lot of snose, for a lot of people who are going to choose if you were not -- and you know, is the perfect -- and you know, is the right -- and you know, the so-called the West, and you know, is that it was that it was that you had a lot of a lot of them -- and one of them is that you had a lot of selling of selling to choose if you have a lot of people to choose if you buy a lot of people to choose if you coulder to choose if you on the way to choose to choose
It's easy to imagine that you could be done a different choice that would be better choices. And what happens is that alternative that is that the alternative that you would imagine that the ability you have done it in the way you would have to imagine that you have to do it in the village that you get to choose to do it if this was a good decision.
The more option of the option of the way you can regret something that is disappointed to the option that you have alone that you have alpha that you have the option that you have a hole in the more option of the way you have a little more option of the way you have to regret the more option of the option of the way you regret to regret something that you have to regret to regret with the option that you have to regret
Second, which economists call the opportunity for opportunity.
Dan Gilber demonstrated very clearly in this morning in this morning we are getting things that we can see the things that we compare to what you compare to what you compare to what we compare to them.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative that is easily by the way, you think of the characteristics of the alternative that are going to be able to imagine the characters that rejects you have a little bit of alternative that you have a little bit of alternative that you have a little bit of alternative that you have a lot of satisfy that you have a lot of satisfy to imagine that you have a little bit of the charged with the character of the character of the character of the characters that you have to imagine the character of the character
Here's an example. I asked. I mean, the people who are not New York's not New York's
But here I should take it to rational.
We have this box in Hamptices.
A very expensive property of it.
She's a great bit. They have a wonderful day. They have to be there. They have all the way to have them.
What could they want to do it anymore? "Well it is a guy. It's a guy.
Everybody in Manhattan are leading to Manhattan are leading to the box.
I could be like in front of the office." And what about two weeks of the idea that the idea that the same, the day to have a place that wonderful place to have a place that wonderful thing.
The rise of the opportunity in the village that we have to have the choices that we are elected in the election of choices.
And the more options that are made in the way to do with the high-charges of these options are going to be perceived as we are perceived as an opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon a lot of things.
He says that we should live in the lack and probably we should be doing things worse.
But one of the things that tells is that it's that anybody who says that you're not doing other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things that are going to be doing and that is going to do what you do you do what you do you do what you do you do what you do you do what you do you do what you do you do what you do you do what you do you can have a lot of things can have a lot of things that can have a lot of things that are going to have a lot of the same attack-in-ended lived in the same attract and that you do what you do
Third are expanding expectations.
That was when I wanted to replace me to replace my bluegies.
I think about all the time.
And there was a way that the people were a single kind of like the one and you buy them as drink as drink as drink as a drink and if you had a lot of time and if you had to go out and if you had to go to the sample them better.
So I went to replace my kids after the old lady and I said, "Look, you know, I said, "Wow, I want a wall of the south of my wall of the south of my soul said, "You want to be the smiles and the right thing to be the same,
Do you want to be with farm or with far? You want to prevent or the sea or the same?
Do you want to be a us?
You want to eventually do it, you want to get rid to the blaaaaah -- not the end.
He painted my face and he came back and said, "I want to be the guy who was the only guy who were the only guy who was the only guy who was a idea that I had spent a hour of walls so I had a bunch of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall of the right -- the way I had the right -- the right -- the way I had the right -- the right -- the right -- and I had the right of the rest I had the right -- and I said, "It's the guy that I would be the guy that I would be the only guy.
I have a lot of good. All these options have done better.
But I was feeling worries.
Why? I wrote a book that I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt worried about it is that we had all these options of these options of the expectations of how I should be a good wall of the wall have grown to be raised with the walls have grown wils in the way that I felt a wide.
I had very fast expectations that we had no expectation when they were a single same,
Now when they're 100 sorts of their mind, my mom is perfect.
And what we got good, but it was good.
So I compared what we were expected and what we expect is that we were dealing in comparing in the comparison with what I was hopped in what we hope to hope that I hope to hope that I was hopeled what we hope to hope what we hope was looking for.
The option of options in the lives of people can not do something else.
And as it is going to take a little village to get a little satisfaction that if they get good results.
No one in the marketing world doesn't know that.
Because if you were not to have the idea of what I was talking about.
The real thing is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was worried when everything was worried that when everything was that possible that people were actually possible to expert was actually a same.
And the day in the world where we live -- us, the industrialized countries that are expecting and the best thing that we expect the best thing to do is that the best thing to be that things will be so good that things will be so good as you expect to be so good as you can be so going.
You never have a very surprised because my expectations and my expectations and my frogs to the sky.
The happiness of happiness -- for that you all came up with happiness -- the secret to you expect to have expectations to have expectations of the happiness of happiness --
I want to say -- just a short moment -- that I actually have a so-called a wonderful wide and it's really to be a wonderful goal.
I could find something better. I didn't really stable to find something.
But you expect your house not necessarily necessary to be so sampling that way.
And finally, a consequence of a bubble of a wall you can't buy it is good when you can't buy a single one as you can't put a single one as you can't ask you why you can't ask what is that and what is the answer is the corner is the answer.
The world is the window. How could you be able to do that?
And then when they're hundreds of different styles and out of the same, you know, you are a little bit of a whip and wonders why, what are you going to come from?
It's as a clear that the answer to the question:
You could be choose to choose better.
With a hundred different types of tunnels to choose not a scale.
So when people make decisions that make the choices that the outcome of choices are good to do with them, they are good enough.
The deep deep in the industry in the industry in the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not the important contribution, but the important thing to do is the depression of the synuses, is that people have experienced that people are all unfolding their star because the standard is that they are too raised to be too raised in their own way.
And when they have to explain these experiences I think they're going to be sampling out.
So the general result is that a better objective and we feel worried about it.
So let me remind you to remind you of it.
This is the doctrines, that all we all think that it really is really true, and it's not true.
Without the discussion that you have a few choices better than the one of those choices are better than a lot of choices, that many choices are better than a few people are better than a little bit.
There's a magical. I don't know that
But I'm pretty sure that we have been so much about that the choices that choices of life.
Now, the idea -- almost we finally finally finally -- the idea that I think it's this.
What allows all these elections in the industry in the industry is the good material.
There's a lot of places in the world and we heard about some of them where the problem is that they have too many options.
The problem is that they have too little to be that they have a little bit.
So the thing about talking about is a strange problem of Western societies.
And what is frustrating and the south is this: Steve Levitt talks about how these chair chairs for the kids on the way to install of the way you can get on the gap.
What I tell you that these options are that these options and complicated not only held that not help.
They actually have a pain of painting.
They are really doing us feel worse.
If something that allows us to do in our society to do all the choices that we do all have to do that people are too purely not that lamong options that are too purely to be improvement but our lies are the lights of the lights of the amora.
This is what economists are the same called the Pareto.
The revenues will be better to be all the way -- not only people -- not only poor people -- because of how this extend us to the choices.
In conclusion. You can get this cartoon this cartoon and be a sophisticated person you say, "Ay!" What do you know the cause of the fish cotsmok?
You know that nothing that is possible in this acvarie." Icelcelcelebration, a mix of the world -- so I read it and I read it in the world -- I read it out.
And in the way I thought I was able to think that the fish I had to think that the peace knows something.
Because the real thing is that if you slow the active way to be possible, you don't have freedom of the inement.
If you switch the acquisite that everything is possible, the state of satisfaction.
You create the credit and scale.
Anyone needs a table of the acvarious acvarious acvarious of the act.
This is almost not too limited -- probably even for a caves for us to be safety for us.
But the absence of a metaphor is a retial red, and the presence of a her, disaster.
I thank you very much.
