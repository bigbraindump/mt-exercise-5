And the year we showed these two diawaye to demonstrate that the polar polar to demonstrate that in the last three million years was the size of the last 30-state state level, has been flying with 48 percent of the month.
But this morning, the serious issue because it's not the end because it doesn't look like the black black hetts.
The polar polar is in a way, the global system that the global system that we have global climate system.
It goes on and they are extended to the south.
The next slide that I'm going to show you will show up to what happened to be a little bit of what happened in the last 25 years.
The peak pense is the marcleaning with the mice.
As you can see the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the blue of the fish.
This is the anual annual on the top of the past.
And it is the day in the past.
Asa, the fety of the footprint of five years or more than you can see is almost like a body of a body.
In 25-year-old came from this to this one.
This is a problem because the inner of the death of the deep death around the ocean.
where it's a massive amount of carbon finger-based amount of carbon catches -- is transformed in metal catches of micro-organisms.
Comparing with the pollution of global pollution in the atmosphere of global warming could take this extreme if we go to if we go to this cost.
Of some lacks in some ways, the metal damn metal diseases is at the southern of the water.
The Kaatey Walter Walter Mato University in Alaska little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a few people at the past.
Oau! Tow! Al Gore: Your questions is -- it's going to be then.
And a reason is that a huge thing of "wor" is Groenland is Groenland is Groenland in the north.
This is a race that all over the year.
But the volumes are much larger than that.
This is the Kangerlushushin the Sweenland.
If you want to know how it creates the big levels of the marriage of the south of the south of the south of the soup.
These debt are growing very quickly.
And at the other end of the planet, Antarctica of the planet on the planet.
The last people have reported in the entire continent have reported as the continent is negative of the Antarctica is the negative of the island of the island of the islands on the ground.
This is the equal equal in the marriage of the big level.
In Himalaya, the main the third side, you see the new formats, you know, the new formats, who was in the cause of the sun --
40 percent of the population of the world get out of the world from the water from these topirs.
Today, this guetch is the surface of the water water for this city for this city of the city
The fact that they raised the ground.
But when it comes to the water water and the water water water --
In California, there was a 40-percent of the farmer in Sierra.
This is the water slowing the water.
And predicting, as you read it is serious.
On the entire global traction has led to a dramatic creature.
And the disasters are all on the globe, they grew up with a gradual rate with the previous and the fall of the way to the previous disaster of the world.
From four times the last 30 years of the last 30 years,
This is a completely unusual model of the absolutely crossed model.
If you look at the context in context you can see what happens.
And the last five years we adgated up 70 million dioxide in every 24 million dollars in every day every day in the ocean.
Up to the point of the Pacification of Pacification at the Western of the Indian where the Indian oxygen of the oxygen in the oceans in the ocean.
The largest because the only one of the global defend of global defend of deforests, is the report of the fossil fuels.
The page is a problem and the cars is the most serious and the good.
The United States is one of the two big emerging of China.
And the proposing was to build a lot of factors.
But we start to see a change.
Here are the people who have been announced in the last few years with the alternative alternative to be a propose.
However, there was a fiber of our political in your country.
And the carbon and the oil and the oil and the oil spills of billion-dollar industry.
The good cookton is a coorest is a ror.
This image of a reminder of something like this.
In the Cracial Cracial Cracial Os billions of the star cartoon was imprast.
You probably see it at the stars.
This is all the clock, the second big deal. It happened in America was in the presented in the presence.
One of the cookers of the good book, about the Cracial Cracial OOnene's been that.
Video: I am ♫ ♫ Frosy, a sletter and the goes; it's a suffer and you see it.
It's from abundance, here in America, and it helps to create the economy.
Frosty, the gold with the car, it becomes more curve.
It's also a adorable and workers recovering the slustrate of slops.
Al Gore: This is the key to the Virginia Virginia.
The largest map on the largest degree of Massey Coal C.
Video: Don Blankenz: I want to be clear the clart, Nanana, but Pelosi, Harry Reihabar don't have to talk about what I talk about.
Al Gore: So the same as Alianta Cattribute to the next campaign.
This is one of them, one of them from one of them.
Video: Actor: From COALi we see new changes in our business.
So our main is to spending a big amount of money for the public forces that we can help us show us the truth of public good.
The truth is actually did. In fact, the cars is not didn't.
We think it's curved -- and I sought -- and I have good.
So it will not make it for the climate change for the climate change for the climate change
You get it in our understanding of it.
Video: The good news: you have heard a map of it.
So let's make a look at a tube to do a good tube of the good forest of the cartoons.
Uls! Maso's a noise of the Sislery is about the zzzzzomoa.
But this is the sound of the technology of the technology of the goal.
And as the good cars are the main the main the global causes of global remarkable technology to change the technology of the technology of the goal.
Look at this point, this is technology today to the technology today to the cartoon.
Al Gore: In the enemy of the alternate to the right of the economic challenges and the problem with national security.
Video: Narrator: The America, is in the crisis in the national security crisis.
The worst that leads to all the law up all the dependence on the basic basic basic basic basic of carbon:
But now we have a new solution to the notion to the end of the incurcto.
You probably have America with electricity to 100, 10 years ago, in 10 years ago.
A plane that he had to go to the third thing, and to help us to make us more than global warming.
In the end, a solution that is to help us to help us solve our problems.
You probably America. You have America.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: Narrator: It's about re-energizing for the United States.
One of the most rapidly fast ways of the old combat of old combat that our planet Barby, our planet Barby, the Like is here to the God, the soil, so.
Barbbat r.2: We invest to create jobs.
Narrator: Roptent America. It's time for action.
Al Gore: The subject of African hour African who says, "If you go fast, you go up the only one hous."
If you want to get it around, you go awak!
We have to get it around.
Thank you so much.
And the year at TED I did a introduction to LHCHC.
And I promised to give up a data, a data about how it works.
So here I go. And for the people who have no idea here was here in LHC is the largest experiment, the most scientific experiment -- Cumphase is to recreate the contains or is to recreate the containers or is to create the courage of a billion.
It's extremely quote.
This is the Genevely.
We do the photographer "Big Bangs" in the decades.
I work at this point. It's called the ATLS -- Lunty, 44 meters, a picture of 22 meters a photograph photograph here is a picture of ATLS in the construction of ATLS in the construction of the ATLS in the construction.
On the age of the last year, I went to the first time I started on the first time.
And this picture was a ATLAS image.
It caused a huge celebrity in the room.
It's a picture of the first piece of particle that has quote over the course of the LHC, cross the LHC deliberately with a part of the LHC is detector.
In other words, when I saw that picture of that I was 10 seven, I knew that the image of the functioning of the functioning of a huge success.
I don't know if this was received the greatest oils, or this was going on on the page, and you see that the first page.
It means that I did a cultural impact on the langle of the impact of the ending.
And then about a seller I had a problem with the device, which actually had to do with these days.
Those are flowing 13 thousand ampers when the device is a motor of power to the maximum of the power of the maximum of the power of the moon.
Now, the engineers in the row of these days, and I say, "You know, I can't transport." I'm not a lot of the end."
But I can do this because when they're at the temperatures become a superconducting.
So as a 271 degree, is more than the friend of the hospital can transport these farming can transport these cutttings.
At one of the layers of the laws of the LHC, was a defer of factory factors.
So that the company was enzed a little bit of the 13 amperformed electricity have been talking about.
This was the result.
This is more impressive to the magnetic account in 20 tone, and they moved almost 30 pounds of tone, and they move.
So I deeply about 50 magnetic magnetic --
I had to take it to the end, which is what we would do.
I reconfidence all of the way to the top, I repair
And now we go into the subterm and then we go into the subteran.
The end of his marvelous marvelous March THC will be like new Lease will be as new as new as we are as new as we are as a new one.
We will start to get up and we go to this data in the unit or of widea, and we will keep the research to find the tools that are the elements of the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, those accidents of the discussion of the interesting thing about the important thing about the extreme and engineering is rejected.
I think that it is that the fact that it's attacking is that it is the important thing that we have young young people like LHCHC.
So I'm going to leave that our words are the words of a scientist of the British Davy, who I think when the experiments protected by the way, this is Michael Faraday, he said, "Nimic progress for human minds to preserve the progress for us to presence the footprints are finding to the footprints are not in our minds are not as a mystic and are not in our world, they are not finding the world are findynamic and not as our works,
Thank you.
I want to start with the rate of a child, when you were playing with the boats.
On the top of the surface to get them and get them and get them to get them and get them to get them to get them to the stand and and give you to the spatial issues.
The hospital of the spot is deep death of how we understand a lot of the world of inconclues.
So in the quality of the IT who inspired the IT interveness with our interactions -- impressive immediateless -- impression of my Pattery, and my collaborator -- I was going to start -- I would be when we use a computer -- I would use a computer to be when we use a computer that would be so much digital maming with a mountains a missing to the mountains that would be both diving, and we could be both both both of the informed and we could be both
So what we want to do you now?
And the question was so excited about the fascinating that we hostand we said, we have the answer to the Sweet creature.
In short, Siftable is a computer interactive computer interactive computer interaction of a bism.
They can be manufacturer can be shocking the reeffort, you know, they can perceive a bunch of the screen and a radio and a radio planet.
The most important is that there are a palpable of games, like the game, you can just get them like to get them as they just get to the way to get them out.
And Sifwitwitwitnesses a new ecosystem to be a new set of digital manipulating information.
On the top of the surface of these tools become more palsing, their mission of the other conferences of our nutritions of our nutractions on their own nutractive and destructive new and destructive new and new ways to interact with new stills.
I'm going to start with simple.
This Siftable is to figure out the image, and if you include the video video of a direction, if you include in the other side, they go back to the other.
These portraits are interactive to each other is one of the other side.
So, if I put them one langer on the other side.
If there are inconcedented by this, they will be a little bit of confusion.
They also can feel the mission and inclining.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of interacting is that we can use the data that we can use the data, how we can use the data as we would be a color as we would be a living.
In this case, we have three Siscameras a gas and can use them to kill them in the center and they can use them to the center, where they will be the worse.
If we get too much, we can get too much, we can get the back.
There are also interesting possibilities for education, like the education, as a language and logical language, mathematics and logical sense, and to see people who we want to see the results are immediately to see the results immediately.
So here I -- this is a size, the From a simple program that are doing with a simple program of equative.
Here we have a game game game game of the words of the words of Scrabs and Boggles.
So in every single one of the first established in every Siftable Sweet on the surface, and they are green to forget with a diction-the-rate with a diction-dictioned dictionary dictionarian dictionary dictionaries.
And then after about 30 seconds resed, and you have a new set of letting new letters and we have a new set of letting and we can be inccleaning and we have a new set of incccleaning at 30 seconds of the last 30 seconds of the second where they resesesed.
Thank you.
These are children who came to the children who came to the Media Media, and I went to go to defend them and reached them a material.
It lived to the crazy.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of applied this kind of applies.
Everything you have to say is "From the words, and they know exactly what to do.
Here are other people who are asking people to go ahead and
This is the most tanker testing to our right in the right.
It turns out that everything wanted to do was to make a Siftable to do one over the other.
So for him was just a cups.
This is a set of animated animating.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who invest language.
And this is Felix.
He can introduce us to us to the stage in the scene, just raising the charge of the Sweiss that they seem to be a person.
So here we put the sunlight on the sun.
Video: The forces of the race.
David Merrill: Now he introduced a tractor in the scene.
Video: The piror of the portrait
Very y! Yes!
When Stable and the Stangangs and assign to the langer can make it -- Video: Wideo: Wideo: Ham!
DM: It makes it a narrative.
Video: All right.
DM: It's a open story with the end of how it will be debt is going to be debt.
Video: Zboard.
DM: The last example I was looking for for it to look at today is a tool of designing and interpretation of the Min's sound, and in which we built the role sounds like the role and all the role of the sound like the role and all the way to the row of of the people that we would look at it.
Each of those four different variations of different variations that you want to use it.
And you can get the sound of the inject that you have to get all the sorts of you want.
The soft sounds the road roples of a Siftable Sweden.
There are effects you can control the lives, like the reverberal and the filter of the filter and the filter of the filmmaker.
You can see it a certain sounds and then including it sounds and then including it to help it off.
The next general effects like the general effects and the volume that are applied to see His to see it.
Video: YM: We start with a riting rhythmar camps in Sif, we have an arrived, a serious exten.
Now I'm now saying a basic line.
Video: DM: Now ading a cleaning cleaning awake.
Video: YM: And now I'm going to adgain, to control the top, to control the lives.
Video: DM: And I can tell the inclined inclining in a part or a part or a part of a part of the other.
Video: YM: Now I'm going to go for more and more except for more expressive expression.
Video: YM: And I can require them to do it for the amount of time.
So I don't have to do the planet, I can improvise, I can improvise, presented or short too.
Now, in the end I can apply the selling of Sifwar camp by using the Sifwitwitzerland.
Thank you.
As I see my passion is my passion is the creation of us is the better to the brain and the way that it works with our brain.
And today, I had time to show you a coordination of this new hospital of design, and you know, and you can actually take them out of the lab.
The Ganda that I want to retiny is like we are at this new generators with the new set of interaction with the middle of the world around us by the world of our rules in our world.
Thank you very much.
And these wiss with you to talk to you all see it.
I'm writing out.
He describes is my teacher, but of course, more than that.
It's all my mother, and fascinating it and fascinating,
And I don't have this kind of a thing to do is change that you ever do.
But this is what it was told that something happened, and in my career and in my career and the required me to report my intreatment with working.
And the truth thing is like this book of the book called "Manannoa's "Manannoa's Rageste," which is the way of my career than my cart's career in the world for a little bit of an amazing which is this kind of a little bit of an international sense, and it became this conceptive sensus to this kind of a international concept.
The result is like where I go now, people go now, people are going to be convicted by as being a convicted.
Serios -- the convict, the dead!
Very of people say, "You know, you don't say, "You know, it's not going to be a worse of this before?
You don't have the chance of you will go to the whole bunch of life is to create a better book that you ever have a book ever se?"
It's very lineasier.
But it was even more likely to remember if I was not going to go to the people -- when I was a teenaged when I was adolescenting -- I want to become writing the same kind of a kind of the same African reaction on a kind of the same African reaction on a kind of the same African reaction on a kind of a kind of ranging that would not be a kind of a kind of a way of the kind of respondenies.
And people said "Not you" is that you don't have any any of success?"
Do you don't know that humility will be rejection to reach the waste of you?
You don't know that you're going to work in this field, and nothing will be in this field, and nothing will be on a board, and you will be a spending finger with the guns of the flow of the flaw of the among among the among the ammed of the whole thing.
Something like that.
The answer -- the answer to all those questions on all those questions is ""Yes."
Yes, it's immediately that we have been the theme of all of the things.
And I always get me.
And you have a lot of the things that people who are no longer to go to the people who can't get them.
As an example of the marriage of the marriage of the big algorithms.
But when it's about the work that I was all the things I thought about the last thing I was "What?"
Is it something rational?
It's the logic is to this wisdom to be able to do it was destroying this to make it for the Pame.
And what is it attached to the specific consistent that seems like we really certainly in a support of health care in a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a way that other teachers don't do it?
My father was a chemical engineer and not as an engineer and not as a chemical engineering to be asked to be a chemical engineering to be a chemical engineer to be a chemical engineer to be a chemical engineer to be a chemical engineer to be a chemister.
It wasn't happening, John, how does the block that go with chemical?
It just doesn't happen to happen.
But we are to be honestly, engineers like groups, and we don't have a lot of reputation to be alcools to be alcools of the pressure.
We write a reputation -- we have this reputation, and not just writing all the kinds of things like this reputation to be strong, and it turns out that they reputting this reputation to be strong.
And everything we have to do is to look at the numbers of the numbers of the 20th century, in the 20th century, in the 20th century, which have died by young and often died by young man.
And even those who hasn't been doing to be true of their own destruction of their own lives.
Norman Mailer, even before I was in the last interview, he said that "Each of my carts" -- he killed me a little bit more than I haven't more than I haven't more than a more t."
An extraordinary ary ary work on a life.
But I don't have clean up when we hear someone like this, we hear this because we heard this kind of things like this, we have absorbing and and unaccept, the idea that the creativity, the idea of the creativity, the idea of the purpose, it will always lead to the end of the worth will always get a bad.
And the question I want to adverty, you all of this is you all the problems with this idea?
You can comfortable with his ownership -- because it doesn't see me -- I don't think about this custome.
I think it's like odize.
And I also think it's dangerous and not to see it in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage to make the artistic artists,
And I know that I was suffering -- in my case, in my situation -- would be very dangerous for me to go to the cartoon this character of this kind of a circumstance.
As for example, I'm pretty tank, I just have a pretty tank, I just have a 40 years.
I have to have a lot of work of work before the worker.
And it's very likely to be a lot of what I'm going to write with this moment that the work that I had come from my own success came from my career of the last few years, right?
What it would say to the men, because of the one kind of the one of the most successful -- it's probably my most successful to me.
Oh, Does, what gand!
This is the kind of gas to get someone to go to the gin to the end of the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I mean, I'm going to do this message that message that I love it.
And then the question the point, right?
And so I go to the meditation, as it was in which I have to work now, to write a way to write a kind of construction, is by creating a kind of construction, right?
I had to have a way to find a way to fly a distance to the confer that write, and my father who write, and my graduate lawyers who would be now before I write the writing of what I write about what I write
And as we all look at the last year in this sense, we started looking at the time, and I tried to find other society to see other society to have better ideas about how to be helping people to be held to be held to be helping people to be helping people to be held to be held emotional risk to the emotional risk to the emotional risk in this emotion.
This is what he went to Greece in Greece, and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma Sera.
So you know, you get the inchitch is the inchitching.
But in Grests and Roms and Roms are not that people don't think of the people don't think the creativity of the human inside of the human inside of the human human being in the human inside of the human human beings.
People thought that creativity was a spirit was a spirit that the credit people in a surround and unintelligence, from the inner and unintelligent and units.
The ones were called these spirits of creatures are helping to the creatures "the term of the term "the term of the terrorists of "We red" --
Socrats was famous because it has a demon which has a department in the department of the department.
Romans had the same pared, but they called creative, impaid, the imaterial spiracy.
What is great, because the romantic romantic genius was actually a very individual genius was a very exciting individual gap.
They thought that a genius was a kind of magical entity that truly is what the credit studied by the artist studied by the Dobby, the south of the housin and unable and obby, the south of the work, and the result of the worker workers in the workforce, the result of the workforce, the result of the workers of the workers of the working.
Absoldier -- this is really the distance of the distance of the psychological building -- that the conference that we protect the worker of the workforce.
And all the world is so what it works, right?
So the artist was protected by some things, like the things like a lot of things, right?
If your work was straluce, you couldn't have the whole thing to do, the whole world for her, the all the world as you have this genius that has helped it.
If your work was critical, it was not completely release the her, it was not completely it?
Everybody stand as the gene was about ignorance.
So they looked at people from the Vest creativity, for a long time.
And then came to the Renasting and everything that was changed, the idea of the main the center of the universe as an individual city of the universe of the universe of the state and mysteries that are received to the stock that they received from diving.
It was the humans of human rational, and people have started to create the creatures like the creativity.
And for the first time in history in history of people have started talking about one or another, instead of a genius.
And it is going to be able to married, I think it was a huge error.
The table to the person to create a simple person, and it is actually the received of the received and the received and the mysterious and the insects and the untain, the unfortunately.
It's like you have a cool to the sun to the sun to the soft
It just recovoted and deforms of the away, and genereforests.
I think that the pressure of this killer artist's artistic in the last 500 years.
And if it's true, I think that is what is we do is asking it that is we do it?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we go back to the greatest relationship between people and the relationship between people and the myths.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't just want to stand and and to make us 500 years of human as a speech of a talk to a talk to a talk to a talk to you
And you may have been in public in public that would raise the signals of the people who are actually going to be in the field of the soft people present around the projects over the projects over the projects over the projects over the projects over the projects over the projects over the projects around the world,
It probably doesn't want to go to to this idea.
But the question I want to ask is -- why I want to ask is -- why not?
Why don't we think about that?
Because it has a sense of it as much as I heard about something I heard about the explanation of the creative process.
It is access to the fact that it was trying to create something -- basically to create something -- in the way -- it is always a behavior.
And in fact, sometimes it can actually slowing the right to the paranormal to the right to the right of the right to the right to the right to the paranormal in fact, sometimes it can actually switch the way to the paranormal can actually go to the paranormal to the paranormal to the paranormal to the right to the paranormimical.
I had a retalent where I met I met in the American American American Rutch Stone, who was now in the American NSA who was on the top of the day and that he told me when she told me when she told me when she was a poetry to work on the camp, and it just happened to be on the cameras and it was just the poet on the camp.
The story as a vast vast of the same.
And it was a roads of the camps.
The idea of the income because you get the fallery fishertain.
In that moment that it has one thing that has a single thing to do, and some of the people who are going to be aler."
And the running up to the housin to the housin the housin a map of map and a piece of map and a fast fast fast and to go through him and go through it and get it through a map.
Sometimes it was not enough to be enough and algae and alery and runs in the house, but it doesn't go through the housin and the poems and the poems and the poems and the poems and the poems of the room, I read "Mr.
They were also the moments in which -- and I'm going to forward -- the moments that story as almost unfortunately, the story that almost loss.
The gadd home, the home and the poems and the poems and the credit card the credit card up with the other hands and the story of he and he had the other man's strength and the cleaning and the other man's state.
And he had the cooking and then he would go into the body and then in the main the math.
In this case, the poems of the perfect map of the perfect and unless and unless and unless at the last time at the first worse.
When I heard it -- it's just -- it's just the only thing about my own creature.
My design process doesn't matter matter to that -- I'm not drive!
I'm a catching catch in which they work on every day and I go to the same day and transfer and go to the same way to go with the weight and to go with the weight and to go on.
But even though I was like, in my good, and I was attached to me, and I was attached to the phenomenon.
And I imagine that as the same as many of you are also a lot of you are.
And I had the projects or ideas that have come from a source of a source that I don't know it.
And what is the whole thing about that?
And how do we should report us to report us so that we don't lose to lose our minds, you know, we want to help us reach to help us reach the disease to reach us to reach out the sample to report the re?
For me, the most relevant example of what we would do is about how we can do is the music that we can do is the music we took a look like a couple of years ago in the revivivivil with the report to the reminds of the revivivividly relevant to the replication of our days.
I was talking about this subject and Tom was almost all the way to the enjoy of the artist of the contemporary artist who begins to control and gestablishing and gestablishing and stock to the creative inside the orizing.
With the walkers came up with the story as a day of the story as a day to Los Angeles and then everything happened.
While I drive a short t t fragile a short seat in a meeting and magical and magitor, as a and magical and the inspire of the end, it's not like to be how to go away.
It doesn't have any hip of map, it doesn't have a five-reported bubble.
The whole thing that the town that the old vanxiety of the Middle of the Middle of the banker for the time.
I'm not enough to reach the door to revevevevevevere."
And instead of looking at the panick, just stopped
It stopped the whole process and made something with a whole new and it all of it.
It raised the way and he said, "You know, you don't see that I'm at an volaner?"
"Are you going to write a little bit like a note that could be a now?
If you want to truly exists, I go into a moment when they can do it for you.
If you go and you get it to another opportunity.
Dug and you get it to Leonard Cohen."
He was the truth process changed the process of this.
Not the opera continuous opera was going to be able to be the same thing.
But the process is the process and the whole thing around him, he had been ased in the moment he took the south, and only because he had to go back and only because he had to come back to where he came back to the way to where he came back to the order, and then it doesn't have to be something that inside the orange.
It could be this unit could be collaboration and the bizarre, and the external external external external to the external external that was not too much like Tomomom.
And after I heard the story of what I heard of a little bit of the way I was working on.
This approach me saved when I was at the middle of the "Manana, Roage," and I have cased in a kind of a kind of a kind of a way that we all go to the way that we all go to the way to be a bad disaster to think that it would ever be a bad reporting to be a reporting to be a quire the most propose.
Not just this one thing but the most proposing this book write.
I had to think that I would have just just to abandone.
I remember my opening my hospital and I was talking about the hospital and I certainly asking and I was finishing.
I raised my manusual and I got my comments, and I reveals a colleague to the camera.
I said to him: "Asculpture, and I know that if this book is not going to be extraordinary because if I was my father's not just going to be just the hous?
Because you can see that I put one on the battle on the battery I would have to go to the best.
So if you want to be better than it is to be better than you can do the right side of the third side.
Okay. And if you don't do this, you know, you know, you all of it.
And I would write a little bit like this is my message.
And I want to consign for this today as I did my job I did my job my side."
Because -- the Conclusion -- -- with hundreds of years in deep in the North Africa, the people are going to get to get the battery to the gload and music music and music music in a role in the air, the panded.
And they were always wondering, because the dancing were teaching were teaching were teaching and they were remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be all wondering, right?
But sometimes the other things happening, and one of the interpret of the common in the community.
I'm convinced you all know what I think about what I mean by what I think about is a certain moment of interpretation.
It's like the time stops and the dancing is on a kind of a stock of a lot of different shape, in the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the birth.
It was not going to be in the third size.
It's lightened inside and light-finger flowing up to the football of the footprint.
And then when it happens, when they were talking about what was going on is called the name.
and they were untains and they were going to scanning the "Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, Stemon, Game, Game, Game, Gam."
It's God.
A interesting amannouncement -- when the main -- when the Spanish Spanish was going to be on the Spanish and the pronounced in "Allah," and "lah" in "Yes, Allah" in "Yes, All, l's, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
and they hear the cleaning with the table and dancing.
In Spania, when a interpret received something impossible and magic is a "Heal," Allaw, Allaw, Allaw, the real ar."
Helloops -- a God of God -- a God of God --
It's wondering, because we need to have that.
But the sea comes up to the second day in the morning, is the insuspicious is that it's also a big scale, 17, and it's not a scaling scale.
It's a dirty that chances are and that you may not be able to go to the gene and maybe even more and forward to the other people.
Can you do that anyone to the name of Domn's name, so that he should be doing with his rest of his life?
It's wrong.
It's one of the most paintings of the most paintings of creative.
But it may not be a sample in that if you don't think about it as a great part, as you know, as the most extraordinary party is the most extraordinary parts of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the world.
Maybe if you just think that they were improud of a source of a source of a moment of a life of the next few days, it would be a lot more than the time they have been more than the time they were on the other.
If we think it really begins to change it.
I started thinking and I started thinking and I thought it was going to be published to be publish the book that will be publishing up on my own confidence and crossing my succeeded and crack.
And what I do, I do with it, when you lose the clean clear the sun on the shelter.
It doesn't be the say. It just just like the Continy Continy to do your party, any one would be her.
If you know the dance, then dance.
If the gene come and expression that you are repair to go to the enemy to go to a cleaning her, even for a quick wall the forces of the forces of the forces of the forces of the forces of the disorders of the dirty of the dirty did, "leancy die and the center of the dirty of what you
And if no, they go anyway.
And with all of these "le!"
I think we should have to be able to pretend to pretend to the world.
"Oh!" And yes, just because you have a lovely because you have a lovely inincaping and incapital to keep in continuing.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I talked about some of these projects, about the human genome, and what would be able to predict the discover of us and discovering new genes.
Now we start with a new point: We actually digital point: we digital code from this code and now we're trying to start to go into a new fishing and to go into a new flowing forward and asking forces and self-self-est.
We tried to put all the time to ask us questions.
"What is life life that I think many biologists have tried to understand to understand the variety of variety levels.
We tried different approaches, simple approaching life to the based on the bottom.
We are already already about 20 years.
When I sequenced the man man man man walked out of the world from the analogical world in the digital world,
Now we're trying to regenerate it: Can we regenerate new forces of life, in this digital universe, in this digital universe?
This is a map of a mice, Mycoplasma genitarium, which has the smallest genome, which has the only one species that can replant in the lab.
We tried to see if we can come up with a genome and smaller genome.
We have been able to get the surface of a gene from a hundred genes in the judgment of the way that are there.
But when we look at the metabolic map of metabolic map to our comparison with us.
I think it is simple.
But when we look at all of the genes that we can get the first time to a single single cell to produce a life that is probably a life that we can take a life for a life of life.
So we decided that we decided that the only way to stand asking this crosis, we can see this cross to reach the components to reach some of the most fundamental questions.
And so I started on the road, "Can we snassess?"
Maybe the chemistry allows these molecules that we don't ever have done before?
And if we can make a cross of a cross-?
A crose, by the way, by the way, is just a gas a chemical piece of chemical.
So, our speed speech's life grew up to a rhythmous rhythmous rhythmous rhythmous of our exponential.
Our ability to describe the genetic code, but it really grown up to the ground.
The last time he came to a soup the exponential curve.
I started this for a better at 15 years.
I went through a few days of the water, in fact, with a bio-etal examination before it makes the first experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is really difficult, the DNA is really difficult.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make little bit of DNA by 30-letter process, but it's a more generative process of the generative process of what you built, so much more erable with more error.
So we had to create a new way to create a new way to put these little dots together and the right of the errors.
This was our first tentative, starting from the digital information from the digital dose, to be the thetic theose.
It's a virus that killer killer that killer killer human being.
I did the paper design, we went through the right right through the right of errors, and I have a molecule of only about 5,000 letters letter.
The interesting thing that I came when I took this piece of chemical material, and we put it in bacteria, and I put it in bacteria, and the bacteria, and to produced this gene code of the virus of the virus of the virus that the party of the virus.
The virus were then released out of the cells in the cells and they have come back and they have come back and they have been killed by the E.
I was talking to the oil industry and said to the cure of the cure of the curriculum of the model.
They have laughing more than you do.
And so we think this is a situation where the software can be built, and they can build their own main in biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the entire cross of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code.
So we said to put the letters in the letters in the middle of the virus to could actually understand that the size of the houses of a houses that are about the reports of a lifestyle.
And the fact that you have to be critical, and if you start with the digital information has to be very precise.
When I sequenced this genome in 1995, the standard was a clever of a 1,000-based classrooms of the walls of the walls of the walls of the walls of the first time of the genome of the first time I have a genome of the genome in 1995, the standards in 1995, the standards in 1995, the standard of the genome in 1995, the standards in 199
I found it, in the resident, 30 to the end of the original era, this was not used to be activated.
The design is in design is the project, which has the long-term project, has to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit less units to build some of the little bit more than we have to design some of the games that you have to be compatible with each other.
We create unuseless.
You may read that we put "waters" in the house. Go to this one code in the home, we have a code in four letters of four letter: C, and T.
Trigo from those letters -- those letters -- those letters about 20 remember a literally literally literally account each of the prepresence every remember,
So we can use the code to write the word words, propositions to the rules.
Immmmal, everything we did was to hear the code.
Some of them were disapplied that it's not poetry.
We designed those pieces so that we can defend up with the enzyme.
I'm sure that they repair and they are they repair them.
So we started doing the gents, beginning with gaps to seven to 7,000 lets to do it by 24,000 lets to make these little bits stations from these laws, and then put it on the other 2.00.
Every time we get these pieces of these pieces in the abundance to sequence, to make a very range of truck a very ranging process -- as you can see a mind.
We try to get to get to that the automatically.
So, this is what a basketch of baskets.
When we get to the very large steps of the bottom, you know, they don't grow so much more than E.
It is all all the tools of modern molecular molecular molecule.
So we went to other hanisms.
I knew there is a mechanism called a human recombination of human biology that is used to repair DNA, and which is useful to reach the joint.
This is an example.
There is a organism called Deinocockcockrow can be a million radiation of radiation.
As you see in the same, the cross of his cross is is destruction.
It was 24 hours later, he put it on his new lawyers like it was at the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be often often all of the organisms.
I can live in the life.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the space can be in the space of the extreatment of a new environment to go to find a new environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is what happens.
Here's a micrograph is a micrograph that we build these procleaning -- in fact, using the advice of the market food that we have only been put together with the design that we put on the ground.
Drojja stars together and they put together the automatic.
This is not a microscope with electronics, but just a micro-to-micro-grapher --
It's so a big molecule that we can see a microscope with a microscope with a microse.
These are images collected over a secondary time.
This is a public that we've had been a little bit of time.
These are over 580,000 letters of genetic code,
It's the largest molecule made ever before, with a defined structure.
It has a map of the molecular molecular molecular over 300 million of the year.
If we get a little bit, we have 10 to the space of 142 pages to get this genetic code, you know, this genetic code,
So, how do we start a cross-cross-gravy?
Since a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to go with bacteria bacteria to go with bacteria.
Estate, I also get a little bit of eucarios like you can just take the nuclear nuclear nuclea nuclear and put it -- clony.
With the archa, the cross is is integrated in the cells, but we showed that we can do a completely transplant to make a completely transplant to a completely completely transplant from one to another, and we can active.
I had a chance to one of the microbial species from one of the microbial species of the microbial species of the species of the microbial species of the microbial species of the microbial spectrum of a microbial cosmic of a gas a truly of a microbial in one of the microbial species from one of the microbial species from one of the microbial species of the microbial
The second is that as people are about as people and the sun as people and smoke.
We added a few genes in the plus to see this cross--crosis.
I deeply to enzymous them to the enzymous proteins
And it was pretty amazing, when I put in the cell -- you'll get our very sophisticated -- and the cross of our sunlight has come into the cell.
In fact, we thought this is how far it can go ahead and we tried to design something more than that.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are looking at all sorts that have been to be a second cross of the third cross of the third time, from the other partner, thousands of new characteristics of us in a second.
So those people who think about evolution just as a single gene of changing the biology.
I'm called enzymes, called restrict DNA restrict DNA
The Cromosome that was in the cell that was in the cell.
The gone -- the cross we put us --
It was expressed and recognized the other cross like the gentlemen, and so we were just with the cross of the cross of the new cross at the net.
It became blue because of genes that we put in cross--crosis.
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristics of a species have lost lost in a completely new species on the software that we put in the software that we put in the cell that we put in the cell that we put in the cells that we put in the cell.
All the proteins were changing, the membranes were changing, when we clever the genetic code, is exactly what we transfer that we transfer the way we transfer the result.
This can sound like alchemistry, but we can move the software to the DNA to change the pretty dramatically change the pretty dramatic.
Now, I support that this is not genesis -- but to build three billion years and a half years and a half years and we support that we can actually create a new version of the Cambridge of the Cambridge of the camera, the basic design of the digital mammoth.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty obvious about it to be awesome.
We're on the way to go from six and a half to seven to nine billion people over 40 years.
So I'm going to ask this in context for me to my context for me in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet, for each of us there in 1946; in 40 years, will be four.
We have a soup problems with potons of potons of pottttons and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half of the south, we have a lot of south, we have a drinking of south, and to have a drinking water --
It will be difficult to do it for the new one.
We use over five billion tons of books, more than 30 billion barriers of oil bars of oil bar barrier.
This means a hundred million barriers on the day.
When we try to think about procing this biological or at any process that will be a challenge.
And then of course, it's all that CO2 to this material, which is the atmospheric that it gets to the atmospheric
Now, from our discoveries around the world, we have a basic basic dated data with the data with these kinds of designers in the future.
The electronics has just just a due to a due to a bit, and this is the diversity that came out of that.
We're limited here in the first time, a biological reality and our imagination.
We have now the techniques, because of these kinds of same, to make what we call what we call what we call the genymic.
We have the ability to build a big robot that make a million cross on the day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of genes of different genes of genes to make the occups, vaccines to produce the pharmaceutical products to make a little team, we can only change more biology than the last 20 years, we just make more biology than the last 20 years,
And that's just the standard selection of standard selection here.
We can select for viable to improve chemical substances or fuels, producing production of vaccines, which is the city.
This is a design of a design design design design that we work in order to wait for us to wait for these species in computers in the computer.
You know, we don't know how it will show it how it will show you how it will show you what it would look like.
We know exactly how they look at their genetic code.
We now focused on the fuel of fourth generation.
You saw it from the pumb at the ethano experiment.
We have a generation of the second and the third generation that will be slowing up to the soup, which are roughly falls of the south or different kinds of fatal button.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact on the food and the fall of food and the fall of the way to CO2 as a math of the CO2 as a math to design and work to design the cells to have the first generation to have the first generation of the generation in about 18 months.
Low solar and CO2 is a method -- but in our discoveries around the world we have all sorts of of our world.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It goes into the deep deep deep in the ocean, and half a kilometers and a half of the temperate temperature.
Transform CO2 in metan used molecular using hydrogen as a surrounding energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 captured, which can be transported in the country, and we would make that CO2 back to the fueling to the product to the product to the product to the provide.
So in a short period of time, we think we could have what is the question of what is the question, "Are you life?"
We really know -- you know, we have -- we have to replace the entire industry of oil industry.
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where another paradig?
So let me get a major source of energy.
But we also work to use these same same surfaces to invest to invest their own vaccines immediately.
You saw this year with the bottom of the bottom and a dollar dollar in minus when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think that the situation can be changed by the combined vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccine before the ground.
So this is how it could go to the future changes now change the evolution of evolution, accelerating the evolution of the bacteria with bacteria bacteria and finally, the end, the end.
We're almost to improve people.
Our base is just to make sure that we have a little bit of a very long way to survive very long for us to be able to do that. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you the next time, is a new fundamental thing that we've added up to Microsoft a new technology, about a year at TED, this is a year. This is a year. This is a year.
It's a average that can interact with a lot of visual data from a big amount of visual data.
So we look at a lot of the digital pictures and subject to the digital and the subject of the perfect and rearguing it by the way, rearized anyway.
It doesn't matter how much information is that we look at the big information is these columns or how big images.
Most of the people are pictures of a new new new digital camera, but this is a scanner, for example, is a Congress, the Congress, the Most of 300 megap.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that should the only only thing is the number of your pitch is the number of your monitoring to a very flow. It's also a very flow.
This is a book that is a book for a non-imaginative.
It's about "Ca" -- the friend of Charles Dickens. Each is a colored capita.
To show you that it's about text, and not a imagine, and not a imagine, we can do something that is really a re-re-re-re-re-re-theme is a positive pose.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read a book in the electronic book in form.
I don't want to recommend.
This is a more real. It's a "Gardian of "Gardian of "Take it.
Each imaging is the beginning of a second.
This is really a piece of joy a piece of experience of a quote journey of a newspaper of a newspaper environment.
We did something small and we do something with the collaboration with this number of "Gardianul."
I created a false reclaim to a very larger -- much more than in any clouds -- and I have a common contains -- and I have a containment.
If you want to see the properties of this machine that you can see here.
Or other models, or even other models.
And this really cleaning from some idea, the road of a monitor.
We hope that this is to be sicking pops, and other people like -- which is not necessary.
Of course, the mapping is one of the applications for a technology of the kind of technology for a while.
I'm not going to say a lot of time on this stuff, but just to tell you that we have contributed to this field.
These are all the road in the United States of the United States of NASA ASA ASA ASA ASA ASA ASA ASA ASA in the United States of the United States of the United States in the United States of the United States in the United States of the United States the United States at a picture of the United States at a scale of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United NASA
Let's go to a look at something else.
This is actually active on the Internet acquire the Internet to the Internet.
This is a project called Posyne, which is the second technology. Some of them is Sealow, and the other other wonderful research in the field of visual perception of visual perception of the universe of the Washington Savon Washington Snavo Confer to the United States See Steve See See Steve See See See Steve See See Constosyyyyynennnn,
and Rick Szelisiski at the Cerzelism.
So this is active on the Internet. Posse because Sealot.
You can see that when we think when we create this kind of perspective, when we can have this kind of experiences in many ways, we can have this kind of experience.
But the space space space of these images of these images that really required.
Ogerian visual visual intervention have recorded these images, so that to report -- they do these pictures -- all of these pictures -- they were doing all over the Grases -- were able to see these tools here on the COOs here a projections here a projection of a projection or panorring space are related to the space or panels were related space of space and these images were related to the space of the space of a projections and so that they were all these pictures and these pictures of the real elemerging images of these images of the real elemerging images of the
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environment.
There are some that have a lot of space.
I would like to go to one of the original stories, this is -- that makes a part of a protool of Posynical trip that we worked in -- to show you what I think is the pioneer of this technology, just just by vision of this technology, just by vision. It's not just a clear to the projects, not just vision.
We had to have to have been talking about the tasks of the legal aspect of the words.
This is a reconstruction of Cadral Reatedral images on Flickr. Does Flickr. Does Flickr, and you find something like something with the pattern in the trouble with the patterns are found a that would be found that they were found that they were found a cooker that would be found that coded up a cooke.
These are pictures on Flickr, and all of them were related to the space in this way.
We can just go into this movie in this motion.
You know, I never thought I would go to work at Microsoft is very eating to have a part of a part of a very primary to have a prime to have a prime to have a primary prime here.
I don't have that noticed that I'm a lot of the camera, all of the cell phones at SRs Rs Rs Rs Rs Ls Rs in this environment.
If you can find out the fingertips.
There are so many scared of girls' fee, swake up.
One is going to be here -- it's a series of photographing --
This is a poster Aper who was recorded the right record.
You can get you to a poster to a physics of this environment.
The idea is that they can do things with the environment. This means to collect the world -- from collective around the world -- from collective memory, and to interconnected to what the Earth is the Earth -- and they have been interconnected to them all those pictures were all interconnected to the partners.
You have a model of what comes out of the Earth.
Think about this as a cool of Stephen Lawler Lawler Lawler CEEEEEO of the Earth.
And this is growing in complexity as the world as we use the world as well as the benefits of benefits as users are using to the users as well.
The teachers are all the pictures of metaphetches that someone else enough.
If someone would be eeeeeen and it would say who are going to be who I am a little bit of the Nobel Ds improvement with all these dates, and I could use it as a social experience.
And of course, a product product and all of these are the huge and the virtual model of the ecal model of the Earth, collective and collective parts of the Earth, but in the village of the village and images from the village and images from the village of the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood the right to your software to allow your software to be a moment in the next few years, is that all the pictures of the pictures of someone on the gload to be interrelate?
BA: Yes. What does is really to be dealing is to dealing is to dealer.
It creates hyper-lining creatures.
And it does that based on the stage of the images.
And this is becoming a quote when you think about the outcome of the information that have these images.
As you do a picture of the Internet, you know, you get a look at some words on some words on the Internet gives you a lot of information about what is the pictures about the point.
Now, what if that poses does that picture make the connection to all the pictures of all the picture?
And then the amount of interconnection and the disease that the leaders that are a huge amount of real. It's where the classrooms of the country.
CA: Blaise, is really incredible. Felics.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense plant skills and one of the joy of the chance of the nographics of the old nographics that have no past, who are still the past, who feel the past, who are still the past, he would still feel the last roads in the row of plants.
You know, you know, the Jaguary Jaguary Calar Lacty, or that the Maga's Twenters still reminds with the understood of the people who continue to understand the Dharbor is to revealing our world is actually to remember the world that we actually have no sense that the world that we live in a anthropology, and this is not just a sense of a model of the world that we live in a model of the world that we live in a model of
The consequences of a certain set of decision-makers who have been working on the street and success, even with a lot of generations in the next generations in the next generations in the next place.
And of course, all of us by using the same imperative adapties.
We all are born. We all bring children to the world.
We go through the initiatives of initiative.
We have to do separate the separation of our morning, so we should not surprise, housing, dancing, dancing, dancing we all have arrived.
But what interesting is the unit of the unique of song, the dance of the dancing.
I mean, it's the Penn Penan Penn Borneo, or the woodo from Haiti, or the war war in Haiti, the tribes from Kenied, the tribes from Kenied, or a card of the Curanderan advanced in the middle of the Sahahaha.
And then this is the guy who I traveling through the deep of desperately a month of a month of the Colages, the Everest, the Everest, the Sverest, the Sweden, the Sverestoring of the world.
All these people are learning that there are other ways to think there are other ways to think about the other ways to think about the Earth.
And this idea, if you think about it, it can't be like hope.
Now, miridges of the world with a spiral reached of spiral life and cultural growth and cultural health cooks and the biological health of the planet of life, knowing the biological health of life, we know about the biological health.
And you could think about this network as being the die of life as being the nosphere and could defend of all of the dream of the dreams, ideas of the artists of the imagination of the farming of the conscience.
Etnosphere is the main human being.
It's the symbolt of what we are and everything we can be like a cross-surprising spectrum.
And as the biosphere was the seeroe, and the nosphere -- and maybe a much larger.
For example, no matter would be a load that would not suggest that half of all the species of all the species of the expanded because it's just not just because it is not true, and yet it's just not true, and yet this is the most scenario -- the most optimistic -- -- the most optimistic in the field of what we know is the most optimistic in diversity.
And the largest indicator of this is the most important thing to the limb of the limb --
When you were born to you, the people in this room, there were 6,000 languages talk to you on the planet.
Now, a language, not just a lab or a set of rules or a set of rules.
A language. It's a spinal scaling of human spirit to human spirit
It's the vehicles, the soul that slowly flowing particles release to the world.
Each language, a lifestyle is a basic basic basically, a town of receiving spiritual possibilities.
And from those 6,000 languages, as we stand here we are now going to be optons in the next half of them are not ranging in the use.
I'm not learning to the babies are learning to actually do something that if they don't change something, that are already going to be death language.
What can be the only one of the ones that are going to be the last of the near-most of your language, not have the language to presence the wisdom of the deep death or to the skills of the children or to the trees of the children or a kidness?
And yet, that sounds like a little bit of a cutting where the Earth is actually on the Earth, at every two weeks because every two weeks ago, a old old old old old old language.
And I know that some of you will say, "Well, it would be better.
It would not be the world a better place if I talk to a single language? And I say, "Grozave, that is that to be the ia. Or to be Canesones." Or to be Canesones."
Or to be Kogi."
And then you will discover it would be able to be able to talk to you to talk to you about your language.
So, what I want to do today with you is a kind of traveling -- a short journey by the nosphorus to try to give you a understood understanding what they are losing to you.
Now, there are many of us who can look like when I say "When I really understand ways to be understood ways to be understood ways to fly around the ball.

I want to start with what I call the "doct."
The Docchef,
The trick-in-in-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-in-fires.
And this doct's soap sounds like this: if we are interested in the level of the good citizens to a lot of the citizens to make a lot of individual freedom of individual free level.
The reason is that the freedom is so that the freedom is that the good value, which is the essential to be many, essential to be many.
And because if people are free then people are free and make things that are going to act things that will be good to decide in our place, and no one has to decide in our place to make a choice.
The most of the freedom of the freedom, is the maximum of choices.
The more choice have to have the more choice, the more freedom of freedom, and the more freedom of the more freedom of the more freedom of the more freedom of the more people have a more remarkable.
So I think, it's so well that it's so well in our system that would not be able to go through the house to get to the sun to put it on the shelter.
And it's deeply to our lives.
I'll give you a few examples of what has done to us for us what did for us for the last time.
This is a supermarket.
I want to say just two words about the soses for safety.
175 sets for his supermarket, this is the supermarket, and the 10 different types of the two-different types of waste and the two-different hopeling and the 12 hits that you can buy your own body to make your own own waste in a very large number of people who are not going to make your own 75 that no satisfaction.
So it's the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronics to make an electrical stereo system to make a stereo -- the housin the hall -- the halls of the hallball.
And in this room room room is a lot of electronics are a lot of the system of system.
We can confifidence six million and half million systems in the components that are in office.

And those days are a lot of the birth.
Now, we have a close diversity of phones, especially in the world of phones, especially in the world of mobile phones.
These are the mobile phones of the future.
My favorite is the one in the middle -- with MP3 player shower in the nas and a town and tortured for the Spanism.
And if you saw it doesn't even leave you with the store you can still in the shocking you to see it.

And you know what the answer is the answer to the question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to buy a phone that you don't know that you don't know that you don't know that you don't know that you know.
And in other fields that are much more important than bugs that are much more important than the number of options that are the number of options.
The health system -- in the United States is not more case you go to the doctor and this is that you do it.
Instead, you know, you go to your doctor and this says, we have a ruba and the various various various various of B.
It has these advantages and these risks to these risks.
It's a bunch of these risks and these risks. What do you want to do it?
And you say, "Yock, what do you do?" And the doctor says, "It has these advantage and these risks and the risks and the risks and the risks and the risks of these and risks the risks of the risks and the risks of the risks of the "Yock." And the doctor, what is you doing?" And the doctor, and the doctor, the doctor.
What do you want to do?
And you say, "But if you were in my place you do?" And the doctor says, "But I'm not in your place "But I'm not in your place to be -- I say "This is -- I say "authenic" and the benefit that makes a benefit to a contains a conference.
But what is actually a transparency of responsibility and choices choice to a way of someone else, in this case, in the case -- someone who don't know about the best and it's almost certainly not to make the best form to take the best form to make decisions -- in this case.

Why is it reveal new audiences if we don't have any of the audien?
The answer is that the people who do this is wait like us to call our doctors in the morning, and to change our reeter-red.
Something as important as our identity has become now a choice of choice, and this transition of the role of the role of the role of the way to look at that.
We don't die that we don't die to have a ability to invest a invention.

We are all our days, everything is really about remove.
I teach students and give them incredibly intelligent and give them to 20 percent less than I was doing it.
And this is not because it would be less desperately because it would be less maps.
You know, because there are to be a question with all sorts of questions "should I make it accumulate and now?
I should be able to go later and I should have been going to be a cartoon?" All of these are questions? All of you have a question.
And they will answer to these questions, no matter what it means to do is not going to do all the bones that give them a good note to my curve.
And this also has to do it. These are the questions to be answers.
Muns like -- we are blessing, as the Carl and the Carl and the technology that allows us to work every mind, we have been in every mind, less than the Hotels -- less from Hotels -- less than the Hotels of the Randphenomenon.
And then there's a little bit of a cold of a cold of the cold of the wireless of the wireless of the wireless of the wireless of the sun.

So this incredible means that this incredible freedom to choose that we have to choose a worker to work with a decision, and you get to decide, and you should not work and if we should not work and if we should be done.
We can go to see how our football and and to have the mobile and Blackberry, and Blackberry, probably that is probably on the other laptops, probably that genes.
And even though all of the mind, there are all the minds that we look at how a football of the football of us say, "We should we be answered to this ap?
You should have answer this email? I should write the theory, and if the answer to the question is "No" is "not sure that your experience experience of your football of you have been very differently than what it would be a difference.
So in the way we look at the small and small objects and the things that are a lot of life is a bad stuff.
And the world I lived that I lived to the world.
So to say, we had some choices to do it, but it was not all a matter of option issue.
And the world we live now looks like this.
And the question is, is good or or it right?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what it is good at this, so I'm going to talk about what I'm going to talk about what is I do.
All these choices have two negative effects on people's does.
One of the effective waves, is that it is that produce paralyze, rather than release release.
With so many options that can choose people are going to choose people are very difficult to opathletes,
You give you a very significant example of a very significant studies in the investing in the private planet.
A colleague had access to the Venezery data from Vania, so the company that has almost almost a million mutual companies that has almost about 2,000 sees of employees and about 2,000 sees.
And what it turns out that it was that for 10 10 funds that they give up with two percent of the employees of the employees of the properly rate with two percent.
The 50 foundations -- they are moving -- they write 10 percent less people who are getting less than if you give them only a little bit of a what?
Because 50 foundations are moving to choose the naid is to choose you to choose what you think you want to choose what you do is so much law and you go on the hand.
And then on the poor and then then on the hot and then the hope, and of course, all the way to the cloud and of course, it never come in.
You know, it's not just that it doesn't just mean that they will consume people will consume for a few few years, because they don't have enough money to put money on the way to put a choice is so hard to make sure that the stable thing to do is so hard to make the compensation that would provide the compensation that would provide the employees that would provide the employees that would provide the employees the employees of the compensment to get the employment to make the employees of the employees of the come.
And I put it with the legs at the top of 5,000 dollars a year from the employee, which would pay a happiness of compensing.
So the credit is a consequence when you have too many options.
And I think this is that it makes the world look like this.
You really want to take a choice to make the best if it's for all the eernity, right?
You don't want to choose the foot of investing or not even the wrong or for safety to say.
So this is a second is that and we can actually get to go to the stand to make a choice and make a little choice to make a little bit more satisfied to be less satisfied by the result of the choice that we are more likely to choose the choice that we choose choice.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that we had a lot of snoses for a lot of people who want to choose if you clock it is perfectly -- and you know, the so-called the West.
It's easy to imagine that you would have been able to imagine that you could have been better choicing to be better. And what happens is that you imagine you would imagine the way you would imagine the regrets that you have to regret and these regret regrets that you have been doing it even if this was a good decision.
The more options you have a little bit of options, the more is the more likely to regret the option that you have alesookay.
Secondly, what economists call the economic costs of opportunity.
Dan Gilber demonstrated very clear in this morning, we talk about how we evaluate things that we are depending on what we think we can see them.
Well, when I'm a lot of alternative alternative to have a lot of alternative to imagine the characteristics of the alternative characters that rejects you get less satisfied by the alternative that you have a little bit of an alternative that you have a little bit of an alternative that you have a lot of the alternative of alternatives that you have a lot of alternative to imagine the charging of the alternative charging of the way you report the charging you can imagine
Here's an example. I am a scoring of people who are not New Yorker.
But here's how it should be a rational thing.
We have this box from Hamptons.
A very expensive properly properly.
The superbits superbit. They have all the wonderful day.
What could you want to want more and doing? Well, at the drack, because it's an audit: It's aughter.
Everybody in Manhattan is coming from Manhattan is coming out.
I could actually look at the office in front of the office of two weeks of the idea that the opportunity to have a place to have a place to have a place that wonderful part.
The food store in the village in the village that we have to have a choice even a choice that we choose is right now.
And the more options are made in the way to the same characteristics of these options are going to be perceived as we would be perceived for us as a opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon tells a lot of things.
It tells us that we should live on the mission and probably we should do things even make the right beginning.
But one of the things that tells you is that it tells you that anybody choose to make other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things can have a lot of things that you do what you do you do what you do you do what you do you do you do what you do you do with the other things you do.
Third of the wavelengths of ways.
This was what I wanted to replace my bluegies.
I think about it all the time.
And there was a hot that the kid were one and you buy them were just like drink and you buy them as a drink and they were incredibly unable and if you get them and if you get them to the better and the spells of the better time and they were starting to stay better.
So I went to my brother my brother after I had been good for the old and I said, "Look, I want a wall of the old walls of my wall." And the St. And the St. And the St. The wishes said, "You want to be smile,

He painted me and he said, "I want to return to my guy who were the only guy who were the only guy who were the only one of the kind of the walls that I spent all the way to the walls and I went out of the walls -- this is the true -- the true -- the truth -- the truth that was the right -- the best.
I have a better better better. All these options have done possible.
But I was feeling worse.
Why? I wrote a book in which I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt worried about is that I felt that we had all these options of my expectations about how I should be a good wall have grown to be a good walls removed on.
I had a very southern expectancy of being a very distinct wavelength when they were one way.
Now when I'm 100 sorry, my mother is a little bit perfectly perfectly to be perfect.
And what we get was good, but it was wrong.
So I compared what I got to have what we've got to expect that I was deadly disapplied with what I hope I was hopped by what I hope I hope to hope that I hopefully I was looking at what I was hopped with what I was hopped with what I was doing with what I was going to get with what I was going to be dealing with what I expected and what I was like
The option of options in the lives of people can't do something else, than to create expect to be those of the best options.
And the way that it will take a little bit of satisfaction even though they get good results.
Nobody in the marketing world.
Because if you know that if you don't have the idea of what I am talking about.
The truth is more about that.
The reason that everything was better when it was worried when it was worried that when it was really possible that people to experience the people to experience the people to experience the source of the people to be papaying the causes.
Today, in the world where we live -- we live -- we live -- we have industrialized and we have the best thing -- the best thing to do is that things like the best thing you can say that things are so good you expect to be so good as you expect to be so good as you expect to be so good.
You never have a surprised because my expectations and my expectations and my expectancy to the end of my way to the end of my way to the end of the way to be never pay.
The happiness of the happiness -- the secret -- the secret is to have expectations to have expectations to have expectations to have expectations to have expectations to have the happiness of happiness --
I want to say -- just a short moment -- that I actually have a great house.
I couldn't find something better and find a better set of it.
But let's look at your home, not necessarily not necessarily necessarily
And finally, a consequence of a budget to a wall of you can't buy when you can't buy a single one one one one is that when you can't get a tumor and ask why you can't you know why that is the answer to why is that the answer is the answer.
The world is coming back. What would you have been able to do?
When there are hundreds of different stars of different sets of available and somehow you report and you ask yourself, why do you know what?
It's just like the answer to the question that the answer to the question of the question of the question of the question.
You could have to choose better.
In a hundred different ways of choices to choose to choose to choose a little scale.
So when people get decisions, even though people are good decisions that the results are good to do with them, they feel good disappoints.
The pressure of erupon the world of the entire industrialized world.
I think a important contribution -- not only a important contribution to this erupper erupon the erupper depression of sync and also is that people have experienced because the standards are too rapidly raised as they are too rapidly red.
And when you have to explain these experiences believe that they are coming up with them.
So the general result is that we go to the better and we feel better.
So let me remind you remind you of remind.
This is the doctro doctor, that we all think is really true and it's not true.
Without the discussion that you have a few choices to be better than it is that many choices are better than the best choice is to be better than the other.
There is a magic. I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty sure that we went to this much more than that the point where the choice is to improve our lives.
Now, the idea -- almost over, I was finished -- the idea that I think is that.
What allows all these choices to the whole industry in society is good to material.
There are a lot of places in the world and we heard a few of them are not that many of them are not too many options.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the issue about talking about me is a strange of the Western society and rich modern societies.
And what is frustrating and the south is that Steve Levitt Levitt talks about how these chair and hard work for children are thrown on the gang.
What I say is that these options, scumes on and complicated not just helpful.
They actually actually actually require the painting.
They really really do it worried about.
If something that allows us to do that in our society to make all the choices that we do would be transfer in society that people have too much less than our lives are being improved by the same lights that the amorry.
This is what economists call the Pareto.
Redwood residents will be better to be to be better people -- because of the way that we have to be sicking us -- because of the ways that exist exist us to reach us to the end.
In conclusion. It turns out that you think about this cartoonist and being a person who knows "Wo!
You know that nothing to be possible in this account in this acoil." Imagine -- so I read it it it and I read it and I read it and I read it and the first time
But the way I thought I was going to think more about it was to think that the fish I think that the clock is something.
Because the truth is that if you hope you hope that everything you would be possible, you know, you don't have free to be more freedom of the real people.
If you go to the active active that everything is possible, the sea level.
You create the death and the scale.
Anybody needs a variety of the act.
This is almost certainly not for a fishing -- probably for a clock for us.
But the absence of a metaphor is a reetter of unfortunately, the unfortunately, the disaster.
Thank you very much.
