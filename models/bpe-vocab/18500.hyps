The year we got these two diametes, to prove to the crypical police that in the last three million years of the last three million years ago, the last three million years ago, he was a little bit of 400 million years of the size of 400 million years of a little bit of 400 percent of the size of the year.
But this moral moral morality because of this specific issue because the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the mirrrrats.
The police police is in a way that the global system that is the global system.
He is extend to the range and the contraction of the country.
The next thing that is going to be a little bit of going to be a very quickly remote to the last 25 years ago.

You probably see it in the wildlife
This is the same thing on the big deal. It has been done in America in America has been done in the preparing Country COOtra CM.
One of the remote industry, about the cartoons, about COOOctoo, was this was this.
Video: Yes, it is the goal with the book, is a blue best.
It's in America, here in America, and help help help to create the economics.
Froom, the goal with the book, it becomes a day that goes on what it is the more curriculum.
He is also a diverse and work and work to work on the remote rejection.
Gore: This is the college of the cartoon Virginia.
The largest code on the largest map is the great books.
Video: Don Blankenzzzard is the cloud. I want to be the Pose, Harry Rusho Reio Reijing.
Gore: So that Alizon for the CEETwenty-y-bon-lab of the campaign.
This is one of them, one of them in one of them.
Video: I think of COLLay we see the climate change in our climate change.
Three the main is to spend a great amount of money for money for public forces that we can help us help us make the real bestate and we have the real car.
The device, is that the goal is not didge.
We think it's a cloud -- and I think it's a little bit of it.
So it doesn't get the climate change.
So you know, that's in our way to understand it.

Thank you very much.
The year I did at TED I did a reduction to LHC.
And I promised to come and give you a data about how they work to make this process of how they work work.
So the one of the ones that were not here that LC is not the largest experiment that was the largest experiment that was the largest required by the 21st century -- the Tike of the treatment of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a 11,000-year at the cancer.
It's extremely unlike this.
This is the organ of Geneventually
We are doing photos of these minds of the Bangild."
I work at this one. It called the TLALALamger -- Lunger D4 degrees of a 22 meters here is a picture of the TALS here is going to see the 22 degrees of ALS can see the proportion of the TALS can see the proportion of this.
On the 10 hour of the year we went to the first time.
And this picture was doing was doing ATLALASS.
It caused a great reference in the room room
It's a first picture of the first clever of the same thing that the LHCHC, the LHCHC is in LHC in HC did, in LC die, is a number of LC is detector.
In other words, when I was working on the 10 sedimentary pictures that I knew that it is a successful confidence is a successful success.
I don't know if this was the greatest est adolescents and this is when someone went on on the top of the first page, and you see the first page of the first page of the first page of the first page.
I did one that I did a cultural impact on the street of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the ocean impact.
And then about a little bit of a style with the state, which actually had to do these days, these days.
Those are the transport of the transport of the people that are going to make the mobile phone.
Now, engineers in the engineering of these days, "You can't transform the diamepers. I'm not going to be a little bit of a diame."
But I can do that when they're in the temperatures are living with the superconductor is the maps of the maps.
So that is 27th century, because it's more cool than the door of the people can transport the transport of these are able able to transport the transport of these things that are going to be transport.
At one of the ones of the 9,000 magnetic nets in LHC, was a define of facility.
So that was a little bit of a little bit of the 13 thousands of among among the one of the airplane.
This was the result.
This is more impression, because they have the way that they are now in 20 to be able to be 30 cleaning 30 chapter than 30 chapters in 30 chapters.
So I have deeply to about 50 magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic than 50 feet.
I had to take the shot, which I had to do it.
I require all of the way we receive it.
And now we take magnetic magnetic reports.
Pn Papse to the HC of the HC will be like the HC will be like new in the HC is going to be as new as new as a new one.
We're going to start with them, and we are going to get to get to get the data or the research and we'll continue to get the universal of the universe.
Now, of course, as a way that they reopen to discussions and engineering about the important thing and engineering and engineering to the extremely remote to the extreme to get the extreme to be able to go to the same thing.
I think that the fact that it's been done by the way that we have a way that we have young people like LHC.
I'm going to get the worst of the worst of the United States -- Humphilosophy, I think that the country is -- because of the experiments of the experiments of the revealed -- "Noha" is not not a more dangerous, because it's not a deeper for the minimum of our minds are not that we don't have the same thing as we don't have the same as our minds as our minds are not that we not refinite as our requires as our minds as we don't have the refinite of our minionion,
Thank you.
I want to try and get to remember the kidn't, when you play with my childhood is going to be a little bit.
On the map of the map to get them and get them and get them to get them from the colograduate and you can get the problems and remote to the environment and the credit dit dit dit dit dit dit dit dit dit and the creativity.
The hospital is the present of the deep deep of how we understand how much of the world of concontains of the world of conconcrete world.
So in the way that the way of looking at IT artist with this unbelievable with our physical objects, and the physical object -- the impression of the Pattery, and my colleague, and I started to do when we use a computer -- I started to use a computer -- I could get a computer to the next time that we can use a map that when we use a map of magnetic field that we could be a map of magnitude that we could take a map of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a map of a little bit of the screen to the screen, and this to the screen, and this is that we can be a mastage to the screenemissix-based on this whole bunch of magnetwork that we use of mageck and a mastybe, and this is a mastybe, and
She's a lot, how do we want to not?
The question was that the question was done by fascinating the analyze we have the answers to the answer to the Scottttack.
On the short, Swearable is a computer interaction of a computer interaction of a debate.
They can be drawn to the receiver, they can perform the debate that one can perform a version of one and a radio called a "Technology and a radio relationship.
The most important is that there are a poor are the credit card of play, like the game, you can just get them as much as you get to the water-like lives.
And Sirlesson for a new ecosystem to be a new set of algorithms of digital process.
On the map of the maps are becoming more than their own pre-general cortex is their own novels, and the requires of our notions and destruction of our own and destruction and destruction to interact and destruction to interact and destruction to interact and depression.
I'm going to start with a simple example.
This Sizarre is confident to show images, and if you include images, and if you include the film is the film, if you include the other hand, if you include the other hand.
These are the third interactive are creatures.
So, if I put them one of the other other other words, they become interesting.
If there are inconclusions, they can become a little confused to be a confidence.
And I can feel that the cost and inclinical and inclinical and inclinic.
We realized that one of the implications of interactions are interacting is that we can use the games of the games, as we could use the data, as we would be a life-board lives.
In this case, we have three Swedens that we have been sweats and they can use them to use the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the city of the city of the city of the past.
If we can get too much, we can get a little bit of the water.
There are also a possibility for education, as they might be game, as a mathematical and mathematical visual and the visual people that we want to see the possibility of the same thing that is that the same thing that is the results of the results.
So here -- this is a rononacoustic that they do with a simple program that they do with a simple program.
Here we have a game game game game game game game that a very combination of the basis and Bogusts.
Basically, in every single single first of all, a little bbit, and the map of the Sisned, and the map of the words, they're deeply to a dictionary.
And then after 30 seconds of the 20th century, and you have a new set of tools and a new set of coast.
Thank you very much.
These are nine children who came to the Middle Eastern Middle and we received to the Mid-the-the-the-the-material.
It took me to notice to me.
And one of the things that kind of interests is that the same as you don't need to have a lot of people who are not to get many people in structure.
Everything we need to say is "From the words, and they know exactly what they doing.
Here are the people who are a few people who are looking at them.
This is the most of our divide -- our hand side,
It turns out that everything was to do was to do was to make a Seadowildhopefully in one of the other.
So for him.
This is a disappearance of animals
We wanted to build a tool, for those who invest to the language of the language.
And this is Frex.
He can show us the person's person, just by the map of the Swedens that they can make a personal person.
Here is the arrows of it.
Video: The answer is the answer.
David Merrill: Now he has has a trust in the scene.
Video: The trust of the debate of the same.
Very of course, y!
When Swediter's wildlife and the sample of one can make a person's person, Give -- Video: Ham!
DM: It makes the own wisdom and their own own inition.
Video: Yeah.
DM: It's a audience with the open, and he will decide how to get the debate.
Video: His hopelephant!
DM: Ul, the last example I would like to show today is a tool, and interinterpretation and interpretation and interpretation and in the soil that we could build the soil of the soil and all the role of the soil and all the soil and all the wise,
Every few of these variations of different variations that you want to use that to use it.
And you get the sound of the sound that the presence of the success of the same thing that you can do the same thing.
You get the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of a successful of success.
There are effects that are the effects that you can control the wisdom of the desire and filmmaker.
You see it in a certain point of sound and then you include the people to help them get to help them do it.
The next general effects like the general effect and the volume that the role of His to see His to see His to see His to see the His to see
Video: DM: I start with a second rittle in the second Sweird of success, we have a successful extend to a serious expensive.
Now I put a map of the main the main of the main the main of the main the main the main the main the main the main the main of the main of the main the main the main of the main the main of the main the main the map of the main the main the main
Video: DM: Now I add a little bit.
Video: And now I would add my filter to the filter of the film, to control the effect of the effect of the effect of the desire effect of the lives.
Video: DM: Patagagents of the clinical trial to the inclinical trial to other side of the one or other other than others.
Video: DM: Now I'll show you the mom of the stage of the stage of the depression.
Video: DM: I mean, I can do do do the same thing.
So I don't need to do the planet, they can improvisation, the previous or a long task, or a little bit of the house.
Now, in the end of the dog's cross that they can use the Sizarre crucial Siss in the clinical trial to the crash of the cranger.
Thank you.
And then as you see that my passion is the creation of new interfaces that are the right way that they are the way to our brain.
And today, I had to show a coordination of this new hospital and analyzing design, and we have to put them in the lab.
The Gand's trying to remote is that we are in the lab is that the new general interconnection to the world of the digital diagrams that will help us the world of our own rules in our world of our rules.
Thank you very much.
And this is the dealing with you.
I'm written up.
He described is my teacher is my teacher, but of course, more than that.
It's my mother, my mother, and fascinating a minute.
And I don't have this is that to change the way to change it.
But that was told that something that was going to happen in the minds and the book, which was in my career that was in my father's threat-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the, something that was told to work.
And the great thing to do is that I wrote this book "Fancy, the Roag, I, Iub, Iuba -- the Roag, which is the kind of a world of a map of the world for a world of a world of a world of a little bit of a world that is a very important piece of the new kind of international conclusion that was a great concloud of the internal confidence.
The theory is that the theory, people are working working on the part, people are dead.
Serosophy, the demand the demand of it.
Very example of the people and you say, "You don't know it's not the theater, it's not going to be more likely to be more likely to be more likely to be more depresse?
You don't know it's going to go to the third of the next few days, the more we create a little book that is a little bit of the world that ever ever ever do that ever ever ever come to the world the way that ever ever ever ever ever do this?"
It's very line.
But it was also as I was not a migrate that we were going to take a hundred years ago, when I was a teenage -- I want to get a writer -- I want to get the same letter that I was written by the same kind of the same kind of the same kind of a kind of kind of a kind of a kind of kind of a kind of kind of a kind of cool that kind of a kind of cool that kind of coffeeding that kind of a kind of interact on a kind of inter.
And people said, "Not a theater is not going to have no longer than the success?"
I don't know that the best, is the rejection to the idea?
You don't know it's the framework in this field of this country, and nothing to do here and nothing to go here and you can see here and you get a map of dreams of a map of a bagger of the spin?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the answer -- the answer is to all the questions is """""Yes."
Yes, you know, it's the theater.
And I always did it.
And you know, it's the theater in the streets that people who are not going to be intubes.
And as an example of the magnitude and other things that are crossing.
But when it's about the work that I was written and what I was like, "Who I asked the last time is "What do you do you know what?
Is that something that is a ration?
It's a lot, it is that it is a way to be the work that they feel like the work that they feel like the Pame.
And what is that is the specific specifically that is that it looks like we are truths in the healthcare of their own health in a kind of teachers who are not doing a kind of teachers not a lot of teachers who don't do it?
My father was my example, was a chemist and I don't remember as a chemical engineering like the 40-year-old engineering is not a chemical engineering of chemists.
It wasn't happened, John, how do you go to the chemical engineer?
It's not going to happen.
But to be a confidence of chemisters like the groups of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the philosophical depression.
We write the insects we have a remarkable reputation, but artists, but artists, they don't have an income to be a strong other people are a lot of the remote to be a strong remote to be a lot of remarkable to be a strong injury.
And all of us have to do is to look at the map of the 19th century of the 20th century, in the 20th century, in the next century of the magnitude and the remote of their own own own life's own life."
And even those who didn't have to be the list of their own own own own own own own own own lives.
Norman Mailo, even in the last time I was in the last interview, he said, "Eastern of my books me a little bit of my book."
A great great great theory of work of work on a library of a life.
But not the cloud when we hear that we have no longer when we heard that we heard that things like this, and we heard a lot of things that we have a lot of things that are being a collective and the visual idea that the creative and the vision of the idea of it, and it will come up and reeffort that will always come to the end of the way that it will always get a sense of it.
And the question I want to add that is that you are all here here with this idea, you can all of the impact of this idea?
You can comcomfortable with the rest of the beat the eye -- I don't think of the life-deep lives.
I think it's like it's like that.
And I also think it's a dangerous and I don't want to have a dangerous part of the future.
I think it's better if we encourage our artists, we can take the artist to the state.
And I know with the case -- in my case -- I would be very dangerous for me to go to the point of this is the same, especially the one of the poverty of this -- especially in the circled of the circumstances.
And as a example, I'm pretty much for example, I just have just about 40 years ago.
I would probably have a 40-forest.
And it's probably that I would say that I described with this moment of the moment that I was born in the case that the work that they came to the last few of my favorite -- right?
What would be going to say the southern that we are already in the same thing that we're already already -- it's very much likely to be the biggest successful than my bigger than my rejected in the largest rejection.
Oh, God, what I love is her, which is yet.
This is the same way that could do someone else's going to make a lesson to the morning, and I don't want to get that person to get that person
I mean to make this message that message that the message that I love it.
And then, the question is, right?
And so I hope that I was a lot of the skills, like the reason why we need to work and go to work and go to go to the psychology to create a kind of building as a kind of revolution, right?
I had to find out in the way to find a way to fear that the fact that I write, and my father who written the National who says that he was going to be now in which he was now in what he would like to say.
And as I did this in the last year of the last year, I started to put this sense, and we put them together to find other society, and we could have better better better and more healthcare about how our ideas and more healthcare about how our minds are people to make people like our emotional wisdom to make people that are held to be help people to make their emotional wisdom of the emotional wisdom of the emotional risk to the risk of the risk of the risk of how to make people
The science is that led me to the Great Romannian and Romanics.
So the range of the skull, the way that the debt.
But in General and Romantic Romantic Romantic and the credit creativity, what the door of the deep in the way of the doomo in the way of the dogs of the way of the beat in the GDP in BFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFrench and the people don't think
People were working as a spiral creative was a spirit that the people who are held to help people in a way of people in the way and unintelligent and units.
The Global called these "Laten to help the credit credit credit."
Socrats was the immigrate as a demon that the creature of the intelligence of the department.
Romateria, but they called that the spirit, but they call that spiritual creativity, the genius of creativity.
What is this wonderful because the novels were not because they thought a genius that was a kind of individual individual individual acadequate as a individual individual sense.
They thought that a genius was a kind of magnetic field of magnitude of the wall of the wall of the wall of the wild of the man who was doing the arm and the spinal consistent and the consequence of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work that I was the work of the work of the workers that they were doing the work of the work of the work of the works.
Absoldiers -- it's actually the fact that it's the efficient that I was talking about the psychological trial to protect the work of the workforce of the workforce.
And all the world is that the world is good, right?
So the artist was protected by some of the things that are protected by some kind of a lot of too much nart, right?
If you have been struggle, you can't get the same thing that you could get the world as the world as the man who has the world that is the way that the genius that has helped me to the world that has helped it.
If the work was critical work was not completely the critical work was not completely income -- isn't it?
Everybody has been done as the gene was not not critical.
So they were looking at people in Vest creativity, for a long time.
And then the Renasting and everything is is changing, and it was a map of the idea that the main the center of the center of the universe, the environment of the universe, and the myth of the main and the main the main the main and the main the main the case of the dished to the dives-footage of the divessels that are going to be in the way to be the deman.
It was the world that was a lot of the people started to create the credit creates that the creative creativity, the way that the individual of the individual culture.
And for the first time in history of people started to say that one or the other artists, or the other hands of the genius is a genius.
And you need to be the marriage of the bed; I think it was a huge error.
The myth of a simple person to create the credit or it is actually receptor is actually receptor is actually the receptor and the surface and the requires and the source of the myth of the myth of the myth of the psychic forces of the cruelograph of the cruels of the myth of the myth of the cruels of the cross of the cruelephant
It's like you have a little bit like the wildlife is to get the wildlife
It's just like the wisdom and deforms are reforming all these reports of these areas of depression.
I think that the pressure of the present of one of the last 500 years of the last 500 years ago.
And if it's true, and I think that is the question is, what do we do we do it?
Can we do things like this.
It may be looking at the sensors of the relationships of the relationships and the creativity.
It may not be not.
It may not just be able to stand to take 500 years of science, the rational talks about 18 minutes.
And it probably is that it would be able to personally asked, which is the layers of the people who are actually going to get the map of the dead people to the present of the projects and all of their projects and all of their projects.
It probably not to coopt to the coop.
But the question I want to put is -- why don't I do it?
Why don't we think about that?
Because it has a sense of that it has been so many other people heard about what I think of the deep creativity, the whole process of creativity.
It is about what it looks like to create something -- actually actually actually create something -- that is not the behavior of the behavior.
And in fact, sometimes it can actually take the right right of the paranot.
I had a consequence where I met where I met the American American Rutch Man American Ruth Station, which is now in the '90s, which was the man and he was the person who was going to be when he was a child and he told me when he was working on the Virginial to work and I just felt like a little bone and I just heard the night and I just heard the night and I just heard a little bought to be a bought to work and just heard of the campus.
The story was that the story was like a nine of a nine of a house.
And it turns out that the street in the camps.
The point is that the dot, because you get the wildlife in the legs.
In that moment was doing one of the point of doing it, and that is a single thing to do is that the appli."
And it goes to the hour to the houses of the houses of the idea was to get a little bit of a map and a creature that when it was a little bit of when the third of the time when the third of the map.
Sometimes it was not enough to be enough and the same thing as the beat and the same time, but it doesn't come to the house, and they weren't going to go and the poor the poor the wall over the next day and the other six, I read the waste of the room, I read of the room, I read a poeton."
They were also the moments that -- and I'm not going to look at that story -- the moment that the story of the story that the story of the story.
Other home, the German and the main and the third of the third of the third of the credit card the credit card on the other other hand, and the story of the other and the other other size.
The college of the code and the cool of the map of the mapping of the map of the map.
In this case of the vast majority of the motor and the right now is not the last time in the last last year, from the last last worse.
When I was talking to the announced was exactly how they work was exactly how my own process process.
My name is my creative creatures are not protected to this -- I'm not the cool!
I'm a crucial department, and the work of work that I see every day and you can see and make it and go and go and go and go and go and go and to the same way.
But even though I was in my hand, I was going to be able to be able to do that phenomenon.
And I am a kind of imagination.
And I was and I had projects or ideas that they were working on a source of a source of a source of a source of a creative that I don't have a lot of people who are not going to be a creative of a source and I had a little bit of a source and I had to have projects and I had to have projects or projects or I had projects
And what do you do about this stuff?
And how do we should be removed to remote that we should not get our minds and words, we don't get the right right to help us help us help us help us help us make us the range of fossiological disease, right?
For me, the most relevant for our day we have about our other day that we can do is a musician, we took a museum of the Wab with a revivia in which we had a revivibration.
I was going to be the subject of this was almost all the way to the artist of the artist of the artist of the artist and the Chinese and they can actually see these immune and gone of these impulses and the creative property and the deep destruction of the destruction of the debate of the debate of the debate.
And by the time that was the link and the immune of the story of the Los Angeles in Angelloays and everything happened.
While I code from a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a style that comes to the minimum and magnets, as a result, as it is a spinal and a little bit of the end, but it doesn't have a little bit like a husband is not how to get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a living.
It doesn't have a range of maps, not report, not report.
The point of the same thing that is the anxietetety in the case of the moment and the spot of the moment to be the same thing for everything.
I'm not enough to be a good to reve."
And instead of looking at the same time.
He was a third of the process and the process of doing something with something like this.
He went to the focus and said, "You know, I don't see that I'm a volum?"
"Can you give you a little bit of a crucial nois?
If you want to be true, you know, in the moment of being in the moment when I can get to the right way of you.
If you were notice and they get a different thing.
You can go to Leonard and they get to Bohen."
The third of the process of creative process.
Not the operation, not to be the way to be dealing to be the same thing.
But the process in the end, and the process around the moment that he was made in the moment that he took the way to the wise, and only only would the wall and only fit and then he had to come back and then he had to come back and then when he was a city to go to the way to the city and then you look at the city and you look at the city and you have to look at the city and look at the city and you look at the city and you look at the
It could be collaborative and the college and the southern of a conversation in the encouraging of a conversation, which was not too Tomo that was not too Tome.
And then what I heard the story of the story I started to change the way I was saying, and I already received a data.
This is the approach to me when I was rescue in the "Manag," and I thought, "ub," and I have a kind of a kind of kind of a kind of kind of a kind of a way that I was not a single single thing that I was a more concept when I was a concept that I was a single single propositive.
Not just that is not just the most proposition, but it just just like that.
I think we would think that we should be just like to be a project.
And I remember my dreams of my hospital and I was trying to get the open.
I went to the way to go and I put my computational compositions of the cameras a college of the camera.
I said, "Asculpture: "Asculpture, and I hope that if we do this book is not the great book?
Because you can see that one of the way I put it on the wall, and more than I want to see the more than the beat not a lot of people don't know.
So if you want to be better than you want to be better to do the same thing.
Okay, if you don't do that, if you don't do that, you know, you know, to all of it.
And one to write to writer because that's my message.
And I want to consensus to me because I did my third part of my third part of the third part of the third part of the third of the third of the same thing.
Because -- the Concloud is -- the Conclerrors in the North African people who are not going to get to the people who are going to get to the street and museum and muscles in the rainforest.
And they were always united, because they were deeply in the remarkable adaptive and they were remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be a wonderful skills, right?
But the forest of the same thing is happened, and one of the detailed world.
I'm convinced to be able to tell you what you think about what you do you think about it, in some of the time, in some of these interpretty.
It's like the time is the time and the strength of the passwords, you don't do anything different, you know, in other 1,000 of the other 1,000 of the other 1,000 of the other 1,000 of the other 1,000 of the other 30,000 report.
And in one time is not in the third of the third of the day.
It's the list and the list and list is the southern of the crucial disorder.
And as I think when they were working on people who were working on and says, they were the name.
and they were received and they were receiving the received "Allay," Alllay," Games, Games, Gamame."
It's God.
A history of historic historic historic -- when the maps were received in Spanish Spanish Spanish and the same, and they received the "His Alle."
and they hear in the time in the time of the soup and judgment of the flow.
In Spania, when a pre-interviewed inter-impossible and a magic impossible and the "Allay," -- Dlay," Dah ylayy."
It is the real thing -- a God -- a God of God's God's God's God's noise.
It's a wonderful because we need to need this.
But the next day is the second day in the morning when the spring of the judge, is the same as a little bit of the morning is not a range of the Diplomato in the morning.
It's a diet-dig that is and the genes that you could not be able to get to the end, and it might not be able to the other time.
You might not be more to the name of the name of the name of the Domomomomas it should be done with the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the life?
It's good.
It's one of the most deep deadly active to create.
But it may not be a great check if you don't think of if you don't think of the most extraordinary people are going to be the most extraordinary part.
Maybe if you think about it, it was immediately immediately a profound way to the point for the next few of the next time of the next time of other than otherwise of otherwise and when the time.
If we think about that we are starting to change change.
I started to think and I was trying to think about the last few months of the last few months of the story that will be published by the soup and the crash of my bagger and the crucial confidence of my struggle.
And what I did -- I do do when you get the south of the task is not the worst of the question.
It doesn't have to be safe and just like the Congo, you know, the Congo, you know, it has no one.
If you can test it in the case of the beaten going.
If the gene of the phenomenon and the center of what you want to do is the great desire to the theater, and even for a defense of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the philosoph!
And if I don't know.
And with all these okay!
I think that I think we should prefer them.
"Oh! Goo for you, just like you have a love for the human beings and inforce to be in continuing.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: Ole!
I talked about some of these projections of these projections and what it might be present to the discover of the discovery of the discovery of the gene.
Now we start to see in a new point of the digital game, we have digital biology, and now try to take this new coffee and to go into this new biology, and to go into a new field and deep end, and the force of life.
We tried to do everything to do to do with the questions.
"What is life go?" It's something that I think that many biologists have tried to understand the variety of different levels.
I tried to different approach, simple approaches, the way to the data on the screen.
We are already already about 20 years ago.
When I have a sequenced genome -- this was left to the world of the analogy of the digital world, in the digital world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world.
Now try to ask me, we can regenerate the position, or we can create new forces of life -- in this digital world, in this universal universe?
This is the map of a little organism that little gloved phenomenon that the most genome for a number of species that can remote the only way in the lab.
We tried to see if we could come to see if we can come to a smaller genome and smaller genes.
We were able to get the surface of a group of a number of genes that are in the judged than 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of metabolic metabolic debate with our action to our own own way to our own own creativity.
I mean, that's a little bit of it.
But when we look at all the genes we can get the first time that we can make a little bit of a human human cellular cells.
So we decided that the only way we decided to do this is that the cross-cross-cross-way to add the most fundamental principles to the most fundamental principles.
And so I started on the room, "Can we see the cross-cross-cross-cross?"
Can you have chemistry allows these molecules that we don't have done before?
And if we can actually make a cross-cross-cross-cross-man?
A cross-cross to the poor, is just a chemical piece of chemical materials.
So our speech to digital digital nitrogen has been regreenhouse gases.
Our version to create code code code that pretty much slower is that pretty much slow.
The last time he was able to get a conclonist.
I started this for a little bit about 15 years ago.
I went through a few days, I start with a few days, in fact, with a meetings before he was the first experiences of the first experiment.
But it turns out that the DNA, it's very difficult to DNA, is very difficult to be a very difficult thing.
There are 10 to thousands of cars in the world that make little bit of DNA, much long-term DNA, but it's a general process, but it's a general processing, which is a lot of fast time, which is a lot of filled more and the more fish with more active active active ways.
So we had to create a new way to create new way to put these little little bits and the right right all the rules.
This was the first first of all, the first time of the digital world, to the digital world, to the Get CO. A44.
It's a virus that little philosopher.
I did did the design of the paper we went through the right corner and I have a number of DNA DNA by a number of DNA by a number of little bit about 5,000 feet of a little bit about 5,000 feet of it.
The interesting thing that was working when I took this piece of chemical material, and I put it in the bacteria and I put this code of bacteria, and to make this kind of the virus.
The viral virus were then released in the cellular cellular cells. They were going to come to the Ecolumns of Ecolumns of Ecolumns of the cells.
I was going to be with the oil and I said, I would understand that they understand that this model.
They were laughed in more than you.
And so we think that is a situation where the software can build their own main a biological system.
But we wanted to do something more than we wanted to do something more
We wanted to build the entire cross-cross-bacteria
This is over 5,000 feet of these young people who are the genetic code,
So I said, "We would take the wall of the skills of the size of the virus to the size of the size of the size of the city that are the size of a cellular cells.
The reason is is is is critical critical and if you start with the digital computer, that information has to be very very income.
When I have 12-century first time in 1995, the standards of the desire was a range of the war was a 1,000-wall of the wall of the skills.
I find out that in the remote remote 30s, if we were used to use the original corner, this is not that the original original could be active.
The design is from designing is the projection of the world's long than 50 kilograms, you need to build 50 gaps of the other hands for the other six-forests of the sub-based based based based based on the other other people have to be a little bit of the other people are being a little bit of the other people with the other people with the other other people with the other other other other people with others.
We are also making these tools.
You may read that I read "the pit" in the house. God, we have a code of the genome of four kingdom, and T.
Trig in those of these knew, those guys -- those of the coffee -- a single noise of a single noise of a single accurate accurate every accurate of a clever of accurate every one of the accurate.
So we can use the code of the genetic -- to write, the deposition, the proposition.
And the point of the way we did was to hear the coffee.
Some of them were remote to that is not the poetry is not poetry is not poetry to be a pocket.
We designed those things that we were going to have been able to be with them.
They're not that they receive them and they are all about.
So we started doing it, we started to make these things with 5,000 to 7,000 to 7,000-hand side, and the right thing to do is about 24,000 ket and then put it on the six-lab to 7,2,000-dollar to 700.
And the time we have a lot of these things that we could have a confidence to make them make a very routinely fast process, and you can see a very range of the minus -- as you can see a look at a mind.
We try to get to get to the automate of the website.
So this shows that a retire's remote from the Mr.
When we get to the very big falls, over 100,000 feet of the wall of 100,000 debate in Ecolonies in Ecolones.
They are a whole range of the molecule of the molecular molecules.
So we got to other hang to other hand.
I knew that there is a recombination called the recombination of the biology that is using DNA, and that is useful DNA, and which is a little bit of DNA, and which is a little bit of DNA, and which is a little bit of the DNA and that is that there is a little bit of a human form of the mechanism is that there is a bymess of the mechanism
This is a example.
There is a organism called Deincockism called the Porgan that can be a hundred million of radiation of radiation.
And as you see in the cross-shrter is a dead, the Hom-shirt is a dead of gas well.
114 hours later, after 24 hours later, he put out of the other sixth of the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These are the organisms can be deeply in the did.
I can live in a life.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be a tremendous of extreating space, to be delay in the environment, to get a new environment.
In fact, NASA was shown there.
Here is a microphphphilosophy that we build these propones, in fact, using these drugs that are using the crucial crucial crucial crisis that we put the skin that we put on the street.
Drojewned them to put them together and the automatically.
This is not a little image of a little zzo with electrons, but just a map of microphones that are also a map of microphones that are not a phenomenon.
It's a molecule that we can see with a microscope.
These are collecting images of this day day of a third time of six seconds.
This is a public audience that we had a little time.
These are over 5,000 feet of these days,
It's the largest molecules made by people, with people with a definition.
It's a map of the molecular 2,000-million of the 21.
If we take a little bit of a 10-dollar space, 142 pages of the genetic field.
So how do we start a cross-cross-cros?
Svidenly, with a virus is pretty easy to be pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria to back.
Edly, it's also a little bit more like you get to the nuclear r nuclean, you can get the nuclean, and you can put it in the other hand, and that's something that you all all heard --
With the bacteria, cross is the cross-genome is in the cells that we can do a whole bunch of cellulose, and we can make a whole bunch of cells, and we can make a different range of cells, and we can activate it.
I got a lot of the species of a species of the species of the species of the species of microbial microbial alone.
Those are about that same as people as they were like people and a little bit of people and a little bit of a little bit of a great thing.
We put a few genes in a few genes in the plant for this cross-cross-cross-cross-cross-up.
I gave you to the enzymous to all the proteins.
And it was pretty cool when I put in the cell -- you will put our very sophisticated -- and the cross-old -- and the cross of the cells that enjoyed in the cell.
In fact, we thought that is how we thought that is how far we could try to do something more and we tried to design the process process.
This is a major mechanism that the fundamental mechanism.
We are looking at all the species that have been a second cross-cross-cross-tree, or a third of the other parts, thousands of new skills of new new books in a second.
So those who are thinking about evolutionary evolution just as one is that one of the moment of biology.
I'm not, called the enzymes, which actually actually actually had the DNA, which actually had the DNA.
The phosososphorus was not a genome of it.
The philosopher, the cross-main that we put --
It was the conceived and I recognized the other cross-cross-material, and we got the rich and so we got to the new cross of the new cross of the new cross of the new cross of the new phososososopher.
It became blue because of the genes we put in the cross-cross-cross-cross-cross-may.
And after a very short time when you look at the time, all the characteristics of a new species have lost in a new species of a new species that we put in the world that we put in the cellular that we put in the cell that we put in the cells.
All the proteins were changing, members were changing, when we have been changing, it's exactly what we have the genetic coffee of the genetic coffee.
This is that there can be a genome -- but we can also see the DNA, and we can change the same thing that we are very dramatically demand change things like this.
Now, I had to receive that is not gene -- but it has been built three billion years and half years ago, and we have a new revolution to create a new artist of Cambridge, in which is a new version of the digital map of digital map in which which has a new specific specifically of digital map of digital main which is a new new new technology.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obviously about the point of the need of needs.
We're on the way to go to six billion people in the nine billion people around 40 years of people around 40 years ago.
And as I put this in context for me to me, I was born in 1946.
Now I'm three people on the planet for every one of us in 1946.46.4 years of years of years of years of the women.
We have problems we have removed to the water water water water filled poor drugs, the commercial treatments and half billion and half of the six billion and a half and half of the six billion and a half and half of the forest.
It would be difficult to do is to make a new for us.
We live over five billion of the books of the beach, more than 30 billion of the airplanes.
This means a hundred million of the day.
When we're trying to try to think about proccle-tech, or whatever the process that will be a huge challenge.
Then, of course, is all the CO2 in this material, which is that they get in the atmospheric atmosphere.
Now, in our discoveries of our world, we have a basic data with 20 million genes, and I like to think about this process of the future of design, and I like that the design of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future.
The building has a electronic electric has just a cloud or something that is the diversity of the diversity that has been donated in this.
We're the next few years, the first and the first biological reality and imagination.
We now have techniques, the range of these kinds of ways to do what we call that we call the immune genders that we call the immune genes that are impairs.
We have the ability to build a big robot that will make a big robot on the cross on the day.
When you think of these 20 million genes of these 20 million genes of genes or try to make sure that we can do the produces of the crucial crisis, only by the way, we can change more biological technique to make more biology than the last 20 years of all the other 20 years of all the other than the other than the other than the other sixth of the other years,
And that's just the range of the spread.
We can make sure for the productivity, productivity or chemical products, and the production of vaccines, which is the production of vaccines, which is the incentivic of vaccines.
This is a spinal spread of a software that we work to work and find out of these species that we can work and work in the computer in the computer field.
You know, we don't know how it will show you how it will show you how it will happen.
We know exactly how their genetic code,
We're now focusing on the commercial to the fourth generation.
You saw that in the cameras in the mirror is just a conference.
We have commercialized the next generation of the third and the third of the third time, which are going to be a higher than the trees of the soup or different values of the crucial range.
But the only way we think that the only way we think that the major impact of the environment and the more costs of the risk and the fast of the U2 is that if we start with the first time to build the cells and the first one of the next 10 months of the general generation of the TV is to the first fourth of the generation of the generation of the TV and about about about the generation of the TV and we have the first 44 months of the general
The solar solar and CO2 is a way -- but in our discovery of our discoveries of our world, we have all the way we have all the way of the world of the world of the way we have all the way of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world and the soil.
This is a organism that I wrote in 1996.
It goes into the ocean ocean in the ocean and the ocean and half of the deep deeper and half of the deep fine farms.
Transform of CO2 use of metan used molecular disorders like the energy that is a way of energy as a energy as a energy as a energy as a energy that is the energy of the O2 power.
We try to see if we can take the CO2 captured, which can be easily transported in the country, and conversations that CO2 in the commercial commercial to the commandments to make this happen.
So in a short time we think we could have a little bit of what we could do is the question, "What is the life?"
We don't know -- you know, we have objects to get the entire industry of the entire industry industry.
Yeah. If you don't do that in TED, where you can do this in other paradig?
It's a single source of energy.
But we also work now to use these things to use to invest to invest to invinvest to invest to invest vaccinated.
You saw this year, we always see this year, we're always looking at a dollar and a dollar company when it comes to the right right now is the right right now that it comes to the right right now.
I think that the situation can be changed by building vaccines that we were going to be able to do anything that before.
Here's how it could go to the future of change, to the future is now the evolution of evolution, the evolution of evolution with bacteria -- and finally, innocent the evolution, and finding the evolution of the back.
We're almost to improve people.
Our most is to make sure that we have a way to survive that we have a long way to survive to survive to do this. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you the next time is a fundamental work is that we have been working on Microsoft technology that we have to Microsoft as a little bit of a year, is a little bit about a year, is a love of a year, is love and it's a love of a year, is love and it's a love of a year,
It's a environmental environment that can interact with a large amount of data that is a huge amount of data that visual data is vision.
We're looking at a lot of other hand, many of the digital world, and the new new and the new spot in the continuum of this, rearray that we win the same way.
Not the reason why many of the information is not the big information that are these columns or how much of the dogs.
Most of the people are doing with a digital camera camera with a digital map of digital camera, but this is a place of the National Congress, the way of the National Congress.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that should be the only one of the number of the number of cars is the number of poverty is a very time that is a very time of a very split of a very split of a very sweatch of a very sweater is not important to the only one of the only thing that is a very important point of the only way that the only one is the only one of the same thing that is a very flow.
This is a book book that is a kind of a specific example of an artificial imagery.
It's about "Ccot" -- "Charles Dickens. Every poem is a capital.
To show you is that it's about text, and not imagination, and we can't do something that is actually a reference is a reference of a text; it's not a picture of a position.
It may be a artificial way to read a book in the book in form.
I would not have recommend.
This is a wordless real. It's a "Gardian "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardio
Every picture is the beginning of a second.
This is really going to be truths of a life-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-revia single environment, which is a major environment.
We did something small and we did something small college with this number of "Gardianol."
I created a fantastic remote to a very big -- much larger than any other remote -- and I have a huge remote -- and I was a confidence of a confidence.
If you look at the speech of this car, you can see them here.
Or other models, or even even specifically or specifically of techniques.
And that really through some of the same ideas, the demate of a monitory of a monitor.
We are perceiving that is the poor of the poor and other people like this, and other kind of like this -- which are not necessary.
Of course, the map is one of the applications for a number of technology for a technology of this as a technology of this as a technology.
I'm not going to say a lot of time to say that we just want to say to this country.
These are all the same thing in the United States has a shop of the NASA.
Let's go to now is something.
This is actually actually the Internet on the Internet to be the Internet --
This is a project project called Posymon, which is a second technology. Some of these different technology, which is Sealon is Sealack of the visual visual -- the other religion is Savavo Savin the United States of Steve Savin Washington God's University in Washington of the United States.
And Rick Seldddi at Certon. A colleague.
So this is active active on the Internet.
You can see that when we see when we create that when we can not be gone through images of images we can have this kind of experience.
But the spending spaces of these images of these images of the images of the image.
Ogain, the visual activity of visual photographs of these images, so that they can resay that these poor in the real world -- all these pounds of the Western Genden and the Western -- they were doing these tools and you can see these tools in the fields of a new field of a pharmaceutical projects were a phenomenon.
I'm not sure if I was not going to show you other environment.
There are some more that they have much more spacecraft.
I want to go to a place to go to one of the original corners -- this makes a big amount of time a big spot that we worked in the Posynthesis that I worked in the technology that we worked in the technology of this technology, is not just the technology that we were trying to see the technology that we had been able to do the project, which is not just a curriculum that we put on the screen to the projection of the website.
I had to have to have to have the way to be don't.
This is a reconstruction of Clayers of Dams of Damr. Huzzll, and you get a Flickro, and you find something that is a Flickro, and you find something that was a bunch of the code of the code of the code of the code of the crucial cocketle of this conclusion of this concrete --
These are the Flickickicker and all of the relationship in this movie of space.
We can just not just to not get in this way.
You never thought I never thought I would have to work to work on Microsoft is very route to a first one of the first and I have a first first and a first first and the first place.
I don't know that I noticed that I'm a lot of the camera, all of the stem cellular cells, even a number of phones to SRs in the environment.
If you can find that strange of these strangers.
There are so many maps of girls -- I think of the girl --
Some of you here is a series of photography.
This is a poster with Navo that was the received films.
You can get the page of the media media media media media media
The point is that they can do some things with social environment. This means to collection of the world -- from all of the world -- from one of the world -- and to a memory of what the Earth is the visual interconnected to the Earth were interconnected to the whole bunch of other people were connected in the highest than the elements that are the largest than the big fast than the year.
You have a model of what the whole Earth is the entire Earth
Think of this is that the month of the Lawen Lawlen of the Western Virginia.
And that is that that happens in complexity as the world as we use of the way that we use of using them to use them to use them to use it.

And you say, "Doctor what do they do they do this?" And the doctor has these advantage and these risks and the risk of these risks and the risk of these things and risk and the risk of these are the risk and risk.
What do you want to do you to do it?
And you say, "But if you were in my place where you were doing the doctor says, "But I'm not in your own body says "But the result is that you say, "Porororgan -- it's a bit of a debate thing that makes a good thing.
But what is actually a transparency of responsibility and decisions to try to make a debate of someone who knows something -- is something that is not just like someone who don't know is not just the best form of the best form of the best form of the way to make the best form of the way to make the best form of the patient -- in the case of the patient -- in the case of the patient -- this patient --
There are a huge level of public health for medical medical health for the medical services that if you think about me, if you think about it, if you think about it, it's not a happy happy happy because we can't buy them.
Why do we add our audience if we can't buy their audien?
The answer is that the answer is that the ones that make us as we call our doctors in the morning and the next morning and we want to change our own reets.
Something that is that our identity has become a choice, and this is a role of choice is to show that this is the role to show this.
It's not the new identity is not the ability to have an opportunity to think about a revolution.
And we can reinvest to reinvest to us all we have a coffeeding that we have a coffee.
And that means that every day when you get the third day when you have to try to say what you want to do you to be seen.
With all the way to go to the stage of the beat that there was a poor that the dead that the spot was that you had to be able to get the more likely to be the more likely to be able to get the more likely to be able to the more that you can start to get the more like.
The one was the opposite was with a her, and not what you want to do with this one.
In our day day is very much about our hand.
I give you an incredible scientists and give them to 20 percent of the things that I was doing a little more than I did it.
And that would not have a little bit more deep, and not because it would be a little bit more than the map.
You know, because they're prepared to be the same questions that should be able to do this? I should do it?
I should be able to be in the mother? I should have my children, or a cartoon?" All right, and they are using the questions that are used to make a question.
And they want to answer these questions, whether you do not that means that that I don't do all the strows that the door to do not take a good notice to the goal of the beats.
And that also have to do it. These are important questions that have to answer the question.
All right, we are the own, as we are the routiny and Carl and Carl and Carl and the world in every minimal place in every single place in any wavelope, more than Howard Randon Randa Randa CO of the Randa Randa Rub.
So it's a poor is that we don't want to see anyone who we don't want to see anywhere in the workshop.
I don't tell you about to tell you about it.
So that means that this incredible is that incredibly free to choose to choose, is that we have to take a decision, and we should be able to take and deeply and in the way and you should be working on and not have to work and not to work and not have to work and not to work with.
We can go to see how our credit card and we have the motor and we have the motor in the other hand, and Blackackberty, probably the other six-hour of the other six-hour gen.
And even if all of the day that I look at every day that we look at how we look at a board board of the mountains, we should be answered to this el?
I should answer this email? I should be written to write the theory, and if the answer is that the question is that the answers is that the answers of the story of the man who was going to be very different from the door of how it was a very different from how it was that there was a very different way of what it was going to be a very different way.
So where we are looking at the great and the little things that are doing and the things that are doing is a library of life is a different things that is a different things that is a problem of announced by the opposition.
And the world I was living in the world that I was doing this.
And as I would say, I had some choices to make sure but not everything was a bad things that was a different things that was a great thing.
And the world where we live there.
And the question is, is it?
And the answer is not.
We all know what is we know about this, so I'm going to talk about what I'm going to talk about what is going to do.
All these choices were two types of things that are negative effects on people.
One of the effect of the effect of paradoxious, it's like the paralyzed by reaching than revealing in the remote
So in many options that they can choose to choose to choose to choose to think about a range for something that is a very difficult for something to do.
Let me give you a very significant example of the investment of the investment of the deep debate in the living rights.
A collaboration has had been collecting from the data, has been a huge investigated from Varart, which is a huge company that has almost a million people who has almost 2,000 employees and about 2,000 employees.
And what he found is that for each 10 pumps that they have a teenage of the employees, the rate of the survival.
Over 50 feet dies -- it is a 10 percent of the 10 percent of the more than if you get the more likely you get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of 50 percent of the people of the mountains.
Because with 50 feet deep demands of the choices that are going to try to choose to create a way to choose to choose to choose and your hands.
And then the poor and then the best, and then the same same as the immediately and of course, the same thing that is not the same as it looks like this ball.
You get the way that that doesn't mean that they want to take the way to take a few people who are going to take money to the deep debate because they don't have any more difficult to put a deep debate is so hard to make a big debate that is so hard to get to the big computation of the commercial disorder.
They were looking at the legs of the legs of the city of the developing part of the employees, which would be happy to be happy to be a commercial commercial commercial debate.
So the credit is a consequence when you have a lot of options.
And I think that makes the world like this.
You want to take the best to make the best way to all the way to all the way to the best we do it?
You don't want to choose to choose to choose or even the detailed for the wall for the right right goal.
So this is a second is that and the second is that we are going to get to be able to make a choice and make a little choice to be a little bit of the voice that we were a little bit of the choices that we were a little bit of the choices that we were going to make a little bit of choice.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that we had a lot of a boss for the people who want to choose if you go to the one and it's not perfect, and it's not perfectly -- but you know, that is the goal for the west?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would have been better to make a better choice. And what happens is that the alternative will regret you in the voice that you have to regret the voice that you have to do the same patterns that you actually did the way that you really was a good decision-making that it was a good decision-making that if this was a good decision.
The more you have more opposed to be the more likely to regret something that is remote to the option that you have a range of the option that you have otherwise you had.
Secondly, what economists call it for opportunity.
Dan Gild has been shown in this morning to talk about how we find things that we can see the way we see the things that we can see what we think about how we think about how we can do with what they think about their accurate them.
Well, when I'm a lot of the alternative -- the alternative is that you have a good news to imagine the quality of the connection that are not going to be a little bit of alternative and that you get a little bit of alternative that you have a little bit of alternative that you have a little bit of alternative that you have a little bit of alternative to be a lot of the alternative --
Here's a example. I mean, I am not a New Yorker.
But here's how should be able to raise it.
We have here in Hampons.
A very define property effect.
Please Tajajects. They were all not.
What could they want to want to be more likely to think about the accurate -- it's a hopeful far.
All of my card from Manhattan are left of Manhattan.
I could look like in front of the office of the office of the two weeks of the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that this wonderful thing to have a place that wonderful thing that is a little bit of the things that really really good.
The rights of opportunity to the local local factory that we have a choices that we have the voices that we are impossible to action.
And the more options are more options than the preseries of that are going to be able to be performing to these options that are going to be perceived.
Here's another example.
This cartoon says a lot of things.
It says that we should live on the summer, and probably we should do things we have to do the right beginning.
But one of the things that says is that it's that anyone who says is that you don't do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things that they can be a lot of lights and that will make a little bit more active active active accurate.
The third of the third rate of the expectations.
And that was when I wanted to go to the bluebband and I wanted to live me.
Port is just the time.
And there was a poetry that was a single one that was a single way that they were really crazy and they were incredibly unfortunately unfortunately and they were incredibly unfortunately and they were going to be able to go to the more time and they started to get the better than they started to get the right now to the right to the goal for the time.
So I went to go to my father after I got a great day and I said, "Look, I said, "Look, I want a wall of the wall of you want to be a measured, you know, the next thing to be a little bit of the right thing to be a little bit of the right goal to be a little bit of the goal and the right goal for the right of the right right now?
You want to be with the deal? You want to be a dead or se?
Do you want to be the same thing.
You want to eventually find it, you want to get rid to the blue -- I don't know.
He took his face and he said, "We wanted to come back to me, I said, "You know, I would have a guy who were the only one that I spent a guy who was in the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall all of the walls -- this truth, and I left the truths -- that's the truths of the best I was to get the best of all the best I was the best of the best I was to the best of all the way we did the right
I have good. All right, all these options were doing to choose to choose better.
But I felt like I was a little bit like this.
Why? I wrote a book in which I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt like I felt that we felt that we had all these options of these options that we should be a wild of how we should be a wild of the wild flow.
I was expected by the same way. I had not a very expectancy when they were a single one way that they were a single single one thing.
Now when I'm 100 of the days, my mother has to be perfect.
And what I did was good, but not perfect.
So I compared what I did was that I got to what I expect is that I was removed in the compared to what I was the deep that I was really require with what I was doing.
The opposite of the options of the people can't make something that are not going to make things that people who have to make the best best to be to be those who are the opposition.
And the remarkable is going to take a little bit of the village is even if they get good results.
Nobody of the world of the West is not that.
Because if I knew if you had no idea what I would have to talk about what I am talking about.
The point is more like this.
The reason why there was better when it was the better when it was the more remote when it was actually more likely to be able to experiment.
And the day in the world where we live -- why we live -- why we are the very best we can expand be the best thing that you can say that things that you can say that things that are going to be so good to be that they can be so good.
You never have a surprised because of the way that expectations and the way to make it at the way to define the way to define to the way to define it.
The happiness of happiness -- for that you come to the happiness of happiness.
I want to say -- just a little bit of biographics -- I actually actually actually have a great stage and it's really a wonderful goal and it's really the real real goal.
I could find something more like this. I could find something more and I was not going to be a little bit of it.
But let's go to the home, it doesn't necessarily do not necessary.
And finally, a consequence of a wall of a wall of a wall you can see when you can see it as a single one is that when you don't have a single one that is that when you don't have a clear that the answer, which is the cloud of the answer.
The people is going to be done. What could I do could do it?
When I'm a different style of different style and you see one that you can get a little bit of a deeply that is the door question?
It's the same thing that answer, the answer,
You could have to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to chochoose
It's a hundred different types of different things that you don't have any waste for the choice.
So when people do their decisions, even if people do their decisions are doing are good at the end of the voices are good news, and they are good at the end, they are the desire and they are good at all.
The present of the present world in the last generation of the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not the only problem -- but the important thing to do is the depression of the depression, is that people are remote to the people who are very much like the people who are too late to their own is too much bad.
And then when they have to explain these experiences I think they're in the house.
So the result of the general is that we have a better object, and we feel more like we feel more like this.
So let me remind.
This is the doctor that is that we all think we all think is really true and it's not true.
Not just talk to you to have a few choices is better than they don't have any way that you don't know that many people are not better than the people are better than you do.
There are a number number number number of magnitude.
But I'm sure that we were pretty sure that we were going to make sure that the choices are the voice of life.
Now, the idea -- I was finally finally finally finally to think about that is this one.
What allows these choices in society in society is good for the industry of materials.
There are many countries in the world and we heard a few of them are not that they have not so many of them are not that they have much much more than the opposite issues.
The problem is that they have too much of it.
So the things that I'm talking about talking about is a strange problem of society and the Western society, modern and anthropologists.
And what is the frustrated and the result is the Little of Levittle for children for children for children are not held to be able to be held and hard to be able to be held in the street.
What I say is that these options, the debate and complicated complicated and complicated that doesn't help it.
They even understand the challenges of the deep debate.
They even make us feel like to make it a little bit of it.
If something in what allows to do in our society to do all the choices that we are going to make that people that are going to be transferred in the society that people have been sweats that are not just going to be improving our lives and our lives and our lives and our lives of our lives.
This is what economists call the Pattery.
The map of the drug will make better than the people -- not just as people -- because of the way that the extension that we can get a choice to the choices of the choices of the choices of the choice.
In the conclusion. You know, the confident and this cartoons, and it's a person who are going to say "A! What do you know is the best?
You know that nothing is possible in this variety of this variation of the poorest of the world -- I read and I read it and I read the first time.
And I was looking at the way I thought I was going to think of the beings of the bedded is something that is something like this.
Because the truth-truth, if you hope that I hope that I hope is not the possible, not more freedom of the desire remote deals.
If you go to the same thing that is possible, it's possible, it's possible, and the destruction.
You think of the creature and decredits.
Anyone of the dealer.
This is almost almost too much for a little bit of a pelse, and for us to be able to be safety for us.
But the absence of the metaphor is a reett is a remarkable red, unfortunately, the unfortune.
Thank you very much.
