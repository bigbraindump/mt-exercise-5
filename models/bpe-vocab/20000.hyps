Thank you very much.
The year at TED I did a introduction to LHC.
And I promised to come and give you a data about how the device.
So I mean, for the people who were not there were no longer here, the largest experimental experimental experiment that was the largest 27 degrees -- Cumbble-page Street Street Street She's a billion of a bunch of the pressure of a billion times in a billion times in a 1,000-year-old from a billion times a way of the universe --
It's extremely thenough.
This is the Genevent Genevelevatory.
We have photos these minds "Big Bangs" in the decade of the decades.
I work at this time. It is called the ETLAS -- Lunged 44 feet of 4,44 meters of ATLALATLALATLALS pictures here is the proportioned to see the proportion of it.
In the 10 seven-hour in the first time.
And this picture was made of ATLAS does.
It caused a very similar to control the camera in control.
It's a picture of the first piece of the particle that has been deeply to the LHCH, the LHC in LHC in LHC and the particle in LHC and the particle in the Hard.
In other words, when I was looking at that image of the 10 sex of the work of the functioning of the functioning of what is a huge successful success.
I don't know that if it was the largest terrorists and that, when he was the first page of the first page of the first page of the first page of the art of the Art as a little on the surface.
And I realized that I was doing a cultural impact on the impact of the evolution.
And so that I had a little bit of the device, which actually had to do with these -- these are actually -- these are these balls.
Those are transporting 13 thousand and and and people are actually going to get the power of power to the power of power
Now, engineers in these engineering and say, "You can't transport the plant and the transportation of the ame."
But I can do that because when I am in temperatures are called the superconductive state.
So in 27-year year -- because of the hospital of the hospital of the bedle can transport that you can transport that fall.
At one of the lab in the 9,000 magnets in LHC, was a defection of factory.
So the company has been swearing a little bit of the 13 thousand ample of the electricity.
This was the result.
This is more precisely as they are being able to get 20 to 20 pounds over 20 pounds over 20 pounds of it.
So I have the reference of about 50 magnetic magnetic magnetic
We had to go away, which I was doing it, which I do.
I recontered all of the theory I reparts.
And now we take magnetic innocent in the suburban subterm.
And the end of the marvelous website will be like new French is going to be like new again.
And we start to start with it, and we have to get the data in the skull, and we'll continue to get the new technologies that are the elements of the universe.
Now, of course, that is in a way that accidental accident about the important thing to do is the important to be the extreme and the extremely rejection.
I think that the fact that it is the way that we have a difficult way that we have young people like LHCHCH.
And so I'm going to be the physics of a human human human announced by the U.K. Davy, who I think about the experiments of the protection of the protection of the protection of the protection of the protection of the risk for the enemy, and it's not more dangerous to presence our minds are not more of our natural gas are not in our minds are not as our refinding to our death rate in our world, and as a refinite rate and as our approach to our approach to our own --
Thank you.
I want to start with the end of the child, you know, when you play with the baby with the box.
In the magic of what you learn to get them and get them to get them and get them to get them to the way you can actually learn how to get the problems and sold the problems of the waste and solving the problems.
The hospital is profound the legal of how we understand a lot of the world of inconconcedence.
So in the quality of the way of the IT interface, the physical interaction with our own objects, the physical objects -- the impression, and my collaboration -- I was starting with my own Patan Jeevan Patan Jewan -- I started to get a computer -- I started to get a whole computer to a whole new way to a mile in this room that if we use a dirate that when we use of a diplate,
She's going to do it for this?
The question was to fascinate this fascinating method of the research I was going to build Sishets' answer
In a short, a Sizart's interact with the super-power.
They can be manufacturing -- they can perform the proceed, you can perform the way they can perform a plane and a radio of a Earth.
The most important is that there are poor are the paths of play, like the plant of the games of the water.
And Sizen Turns out of a new ecosystem to the digital tools of digital process.
In the main which these tools becomes more than their own mission, their own initial coral notions of the other nutrients and incommons of our nutritions and destruction of our interactions and destructive new ways to interact with interaction.
I'm going to start with simple.
This Sizarre is confted to the video image, and if you include the movie of the movie of the mother, if you include the more, they are all the income of the wild.
These are interacting is the connection of one of the other other thing that is the other other things.
So, if I ask them one langle -- it's becoming interesting.
If there's a conclusion, they can see it, and they can become a little bit of confussion.
And you can feel like the continuous and inclinic.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction of interactions is that we can use the data, how we can be able to manipulate the data, how we would be a light.
In this case we have three Sizen Susty Falls and your flower and the poor can use them in the center of the cell, where they will lose the cause of the cat.
If we can get a little bit of it, we can get a little bit of the wood.
There are also interesting to educate interesting, as you might be games that would be games and logically and logically and logically we want to understand the possibility of things that we want to see the results of the result of the results.
So here I have -- this is a simple 4act, which is that they do with a simple National program that are doing with a simple program.
Here we have a game game of the words of the right right of Scrabs and Boke.
And so that in every single one of the first steps was in the end, and on every single word, and on the magic of the words, are the words, are green with a dictionary.
And then, after about 30 seconds of 30 seconds are residents, and you have a new set of letters.
Thank you.
These are nomoministic children who came to the Middle Eastern M, and I received them and mostly to the mom of a material.
It was a crazy.
And one of the interesting things that kind of applications is not as much as you need to do a lot of people who are not to get them to a lot of people
Everything that we have to say is "From the words, and they know what to do.
This is the accurate of people to get it.
This is the most anthropy of our hands in our own right, the right in your own right.
It looks like everything that wanted to do was to do was to do with the Siftsets of one over the other.
So for him.
This is a apply apply of animal.
We wanted to build a instrument for those who invest language the language of the language of the language of the language of the language of the language of the language of the language of the language of us to build a molecule for us to build a tool, we wanted to build a tool,
And this is Februx.
He can introduce new characteristics in the stage, just by the way, just the way they can get those of the charge of the charges.
This is the surface of the soil.
Video: The answer is the Serry.

Video: The Tractal Art.
Very of these.
Misss' and the Sizen and the one of them can do a personal person's powered -- Video: Ham!
DM: It makes the own narrative.
Video: Hon!
DM: It's a open-up story with how it will be a very bad story.
Video: Zaraaaaa!
DM: Using the example I was looking at today is a whole instrument is a tool, and interpretation that we built the museum that we built the sound that we built the sound like the sound of sounds like the role and all of the so.
Each of these are four different variations that you want to use it.
And you can get the sound of the sound of the succession that you have a lot of you have.
You know, the sound of the sound of the sound of sound of sound of a successful Siftable Sifts' success.
There are effects that you can control the tale and control of the moon.
You know, you see a certain certain sound and then you include it to help it to help it out.
The next effects of general effects like the pure and the volume that are the His to see His TV roughly
Video: DM: DM: We start with a second Switch in the two Switzero, we were arrive in a serious serious seriously.
Now I put a CEO line.
Video: DM: Now I add a little bit of a flow of a flow.
Video: DM: And now I will add the moon, to control the whole thing to control the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect.
Video: DM: Most of the inclining of the inclining of the inclinical and the other part of it.
Video: I will be able to do it for more expressive to more expression.
Video: DM: I can resect to do the time.
So I don't have to do the plant, they can improve or improvisation, the price of the list of the light.
Now, in the end of the inner can enter the spring of the Sify Pububa tree, the volume of the volume of the cranger.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is the creation of new new cartooner that are right with our brain, which is the better way to our brain.
And today, I had time to show you a new coordination of this new hospital of design, and the reason that we try to get them from the lab that we try to get them from the lab in the lab of lab.
The reason that he wants to repair is that we are in the general tools of the tools of the interaction of those digital disorders of the world that will bring the information in our world.
Thank you very much.
This is the skills of the discussion.
I'm writing it.
He described is my career is my teacher, but of course, more than that.
It's my mother, my mom and fascinating.
And I don't have this change that is going to change it.
But this is that I mean, something that was happened, and in my career and my career was my career who require me to the instruct of the work.
And the little bit of this is that I wrote this book called "Manuh," the Roaging "Manuh," which the Iuban Iuban -- the cross-ence, the range of the world for a lot of the skin for a world for a little bit of a very important thing that is a very important that the kind of a very important thing that is the international --
The theory is that they go now, people go now, people are going to be the expensive.
Seran's conclusion, the conclus!
With the fact that you can immediate and you say, "You don't know it's the worth of the beet?
You don't know it's going to go to the whole bunch of life is going to take a little bit of a book that will ever be a book that ever ever ever ever do this?"
It's very line.
But it was more likely to be if you don't have any more than 20 years ago, when I was starting to do the people -- I want to get the people -- I want to become written -- I want to become written by the same thing that kind of a kind of African reaction on the side.
And people said, "No-the-the-the-the-like success?"
Do you know that the beat will be the right will replicate the idea?
You don't know that you're going to work in this field in this field in this field of a -- and nothing will be a moral of a map of a piece of dreams of the dreamed of the sample of the base of the sam?"
Something like that.
The answer -- the answer to all those questions is the short of those questions."
Yeah, you know, it's the theory of all those things.
And it always happened.
And you know, it's the theory of the other things that people don't have any people who can't afford them.
As an example of the magnitude algorithms.
But when it's a project I was writing about the last thing I did was in the last time I was "Why is the last thing that is "Why is the question of that?
Is that something else.
It's a logic to be to be able to be able to do that they feel like that they feel like that they feel like the Pame.
And what is that the specific initial is that seems like we are really really true that we are really really really in the way that other teachers don't do it?
And my father was a engineer of chemistry and I don't remember the 40 years of you who are in the 40 years of engineering is a chemistry of engineering is a engineer to be a engineer of the chemister.
It doesn't happen -- John, how does that go with the chemicals?
It's not that happening.
But as we are the engineers, engineers, the engineers of chemicals that have not too much of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the power of the depression.
We write the insects we have this reputation, and not only writers, but not only writers, but the artists, they look like this in the way they have a lot of people are very strongly stronger to be very strongly strong.
And all of us is to look at the numbers of the numbers of the numbers of the 20th century in the 20th century that have been died by the minds that they died by the time they did.
And even those who didn't get the own core of their own bedrop and the own own own mind.
Norman Mailer, even in the last time I was going to be the last time said that the baby was a little bit more of my cartboard was a little bit more of my cartoon my cart."
A great great extraordinary of the work of a life of a life of a life of a life.
But I don't have a little bit of a person who I heard this because I heard that things like this, because I heard a lot of times and I would have absorbed and unacted the idea and the idea that the creative of the creative and the inherence of the power of the forest.
And the question I want to add this is that we all want to do with this idea: Are you all the idea?
You are comfortable to do -- because it is that the list of the eye -- I don't really get this -- I don't really get this in the poverty.
I think it's like the odie.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to give you a vast of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of dangerous and I think it's also because I think it's a curve.
I think it's better if we encourage our artist's artist's artists.
And I know that in my case -- in my situation, my situation, my situation, for me to start to start to start to start with this kind of a bunch of this -- especially in the sky, especially in which I think is about the circumstance.
As a example, there are pretty much like 40 years.
I probably have four decades of the work of the work.
And it's probably like to be the incepted with this moment of the work of the work of the work of the work of the last few days, the last few of my career, right?
What would be a little girls, because of the same thing that we are already friends, we are probably the largest successful of my greatest to be happened.
Oh, God, what is gonna her,
This is the way that might do anyone in the morning to get the end of the morning, and I don't want to get that person to get that the person
And I mean in the continues that message that I love it.
And then, the question is: OK?
And so I hope that I was a lot of meditation, as a manipulation, that is to go now, to write a kind of building a kind of process that is to write a kind of process that is a kind of profound psychology that is wrong?
I had no idea of it, I had to find a distant that I was a distant distant that was writing about my notion that was going to be in the lab that I was going to be in the way that will be in the way of what I was written to write the way to explain what I was writing to write what I was writing to write what I was was going to write
And as I did that in the last year of the last year we started to find out of the time, and I tried to find other society, and I could have better ideas, and I could have better ideas about how to have the people of how to be held of how people are helpful people are held to be helpful and more inherent of the emotional wildlife of the emotional rise of the emotional wise.
The scientific was in the Great and Romans.
So you know, the thing you do is the incheck.
But as a GDoms and Romen are doing that people don't think of the creative that the creative of the way in the way of the people in the skill?
People thought that the creativity, was a spirit of the people who are held to a shape of people in a way and unintelligent and unaccurately and unintelligent and united.
The reason they called these are the basic procedures of the creative creativity.
Socratic was the immune because it has a demon which is a demand the intelligence of the department.
Romers had the same pitch, but they called the creative creation, but they were imating.
What is wonderful because the notion of the notion was not a individual genius was a very few of the deeper of a very practice of a very exciting of the end.
They thought a genius was a kind of magnetic field, which is what the way the wall of the way that Dobby, in a kind of like Dobby, the spring of the arm that are made of the original and the pattern and the pattern of the work of the work of workforce of the work of works.
His sold -- this is really distant -- this is the distant that the process of that building -- that the process that building the protection of the works.
And all of the world as it turns out that it happened, right?
So the artist was protected by certain way, as much as a lot of things, as much narcision, right?
If the work was straight of the work was the way you can get the whole world for her, the whole world as a result of the world that has helpful to the travel to the way it held.
If the work was critical, it wasn't the work was not the end of it, right?
And all the world as the gene of the gene was a very ignore.
They looked in the Vest of people in Very creativity.
And then he came out and everything was changing, and everything was going to do with a certain idea of how the people are going to put the idea in the center of all the way to all the way to all the way they get the most famous way to create the mysterious way to create the mysterious way to make the demander of the dish.
It was a little humanism of the rational rational, and people started creating the creative creativity,
And for the first time in the history of the history of the artists, and the other artists, in place to a genius.
And it's going to be married, I think it was a huge error.
And if you get the simple person to create the creative or the receptor is actually the receptor and the insurance of the skin and the income and the surgeria, the mysterious responsibility, the unlike the four-board responsibility of the psychic responsibility of the human mind is too much more of the psychic and the language of the human beings of the way of the human being.
It's like you have a cover will be able to get the sound.
It's just incotal and deforms of the risk of the incomfortable of these areas of inspire that they are in the performance.
I think that the present of the artist's artist's artist's in the last 500 years.
And if it's true, I think the question is, what do we do is that we do it?
Can we do things like this?
Maybe we go back to the sensor of the relationship between people and the mystery of creativity.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't just stand to stand and and human rational-rational talk.
And you probably have the public public is that would be the real question of the question that would be the theater of the people that are actually going to the people are actually going to the people are the present of the projects and all the projects of their projects and all the projects and all the projects and all the world.
It probably don't want to be cooption on the idea.
But the question I want to ask is -- why don't I want to ask is what is now?
Why don't we think about that?
Because it has a sense of as a lot of more than anything else I've heard about what is the real range of creativity.
And it's about anyone who has to create something -- in fact, to create something -- in fact, it's not all the way -- the more remarkable of the unit of the unit of it.
And in fact, sometimes maybe the fun can go to the right paranormal.
I had a real innocent where I met the American American American Rutch Station, which is now in the jewood in the jewest and that was the story and that was the story of when he was the story of the Virginia and he was a story of the Virginia to work on the road to work on the road and I just feel a little bit of the camera in the camera and I just felt the bought to feel a bought to work on the camera
The story was like a venture of the same.
And they were spring over the campaign.
The symptomy, because you have the wild falls in the legal core of the leg.
In that moment was one thing that has a single thing -- and certain -- I read the same -- "applie."
And it goes to the house to the housin to the hole of the hags of the map was to get a little bit of a map and a creative that when the third of the mountains and a split of a map.
Sometimes it was not enough enough to be able to get the same and you go to the house, but it doesn't get the housin and the boy of the wild and the poem in the rooms of the road around the road around the road of the road of the road of of the road in the room.
They were the moments in which -- and this is not going to look at the time, the moments of loss that almost almost loud.
Offering home, the moon and the main and the way it was the way it was the only one when the price was the one of the other one of the other one of the other and the story of the other and the other.
The reason for the code and the role of the code and then the role of the magic of the math.
In this situation, so that the applid, and it is the perfect and the last few words, but to the last one.
When I was hearing -- it's just the praniger, was the way my own process of creativity.
My point is not the creative of this -- I'm not protecting it.
I'm a cating, and the way they work on the same thing I hope to see every day and I think of the same and you think about it, and I think of the same as you can see and be able to be deeply with the wrong with it.
But even though I was in my hand, even I was able to find that the phenomenon.
And I would imagine that kind of as you are a lot of you.
And I had been designed by the ideas, or ideas that they came from a source to identify that doesn't know it.
And what is the whole thing you do here?
And how it is it that we should rescuus us to lose our minds, we don't lose our minds to help us the remote to the remote of the disorders?
For me, the most relevance of our daily in our daily in the way we can do is the music of Tom Way, we took a piece of the Waiten with the revivia in the revia in the revia in the revivia in the review of the revidence of the most relevant in the world.
I was going to be the subject and all of this was almost almost all the artistic of the artistic artist who started to control the artist and gestablished these impulses.
With the time it was the story of the story as a story as a result of the way in Los Angeles and then everything was changing.
Where we protect a short time a short park of a piece of a piece that comes to the earthquake and a magnetic and a straight and a dream and a lot of inspiring and a little bit of a and a little bit of it.
It doesn't have a lot of the creation, not have the reported of the creaty.
The sense of that the screen of that the ecanxiety in the room and the point of the mom, and the paper for the time.
I'm not enough to revealing a lov."
And instead of looking at the end of the wild.
He was a whole process of doing something with something and did something else.
He got the way to ask and he said, "You know, you don't see that are the volcano?"
"Can you have to write a drug a cross-on?
If you really want to be true, it goes to be in a moment when I can do it.
If you don't know how you get the other things.
DH: With the Leonardo and the Cohen."
The process of creating the process of creating this is changed the way of that.
It doesn't have to be done to be deadly in the way that it was always the innocent.
But the process of it, and the end of the same and the notion of the time that he took the wild, and only because he was the wildlife and only because he was in the way to come back to the road and then he had to come back to the way to come back and also to the China.
It could be this collaboration and the great college, and the whole bunch of other exteraron, and the exterarm and exterroristan that was not so much like Tomanist.
And when I heard the story of a little bit of a little bit of what I was thinking about it.
This approach me to the mid-when I was the Haguest, the Roag, Iub, Iuban and I have a lot of the ends of the wildlife that we were not a lot of people who were not a bad reporter to think about what I did is a report that it will be a refrigerated to think that will be a refriend of it.
Not just that the most profound that the first book of writing it.
We just think that we should just think of the design project.
And I remember my time I was talking to the hospital and I was trying to get the open.
I went to the way to the manusual and I was represented a collection of the camera.
I said, "His I have the notion of the newspaper, and I know that if this is not a great thing that if this is not just the great thing that is not just the hous?
Because you can see that one of the wild to see that I would have to be more than you do.
So if you want to be better than you are you going to do your own stock and you do your own little bit of it.
Oh h if you don't want to do that, you know, to do that.
And one thing to write about this is the message of my goal.
And I want to consensus me today as I did my part of my shot on my third part of the third part of the shot of my daughter of the tree.
Because -- the Conclusion -- the Conclusion -- with hundreds of years ago, the North African people are not going to add the wild of the beeen and muscles that have been able to get the end.
And they were always very wonderful, because the encounters were the remarkable of the remarkable and were the right corruption?
But sometimes the time, it really is happening, and one of the interpret of the community of communication.
I'm convinced you all know what I mean by what you do is that you all know about it, a certain kind of interpretation.
It's like time when the time it was a confer is a kind of parking and a lot of the part, you know, the other 1,000 countries in the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 ser.
And in a time it seems to be in the threshold of the sky.
It's lighting on the road and lived from the pure is the same.
And as I was going to do what was going to do is what they call it.
And they were uncomfortable to get the scanners and they were "Allah Allah Allah Alllah Alllay, Gamam."
It's God.
A interesting history of the history of the history -- when the main Spanish Spanish Spanish and the sample of this and the sample of the New York City in Alley, Alleeehhin in the "Holeh" -- the wood, "ol," and old, and y" -- olold, and then the other other history of them --
and they hear the time in the fibers and the dancers and the dancing and the judgment of the spring.
In Spania, when a revealed something impossible and magic has been able to "Allay, Allay, Allay, Allay, Allay, Allay, Allay, Allaw, the voice of voices.
It looks like a -- a God -- a God of God God God God God of God's God's nows.
It's wonderful because we need to have something like that.
But the point is the second day in the morning when the end of the end of the inner is the fact that it's a little bit of the morning, 17 morning and it's not a lot of the Divanna come in the air.
It's a diverse that is and that it is also the gene of the genes and it might not be more and more innocent in the alone and the inalone.
It might be like nobody to the name of the word "Hom" when he was the word that should be done with the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the lives of the rest of the lives of the life?
It's good.
It's one of the most vulnerable acts of the creative creature.
But maybe not a big chunk in the beginning of if you don't think about the most extraordinary part, as the most extraordinary part.
Maybe you think if you don't have been a sample of a source of a way of thinking about the moments of the data from the next to the next day and the next day when the moments were going to be a data.
If we think that it is becoming change.
And I started thinking and I thought, and I thought it will be sure in the last month of the book that will be published by the time of the forest and the crueling of my footprint and cruelty.
And what I was doing is, as you get when you get the sophisticated with the blue of the West.
It won't be the safe and the fact that you can do your own presence of the Industrial anywhere.
If you get the end, the end, the more of the dance.
If the gene gene the gene of what you are replicated to the late that extraordinary is the extraordinary that extraordinary to a very clever of the force of forces, then "Hle!
And if no, you know, the light.
And with all of these "Have you.
I think that we should have to predict them.
"Theky for you, just you have a load loves for the human beings and inforce of the end.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I talked about some of these projections of these projections and what could do is predict and what they might be discovering new genes.
Now we start a new point in a new point of biology -- we have digital biology, and now we're trying to start to start with this digital biology, and we're going to go into a new biology, model and asking force and dealing force and emotional force.
We tried to do it for us to ask us about it.
"What is the life?"
We tried different approaches, simplification of life on the data.
We are already about 20 years.
When I was the sequencing genome, this was left from the world of the analogy of the digital biology of the Web in the digital world.
Now we're trying to regene the question: Can we create new forces new forces in this universal world.
This is the main of a little organism Mycobes that the most genitarian that has the most genome that can replicate the only way that can replicate the only way in the lab in the lab in the lab of a lab of a laboratory of a spectrum.
We tried to see if we can come up with a genome and small.
We were able to get the orange of a group of gene gene in the judge of the forest are there.
But, when we look at the map metabolic -- it's pretty simple, it's pretty simple, it's pretty simple.
And so that is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can get the first time, it's probably a little bit of a cell.
So we decided that the only way we actually think the only way we can do this cross, in the same way that we can can see the amount of questions to the most fundamental questions.
And so I started to see the catastrophe, "Can we be the philosoph?"
Maybe the chemistry allows these molecules that we don't have any big molecule that we ever did it with it?
And if we can do that a cross-genome?
A crosis, by the way, the more -- is just a piece of chemical material.
So our digital truly to digital life has been done by a exponential rate.
Our ability to write the genetic code that very very quickly, but it was a little bit of it.
The last time he was a sample of the exponential curve.
I started this for about 15 years.
I went through a few days, in fact, we started looking at a bio-et-the-the-handed experiments.
But, it's obvious to see that the DNA is very difficult to do.
There are tends of thousands of cars in the world that makes little bit little DNA to 30 to 50 kilometers, but it's a general process, but it's a general process of doing a long way of doing a long time, with a long time, with more ertainment.
So we had to create a new way to put these little bits and the right thing to do with the right of the errors.
This was our first tentrepreneur, the digital world, to the digital divide, the I74.
It's a virus that the omorers.
We made the paper of the paper, I was the right of the error, and I have a DNA of ADDD and a DNA.
The interesting thing that I took this piece of chemical material, and I put it in bacteria, and I put it in bacteria, and the bacteria, and the bacteria, and the bacteria.
The viral virus was then released and then they were returned to the E.
I was going to be with the ownership and they were doing this very clear this model of it.
They are laughing more than you want to you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software can build their own master can build the master system.
But we wanted to do something more than we want to do something more of it.
We wanted to build the entire cross-genome.
This is over 580,000 letters of them over 5,000 letters.
So we said, we would take the wall of the board of the boy of the virus to actually understand the size of the citizen that are the size of a cell.
And the process is critical, and if you start with the digital information in the computer needs to be very accurately, that information has to be very accurate.
When I was the first sequencing this gene of the 1990s, the standards of a 10,000 pounds of war in the war of war to 10 pounds of war walls.
I found out of the revenue, 30 to the wild. If we were used to be the original original original original would never be activated.
The design is from design is the projection, which has the long long enough to 50 letters, which is to be a little bit of a different piece of other letters, to build 50 letters, to build some more than we design so much, so we have to create some of them so many other people are to create some of them are able to transform some of the other people.
We are also using tools.
You can read that I read "marks" in the house. Good and you have a gene cover the genetic code in four letters, the C, and T.
Tries from those letters, those letters, those letters, about 20 remember about a literature -- one of the one -- one of the income every one of a spread.
So we can use the genetic code to write the words, the propositions.
And I was all the way we did was to hear the code.
Some of them were unable to be that it's not the poetry is not the poetry
We designed those little bit that we can actually have been able to manage them.
I'm a lot of them reparing and they are all them.
So we started doing the gents, starting with five to these few tons to 7,000 tons of the sample of them to do these little bits of 24,000 lets, and then they put them in these lawyers in the air.
Every time we got these little bits of these little bits in order to do 11,000, and we try to create a very very range of falling process -- as you can see a very range of the mind -- as you can see in a mind.
We try to get that pointed to that point in the text.
So, this is how a theory of the War.
When we go to the pipe, you know, over 100,000 pounds of war walls of the wall of the wall of them.
It is a whole new molecular of biology biology of biology.
So we were really really gotten to other hand.
I knew that there are a mechanism called the human recombination of biology that biology is using DNA to replicate the DNA that is unfortunate to be happy to be gone.
This is an example.
There is a organism called Deinocockkches that can be a million role that can be a million role of radiation.
As you can see in the panel in the panic is the crosome, the Homomen is a bit.
12 hours to 24 hours later, he put it in the lawyer as it was in the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be emerged on the state.
They can live in your life.
I'm really sure that life can be in the space can be in space to be mostly more, to find a new environment,
In fact, NASA showed that this is that this is happening.
This is a molecule that we build these profoundly built these profoundly -- in fact, using a piece of design with the design of the design of the skin that we put the skin that we put the sky.
Droja is to put them together to the automatically.
This is not a little image of a microscope with electrons, but only a microphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphony.
It's so a molecular molecular that we can see a microscope.
This is the image, over a hundred seconds about six seconds.
This is a public we've been a little bit of time.
These are over 580,000 letters of the genetic code.
It's the largest molecular molecular molecule with a structure structure of the structure of the structure of the structure of it.
It has a molecular molecular molecular over 300 million dollars.
If we get a fix of 10 and without space and without space 142 pages to be able to enjoy this code of genetic code this code code.
So how do we start a cross-cross-on? How do you do that?
Evivil with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with the bacteria.
And also, as you get more and you get to the store of the nuclear nucle: You can just put the other thing -- it's something that you all heard -- it's something you have heard -- it's a something that you have heard -- clonce.
With the Aromic Society is integrated in the cells, but we showed that we can do a whole bunch of a whole cross, from a whole range of cells, and we can activate it.
I have a gone of the microbial spectrum.
These are the second as much as people and the people and the people and the way it is.
We added a gene of a gene in plus to this cross--range for this crosome.
I have been looking at the enzymous to the protein.
And it was pretty ununfortunate when we put it into our cells, very sophisticated -- and the cross--stom-and-en-ended in cell.
In fact, we thought this is how far it can go and go and try and get something more and we tried to design the process of it.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We find all kinds of species that have been able to do a second cross, or a third of the tree, or a tree, of the other new characteristics of new new new characteristics of new new characteristics of new characteristics of new characteristic species.
So those who think about evolution just as a single gene of change, they lost a lot of the biology.
I'm asidenied by the restriction, which actually had the DNA that actually have the DNA.
The Cromosome, that was in the cell.
The story -- the cross-on that we put new --
It was exceded and recognized the other cross-once, as the sky, and so that I was just a straight with the crosomic crosomic with the crosome.
It became blue because of genes that we put in the cross-genome.
And after a very short time -- all the characteristics of a species have lost in a new species have lost a new species of software that we were lost in the cell phone that we put in the cell.
All the proteins were changing, the members were changing, when we are changing the gene, it's exactly what we are the genetic code.
This can sound like alone genome, but we can also do the software software model, and we move things pretty cloud.
Now, I was not that that this is not genesis -- but half of the evolution; and half years ago, and I was supposed to create a new version of the Web of Camboancient Cambodian of Cambridge Cambridge Cambodian of the main which of digital mammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Why do that?
I think it's pretty obvious about the real time.
We are going to go to six billion people around the new and half of them over 40 years.
And to give me this in context for me in 1946.
Now I'm three people on the plane for every of us in the 2046; in 40 years, in 40 years, will be four years, in 40 years, will be four.
We have problems of the problem with the water samples, and the drugs, commercialization, committed to six billion and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half of the problems of them.
It will be difficult to do it for us.
We are now using the good news over five billion pounds of cars, more than 30 billion pounds of oil.
This means a hundred million barriers on the day.
When we try to think about profoundly in the procast process that will be a huge challenge.
And then, of course, is all that CO2 in this material, which is that it takes in the atmosphere.
Now, in our discoveries of our world, we have a data that we have a data with 20 million genes, and I like to think about these components of design design as a component of the design components of the design components of the future.
The electronic electronics has just a due to a bunch of the components, and this is the diversity that has been going to do it.
We are limited here, in the first biological biological biological and imagination.
We now have the technique of these ways to do what we call what we call what we call the genuinity.
We have the ability to build a big robot that is to do a million cross on the day.
When you think of these 20 million genes of genes 20 million genes are different genes to try to do the farmer to produce the pharmaceutical treatment, we can change the farmer and product to a little bit of the technique than the last 20 years, the same molecular technique.
And that's just the standard of the standard of the standard of it.
We can control for your life or chemistry or chemical chemistry or fuels, producing production, production of vaccines, which is the incigarettes.
This is a capital of ecosystem that we can do things that we work and work on these species in computers.
You know, we don't know how it will show you.
We know how their genetic code their genetic code.
Now we focus on the combat the fourth generation.
You saw that in the mirrrruman experiment is just a conference.
We have comfortable to generate the next generation of the third and the third of the very curriculum that are nowadays, which are the largest value, or different types of buttermilk.
But the only way we think that the biology can have a major impact without a major cost-scale costs of their food and the fast is if we start with CO2 is the first step, and we think we can start to design the cells to design and this is that we can have the first combine the next few decades of the next six months.
They solar solar and CO2 is a way -- but in our discoveries of our world have all kinds of ways of the world have all kinds of ways of the world.
This is a organism that we were described in 1996.
It is the ocean, about two kilometers and half of the ocean and half in the temperature temperatures are the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the blood vessel.
Transform CO2 in metan use of hydrogen molecular biology.
We try to see if we can take CO2 capital that can be easily transported in the country, and convert that CO2 back in the bbbase in the combat that point, to reach this properly.
So in a short time, we think we could have been able to do what is the question is, "What is the life?"
We know -- you know, you know -- we have objects to get the whole industry of oil industry.
Yeah. If you can't do that in TED, where in other hands in another part.
So let me become a amount of energy energy
But we also work now to use these same source that are the same way to invent the product in the field.
You saw this year with the spring with a year and a dollar in the minus when it comes to the right of the right of the right of the right of the right of the right now.
I think the situation can be changing, that situation can be able to do the vaccine.
And here's how it might be able to show the future of change is now where the evolution of evolution, accelerating evolutionary evolution, and in fine, and finding the initial evolution, and finding the inner of the wild.
We are almost to improve people.
Our idea is just to make us that we have a lot of us that we have a long way to survive to do that. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you the next few years, it's a new technology, it's a new technology, a new technology that we had to Microsoft as a year from a year now is a year ago in a year ago is a year.
It's a medium that can interact with a lot of visual data is the distance of data data that are visual.
We look at a lot of time, many gigs and the digital banda and subject in continuous place, by the panels of that, in fact, we wish it.
It doesn't do the way of thinking about how big information is that big data, how big the colleges are images.
Most of the people are doing with a digital camera camera with a virtual website is a scanner, but this is a Congress, the Congress,
It doesn't have important because the only thing that should restrict the system is the number of pixels of your own month of your own month of your own thing in a very fly of a very swealth.
This is a three-dimensional for a time, an example of a non-imagination.
It's about "Cath" -- Charles Dickens. The Dickens. The whole is a capital.
To show you that it's about text, and we can't do that. We can do that is really a real thing, to show that it's a reference of a text of a text -- it's not a picture of a text.
Maybe this is a artificial way to read a electronic book in form.
I would not tell you,
This is a real real real. It's a "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian of "Tanulance.
Each one of the beginning of a second.
This is really a piece of experience of a experience of a life of a version of a revia or a resistance of a very high environment.
We did something small with something little bits of the Gardian of Gardian of Gardian of the Gardian of "Gardian
We created a symphony to a very big -- much larger -- much larger than any clamp -- and I was in a reclear -- and I was a confused to be a concrete of it.
If you want to see the properties of this car, you can see here.
Or even other models, or even the species.
And that is really through certain ideas, the more idea.
We hope that this is to be a lot of flowing and other frog and other like this -- that are not necessary.
Of course, the mapping is one of the applications for a technology for a technology like this.
I'm going to tell you a lot of time to tell you more about it, but just to tell you more about this field.
These are all the way of the United States has been on a picture of the NASA.
Let's go to a look at something else.
This is actually a way of putting the green of the great.
This is a project called Ptext Ptex, which is the second two different technologies. One of them is Seaon Seager and the other side of the visual behavior in the context of the language of Savin Washington Savin Washington of Steve Savin Washington at the U.S.
And Rick Seliski to Certain. A school. A very beautiful school.
So this is active on the Internet. Possil for Seal of Seal Seal of Seal Good lo.
You can see that when we create that when we create these kinds of perspective, we can not have this kind of experience in many of the experience of a lot of their experience.
But the space of the space of these images of these images.
Ogerious thousands of perception have recorded these images have been recorded these images, so that they are doing these pounds -- all these pounds -- all these pounds -- they were doing these tools -- they were able to see these tools -- they were able to see these tools in the projections of a projection of a projection of the space of the space of the space of the space were in space
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There are some more that have more space of the space of the ality.
I would like to go to one of the original core of Nowl -- this is doing a huge amount of time in a huge process that I worked in a vast -- to show you what I think is the pioneer of this technology of technology that we believe that it's not just a lot of the technology of this technology that we have been able to go to the projections that we have to do it in the website.
We had to have been looking at the things that are the things that are going on.
This is a reconstruction of Coral November of Duel Flickr. Glllll. And you know, the Duel His Srickr, and you find something that was a bunch of room, and every single one of these reveals in the rooms of these rewardly reignored rerererements that was found a picture that was a picture that he was a picture that was found that they were a picture that was a cooperate.
These are the Flickr, and all of them were the real space in this way.
We can just have to be in this way.
You know, I never thought I will be working to work on Microsoft is very strangular to a contain of a first and I was also a first and I was also the first part of it.
I don't know that I'm noticed that I'm a lot of the camera in the field of the camera in SLRs in SLRs in SLLLs in this environment.
If you know, if I can find that strange the strange of it.
There are so many mammmals -- hussia, waiting for me.
One is going to be here -- it's a series --
This is a Space with the Duelt who was been recorded by the right right here.
You can get the time of the environment to a physically remote to this environment.
And the idea is that I can do certain things with social environment. This means to collection on the world -- from a collection of the world -- and to a memory -- and to interact with them -- and to interact with those -- and they have been connected to the whole thing that is more and more and more fast than the elephant.
You have a model of what the entire Earth is the entire Earth is.
So look at this time as a long as the code of Stephen Lawlen Lawler of the Earth.
And this creative in complexity as the world as well as a lot of people who are becoming more of how users are using them as useful as use.
The reason is that the quick of metal is that somebody else else else that else else has to be done.
If anyone would all these bicycle and say who they are the pictures who are the pictures of the Dutch Hum's Dutch Ds and I could improve all these data to use that space to use that space to do that space to do that space to do that space for a whole whole whole social data.
And of course, a product of the whole range of these are and the rich and the virtual areas of the Earth are the real world of the Earth, collection of the Earth and images of the Earth and imagery, but also of a collective member of a collective memory and image.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: What is the right thing to allow the power of your own voice, is that going to be a few years, is that all the pictures of the dogs of someone who are doing the pictures of the people that are going to be interconnection?
BA: D. What is the real thing is to do.
It makes the performs, if you want to see, in the image.
And that is made it of the imagery.
And this is becoming incentive when you think about the information that they have these images that have those images.
As you do a look at the Internet, the Internet -- the way you can take a certain word, and the text from the Internet to the Internet a lot of information about what is is the positive information about what is the positive information about what is the positive information about what is the positive when you do the picture.
Now, what would be if that positive is the connection?
And so that the amount of interconnection and the disease that we have the rise of this is that effect is where the profound effect of resident.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible. Felicity.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of the intense and one of the great research research is to live is the ancient is the old of the old who don't look at the old -- they still feel the last few days of them are still the last roads of the boxes of the pitch of plots of plows.
You know, you don't know that the Jaguary Jaguary Lacy, or the people who are still in the Himallies of the Himallies with the Himalay, or that in Himalay, it's still to Doubling is to Dharan anthropology is that we are in a sense of the world that we are in a sense of the idea that we are not just a sense of the idea that we are not just in a way we live in a way of a model of a way that we live in a very uncombunch of the idea of the idea of the fact that we live in a lot of the world of the real world that we live in a lot of the world that we live in a lot of the re
The consequences of a certain set of decision-makers that our insects have to be a lot of our generations, with a lot of generations in the next one.
And of course, we all share that same with the same imperative adaption.
We are all born. We all have to bring children on the world.
We are now through the initial initive.
We need to do our separate moral legs, so that you should have to do our surprise, so that you know, all the songs, and they have all the art.
But what's interesting is is the blueprint of the bedrops, the rate of the way every culture.
It is that the Pennsynthesizes in Borney, or the Voodozen Voodozen in Haiti, or the warm of the Karisa Caisland in Kenyan Day and a tribal of Andrew Saharan and a carrier in the middle of the Sahai.
This is the kind of a guy who had the journey that I had the journey in a wider steps of the CEverest, Everest, Everest, Everest, the wooden of the world.
And all of these people are all the things that are other ways to think about the other ways to think about the Earth will be the plant.
And this idea, if you think of well, maybe you know, maybe it's not like to get your hope.
Now, the mirrrors with the world of the brain is forming a spiral and culture, which cooperation and culture, which cover the planet, and it's also the important of the biological biological biological biological biological biological biological of life, know that the biosphenomenon.
And you might think about this required rements as the reette of life as being the nosphoral and the definition of all the dreams, the intuition of the imagery, the intuition of the imagery of human imagination.
Etosphere human beings.
It's the symbolt of what we can be like we can be like a very surprising species of code.
And as biosphere was the heroid, and the nosphere -- and maybe at a much larger.
For example, no biosis not going to suggesting that half or more of all the species was in the marvelous because of the great because it's not true, and yet it's not true, and yet it's not true, and yet this is the most quarters of the biological -- abuse of the biological biological -- the most fundamental sector of what we know in the evolution of what we know in the diversity in the evolutionary sector.
And the largest shot of this is the design of the risk.
When you have been born, you know, the voice, there were 6,000 languages were 6,000 languages talked about the planet.
Now, a language is not only one of the voice or a voice of rules.
A language is a brain of the human spirit of human spirit.
It's the vehicle that the soul of the base of the particles are going to be in the material.
Each is a old language is a lunch of mind, a recept, a very ecosystem to be the spiritual possibilities.
And of those 6,000 language in the World War here in Monterey, a half of them are not more than the kids.
I'm not a baby, which means that if you don't do something -- that don't do something -- that are already -- they are already already -- they are already hard.
What can be more than the only one to be able to be the last link of the most reference, to talk to the language of the language of presence of the deep and the way to the encounter of the inner of the inner of the initial and the kids to the insurance of the children.
And yet, that sounds like the war is even the one of the wild of the Earth is about every two weeks, because every two weeks, a single old old old old old old old old old old lady in the morning.
And I know that some of you will say, "Well, you know, you don't be better?
It would not be better if I talk to a single language if I was talking about, "Grozave, this language of the language of the Arab. Or to be the ia.

I want to start with what I call "the doct."
The truth of the goal
The truth of all the human society of the Western industry.
And this doctor is a little bit like like we are interested in how we are interested in the very good level of the beds' worth of the citizens, the way to do is a lot of the freedom of individual freedom of individuals.

SSShe's got these advances and these risks. What do you want to do this?
And you say, "Dock what do you do?" And the doctor has these triangles and these risks and these risks and the rise of these risks.
What do you want to do?
And you say, "But if you were in my place in my life, you know, the doctor says, "But I'm not in your place "But I'm not in your place of the patient is -- I say "You know, it's -- I say that a little bit of what makes a lot of the patient to do a little bit of a little bit of a thing that makes a lot more effect.
But what is actually a transition of responsibility and decision--makers who are doing something -- in this case -- in this case -- in the case of someone who you don't know it's not almost almost the disease and it's almost not almost the same form of disease -- in the case of the human decision.

And one really important that our identity has become a problem with a choice, and this transition of choice to show that.

With all the way to cover the family was a bunch of family was that the prescription of what the Art was that the exoded by any time it was that you have to start to get the more than you start to start to get them to be able to get them to get them to have children to get them to get them to the kids to have their kids to get them to have their kids to start to have children as much more
The only one was the opposite was with the sky, and what will do you do after that.
In our days, we are very close to the found.
I mean, they are incredible intelligence and give them 20 percent of them and less than I was doing a little bit more than I do.
And that wouldn't be less than it would be less than it would be a little bit more than the hardware less than the harmony.
And what I'm sure is the preserve with all kinds of questions, "should I do this? You should do this?
I should be able to get me back to my children, or I should have a cartoons, all of these are questions? They all are questions.
And they will answer the question, for those questions, if this is not to do not do all of the stand and and do not a good notion of the food.
And this is also what we need to do. These are important questions that we need to answer them.
The one -- we're the blessed and the Carl and Carl and Carl with the technology that allows us to work in every mine -- less than the way in every single place in any way of the planet -- less than the Sesphones.
It is a while, there's a collection in a collaboration, which we don't want to be able to see the sound works.
I don't say about it because I want to use it.
So this is that the very incredible freedom to choose that we have to choose to work with work, it's that we need to take a decision, and we should be able to do it.
We can go to see how our game our foott's football in a bunch of the bones and Blackberryard and the Backberry in the other lapse, that on the genes.
And even though there are all the mind, in which we look at the door of a bunch of football of us is we should be the question?
You should answer this email? You should write the theory, we should write this me?" And even if the answer is that the answer is that the idea of the book is that the experience of the footprint of the footprint will be very different from how to be a lot of what it would be was not very different from how it was to be done.
So in the theory of us and very small things that are doing and the things that are also the things that are a little bit of the opposite thing to optic.
And the world we lived about it.
And I was like, I had some choices of the choices of the options of the option.
And the world we live here as well.
And the question is, is good, or now?
And the answer is no.
We all know what is good at this, so I'm going to talk about what is going to do.
All these choices are two effects of the effects of human effects.
One of the effecties, in paradoxically, is that produces the paralyze.
And so many options that can choose to choose them are very difficult for something.
You can give you a very significant studies about the investment of the investment in the planet.
A collection had been able to accomplished about the data from Varia to Varia that has been a lot of flowers that has almost a million seven-a-million seven-and-a-million sees.
And what he learned is that for every 10 ppyramid that they are going to be able to participate with two percent.
You know, 50 founded by moving to 10 percent -- they are getting more than you have to get more of the people of the people you who are going to get the same. Why?
Because 50 forces 50 foundations of the way to choose the naid to choose what you want to choose that you want to choose that a boat.
And then on the stage and and and then on the wide, and then the same, and of course, all the noise of the noise of the noise of the noise of the not.
And you know, this is not just that the acts that the acts that are used to eat because they don't have money to put it in the pension, that means that the more of a way that is so hard to put a lot of money is so hard to do that is so hard to do that without a lot of money from the compens;
It was getting the left, they have to do with 5,000 dollars a year from the employees that would be.
So the creative is a consequence when you have a lot of options.
And I think that makes the world like this.
You want to take the decision-making decisions if it's for all the way of the ernity, right?
You don't want to choose the investment of investment or even the same.
So this is a second effect. The second is that we are able to get the strength of creative and we do a little choice as a satisfy that we have been doing with a result of the choice than we were able to choose the choice that we were less than we want to choose the choice.
And there are some reason for that.
One of them is that we had a lot of a boss for the people who are going to choose if you don't think about one -- and you know, who are not perfect?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better choose. And what happens is that the alternatives that is that the alternative of choice that you have done your choice that you have done the regret of the regret that you have been doing it in the village that you have been a good decision-making decision.
The more you have the more opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite that you have the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of you it.
Secondly, what economists call the opportunity.
Dan Gil's shot in this morning to talk about how we evaluate things that we see the things that we compare the things that we compare to what we compare them.
Well, when I am a lot of alternative to have a lot of alternative is to imagine the characteristics of alternatives that are the great alternative to the alternative that are going to be less satisfy of alternative.
Here's an example. I mean, I am not the New York's not New York.
But here's how we should reduce it.
We have this box in Hampons.
A very expensive property of it.
The superbits super-shoulder. They have gotten all the way they should be good.
What could you want to want to be more likely to get the finger: I think it's a guy.
And all of my cartoon the Manhattan are border.
I could be like in front of the office of the office. And what two weeks are the idea that the dogs of the idea that is a little bit of a part.
The way of the opportunity in the village that we have the satellites that we are accomplishment.
And as there are more options of the options of the fun that are going to be the same qualities will be performing new opportunities.
Here's another example.
This cartoon says a whole bunch of things.
It says that we should live the sample and maybe we should do things more and we should do better.
But one of the things that is saying that anyone is that anyone choice is that you don't do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things can do and that is going to do what you do you do a little bit of what you do you do a little bit of what you do you do.
Third of the expectation of the expectation.
This is when I wanted to live my life's lifes.
And you get the time.
And there was a little bit of the people who were a single kind of like you and buy them as a lot of people who are incredibly uncluster and if they were incredibly uncomfortable with the time and they were starting to go to a lot of time and I was starting to go to the better, and they were starting to go to the better,
So I went to my own friend after I was a good day and I said, "Look, I want to tell you a little bit of the wall of you want to ask the "You know, the wall of you want to be a little bit of my goods, and the right like?
Do you want to be the death or with the farmer? You want to get the skill?
Do you want to be the reference?
You want to eventually -- you want to go to the wind --
He painted his face and she said, "I want to come up with the guy who was the only one guy who were the only one of the guy that was not a city that I spent a city that I spent a city that I spent a city -- the real wall of the wall of me -- the real thing -- the real -- the real thing -- and I went to all the best I was to get the right -- the best of all of them were the right --
We have better good. They all have done it possible to choose better.
But I was feeling more like that.
Why? I wrote a book in which I tried to explore it.
The reason I felt more worried about these options is that we had all of these options about how I should be a good expectation of the wall of the people have been a good wild of the wall of them red.
I was expected by the way, I was not a very expectation of when they were a single one way they were going to be a single way.
Now when I'm 100 eyes, my mother's mother, my mother, one of them have to be perfect.
And what I had been gotten was good.
So I compared what I was received with what I expected is that I was rescued with what I was hope.
The role of the options in the lives of the people can do something else, than to create something that people who have to be those people who have to be those options.
And as a big initial will take a little satisfaction that even though they are good.
No one of the Internet doesn't know that.
Because if you knew it, I would not have the idea of what I am am am I going to talk about what I do.
The real is more like that.
The reason that everything was better when it was a better when it was worried when it was actually more likely that people to experience.
And over the world where we live -- we live -- the world of countries and the best we expect the perfect thing that we can expect the best thing that you can say things that can be so much as you can hope that things are going to be so much like that will be so much like that.
You will never be a surprised because of the expectations of my expectations and my way to do it.
The happiness of happiness -- for that you have all the happiness is to expect to expect to expect to expand reveal it.
I mean, just a short moment -- a very short positive -- I actually actually have a wonderful wife.
I couldn't find something better than I was in the time.
But you can see the homework is not necessary.
In the end, a consequence of a wall of a wall of you can't buy a single one is that you can't buy a single one as you can't see what you don't know when you don't ask what it is, and what is the answer is the clear and the answer is clear to the answer is clear the answer is clear the answer is clear is clear the answer is the cloud.
Will you the bed. You know, what is we could do it?
And when I'm hundreds of different stills of different stills and a little bit of a kind of a and question, what are you asking out of the be?
It's like the clear that the answer to the question is:
You could have to choose better choice.
With a hundred different ways of choices that you don't have any extensive to be no scale.
So when people have to decide whether people do the results of the choices are good enough.
The present of the brain industry in the world industry in the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not the only one of the erupper erarchy of the erupdate and also also the people who have been assisting the people who have experienced that are dead, because the arts are too much to do.
And when they have to explain these experiences of these experiences are coming in.
So the result of the general is that we have better good, and we feel better and feel better than we feel the more like.
So let me give you a remind.
This is that the doctor that we all believe in a very few days, we think it's really true.
No discussion that you have to have a few choices is better than not the same thing that you don't have a lot more than you do.
There are a magical number of magic.
But I'm pretty sure that we have been able to do that the choices are the way of improving our lives.
Now, the idea -- almost I have finally finally finally the idea that is to think about it.
What allows to do is that all these choices is the good news.
There are a lot of places in the world and we heard about some of them are not that much more options.
The problem is that they have a little bit of it.
So the thing is talking about me is a very strange of the Western society, modern and rich and rich ich ich and rich ich people.
And what is the frustrating and the same, is Steve Levittle for kids who are about these cars for children are being held to be any way of the people are border. I'm a money on the gas of it.
What I say is that these options, and I think these options, and complicated not only that they don't even help.
They have the challenge.
They are really doing us as well.
If something that allows to do in our society to do all the choices that are we doing all the people who are too much less than the people who have too much of the people who have too much of the people will be improved the lives of our lives will be improved the lifed.
This is what economists call the Pall.
The main will make the comedy will be better -- not just the poor people -- because of the way that we can do it in this expensive expensive to the choice.
In the conclusion. It turns out that the cartoon this cartoon this cartoon is that you know the "A! What is the cool? What is the cool?
You know anything that is probably in this action of the poverty, a poorest in the world -- so I read and my first step.
And when I thought about it was more to think about the code of the bedle of the bedle of the bedle of the bedle of the bedropped out of the beat the time,
Because the real real thing is that if you hope that they hope that they are not more freedom of the freedom of the wild.
If you hope that everything is possible, so it's possible, it's possible, we are able to do it.
You can think of the creative and desire today,
Anyone needs a various action.
This is almost almost too much for -- even for a flower -- even for us to us.
But the absence of a metaphor is a reette for the near-in-enough.
Thank you very much.
