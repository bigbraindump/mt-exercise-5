And the year we put these two diaunt dia's entire polar polar that was the cross that in the last three million years was the size of the last three million years of marriage of marching for 40 percent of the marimmediately 40-percent of the marchance of it.
But this is serious mornity of this specific issue because it doesn't look at the black box.
The polar polar is in a way, the heart of global climate system.
It is extended the waste and the fear and the fear of the summer.
The next slide that I'm going to show you about what was going to be a very quickly about 25 years.
Ghe's peaenta marchin the smell of the smell of the smell of the rough.
And as you can see the white white catch.
This is the anuary on the ground.
And it is the summer.
By guess guarantee guy, you can see as a month, you can see that it's almost as a body of your body.
In 25 years of getting from this to this, at all.
This is a problem because the quarter of the fallen of the finger around the ocean.
where it is a massive amount of carbon needle that when it comes to meter, it's transformed in metan catch.
Compart, with polluty in the global warming of the global warming will be double if we move this extreme if we go to this point in the extreme of the extreme of the flow.

Wow. Wo! Al Gore: She's OK to be if we are going to be there.
And a reason is that an enormous words: the hot Groenland is the Groenland in the north.
This is a range that was all over the year that was all over the year.
But volumes are much larger than it.

And at the other end of the plant, Antarctica largest main on the planet.
The last scientist people reported as a network that are just like the continent of the continent is negative and the Western Antarctica of insult on the top of the island of the island of the island of the island of the scientist has all been reported as they reported all over the street.
This is the equal in the high-scale levels of the big level, as in Grooms.
In Himalmi, the main the third of the earthquake, you have new visions, which after a few years was the guarantee of years old.

The debate has ground.
But when it goes to go out with the water water and the water water and the water water
In California was a 40-percent scarrived in the Sierra.
This affects the water reserves the water reserves
And predictable, as you read it, I'm serious serious
On the entire global caccount of the dramatic creative credit of incentives of incenties.

From four times more in the last 30 years of the 75 years of the 75 years of the 75 years of the 75 years of the 75 years of the bird.
This is a completely unsustainable model of unsustainable model.
If you look at the context you can see what happens.
In the last five years I added 70 million tons of carbon dioxide every 24 hours of 25 million in every day every day in the ocean.
Look at the end of the strength of the American Pacific area and every part of the subcontinent of the subcontinent of the subcontinent of the ocean.
The largest because the global warming of the global warms, which is the reports, which represents 20 percent of the fossil fuels.

That's our main is to spend a big money for for for money for eating forces that to help us show us the truth of advertising and we really really really have the real life.
The truth is not dirty dirts;

Thank you very much le!
And the year I did a TED LHC.
And I promised to come back and give you a data about how it works.
So this is my husband for those who didn't have been here, LHC is asked for the largest scientific experiment -- the 27-kilometers and it's about 27 kilometers or is to recreate the presence of a fraction of a fraction of a billion times a second.
It's extremely both of these things.
This is the device under the Geneva.
We do photographs these minds "Big Bangs" inside the decades.
I work on it. It's called the TLAS detector, Lungymous diameter of 22 feet photographs of ATLAS photograph in the construction of ATLAS in the construction.
On the 10 seven, I went to the first year I started the first time.
And this image was the ATLASS.
It caused a great famous famous remote room.
It's a picture of the first piece of particle that has gone through the law of the LHC, crypy system is a part of the LHC deliberately flew in detector.
In other words, when I saw that last 10 seven-seven-the-ended apartment that is a huge successful of what is a huge successful of it.
I don't know if that was the largest own, or when someone went to Google and this page went on the top page of the first page.
It means that I did a cultural impact on the wind impact.
After about a week I had a problem with the device, which actually had to do with these days, these days, these days.
Those are a bubble transportation when the device is functioning to maximize the maximum of power
Now, engineers in the road is looking at these days, "can't transport."
But I can do this because when they're at temperatures become a superconductor.
So in the 271 degree, there is more cold of those stars, the hospitals of those steps can transport these strengths can transport these cutting box.
At one of the layers of the layer in HC, was a factory of facilities.
So the company was enzled a little bit, and the 13,000 of the 13,000 people ended up the power of electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressive, and they have a lot of them spend over 20 tone, and they move almost 30 cycle.
So I got about 50 magnetic magnetic maked.
We had to take the outside, what we did and does.
I reconvicted on the topic, I repair it.
And now we take magnetic magnetic and then we go to the subteran.
And the end of the end of the LHC mart to the LHC will be as new as new as well.
We're going to start again, and we are going to get data in the hulian or or hulia, and we're going to keep the research strength of the universe.
Now, of course, those accident accident accident about the importance of science and engineering and engineering to extreme to break up to break it out. It's going to break it.
I think that it is so hard to be a hard to be the fact that we have young initive, this is the important thing to do is the important thing to do as the L.
So I'm going to leave as a human scientist of British scientist, Humphrey Davelphrey Davelan experiments of protected experiments or protected the protection of the protection of the protected human progress for human minds to minds and human beings, and as a human beings, as the scientists are not finding natural disabove natural natural natural natural displaying in natural natural natural natural disappeare."
Thank you.
I want to start with the rate of your childhood, when you put your bodies with your bodies.
And as you invent them to watch them and raise them to get them to get them to the colored, you know, you actually learn how to understand problems with intelligence and manipulating the spaces of the space.
The hospitals is deeply to how we understand a lot of the world in the inconconcedence.
So in that, in fact, in IT re-inspired by this utility of the physical interactions of our physical objects, -- impression of my Pattian Kalanithanithy -- I started to go into this unique -- I started to get a computer, where we can use a computer, in this unique with a digital disseminal demanded digital diet that would be so much more digital trouble to be able to put in a digital disruption if we can be able to put in a digital displaying digital display, and then we could be so much more digital disappear a computer, and we can now to embee to embeen, and then we can be able to embeen, and then use to embee to ection to embeankingly digital demanded digital demanded by a digital wissionate digital demanded by a computer, and then
It makes it a lot of what we want to do?
This question was so fascinated by the fascinating we hosted the research of building Stttable by Stttable by Sttttable to do Stttable of this is so fascinating the question of this fascinating was so fascinated by the fascinating of this fascinating was so fascinated by the fascinating we had to attacked the science of the research I was so much to try to make Stttttable to do Stttttable.
In short, a short of a very short computer computer to a bism.
They can be manufacturing them, they can perceive the reef, you can perceive the foundation, and a radio of wireless and an radio wireless wireless of wireless wireless of the wireless of the reference.
The most important is that there are palpable, like the game, you can just keep them as they just get them out of it.
And Siftapes office of an ecosystem new environmental manipulation of the digital manipulation of the digital manipulation of the digital process.
The main of these tools are getting more and more and more and more constantly their mission of other, and the constitutes of the nutritions of our nutritional nutritions, we can start to explain new stills and new ways to interact with new stills.
I'm going to start with a simple example.
This Sifted is confified image, and if you include it in a direction, and if you include it moves the movie, it tells the movie.
These are the interactive are constantly in the other.
So, if I put them one to them on other, they become interested.
If there are unconfident and this is going to be a little bit of fuzzy and it becomes a little bit.
And you can also feel the misforce.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of interactions of interacting with the obstacles of obtaining the data, as we can use the tasks like we would have a cold liquid liquid liquid liquid liquid liquid liquids.
In this case, we have three Siftapes like the paintings and they can use them to be torn in the center, where they will be amece.
If we can get too much, we can get a little bit of a long time.
There is also interesting possibility for education, like how would be games and logical games and logical ways we want to want people to try to try to get people to try to see the results as quickly as it as quickly as it as soon as it as sound.
So here I -- this is a southick of the Fibonacious program.
Here we have a game of the words of the words of the Scrabble and Boggle.
So in the first first first one of the first one of the Sytagging, and the map of what the death of the words, they're great, they're great.
And then after about 30 seconds residents are reseats and you have a new set of letting new letters.
Thank you.
These are the children who came to the children who came to the Media Laborator and reached them to come up with them and filmed them a material.
They like them to crazy.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of apparents are not that you don't have to give them a lot of people in the structure.
All you have to say is "Fa word," and they know exactly what to do.
Here are other people who are looking at them.
This is the most tandest testert in our right.
It turns out that everything that wanted to do was to make a Stttable to do it.
So for him was just cubs.
This is an interactive, an interactive.
We wanted to build a instrument for those who invest languages.
And this is Felix.
He can introduce new characters in the stage, just the Sizarre of those Switttings.
This is introduced the sun.
Video: The race.
David Merrill: Now he introduced a tagger in the scene.
Video: The portoil: The tour.
Very of course, yes.
Misming and Siftttable and watching one of the other hands can interact -- Video: Wideo: Ham!
DM: It creance.
Video: His a!
DM: It's a final story with open and he decided, and he will be a bunch of things.
Video: Zboard, pyard.
DM: The last example I have time to show you today is a device is a device and interpreted music that I built the music I built the role of the sounds of sounds like the sounds of sounds like bed.
Each of these are four different variations that you want to use it.
And you can inject the sounds of a succession that you can assemble after the guy.
Stanger gets back and the sounds of sounds of a successize.
There is effects you can control pounds like reverberary and the film.
You have a certain sound of a certain sound and then includes it to help it.
It follows the general effects like the main and the volume that applied the inentire century of the God to see it.
Video: DM: I will start with a rhythmous rhythms, I was arrived in a serious serious seriously.
Now I put a basic line line of the base.
Video: DM: Now I add a little bit.
Video: DM: And now I'm going to add the top, to control the top, to control the light.
Video: DM: I can be the entire inclined in the clinical fire or something.
Video: DM: Now I'm going to put this on the baggas for more extension of expression.
Video: DM: I can resecution as a amount of time.
So I don't have to do the previous plan, you can improvise, pretending to the movie from the walk.
Now, the end, I can get the whole bag, I can get the southern of volume Street.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is the creation of new interfaces that are really getting better with the way of our brains and our body in which we are our brains.
And today, we had time to show you a coordination of this new space, and some of the possibility that we were trying to get out of the lab.
The Ganda retiniest wants is as we are at a new generated by the new general tools of interaction with the digital environmental environmental rules in our world.
Thank you very much.
These episode is to discussion all the way to be all of you to talk about it.
I'm written by writing.
He wrote the book is my professional teacher, but it's more than it is.
It's my mother, loved love and fascinating a life.
And I'm not so much to change it.
But these are being said, something like a weird in the career and in my career and in my career who determined me to remove my work with work.
And the weird thing that I wrote this book called "Frey phoney, Roag, Rageste," which Rageste," which is unlike my bookstststore in the world for a very important international books to a world for a little bit of an international signs.
The result is that anywhere I'm going to take me now, people treat me as a convicted as it was convicted to be convicted by the end of the food.
Serios -- convicted -- convicted a!
So as if you get immense and you say, "Don't you want to be the theme as none of the passenger performance that?
Don't you want to write a life on your entire life to create a more book that makes a bunch of book a book that ever fall the world on this ever fall?"
It's very linked to truly it.
But it was also a lot of them if I don't have all about 20 years ago, when I started to marriage people -- I want to become written by the same kind of as I want to become written by a kind of African reaction of the same African reaction of the Africa.
And people said to me, "Don't you have never have any success?"
Don't you know that humility will be kicked to kill you?
Don't you know, it's the fear of your life in this field of life and nothing will be in here and not going to be a dream of a dream of a dream of the enjoy of the endless dream of the screen?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the answer -- the answer to all those questions is """Yeah."
Yes, you have the fear of all of those things.
And I always hit my husband it always hurt.
And it's a filled in the rainforest that people can't get them to die them.
As a big algorithms that are cross-cross-crushed algorithms that are cross-illusion.
But when it is about the work that I thought about the last thing I have been thinking about the last time is "why?"
Is this a rational?
It's logic to this host hits to be able to do it to do it as a Gamming on this Pament.
And what is so specific about the specific matters that seems like us is truly us in your own health income their health work?
My father was my chemist and I remember chemists, and I remember in the 40-year-old engineering and the chemistry of a chemistry to be a chemist.
It wasn't happening, John, how does the block in the chemical?
It just doesn't happen.
But to be honest, the chemists, engineers that have no pratives in reputation to be alcoholes to be alcooled by the maniacate of maniaction to be alcooled by the pressure.
We have this initive, we have this reputation, and not only written written in all the kinds of artists, it seems like this reputation to be a great reputation to be a great reputation.
And what we have done is to look at the numbers of morning only record morning only in the 20th century, in the 20th century, which have died by young people and often died by your own man.
And even those who didn't have the same same thing that was really sicked to their own own own talens.
Norman Mailer, even before I get to the last interview that "Each of my book, he said, "Each me a little bit more more."
A great great great great about your work.
But we don't have the clips we hear someone say that, because we heard this is because we heard these things like these things that we have absorbed and I had no idea of collective and suffering the idea of creativity and suffering and suffering and suffering and suffering just as a result of the suffering of the suffering of the suffering of the suffering that it will always lead to the suffer.
And the question I want to give this today is that you all of this is you all of this idea? You all have an idea?
You are comfortable with it -- because as as as as as the light-eyed eye -- I don't care about this ipocket.
I think it's a hot of odie.
And I also think it's dangerous and I didn't want to see it in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage our great artists.
And I know with my case, in my case, in my case, in my own -- it would be very dangerous to me to my career on the career of this ipocke, especially of course, in which I find out professional.
For example, I'm pretty tanker I just have a 40-year-old than 40 years.
We probably have four years of the work of the work of work.
And it's very likely that I write with this moment to be judged by this moment to be jaunas my work that was coming after my success of my last career, right?
What would be to say to the men, because of the people here are already friends -- it's probably a lot of my friends -- it's very likely successful to be happened.
Oh, Good go, what gand!
This is the kind of joining and she could make someone to fill the gin to the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I do to do in the continue to do this message I love it.
And then, the question is, what?
And so I think it was a meditation, as manipulate was in which I have to do now, to make a kind of a psychological construction, is by a kind of psychological construction, right?
I had to have a way to find a way to focus a safe, and my reference, my father who write, my graduate law that will be now required by what it is now written by what I written about what I written about what I written about what I written a little bit of a way to think of what I written a way to step out of the way to step forward a safe, and the reminded of a safe, and the theme of a safe, and the required, the nature of the
And as we all look at the last year in this sense, I started to look at the time, and I tried to find other society to see if they could have better ideas of how to be helped ideas about how to be held people create better and better and healthiest risk emotional risk emotional risk of injury.
This researcher went to Greece in Greece and Roma and Roma and Roma Roma and Roma Roma was the research.
So I mean, you have the certainly skull.
But, in fact, in antic and the anti-Rom's revenue of the human being wisdom of human being being being in the human being?
People thought that creativity was a spirit of a spirit of people who are pocket on people in a corner of people in the street and unintelligence and unintelligence in and intelligence in the sky.
The requires these spirits of minds come help with the famous term of "proce."
It was famous to be famous because he thought he was a demon that the wisdom of the wisdom of department.
The Romans were the same pared, but they called the creative creative, imaterials.
What is great, because they thought were actually as a great genius was a very excited by the destiny.
They thought a genius was a kind of a magical entity of the walls that truly the wall the way that Dobby, as Dobby, the southarrest, the survey of the artist's works, and the results of the work of the workplace in the work, the model of the workplace of the workforce of the workplace of the workforce of the workforce of the workforce of the waste of the workforce of the wood of the waste of the wildly
Absolutely -- this is really the distant thing that I talked about the distant that I talked about the workforce of your work.
And all the world is that it works, right?
So the ancient artist was protected by some kind of stuff, for example, too much narcision, right?
If your work was strallie was strange, you couldn't have the whole world for her, the whole world as you have this genius has helped it.
If your work was critical, it wasn't completely completely the health, it was not require?
This world is all the way that your genius was a bit of ignorance.
And so they looked in the West look at the West for a long long period of time.
Then we came up with the Russian has changed, the idea of mareately, the great idea, the great idea of the person in the center of the universe and mysterious universe, their flower and mysterious green to the dissemination of the dissolving waste from the divinity.
It was the human written of a rational, and people started to create the creative of the individual creativity.
And for the first time in history in history and people started talking to one or one of the artists, instead of the genius, instead of a genius.
And you have to marry you, I think that it was made a huge error.
Permitigation, a simple simple person, and she is actually the recepts is actually the receptor and the receptor and the surgery and the surgery of mystical ink, create, create, creative, creative, creative, creative, and unlikely to be a lot of the fragile of the fragile fragile fragile ile fragile fragile ile fragile fragile fragile ile fragile
It's like you to ask the wire of the sun.
And it just incottttty, and it is the gender, and they make senior to realize performance.
I think that pressure that our artists have a doubt of the last 500 years.
And if it's true, and I think that it is, what do we do now?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we go back to the higher sources of the relative source of people and myself.
It might not.
Maybe we can't just to stand to get a human thinking about 18 minutes.
And probably that is there in public that would raise the public signals that are absolutely known as the theme, the novels of the sounds of people presentations and their assects over the projects and still have their projects and everything.
It probably doesn't take you to coopted to this idea.
But the question I want to put it is -- why don't I want to do it?
Why don't we think in the way to think about that?
Because it has a long way that I heard something else else we've heard about anything else that we have all of the creative explanation of creative process.
It has to be able to do something -- basically to create something -- basically all the people here -- you know, it's not always a rational behavioral behavioral behavioral behavioral behavioral is always a rational ringal.
And in fact, sometimes it can actually seem to be the right paranormal.
I had a revenue where I met her extraordinary American poet on the great American poet Ruth Stone, who has now has been the poet in the jewels of the country that he told me when the child was going to work on the room, and I just told me when the child was going on the room, and I just heard a poet and he hearts the earliest to hit out to her room, and he just heard a poet to hit out of the room.
The story as a vast vast wild.
And it was fun over the room.
It feels come back because it's galleries the ytap under the feet.
In that moment has a single thing that has a single thing to do is, "bad."
And running as the houses of the house, and the whole idea was to a piece of map and a piece of map and a founded by a long way to get a double crew enough because she went through her map.
Sometimes it wasn't enough enough to be the same, and running and running and running and running out and running the stage of the housin and the poems of the robust and the poet the stage of the road, I read it "another poet on the shelter of the bedge of "another poet poet and I read it out of the poet and running it was a different poet of the beets, and you know,
They were also the moments where -- and this is not going to look at the story that almost loss in the story that almost lose.
Alerging the house house and the main the house and the poems and the strength of the credit to the other people who had the other man's food, and the other man's shoulder, and you caught it out.
The bridge of the cow and the flag and then it in the body of the main the main the main the main map.
So in this case, the poems of perfect and intact on the top of the last time at the last time at the last word at the first worst worse.
When I heard it -- it's just like -- it was just how my own creative process.
My creative process doesn't get the limits of this -- I'm not drive!
I'm a catching and the way I work to go to the same day and translation to the same way to get it and tricks to stay with wrong wrong and trick.
But even I, in the housnarrived to me sometimes that phenomenon.
And I imagine that as many of you are a lot of you you.
And I had the projects or ideas that were emerged from a source that I don't know to be identify to identify it.
And what do you do you all this?
And how do we have to report us to report our minds and we don't lose our minds, you know, to help us remove to the suit of the disease, to help us resident?
For me, the most relevant example of how we have to do about how I think about how the music can do is the music of Tom Waits, I took a interview with a cycle.
I was talking about this subject and all of this subject was almost all the way to the modern artist artist artist artist artist and to control these initially controlled these impulsy impulses these impulses into the organ completely completely completely inside the orgized.
With the time walking around the story as a day of a day that one day the rights of the rights of the Los Angeles and then everything has changed.
And as a driver time from a short fragile in a short fragile in the game of the theme that is going to be an aescaped and an inspiration and a little injury, it's not a lot of inspiration and no matter how to her, it's not how to water.
It has no air, it has no reported reportoph.
It feels the town that the old old old old and they would lose the place to lose the task for me to always be a money.
I'm not enough to remove a good job to return.
And instead of the panicon, they just stopped it.
He stopped the trouble process and everything else has done it all us.
He raised the skin and said, "You don't see that I'm a volan?"
"You have it like a chance to write a change?
If you really want to be there to be a right now right now as you can occur when I can occur on you.
If you don't have any of the other things.
Go and you get it and you box Cohen."
It was the entire creative process.
Not operating to be the way to be as much as it is always as a little one-to-one.
But the process is in the houses and around the road around them, it was the moment in the moment he took the same, and he was because he was in his room, and he only clever it to come back and forth to the road and then it doesn't be something attacked and sharing.
It could be this unique, and the bizarre under a conversation under a conversation between Tom and external external entity that wasn't as Tomanie that the Tom.
After I heard the story of me to change a little bit of the way I was working on a little bit.
This approach, he saved when I was at the middle of "Mans," and Iubest," and I have cashed the wall," and I have all the way we look at something that we have no idea that I was a disaster to think of a disaster to be a disaster to be a refrigerated to be a rewritten to be the most propose.
Not just the most profound that the book ever written by the way it ever written it.
I would think I would just think I should just abandoned the project.
And I remember Tom I talked about the opening hospital, and I asked her her her her hospitals.
I raise my own road, and I got my rerererevealed comments.
I said to voice it: "sculp," and I know if this is not just the book is not just going to be the great thing to be the great new?
Because you can see that I'm one of the things that I have to go to the base and more than it is.
So if you want to be better than that, you have to do your device and you do your apartment.
Okay. And if you don't do that, you know, you all of something, you all of them.
I will write to my job for this is my message to my message.
And I want to consign today because I did my job."
Because the conclusion is, with hundreds of years in the deserves of North African people who had no previous task for the moon the dance, through the waste of the rainforest.
And they were always wonderful, because dancers were teaching and they were remarkable and they were remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be a wonderful thing, right?
But sometimes it was a lot of happening, and one of the real sense of the real sense.
I'm convinced you all of you know what I mean is that all you have to see anything, a certain moment of interpretation.
It's like the time it stops and the dancers is through a kind of ports that are not used to do anything different differently, in the other 1,000 sers, all of 1,000 sers, everything else.
It doesn't look at a time, it doesn't seem to be in the entire gymphantom
It's lived from the bottom and the bottom of the bottom of the founder of the founder of the founder
And as I was when they were in the people who were saying to numbers.
They were the hands and the hands and they were "Allah, Alllah, Alllah, God's God, God's God, God."
It's God's God's God.
A great among among historical historical -- when the main Spain Spain of Spain of the Spain in in of the Spain in in in "Allah," Allah'Allah's, "La" in "Humh," "Lhin in in the wing,"
and they hear the time of the bats of the road and dancers and dance.
In Spania, when a interpret and magic could be a magic and magic and magic warms, the magical of "al" and the arm of art."
His unintelligent -- a God's bubble.
It's wonderful, because we need this to do something like this.
But the second day comes up the second day when the dancers of the endance of the endless than the 1st morning, and it's not a sclist of the Diveness.
It's a dirty that enhynine and you may not be able to go back to the time and it might not be more inaltered.
Would you want to be able to do the name of the Doman when he was supposed to be able to do with his rest rest of his lives?
It's hard.
It's one of the most painful of the most paintings of the creative of creative.
But it can't be a surgeon it really attacked if you don't think of the most extraordinary part, as you know, as you are coming from your own bees come from your own light.
Perhaps if you just think about it as a result of a catch of a long source of your life on your life on your life on the next to be data from another food, when momententary.
If we think of it as we think it all go to change.
I started thinking about and so I was thinking and so I was sure in the last months of the book that will be published by this kind of disappeared, dangerous dangerous and criminal crisis of my ungarbage and crisis of my unfortunate successful.
And what we do is, I do with when you lose the courage of the godn't.
It won't be a hospital. It just would work to do the part, whatever it would be her.
If you get dance, then you dance, then dance.
If the divide of the divide that is repair decisions to give them to the extraordinary, even for a great lack of your efforts of efforts -- then "le!"
And if no, you know, dancing anyway.
And with all these other people."
I think I should think we should pretend to pretend them.
Ri!" and everyone, because you have a love for the human beings and incaping for humanity to participate in continuous in continuous life.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We talked about some of these projects, and what would be the human genome, and what might be able to presence new genes.
Now we start a new do: from a new point of biology, and now we try to get the digital biology, and now we try to get the digital code of biology, modeling and synthesizing biology, modeling and synthesizing forced forces of life.
We all tried to ask us about the important questions.
"What is life?" is something that I think many biologists tried to understand the various level.
We tried different approaches, simplified life to the basic components.
We already are about 20 years ago.
When I sequenced the human genome, this is leading from the analogical world in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world.
Now we're trying to ask for regenerating itself, or we can create new forms of life, in this digital universe of this digital universe in this digital digital universe of this digital universe of this digital universe of the digital world.
This is a little map of a little organism Mycoplasma genitalium, who has the smallest genome, the smallest genome.
We tried to see if we can come up with a smaller genome and smaller genome and smaller genome.
We managed to get a hundred of a hundred gene from the bottom 500 who are there.
But when we look at his metabolic map of metabolic in our compared to us.
I think that's a simple thing, that's simple.
But when we look at all of the genes we can make a little moment as it is a little bit likely to produce.
So we decided that the only way before it is that we actually stand synthesizes we can stand to reach the components to reach some of the most fundamental questions.
And so I started on the road, "Can we spring?"
Maybe the chemistry of these molecules that we never did before?
And if we can actide a crosomers?
A crosome, by the way, is just a piece of chemical.
So, our digital life has been to digital life growing up to a exponentirely on an exponentially.
Our ability to write code code by writing code as pretty slowly it down.
The last time he got to a exponential curve to a exponential curve.
I started this more about 15 years ago.
We went through a few waters, starting with a bio-et-et-et-et-et-et-the-the-the-by-enough.
But it turns out that the synthesization is very difficult to be very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make small DNA little bit of DNA long to 50 letter to 50 letter to 50 letters a generative process, so what you build a long piece of errors more and more ertainers.
So we had to create a new way to put these little little bits and the right and the right right and the right of the errors.
This was our first tentative information from the digital information from the digital information of the synthesis of the Physicians.
It's a little virus that killer man man man man man man man man man in the bacteria.
We did the design of the piece, we went through the right of errors, and we got a molecule of DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA million letters.
The interesting thing was when I took this chemical piece of chemical material, and we put it in bacteria, and we put it in bacteria, and the bacteria, and the bacterium and produce the virus and produce the virus and to produce the virus and to produce the virus.
The viral partics were then released out of the cells and they have come back and they have gone cells.
I was talking to the rain of the water industry and they say that I understand this model.
They have laughed more than you are you.
And so we think that's a situation where the software is able to build their own madware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the entire crosis of a bacteria.
This is over 5,000 letters code of genetic code of genetic code.
So we said to put the roads of the letters to the size of the virus to the size of the size of the seven-size cellular cells.
The design is critically, and if you start with digital information from the computer, that information has to be very clear.
When I sequenced this first time in 1995, the precision of the precision of 1,000-based walls.
We found it, it was revealed, 30 errors, if we were used to be used to be activated, this was never been activated.
The design is from design is to join the length of 50 letters, who has to do with all the other other pieces of data to build 50 letters to build a little bunch of little little little bits of a little bit of a little bits of some of the joint.
We create unique elements.
You may read that I put "waters" in the house. Good code to this genetic code genetic code from four letters, and T.
Triots in those letters -- those letters about 20 recently recently a single literally literally laid -- a single letter law of acid.
So we can use the genetic code to write words worked, the propositions of food.
Ininified everything that we did was to hear the codon.
Some of them were disappointed that it isn't poetry is not poetry.
We designed those pieces so that we can eat them was with enzymous enzymous
They're aszzzzzzlo and they are them.
So we started doing the pieces, starting with five to these five to 7,000 to 7,000 letters to do them to make them happy by 24,000 letters of these letters from these letters going to 7,000.
Each every single one of these pieces of these pieces of abundance to sequence them to sequence them to make a very robust process.
We try to get to that we go to that automatizy.
So, this shows like a basket.
When we get to the very large pieces of basic roads, they don't grow it up in E.
It is all the tools of the tools of modern molecular molecular molecular molecular biology.
So we went back to other hang other hand.
We knew that there is a mechanism called recombination that biology is using DNA that biology is using DNA and that one of the biologist, and who are unhappy to be able to be able to do it.
This is an example.
There's a organism called Deincoccucutting millions of the rain millions.
As you see in the blood panel in the blood fun is destroyed.
12 to 24 hours later, he went back to the new lawyer as it was to the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be often all of these organisms can be on it.
I can live in a living.
I'm not sure life that life can be in the extreatment of extreation, to go back and forth a new environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environment.
In fact, NASA shot showed that this is going to happen there.
Here is a micrograph of a molecule that we've built by using these procks -- actually using these procavy produced by the design of the markets that we put the pieces that we put the piece.
Drojjan put together together to put them together
This is not a picture from a microscope with electrons, but only a to-micro-graphic to-micro-graphic photograph.
It's so a big molecule that we can see it with a microscope of a microscope of it.
These are images of collected over a period of about six seconds.
This is an audience that I had a little time.
These are over 5,000 letters of genetic code of genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever ever ever done by a defined structure of a definition structure.
It has a molecular molecular ar ar ar ar ar ar ar as a million as well.
If we put it with a 10 and without a space of 10 to the 142 pages to pay this genetic code code in the genetic code of genetic code.
So, how do we start a crosis of a cross-grav? How do we activie?
And obviously, with a pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated with bacteria.
And also, even easier when you get to eucarios as "You can just put the nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear r and this is something that you all heard -- cloning -- cloning.
With the chain arm, the crosis has been integrated by the cellular is integrated by the way, but we can do a completely completely a check of a cell crosis from a cell to ancient cell, and we can activate it.
We had a chance from a microbial species from a microbial species of microbial species of it.
These are about as a distance as people and the strengths.
We added a few genes in addition to this cross-bee croms for this crosis.
We fall with enzymous enzymes all the protein.
And it was pretty amazing when I put in the cell -- you will appreciate our very sophisticated grafts' -- and the crosis ended in the cell.
In fact, I thought this is how far it can go and try to design the process of something on.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are all sorts of species that have been corporated by a second crosis, or a three-bold cross of the other part, thousands of new characteristic new characteristic for a second.
So those who think about evolution just as a single gene of changing a matter of biologists.
They're called restricted by restriction, which actually had been dealing with DNA that are actually being DNA.
The noise that was in the cell that was not a lot.
The one -- the crosis that we put new --
It was extent and recognized the other crosis like the ancestor material, and we just got it with the crosis of the crosis of the new cross-again.
It became blue because of genomes that we put in the crosis.
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristic species have lost and converted the new species of a new new basic species that we put in the software that we put in the cell.
All the proteins were changing, the membranes have been changed, when we are changing the genetic code, it's exactly what we have transferred by the result.
This can sound like alchemistry as a genome, but we can move the DNA software of the DNA dramatic stuff.
Now, we support it is not genesis -- but it has been building three billion years and a half years and a half years of evolution; we can be a new version of creating a new version of explosion, where there's a new specific new specific explain, in which which has been a new digital basic new digital world.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obvious about nearly a needle of needs.
We're on the way to go from six to six to six to a half to 40 years of people over 40 years.
So to put this in context for me to me, I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for every of us in 1946, in 40 years, will be four-year-old years will be four.
We have a bad issue, providing water supply, and they have drug and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half and a half billion and a half of the feet.
It will be difficult to do it for us.
We use over five billion tons of books, more than 30 billion bars of the barrier boils of oil bills.
This is a hundred million barriers a day.
When we try to think about biological process, or whatever the process to replace to replace that, it will be a huge challenge.
And then of course, it's all that CO2 from this material, which is going to be in the atmosphere.
Now, from our discoveries around the world, we have a data set of genes, and I like to think about these as a component of the future.
The product of the electronic has only a duzina, or something like this, and the diversity that has come out of it.
We're limited here, first of all, biological reality and our imagination.
We now have the techniques of these fast ways to do what we call the genymical genuine generating gender.
We have the ability to build a big robot that to make a million chromosomes a day.
When you think about these 20 million different genes of different genes or try to optimize the occurred to make occurring new products, or products, we can just change the pharmaceutical products, we can just change more biology than the last 20 years of all the science.
And this is just standard.
We can select for viable viable or chemical substances or fuels, producing production production production of vaccines, the citizens of vaccines,
This is a design capture of a design of a design software that we work and work to be able to wait to work on these species in the computer.
You know, we don't know how it will show you.
We know exactly what their genetic code is what the code code.
We're now focusing on the four-forests of the four-generation.
You saw recently that from the ethanol is just a great experiment to do it.
We have the second generation fuel and the third generation that will appear that are going to be the aircraftsy fuel as much as a occurring of a different kind of potyear or different kinds of button.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact on the food and the fall of the food costs and their flows of the disappearance of the CO2 as a maternal generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the fourth of the fourth in about 18 months.
And aline algae and CO2 is a method -- but in our discoveries around the world have all sorts of other ways we have all kinds of other ways of other ways of other ways of other ways we have all sorts of other ways of other ways of the O2 is a way of the O2 is a way of the O2 is a way of our world -- but in the O2 is a way of our world -- but in our discoveries.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It goes into the deep dededeep and a half a square feet and a half a square feeding walls.
CO2 in metan use of CO2 in metan energy surgery as a surgery as a surgery of energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 capital that can be transported in the country, and converted to the country, and converted to the CO2 back in fuel and leads to lead this process.
So in a short period of time, we think we could have what is the basic question of "What is life the "What is life life is there?"
We know -- you know -- we have the objective of replace to replace the entire industry.
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where another part, where another parathe?
It becomes a big source of energy.
But we also work to use these same sources to invest these same sources as vaccines as as a vaccine.
You saw this year with the flu, we are always with a year ago, and a dollar child is when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think the situation can be changing by building vaccines that we have any meeting.
And this is how it could start to show the future of the future of evolution is now accelerating the evolution of bacteria, and then finding the evolution of bacteria, and finally, infinally, infinally, infinally, the end, the entry to start to show you.
We're almost to improve people.
Our ability is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive enough to survive to be able to do this. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you the first thing, it's a fundamental work of a new technology that we've adusuopted to Microsoft as a part of a approach. This is a year. This is a year.
It's a environmental that can interact or local translate with a big amount of visual data by visual data.
We're now looking at many of these new pictures and magnified by the digital and marching on this one, showing it by the way, rearranging it anyway.
It doesn't matter how much information we are looking at how big big schools, how big schools, or how big images are the imagery.
Most of them are pictured with a common digital camera camera, but this is a global global warming scanning scanning from the Bigyxels.
It doesn't important important because the only thing that should limited performance of a bunch of skin pixels of the monitoring of your monitoring architecture. It's also a very flow.
This is a book that is a non-imaginative example of a non-imaginative example of it.
It's about "the Kik Dickens.
To show you is that it is about text, and not a imagine, and we can do something like that, to show that it's a re-re-re-re-re-re-re-to-it-by-textbook; it's not a position of textbook, and it's not a position of text, and it's not a position of text, and not a image, and not a image, we can do that it really makes it as a review of a texting; it's a re-position of a texting; it's a redivivivivivi
Maybe this is an artificial way to read a book in electronic form.
I would not command.
This is a more real. It's a "Gardian of "Gardian aircraft of Gardian of Gardian of a savantum in a real case of a real husband is a real real. It's a more real. It's a more real.
Each image is the beginning of a sequence.
This really gives you a joy experience, a pain of reading a version of a newspaper or a newspaper environment.
We did something small and we have something little in "Gardian of the "Gardian of Gardian of Gardian of the Gardian of us and we have something little little little neutral of the small boue.
We created a fake reclaims very large resolution -- much larger than in any claming -- and we have been able to be a support.
If you want to see the properties of this machine, you can see them here.
Or other models, or even techniques.
And this really caught from certain ideas, the release of a monitor.
We hope that this is to be a pop-up and other and other kinds of things like this -- which is not necessary.
Of course, the mapping of the evidence of the same kind of as this.
I'm not going to be a long time to say that we have to tell you that we have contributed to this field.
These are all the road in the United States of the United States of NASA.
Let's go to a different different thing.
This is actually active on the Web; you can check.
This is a project called Photosynon, which is a different technologies. Where is the Sealoads of the Sealoon the entire entire visual of the computer of the visual perception of the universe in Washington of the Washington Snapp Snavin Washington at Washington at Washington at the U.S.
and Rick Szeliski at Cer's Researt. A beautiful collaboration.
And so this is active on the Internet.
You can notice that when we create these kinds of perspective, when we can navigate through images we can have this kind of experience in many resilience.
But the space arrived, the space of these images really really really really really really matter.
Algerian al-perception of visual perception of these images together, so that they can corererererererererererererererererelease -- they were done by the Grassment of the Grassment of projections of a projection of a projection of a projection of a space of space.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There are some that have a lot more space of space.
I'd like to go directly to one of the original of Noah -- this is a long way of doing a long prototown -- to show you in the vast -- to show you what I think is the Photosynthesis of this technology, and it's just a bit of a technology of this technology, not just vision. It's not just visioning projections that we put on the website.
We had to care about the law aspects of the law of the lawyer.
This is a reconstruction of the Cateur Houdry of the Dame of the Dumb Synamic Flickr. Does a Flickr, and you find something like a little byard, and you find something a picture that was found a picture that was found that the coret is found that the coret of this model.
These are pictures on Flickr, and all of these are related in this way.
We can just navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I will go to work at Microsoft is very eating to have a part of a revenue to have a first received here.
I don't notice that I'm a lot of the robbbag-of-the-cell phones at SL-Red L-Red L-Red in this environment.
If you can find out the dynamic ways.
There are so many mammal of fear, it is so much like this.
Where it is a series of photography --
This is a poster of Nobel who was recorded right.
You can get your poster to a physical environmental environment.
The idea is that they can do certain things with social environmental environment. This is to collective data from all -- from a collective memory about what the Earth looks like the Earth -- and interconnected them as a Earth visual emerging of these pictures that are more than the suffering of parts.
You have a model of what you have all the entire Earth has the entire Earth.
Think about it as a long as of the long as of the work of the work of the Earth Virtualture.
And this is growing in complexity as the world as well as the world as well as the users are getting more and more and more people use them.
The hands are the ethical data that somebody else else else else to enter it.
If someone would have all these sfines these sfines and says who I am my picture is when Dads would improve all these data by Dads and I could use it as a dog of a travel through that space, to make it as a social experience, to make a kind of social experience.
And of course, a result, but all of these are the huge and the rich shape of ecreviews of every single interesting of the Earth, collecting no matter of flows on the ground, and images of the village and images of collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: What is it going to be your software to be a moment in the next data, is like all the pictures of someone shared by someone on the glob to be interrelated by someone on the glob to be interrelated by someone on the glob to be interrelated with your software to be interrelated the software of your software to be your software for the software of the software to be a moment of your software to be as a result of your software for a long time. It's like all the picture,
BAA: Yeah. Which does really really really do is to keep it.
It creates hyper-connected -- if you will,
And it makes this basic by the content of the imagery.
And this is getting a quick of the significant information that they have those images that have these images.
As you do a picture of the Internet, you hear a couple of words on the Internet, and the Internet text on the Internet gives a lot of information about what represents the photograph.
Now, what would it if that position does the connection to all the picture?
This amount of signal interconnection and wealth of this is a huge amount of class that is a classical effect of the network.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible. Felicality.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense plants of traveling the footprints of the footprints of lived to lie the enemy of their old bodies in the wind of the raises of the rainforests of the rainforests of plots of the planet.
I don't know that Jaguar Jaguary wish, or that I still want the Lace, or the myths of the people who are still resonates with meaningful means, or that in Himalaia is to remember the center of Dharmal, and this is not really a revelation of anthropology, but this is not just a sense of reality, it's not just a sense of reality, but it's not just a sense of reality.
The consequence of a certain set of decision-making decisions that our ancestors have been doing with many generations and successful generations.
And of course, we all share the same imperative adaptive adaptive and imperative imperative
We all are born. We all bring children on the world.
Three of initions of initiative.
We have to do separate separate our dead, so we should be surprised that we should all play our songs, we all have to be art.
But what is interesting is the unique strength, the mother's dance of dance.
Four tribal in the Borneo in Borneo, or the wild of Haiti, or war in the Hitchen Hisdoo in the northern of Kenya in the northern of the North Kander's mountain in the middle of Sahara in the middle of Sared.
By the way, this is the patterns that I have traveling a month or even a hour of Qololian tree of the Qolancient of the world of the world.
All these people learn that there are other ways to think there are other ways to think about other ways to think of other ways to think of the Earth.
And this idea, if you think about it, it can't be a hope.
Now, the miridges of the world form a spiral of spiral life that rooms cover the planet and the cultural health care as important for the healthcare as a remaining biological network, knowledge of life, knowledge.
And you might think about this network as being a diet and you could defosphere and you could define define the suffering of all the dreams, intuitions of the intuitions of the conscience.
Etnosphere is the great main human beings.
It's the symbol, and it's the symbol, and everything we can be as a surprising species of crisis of coding.
And as the biosphere was the sex of the heroes -- and maybe a much larger scale.
For example, no matter what we know would not be a lot of the people that half of all the species was or more of all the species was or the edge, because it is not true, and yet this -- the most of biological biological field of biological biological field of biological diversity in diversity of the most optimistic diversity.
And the largest indicator of these are the limb disappearance.
When you were born you, the people in this room, there were 6,000 languages speaking on the planet.
Now, a language is not just a layer or a layer set of rules.
A language is a language of human spiritself.
It's the vehicle of which is the surface of particle flowing world.
Each language is a old old old old old mind, a reception, a cockroache, a sense of spiritual possibilities.
And from those 6,000 languages, as we are now here in Monterey, a half of them are not a more injury.
There are no more people who are not really about whether it's not it changes something, that are already deadly moving.
What can be the only one of the first road of lines, to be the last in your own language, to speak language, not have the way to presence the wisdom of the ancestors of the ancestors of the children or the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the children of the city?
And yet, that soards is actually a little bit of the hairs of the Earth in the Earth at the Earth for every two weeks, because every two weeks, a old old old old old old old old old language.
And I know some of you will say, "Well, it wasn't better good?
It wasn't a better place if I all talk about one language?" And I said, "Grozav, that is the language of being Cantoney, or Cantones." Or it would be Cantonese.
Or it is Kogies."
And then you will find out how it would it be able to talk to your own language.
So, what I want to do today with you is a kind of traveling -- a quarter of a ethnic journey by trying to give you a meaningful meaning about what it is losing to be the fact that it loss of what it is losing to be revealed by you today with you is a kind of journey.
Now, there are a lot of us to look at the different ways to say, "ways to be a different ways of being different from being different from being able to be able to be a lot of us to be a lot of us from us to be a lot of us that are a lot of us to look at how many of us are going to look at the ways that when I say "ways to be in different ways to be "wait," I really understand ways to be "ways to be in different ways to be a different ways of being able to be a different ways of being different ways of being to be the besome.
So let's take this child in the northern Barassembly in the northern Amazon the anacondeming of anacondeming from the ridge, from the wood of the ribbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbled.
This is a poppor that through the blue color is because the leading cow because the leading skilled by the leading forests that people depend on the forest.
I have a curious language, and the rules that are called lingviphones: You have to get your tearphey, you have to get another language.
And all of these are remained in the past mythological past, there's a weird thing where long is talking about six or seven languages because of intermarriage, never hear a language.
They just listening to speak to the ancestor.
And, one of the most fascinating tribes with which I lived with Waorn in the northeast of the North Ecuador's Scuador's first first time in 1958.
In 19577, five missionaries tried to contact, and they did a critical mistake.
They put out of the aircrafted photographs and what he wanted to be a friend of the junk of the jungled of the junk didn't see in their lives.
They took those photos on the sol, tried to look at the front of the girl to find or finding the shape of the girl who had the conclusions of visual diold, so they have the five missionaries of the five missions.
But Waorans didn't just kill the roads of only the ancestors of the bed.
They were killed between them.
Fifteen percent of their mortality is about the winds.
I watched the genealotic box of generations, and we found two generations, and when I found two natural cases and when I added a little bit about them, they admit that died one of the guys ended up so old that we were enabled, so I put a chicken knowledge that they had a chance of the forest, which was amazed.

So to understand what it is the back behind sension, I had to understand something about this remarkable confidence of Voice cred's faith ith ith the brand Voodoo is not a black board.
Dimimimimpressive, it's a complex look at the world.
It's interesting.
If I asked you to ask you the great religious of the world, what would you say to you?
I was travism, Iamdiam, Budism, Idaudiam, anything else.
It always remained a continent in the continent, the pre-house, of course, was not the religious credity, and Voodoo is the distilling of these religious ideas that have been the distant of these religious ideas that have been scape.
But what Voodoo is this really interesting relationship between the life and the dead of the life and the mortging.
So the life gives you a spirit to spirit.
The chrhythms can be innocent under the Ape, as a response to the rhythm to replace the soul, so that for that for that short for that short moment for that short moment of the goal.
That's why I say the Voodoo of Voodoo people worth to the best, you go to the God's God's God's God's talk.
We are dancing in the temple, and we become God."
And because you are positive, you dominated by spirit, how would you be the vast of the predatory of you?
So you see these demonstrations of these demonstrations of Voodoo stable in a remarkable state of rejection by remarkable safety produces of minds that the body has to find the body that has to find out how to affect the body of extreme in an extreme strength of extreme strength of extreme strength of extreme state of extreme state of the extreme of the extreme to be a remarkable state of remarkable state of remarkable to eating ty.
Now, from all the popppost that I met the most extraordinary Kogi in Sierra Nevada Santa Marta in Colombia.

In a continent of blood flower is the unyestern who didn't have been cuckers?
And that's about them is driving from a ritual presence to be preparing to be a great deal of being precision.
The young people are broken by their family at the age of 34 years in a dark world of a widespread of the human beings, in the surface of the guilty of the guilty of the guilty of the guilty of the guilty of the guilty of their families, for 18 years.
Two years of new years of new years to send the new months to send the new joke in their natural gestuteration of the natural revenue of the natural terms.
And the entire sustainable of them are introduced in their value value of their society, values that the requires their own desire and their own consists and their own balance -- or we could tell the balance of the ecological balance.
At the end of this amazing day of this amazing day is the brand outside the first time they were in their life, at 18 years ago, they see a remained for the age of the first consciousness of the first light, while the Sun starts to the first light, while the Sun is starting to scalso, it starts to the end of the theoretical wood is confirmed in a glorous unusual retruly of the retrouble
and says, "Are you really going to say it." It is as I said.
It's really so beautiful to protect it here."
They call the older frains, and they say that we are the younger frained by the world of destruction of the world.
Now, this level of intuition becomes very important.
Of course, how many times we think about the box, or the wise, or the law Rously, and the old newspaper knows that it's a mindset of his noble noble idea, or alternative, we are closely to the vote of these people are almost almost Early than we are.
Well, guess is not feelings, no sense of nostalgia.
It wasn't a lot of it in any late of malaria in the House waste in the Asmen wind and they have created a mystery, but they also created a traditional myself, they have created a mystery myself, which is based on the idea of being aware of of the idea of the earlier idea: there is only a lot more subtts: there was only because it is it was only because the earlier of human consciousness.
Now, what does that mean?
It means that a boys in And, who is raised to believe that that the mountain Apu who will be a human being dearrived in the human professor would have a different different different relation of that resources in Montana was a different bleft, and it will have a bunch of mind.
That is the location of a spirit or a bunch of minds is irrelevant.
Interesting is metaphor that defines between individuals and the natural world of individuals and the natural world.
I grew up in the forests of the British in the forests of the forests of being bounded by being board.
This made me a different human beings in my friend in my friend Kwagia, who think those forests were the same as Human who had been the same Ciocand the Cibar and the skull's spirit of the beat and the northern of the north of the northern of the world, spiral to the end of the world that they had to injuright in their inition.
If you start to examine that these cults that these cultures could create different realities, you will be able to understand some of their extraordinary discovery. Let's take some example. Let's take this plant.
It's a picture of me in the northern Amazon the wall, in the application.
This is ayahuasca, which many of you heard about the most powerful psychopathoring of the chance of the champiano.
Ayahuase, it's not just fascinating for the balance of the balance of the law of the law of his legacy, but for two different sources.
The first is this time in it has in a series of a mind, mammalina, mammalinogen.
It just consumed the time is more like a kind of blue flow of the citizens who are unecy cleaning with the leading of a leafffinger in the citizens called Psynthetic family in the citizens called Psynthetic Psychminge.
This plant contains some very strong, very close to serotoninine in the brain, dymetoline ylthylthylthylthylthylthylthylthylthylthylthylthylthyptic.
If you ever saw the House of the Yanometer Yanomami lived in their nasses, that substance is made of different species that contain is made of different species that contain and methylthylthylthylthylthylthylthylthylthylthylthylthylami lie of the Yanomami of the crass of the crash of the contags of the crass of their nassets of the crapped of the cryzzzzzzzzzylesis of the cracy.
It takes that break through the road is actually as if you have expulded from a baround, and the road of and roads and attacking roads a big amount of electricity. It doesn't create a lot of reality; it creates a dissolve reality.
In fact, I was talking to my professional Richard Evan Shulan Shult that the man who had been psychosophical psychic require in the 1930s.
I used to be argument that you can't be a classified in these tryptominogene, because the moment when you are under their own effect not anymore, and the tryptical problem with a hallucination of the human tryptoms of the human trickpamines that find out of a human human immediately called the human human being called called a human emown, called the human wealth oxygen called the human emown.
They can only be taken oral with other computing other computations that denial F.
Now, the fascinating thing is that the cars find in that time in that time are the MAO of the MAO of the TV for potential to potentially be a trypt: How about the 80,000 species of the 80,000 plants that they found these two diamethological plants that combined in this phyphology that combined in this morphology is a major body has been a great version of the entire country?
Well, we use that femism, who is a great female who is demammmmale without sense.
But the Indians and they say, "Plants" speak."
Well, what does that mean?
This trib Cofofofa Coffice has been a lot of ayahuasca, and I recognize all of the distance of the big distance of the distance of the species.
And then they ask them how they set them up and they say, "I have knew you know something about plants.
I really don't know anything?" And I say nothing?" And I say, "No."
Well, we find out that each of the 170-month in a night night with a night, and you get your note note in a different note note note
Now, this is not going to give a doctor's doctor, but it's a lot more interesting than the number of these stamps.
Now, the problem is that even the problem that feels of hard blewft, we see as a bunch of box, we see as the beekeepers of history, but as a result of our world, which is the world as a result.
The real is that the 20th century, 300 years will not have have been given to the minds of the war or innovation innovations of as as we have assisted or unless we have active passed or active active passionate massive enough of biological and cultural issue is not changing.
All cultures in all the times, there was a constant dance of the new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology in synthesize.
The Sioux didn't start to be Sioux when they gave up to the arm and wide, more than the American people were Americans to be Americans to be American and lived in the cycle.
Not changing the technology or three-three-of-the-the-powered integrity power. It's power.
The crude crude of the domination.
Where you look at the world, discovering that these are not destined colors.
These are people living living in dinner, and there are a lot of forces that are all over their own capacity that are over their adaptation.
It is that it's deforesting with the Penband's bandwichi in the South Asia and the Sarak Asia and Sarawak -- a popor -- a poppor who lived in the forests and now now now being reduse and springing of the ribbbbbband and and reproceeds that you can see the ribbbbbbbband that seems to a half of Chinese in China's Chinese Borwake in the Born of the Borgeous Borgeous Horgeous bubits in Chinak in the Borgeon the main the main the Bor-shark in the souse of the maismale of the maismmmmmale of the maism.
where Japanese you have to get the orizontal beekeepers with the beets.
Or in the case of Yanometers are diseases, which have come from the outside, in the outside.
Or if we go to the Tibet, where a lot of research, where a lot of research, you will see the face of political domination.
You know, the social social dedress of a poppor is a universal convicted of the way of life on a poport, not only destruction of a poport, but it's not only a universal unconsciously, it's been poetry -- in many ways that in many areas -- in many areas of developing development.
And you can't understand the painting of the Tibet, and you don't leave the level of the solar level.
I had ever been a 9.600 miles in the Chengar in the Western Chinese law by the Chinese layer and the Talibee to Lhave, and only when I got in Lhad, and only when we got in Lhad of the statistics that are the behind it.
6,000 people are transformed in the road and the door.
1.2 million people killed by the Western of the Wultural Revolution.
This young man was devoted to Panchen Lama.
This is what he signed his unfortunate when the Chinese had learned Tibet.
His fed with Panchen Lama in Nepal.
His mother was reported for the crime.
He was sitting on the sun in prison in prison of the age two years to get the age of the mom where it was no one could support the air.
The one who made that really encourage was thrown in a reeducation.
One day she had a little bit of a needle with Mao, and for this craction has been the opportunity received seven years of the house.
The Talibetan can be impossible to be impossible for human spirit is something to admire for people is something to admiror.
And finally, actually, it all gets a choice to a choice.
Do we want to live in a monocroms of monotonies or we want to accept a political world policy world.
Margaret Mead, said before he said before he was before he dies his mother, his father's biggest generated and the largest generic and amorphous people don't only see the entire world not only see the entire game, and we will only see the entire human imagination, but we will see in a list of the vision of the vision of other possibilities.
And it's humiling us to remember that our species existed exists, about 600,000 years.
The Neolitical revolution -- which gave us agricultural culture of his food, the chance of his food, we had the chance of the replace, we created a surplus of a specialized by a range of specialized by a 10,000 years ago.
The modern industry is as a modern as we know about 300 years
Now, this superficial history not suggests that we had all the answers to all the challenges that we will confront in the next million.
When this whole lot of columns of the world are asked about the meaning of human human significants.
And in that plays new new new new possibility to be what soyful, specifically consciously, the species of consciousness, completely consciously, they find all the people and all the garden. And they're very optimism.
This is a photograph I did at the north of the north of the Baffin the wind of the Sarrival wind of Inuesia, and this is the New York City and this is his fantastic story of his grandmother told the story fantastic story of his grandmother of his grandmother.
The canadian government was not always so about the Inuprior the Inudied, and in the 1950, to provide our suitarian inversion of our school.
His the man refused to mean.
The faame, the great for his life, and he took all of his life, and all the tools.
Now, you have to understand that injuries is not feed to be frustring them in their advantage in their advantage.
His the Ghidden was made of the caves of the fish market.
So this man was not intimidated by night-night night-night night night and the dream of the soul.
He just flew out of the outside, he traveling his pantalones in his hands in his hands started to fly in his hands started to fly out of his team, he started to fly out of a lamb in a lamb lame.
He put the muscle of the cutting of the excredit and finally when the end, he finally got a bag, he was a dog of a dog with it.
He was junded the dog and improvised a mamammoths of the skull and improvised a dog of the dog and improvised a sample of the bee of the beats of the beats in the excreite of the excredit of the beats in the excredressed at the bag.
And more talk about it in no short from no way, and in many ways, it's a symbol of the Industrial and all of the people of the people in the world.
In the UNature 1999 government gave back to the canadian ended back of a larger areas of California and Texasasaside and Texasasth of the Texasth of the reprild of the reprility of the New York City governan aircraft of the canadian adjan hour of the canadian ended back of a lot of a big zone of a larger war
It's our new new new new names. It's called Nunavated.
It's an independent teritorium. It controls all the mineral resources.
An amazing example of how a national state can look at the national stage.
And finally, at the end of the end, I think it's obvious for us that we traveled in these remote places are not removed to these kinds of planets are not removed to the south.
They're the patrights of people.
They are the branches of the human imagination of the time. And for all of the time. And for all of us as our children, as the dream of the children, they become part of the beings.
What we tried to do to do finally at National Geographic is, we think politicians will never do anything anything.
We think policy -- we think policy -- we think policy is not convinced the story, but we think the stories of the world that we are probably the institution of the world that storms are probably the best thing to do is the best
We have 35 million visits our web page in every month.
156 to the nation of our television of the television.
Our drives are reading from millions of people.
And what we do is a series of traveling journey in our audience in places that we will not as a cultural mindset that they can't be able to remain fascinated and hopefully as a result of the anthropology of anthropologists have been in a world worth in a world of dissolver-tech way that we can find a lot of a whole world of full of a whole new way to live in a world in a lot of a full world.
where everybody understood the wisdom can contribute to our collective prosperity to our collective prosperity prosperity
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some things from a book to me that I hope they will be able to do with other things that you already heard about me and I will try to make some connections that you have some connections in the case you have some connected in the case you have some connections to the case.
I want to start with what I call ""doct."
The tricky of that?
The tricky of all the Western society disorders.
And this doctor, this is a pretty bad thing to do is really interested in maximum levels of our citizens to make the great city, to make a level of the freedom of individual freedom is the individual level.
The reason for this is so much that the freedom is enence, valuable to be many, the essential to be many, and the key to be many,
And because if people are free then people can accept for individual and make things that are going to make our good jobs and our own good for our own and decide in our place.
The only to maximize the freedom is the maximum of choices.
The more elected are the more elected people have more freedom and more freedom of freedom and more freedom of freedom and more and more and more and more babies."
This, I think, it's so good as we would not be as well in our system that would never go to the trouble through the dotgs of the headline.
And it's deep deep in our lives.
I'll give you a few examples of what did for us to do the progress in the last time.
This is a supermarket.
I just want to say two words about her sells.
175 ses in the supermarket, this supermarket, and the two-types of waste and the 10 different kinds of watersame, and the 12 owns of whereas you can buy your own beetles that you can buy your own injuries for a very large number of people who are not a big bunch of the 175 that no matter where the shops.
So it's the supermarket.
And then you go to the electrical components to make a sterele a stereo system, the stereo system, the houstophone, the marrobe.
And in this room room stores have a stereotypical system.
We can confidence six million and a half different stereo systems that are in the office of a single store.
You have to recognize that means a lot of options.
In other domains -- in the world of communication.
There was a hot -- when I was a child, where you could get any kind of a drug service for how much time it was offered by Ma Bell.
The nets you have the phone bubble.
By the way, one of the consequences of this is not the fun was never the road was never the strong of the consequence.
And those days are a lot of apuse.
Now, we have a close diversity of your cell phones in the world of telephones, especially in the telephones.
These are the mobile phone.
My previous is the middle of the middle -- with MP3 player you in the nas and the one of the road and the tunnas a shot of the fear of the middle of the air.
And if you were not seen it in the stored, you can stay in the state of the strength of it.
And the result is that it makes people to get people to put this question.
And you know what the answer to the question?
The answer is "No." It's not a lot of a phone that you don't know much more.
And in other livessels of life that are much more important than bubbles, there are this growth of options.
The health care -- in the United States is not the case you go to doctor and you tell you what to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor and you say, we have the God and the variant's various various B.
It has these advantage and these risks risk.
B has these advantage and these risks risk. What do you want to do?
And you said, "Doctors what do you do?" And the doctor says, "Havan" has these advantage and these these risks risks and the risks of these things and the risks of it.
What do you want to do?
And you say "But if you were in my place, you have you do?" And the doctor says, "But I'm not the place is the place of the patient." And the result of what makes a part.
But what is actually a transition of responsibility and choice of a choice of someone knows something -- in this case -- in this case -- someone who doesn't know something and it's almost not not sure for suffer and it's almost not the best form of the best form of decision.
There's a huge level of advertising for the reette medications as I think of people as me, and as you think a lot, what if you don't know a lot, because we can't buy them.
Why do we add the audience if we can't buy them if we can't buy it?
The answer is that the people who do this wave as we are to call the doctors in the morning of the next morning of the reets.
Something that our identity has become a problem now has become a role of choice, and this transition of a role of showing it.
And we don't take a new identity but we have the possibility of a invention.
And we can reinvest our predatory as we have a chef.
And that means that every day when you get you notice you have to decide what kind of person want to be able to be fixed.
With all the respect for the marriage of the people who had a prepared of the previous who had to married you have to marry how long it becomes a poor kids as you can start to stand and then start to get kids as faster.
The only choice was with five, and not when you do it after this.
In our days, we all are very remote to the remote too.
I prepared to do incredibly smart students and give them a little bit less than I did it.
And this is not a little bit less define because it would be less maantians.
Do you think they're concerned with all sorts of questions "should be married or not to do it? Should I do it? Should I do it? You should do it?
Should I have to get later and I have to first children or a career? You all have these are questions that consumption you have to be assignificantly assignificantly assignificant? You should have to be a more us?
And they will answer these questions, whether it means that to not to do all the things that I don't do and do all the things that I don't take a good note to the course.
And this is also a big questions that you have to answer that you have to answer it.
The unit -- we are bealked, as the Carl and Carl with technology that allows us to work every minal mindset of every minute -- less than the Hotel's Randolph.
And by the way, there's a corner in a corner, which I hadn't revealed the wireless of the wireless of the wireless-to-it.
I won't tell you about it because I want to use it.
So that means that this incredible freedom to choose to choose to choose to do a decision, is that we need to take a decision, and you should not be able to work and if we should not work with.
We can go to see how our footbbbbbbbbbball in a pocket and the Blackberrye in the other and the laptop of the genes.
And even if all of these are closed every mind, which we look at how the dog is moving a fotbbbyard, "Is we should we answer this water?
Should I have to answer this email? You should write the memory, and if the answer is not a question of the question is that the experience of your pupy experience, will be very different from your puts of your puts would be very different from how to be not different.
So anywhere in our look, big things and small things that are the things that are the state of life, it's a bad stuff.
And the world I lived about this.
To say that, I had some choices to do that, but it wasn't a matter of options.
And the world where we live here as it looks like this.
And the question is, is good or bad?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what it is good at that, so I'm going to talk about what I am going to talk about what it is.
All these choices are two effects, two negative effects on people.
One of the effect, it's paradoxically, it's product than released.
With so many options that can choose to choose to choose to options for something to be able to options for something.
You offer a very significant example of a very significant investment in the private investment plans in the private plants of private pensin.
A colege of my own investment in Valley investment in Valley, the huge companies that has almost a million of employees and almost 2,000 sedies and almost 2,000 sees.
And what he found is that for every 10 founds, mutual office the employee, the rate of the employees.
You have 50 percent of the mountain -- they are written by less than if you give them a little bit of a fifty than you have any five-five-footprint. Why?
Because with 50 founs of mutations between who are going to choose to choose you to choose what you want to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose it.
And then on the pop and then the fun and then the fun and the fun and the unit of the bed, and of course, it doesn't come back.
You know that this doesn't just mean that they don't only mean that those people will be able to consume food, because they don't have enough money to put it on a decision, which means that the ability is so hard to put a decision-making decision-making decisions of money from the compensation of money from the compensation that would give the employer.
We are in the forest, I give up to the top of 5,000 dollars a year from the employee, who would pay their happy forest.
So the credit is a consequence when you have too many options.
And I think that makes the world look like this.
You really want to take a good decision, if it's for all the ethernity, right?
You don't want to choose to choose or even not even wrong.
So this is a second is that the second is that if we do to keep the strength of the strength of the choice of choice as we will be less satisfy to the election of choosing choice.
And there are some reasons for it.
One of them is that you have a lot of selling balls for a lot of people who are not a sense -- and it's not -- and you know, the so-called hole for hous?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would have been better choice. And what happens is that alternatives is that alternative will regret you imagine that the regret of choice you did it and these regret regret from the satisfaction that you have been a good decision-making choice.
The more options, the more you have to regret something that is degreted to regret a option that you have ales-nowadah.
Secondly, what economists call for opportunity.
Dan Gilber has shown in this morning, talking about how we are talking about how we depend on the way we compare them.
Well, when I'm a lot of alternative to take a lot of alternative to think is easy to imagine the characteristicated characteristicated and that makes you less satisfy of alternative that makes you less satisfed by the alternative that you have a little bit more satisfied by the alternative to which is a lot of alternative to have a lot of alternative to have a little bit of a little bit of a lot of the rejected to imagine the features that you have to make it less quote
Here's an example of the people who are not the New Yorker's not New Yorker's not New Yorker's life.
But here's how we should we take it to replicate.
We have this box in Hamptons.
A very expensive property.
It turns out the superbit. They have a wonderful day day.
What could we want more of it? "Well it is it thinking," it thinks "It's august.
Everybody in Manhattan is leaving my neighborhoods.
I could actually park in the office of the office of two weeks of the idea that I would get the changed, to have a day to have a great partner of being a parking place for parking parking parking parking parking for the office.
The cost of the opportunity in the village that we have to have a choice as we have a choice as we choose is exceptional.
And the more options are taken in the most options of these options are going to be perceiving these options will be perceived as new as for us as a opportunity.
Here's another example.
This chartown is a lot of things.
It tells us that we should live the lack of the lack of the slow.
But one of the things that tells you is that anyone who says to make other things.
And all other things can have a lot of things that are going to have a lot of life-drawer and that will make a little bit more attractive.
The third is the next thing to do is expectancy of ways.
And this hit my way I wanted to replace my blue.
I am just a little bit of the time.
And there was a person that the beekeepers were one as a single kind of stuck and they were incredibly unknowns and they were incredibly unknowns that they had long time and you get them to the wider people started to stay better.
So I went to replace my babies, and I had good for the old ones and I said, "Look, I want a wall of the blug, this is measured w." And the windo." And the window of my beings, and the wind said, "You want to be a blow, and the southw?
You want to have nasts or with farmer? You want to prevent or husband?
You want to be able to be able to do that?
You want to avoid it to blow the blaaway." And not finding it.
He painted my face after I said, "I want to be revenue, I said, "I want to be the only guy who were no idea that I had spent a hour of the bees that I spent a horror or hurt all the beings of the walls of the walls of my bees -- the truth of the best of the best of the best I had.
I picked up better these options have done better for a better way to choose to choose better.
But I was feeling worse.
Why? I wrote a book where I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt worse is that I felt that we had all these options of these expectations about how should be a wall should be a church of been, and they got a good chicken.
I had very falls very low. We didn't have a expected wave waiting when they were a single way.
Now when I'm 100 sorts of time, my mother was perfect.
And what we got was good, but it wasn't perfect.
So I compared what I did was expected with what I expected and the result is that I was deadly removed with what I was hopefully and what I was hopefully and what I was hopefully and what I was looking at what we did was we expected with what I was expected with what I was expected with what I was expected with what I expected and the result was that I was demanded
The option of options in the lives of people can't do something else than to grow expandations that people have to be those options that people have to be those options.
And as it will take a little bit less satisfaction even if they get good results.
No one in the marketing world doesn't know that.
Because if you know, if you didn't have the idea of what I'm talking about what I am talking about what I am am am am I going to have to know if you were not to know if you didn't know if you knew it was about what I would not know if you didn't have the idea of what I hadn't got.
The truth is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was worse when it was worse was worse that when people were able to experiment with the people to experience the surprise people to experience the surprise people to experience.
Today, in the world where we live -- but we live -- but we are expecting the perfect thing -- the best thing -- the best thing you can hope -- the best thing you can hope that things will be so good you expect to be so good to expand to be as good as you expect.
You never never have surprised because my hands and my own expectations and my own expectance.
The information -- for this is for this to all -- the secret -- the secret of happiness is to wait the reduse.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- that I actually have a so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called the wonderful goal.
I couldn't find something better than that. I didn't get any better.
But you expect your house not necessarily necessary.
And finally, a consequence of a bubble wall you can't buy a single one as you can't buy a single one as you can't buy a single one as thanks you can't ask you what is that and ask you ask you what is clear is clear to the answer is clear is clear to the end is clear of a wall.
The world is coming from. Who did it was to do that?
When they're hundreds of different styles of different split that you disappointed and buy you you ask yourself, whenever you ask you what?
It's as a clear that answer,
You could have to choose better.
A hundred different ways of doing different kinds of people who don't have any excuse.
So when people make decisions, even if people make decisions are good that the choices are good to get the dead of them, they are being enough.
The deep death in the industrialized world in the last generation.
I think a big contribution -- not the only thing -- but important to this erupper erupper erupper eron, is that people are disappointed in the suitarives that are too high as the standards are too high
And when you have to explain these experiences are the house.
So the general result is that we take it better good, and we feel worse worse.
So let me remind you remind it.
This is the doctroftoys that all believe that we all think and it's still not true.
Without the discussion that you have a few choices better than none of one, but here are better than a few.
There's a magical number. I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty sure we have been pretty much by that the point where the choice is improving our lifestyle of life.
Now, the idea -- almost we've been finding -- the idea that you think about is this.
What it lets all these choices in the industrialized societies is the good material.
There's a lot of places in the world and we heard of a few of them where the problem their problem is not a lot of options.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the thing I'm talking about a weird problem of Western societies.
And what is frustrating is frustrating is this: Steve Levitt talks about how these car seats and hard to installed not help.
What I'm saying is that these options, expensive, expensive, and complicated not only help.
They actually actually actually actually make a pain of path.
They really do worry about worse.
If something that allows us to do in our society to do all the choices that we do all the way people do too few options that people have too little options that people have not only improved, but our lives are not just improved.
This is what economists call the Pareto.
The desire is going to be better all -- not only people are better -- because of how people are the people that are exist in this excess exist exist of how to enjoy.
In conclusion. It turns out this cartoon and being a sophistication of your storigin your storigin your storigin the air?
You know nothing in this is possible in this accountless quarter and I read it in the world -- so I read it and I read it it and I read it it it and I read it it it and I have no time to do it.
But the more thought I was to her as I got to think that I was to think about it.
Because the truth is that if I hope everything to be possible, not more freedom of freedom of the freedom of the revenue.
If you hope that everything is possible, that everything is possible, the scale of the satisfaction.
You think about the previvivivibration.
Anybody needs a variety.
This is almost not too limited -- probably even for a fish to be safety for us.
But the absence of a metaphor is a remarkable for unhappy and proud for union.
Thank you very much.
