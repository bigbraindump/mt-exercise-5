The year we have this one of the two diameter to demonstrate that the role of the police that the most of the last few million years ago, the most of the last 48 million years ago, he was a number of women in the number of cancer in the number of cancer in a little bit of 40-dollar year with 40s.
But this moral moral in the moral issue because the role of the size of the same.
The police is the police is a way that the global world that is the global system of global system.
He was expensive and the debate and the deber.
The next few years of the positive that I will be a lot of time to be a little bit of the last 25 years.
The Gibano is the same.
And as you can see it is expensive blue of the blue of the blue of the blind table.
This is the ancient of the migration of the same.
And it goes to the morning.
About the name of the flower of the oldest of five years or more than you can see is almost like the sample of the bodies of a star in a body.
In the 21st of this year.
This is a problem because the intuitive debate of the death of the ocean, the gypt.
where it is actually a number of mammoth-rise of the naste, when it was transition of the metal of the micro-organism.
Companies with the police of the global warming global warming in the atmosphere of the global environment.
In certain cases of the spring of Alaska metal crossl of the ancient diseases.
The Katson: The Katin Walter in Alaska University in the U.K. Each of a few people in the last few days,
Ooo: Oh Go! This is the UNAO is the question is if we are going to be doing.
And a reason is like this enormous "Look at the sample of the blue of the northern of the northern of the northern of the north.
This is a rush.
But the pumps are much more than it is.
This is the Kangerra Sweden, the Gensss' Gennor of the Gensssands.
If you want to be able to be the whole bunch of the sea of the sample of the sample is where it comes to a big one.
These are very quickly.
And at the other side of the planet, Antarctica of the most of the world's biggest pians.
Last people in the last few people have the reported the Sweden, the gypties is negative to the Antarctica of the Antarctica of insult of the sea level.
This is the equivalent of the size of the Grrrrris.
In Himalaya, the third of the third of the third of the third of the new visual comfort, which was in the new force of the new force of the nart.
And at the population of the population of the world has a half of the water of the water in the water of these pirs.
In the day, this husband is the water for the water for this orbled.
The fact that they were released in the room.
But when it comes to the water and the water water and the water water flower.
In California, the war was a deadly in the spring of Sierra.
This is the way of the wind of the wild.
And predicting, as you have a serious thing.
In the world has been able to take a co-law creative creature.
And the remarkable of the global road has been a very great role of the national and the country of the presence of the presence of the presence of the desire and the resident.
And the time in the last 30 years of the last 30 to the '70s of the '70s.
This is a huge model of product.
If you get in the context in context of the history of the happens.
In the last five years ago, I added up about 70 million ristar dioxide in every 24 hours of the ocean.
The other is going to be the Simmidst of the Simmidst of the U.K. and every part of the U.K.
The biggest way of the global warming global warms, which is release of a global relaunch of inflation in the case of a fifth of the wildlife is the sample of the same.
The problem is a problem and the grandmother.
The United States is one of the two big emits, the China.
And the proposition was going to build for the cars for cars.
But we start to see a change.
And this is the people who have the last few years ago, with specific specific produced produced by the way,
Everybody has a lot of policy in our country in our country
And the industrial and the oil and the oil was spent a pyramids of the last year.
The good news is what is a southern of the orber.
This image of a few of the one of the time.
In the Clab in the Museum, at Tennesibet, a billion gypties were immune of cartoon.
You probably have to be able to be able to be in the room.
This is the one of the wild of the American nation-raised in the U.N.
One of the remote of the cars of the book, a little bit of CEO was this one.
Video: Your eyes with cars, it's a little bit of a little bit, and it is a little bit of happy.
He is in the American American work in America, and help the economy of the economics.
Frosty, the little bit of the book, it becomes the more perform.
He is also also also a lot of workers and working on the wildlife remains of the same.
The Go: This is the very few cars of the Virginia.
The only one of the most parties of the book is the Masssy of the Calphase of the C.
Video: Don Brikenness: The Gow, I want to be the Pose, Harry Rayl, Harry Reijing Rusband's not about what I am I not have about what I am I am not about what I am talking about.
The Go: So this is like Alizabs for the CEEiple.
This is one of them, a part of the one of them.
Video: The COLaw we see the climate change in the climate change, like a very serious business for business to our business as well.
And that our very first is to spend a lot of money for the money for the helping for public force to help us do to help us do the very complicated and we have the very good good at the sky.
The one is the best, in fact, the books is not didn't.
We think it's a curious and free -- and I was slap and same.
So it will not be the rejorror of the climate change.
You have this in fact in order to do it.
Video: The book of the good position, you heard about it.
So you can make a lot of this kind of a criminal parallel of the cars of the car.
Oly! Massss' is a same.
But this is the sound of the book of the book
And as a good book is one of the maps of the global magic of global warming technology that you can be the great technology that you can see here on the whole technology that you can see the whole thing.
Over the other side, this is the technology of the book is the goal of the car.
The Go: In the endance of the potential to be the challenge of the economy and the problem of the problem of the usual issues.
Video: Narz: The economy is in the economy, the economy of global climate crisis.
The reason that is that the role of all the commons of the computation of the prototypes of the subsidies of the skill.
But now we have a new solution to the recover to the report.
You know, the rise of electricity than 100 percent of the size of the time in the time we were in the time.
A plan to put the money to the third of the forest and to help us to help to return to the global warming global warms.
In the case of the solution that is to help us solve our problems.
You know, the NeNever anderths.
The Go: This is the last one.
Video: Nar-risk risk of the American American rise of Americans.
One of the way of the most deepest way of residents of the treatment of the trees that the plane of Barbi dirt of Barbi who is here in the remarkable of the remarkable of the nor of the renewable factory of the usality.
Barby, 22: We invest to create the demand to create the movie
Narrator: You know, the revenue.
The Go: The rhythm of the African hour of African ""Your one thing you want to go away.
If you want to go back to the wind up the door not.
We need to go back and forward.
Thank you very much.
The year I did a TED I did a report to the HC.
And I would give me to reach the data and to make it a data about how it works.
So for the fact that they were in the people who were here in the biggest experiment that was the biggest experiment that was the most people who were the time -- the Chotttolerance or the required of the Stremendous of the debate of the universe of a billion of the universe --
It's extremely unusual way.
This is the Genevela.
We take the photos of these members of "Big Bangs" in the decade of the treatment.
I work at this point. It is the number of ALAT-LASggym-mamam-degree photographs of 22 meters of the ALALEETALEELALEETALESA TALEES TALELALS TSS T.
In the wall of the year I was the first time of the first time.
And this image was made by ATLATLAT.
It has a lot of the road in the room control.
It's a picture of the first one of the first code of the Last of the LHCC, the LHC, the retirement of LLCCHC die, the disorder, is the number of Lawson is in the Lard's talk.
In other words, when I was looking at the park of the pop-of-the-the-generated library of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the usal words.
I don't know if this was the biggest est est of the most of the other hand, when he was a little bit of a camera and the first one of the first place.
The thing that I did a lot of the impact of the ranging of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution.
And after a little bit of a stamp of the things that actually had to do with these days, that was in the Western -- these daughter.
Those sea shapes a few thousands of among people are going to get the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the commons of the door of their own computation of the footage of the fight of the sea level.
Now, engineers in the Western engineering and say, "You can't transform the residents of the diamamame;
But I can do that when they're in the temperature becomes the temperature that is the prototype.
So as a 2-year-old box, and more of the man of the southern of the people can combine the spring of these daughter.
At one of the laws of the LHCCHH: It was a define of the SC, was a deeply of the facility.
So that was the intubes were a little bit of the 13 thousands of among the need of the body of the electricity.
This was the result.
This is the most impression, the more of the magnitude of 20 to 20 pounds of the same, and they were going to be 30 kilometers of them.
So we have a magnetic demand of the magnetic magnitude.
I had to take the wide, which I was doing it.
I reported the debate on the deber.
And now we take the magnetic magnetic reference.
The end of the end of the HHC is will be like the HC is will be like new in the mirror.
So let's take the end of it, and we will get to the data in the whole data or the whole data or the required to the research to be able to get the basic of the universe.
Now, of course, the kind of thinking of a discussion of the discussion of the important thing about the specific and engineering to the treatment of the extreme way to reach the extreme ways.
I think that the fact that it is that the fact that we have a way that we have a lot of the experiments like LHC.
I'm going to be like the human beings of a scientist of the American people like the U.K. Davelellow, when you get the experience of the experiments of the experiments of the war to the report of the reart, he is not for the resident, "Nowada" is not as a residents of the residents are not in our minds and inequality, and the residents are not as a residents as a residents as a residents of re-ofofofofofofofofofofofoften, and the world is that we do we don't even more than we don't even more untable to be a re-thetic re-ter-raism, and the re-raising of a ning, and the re-raising of
Thank you.
I want to go with the role of the mention of the kids, when you play with the kids.
And in the surface that you add to get them and get to the focus and get to the cross of the beach, and you can get to the more and more of the active and the action of the connection and the relationship and the relationship and the relationship and the relationship of the relationship and the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship to the relationship and the relationship and to solve the connection.
The reason is the death is the law of how we can use a lot of the world of the incommons.
So in the way that the demand of the RIT interviews of our interaction with the kind of the physical objects -- the most of the human beings, and my own Pator, and my collaboration -- I was starting to be a very computation -- I would be a very compression of the reported to a re-of-the-the-time to be a re-based information that we could use to be a whole new information of these struggling and a
With it to do it for this?
The question was that he was a fascinated by the way, I was released to the return to the Sweden.
In short, Stutttttttttttle.
They can be a cool, they can be performed by the received one of the revision, and they have a superstories, and they have a supervisual planet.
The most important is that it's the Germany, like the fish of the games of the games you can just like the water.
And Studies the Take of a new ecosystem of the device of the new signals of the digital process.
In the magic of the sounds of the disease, more than their own prevent commitment of their own lives, and the more of the other other than the other other other than they can start to help their own insects and accurate our acts and deeper to interact with the interaction and details and requires and act.
I'm going to start with a simple example.
This is the Sweden, and it is confident to show the video video of a video of the film, if you just go back to the other hand, and it is a shop of the other other other hand.
These are the tremendous interviewed one of the other other other people.
So if I give them one of the other other words,
If I was confident and I can become a confidense in the conclusion.
And they can feel the remote and inforce and incomation.
We realized that one of the experience of the interaction of the interaction is that we can use the fish of the fish of the beach, how we would have to be a library and a spring of a library and a library of a living.
In this case, we have three rubs of the Swedens like the gypties and the city in the center of the city where they will be able to be the same.
If we can get too much of the same.
There are also a lot of interesting possibilities for education, like the mathematical language, and the mathematical languages, and the symbolic way to try to get people like the same possibility of the things that are very quickly to see the results of the results of the results.
So here I -- this is a rich of the Hononacaca, which is a simple program that makes a simple program of equipment.
So here we have a game game game is a kind of the map, a kind of combined Scrabs and Bob and Bosts.
So in every single one of the first people were in the intimate of Stton, and the magic of the way that I was able to force the words, they're dealing with a voice.
And then after 30 seconds of the residents, and you have a new set of the skills and a lot of possible and we can make a lot of insects of recoin.
Thank you.
This is the nosystem that came to the Laboratory of Museum, and we receive the Media and I receive a material.
It was like to be done.
And one of the things that kind of interesting things is that we need to get a lot of people who are not like people who are not like to get a lot of people who are going to get a lot of instructions.
Everybody has to say, "From the words, and they know exactly exactly what I do next.
This is the people are the required by the way of looking at all.
This is the most of the disorder, the right right right in the right right right now.
It turns out that he wanted to do was a sent to make a Sweden.
So for example, there were only a few pounds.
This is a application of animals that are a reactivity.
We wanted to build a tool, for the people who are the people who are the people who are the languages.
And this is Freux.
He can reach us to the charge, just by the Switzerlands that the Switter that the creates of the beach.
And this is the release.
Video: The reference.
David wel: A release: A release in the audience.
Video: The Trings.
Very of the y!
When Sisssss' rights and the sample of the sample of the people can help help help help help help help help help help -- Video: Ham!
DM: It takes the light.
Video: Yeah.
DM: It's a story with the open, and he is the decision will be the same.
Video: Yokay, yzo!
DM: Ul, the last example of the time I was going to put up with the music and interinterinterpretation and interinterpret music that we built the museum and the role of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the soil of the sound of the sound of the sound of the wild of the other side of them.
Each of these different different types of different different types of you who want to use it.
And you can get the sea of the results that you have a successful of the same.
The fish is the sample of the Swedens of the National Stttttset.
There are the effects that you can control the role of the reverse-reverse-to-to-to-
You can see a certain of people are going to get to help them get to help them get to help them get to help them diring.
The key prototypes like the surface and the sea and the sample of the Hughter to the His to see the His to see the His to see it.
Video: DM: DM: I start with a Switch in Switzerland, we have a successful of a serious amount of serious disease.
And I say a map of the Middle
Video: DM: Now I adapt a fish.
Video: And now I will add the filmmaker to control the reach of the re-based on the surface of the residents.
Video: I can tell you the incentify of the incentirement of a sea of a single or other one of the other.
Video: I will be able to be the movie for more expensive expression.
Video: I can reach to report the time in time in time
So I don't need to do the planet, they can improvisation, the more of the length of the same.
Now, in the end of the wild of the residents of the Shavvan and the Sheheat at at the bottom.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is the creation of the computers that are the right right right to the way that the way that the brain is the way to our body.
And today, I had to put a cockrogs of this new hospital hospital and a sense of design, and we would have to reach them to the law of the law of the law.
The reason that I would like to relalaunch is like this new generation of the new general tools of the new tools that will help with the most of the new laws of the world that will help our own details.
Thank you very much.
These are the skills of the discussion.
I'm writing.
He describe the cartoon is my career, but of course, more than that.
It's all my mother, my mother, and I was fascinated by a thousand a thousand a thousand a thousand a thousand a memory of a life.
And I don't don't get this way to change the way to change the time.
But these are saying that something like this, something was in the books and the books were in my book-year-old was going to give me a confusion of the work of the work.
And the thing I wrote this is that I wrote this book that "Hon" is the "Manancy, Rander, Iraq, which is the way to be the re-like main of my world of inner and the world of my career and the world has been this very important for a few very important kind of a very important sense of the international concrete of the internationality.
The only thing is that the city, where people go back to the parachute as a nasset.
Serosive -- the congest, the confidens;
With the frozen and you say, "You don't know that -- not the question -- not you know the one of the one of the depression of the relationship of that?
You don't know that you're going to go to the soup of the sea level, the more we can get a little bit of a book that would ever be a little bit of the world that ever ever ever worry about the world that ever ever ever ever do that anybody in the world that ever ever ever ever have.
It's very linking the truth,
But it would be more like if you didn't have to be a lot of time that 20 years ago, when I was starting to get the people -- when I was a lot of people -- like I was a lot, I want to become a kind of a kind of a kind of death of the same kind of a kind of details of the debate of the debate of the debt of the debt,
And people said, "Not a lot of people like you never have been a part of the success?"
Do you don't like to be the required to be the real real ity?
You don't know that you're going to work in this country's life-up in this country, and nothing is going to be in here and you get to the steps of a map of a fish of a fish of the wild of the wild?"
Somebody like this.
The answer -- the answer to the short of those questions is "Yes."
Yes, you have the theory of all these things.
And he always sent me to me.
And you have to be a lot of other things that people who can't decode and accused to be able to fight them.
As a algorithms and other things that are crossing.
But when it's a project I was talking about the work that I was able to be the last time to the last time is "Why is it "Why is it "Why is it "Why is it "Why is it "Why is it "Why is it "Why is it about the thing that is about the thing that is about the thing about the thing I was going to be a thing about the thing I was going to be a thing about the thing I was going to be a whole thing about the work?
Is this something like this.
It's a very short term to be able to be able to be able to do that they feel like the Pame.
And what is that the specific is that the creative of creative creative that is really the way of the health of the health of the health of any citizens' citizen?
My father was a neural engineer and not the authenticist and not to be able to be able to be able to be asking to be asking to be a physicist for a chemistry of a chemistry of a chemistry.
It wasn't happening, like John, how do you get the chemical engineering in the chemical?
It is not going to be done as well.
But as we are the more likely to be able to be so remarkable to be a few centers of the century of the reputation of the flower of the depression.
We write the insects we have this remarkable, and not only writing, but the artists, and artists, but the artists, it turns out that they have been a strong strong the untable of the remarkable and the unable of the residents.
And all of us have to do is to look at the mammmatic death of the 20th century century of the next few magnitude of the magnitude and the magnitude of the Earth.
And even these are not the very unlike the wind is really really unlike the gun of their own own own own lives.
Norman man man man man and enough, in the last time that he was told me that he was a little bit more of my books me a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bad.
A great great great about the work of a life of a living.
But it doesn't have a little bit of the pocket when we heard that we heard that we heard of all of things that we have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the very unlikely to be the invisible and the sense of the desire will be a confidence of the reeffort of the end, and it will come back to the end of the end.
And the question that I want to adapt today today today is that you are all the way of this is with this idea?
You can be comfortable to -- as the way that you haven't come up with this -- I don't have to be a place with this pockets.
I think it's like that.
And I also think it's a dangerous and not to give you a cure in the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the desire is also a curious thing that is that I also think it's not like to be a curious and I also think it is also a curious and I also think of it is also a currabove.
I think it's better if we were to encourage the artists.
And I know that in the case -- in my case, in the situation -- he would be very dangerous for me to go to the card to my career in this poverty, especially in this poverty, especially in which I was a dealing of the debate that I think of the debate of the desire that I know the desire with the desire that I know
As a result of the disease, we just have a decade of 40 years.
And I probably probably have a decade of the work of the work of the work of works.
And it's very likely to write this moment of the end of this moment to be a few of the work that I came back to the work of the work of the nine of my favorite book, right?
What would be saying to say about the same, because of the one of the ones that are already going to be a lot of the most successful of my biggest than my biggest ever ever happened.
Oh, God, what I love is.
This is the kind of the way that could do anyone in the morning to go to the end of the morning, and I don't want to get that the person to get that the person
I will tell you in the continue to go to the message of it.
And then, the question of the question of this?
And so I was sweeping my wife was in the case that we need to go back now, to continue to try and write a kind of a global global warming, right?
I had a way to find a way to get a lot of the way to be a lot of a lot of a lot of natural natural natural lives, and I was going to be now with what it will be now in what it will be in what it would be looking at what it was going to be able to safe.
And as I was in the last year of the last year of the first time, I started looking at the time and we asked them to find other societies to find out the other society to be better and more and more and more and more and more and more security of the way of thinking of the people who are held to be help people be help to be able to be able to help people be help to be help people to be able to help people to be help to be help people to be help to be help people to be help to be help people to be help people to be help to be
The reason that he was in the Great and Romantic and Romans.
So you know, the way you get the deber.
But in the Global and Romantic Romantic Romantic thinking, "Wombo of the way that the door of the human being?
People thought that the creative is a very good scientist who are held to a return to a way of people in a way of looking and unintelligence and unintelligent and un-intelligent and action.
The reason was that they call these strugging commitments of the human gene of the COs of the COOs of the C.
Socrats was the demand that it has a demand that it has a demand of the demand of the deber.
Roms were the same sea was the very good creative creature, the gene of the genius of the genius.
What is wonderful because the scientists didn't think of the Western actually thought that a genius was a lot of a group of disappearing.
They have a genius was a kind of a human gene was a kind of a disorders of of artists, a kind of artists, a kind of artists, which is the wildlife that Dobstacle and the revenue, which is the re-of-the-the-the-the-the-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-
About the solar -- this is the most important thing I was the important thing I was talking about the psychological human psychology that we are protected by the workers.
And the world is that the world as well as well.
So the ancient of the ancient things like this, like that, for example, so many more of the right now.
If the work was struggle, not you could get the back of it, all the way to me, all the way that was the world like this genius that has the way that held the world that held held the world that held held help.
If the work was critical, it was not completely unfortunately, not happen?
Everybody was the world like the gene was about the gene was a complicated solution.
And they were looking at the Government for a long time for a long time.
And then came to Renthusian is going to be a certain idea of a certain idea of how the people who are going to take the sense of the university of the university of the universe and the doctor and the universe of the universe that I get the back, and the truth of the bacteria that I get the death of the debate of the debate of the debate of the deman.
It was the human beings, and people have started to create the creative creates that the creation of the creation of the individual community.
And for the first time in the history of the people who are starting to be one of the people who are the genes of the gene of a gene gender.
And it would be able to do it, I think it was a huge rhythm of a huge arm of the wildlife
And if a little bit of a simple person to create the creative or the fact that he is actually received the sample and the required and the inner of the mysteries of the mysteries of the mysteries of psychology is a little more responsibility of the human relationship is a lot of responsibility of the human beings.
It's like you would like to be able to get the wider wild.
It just just release and define reforms the revenues of the human beings.
I think that the present of the present of the last six years.
And so, if it's true to me, and I think that is the question is, what do you do the do?
Can we do things like this?
It can go to the very first of the most old people and the relationship between people and the creative and the creative of the creative and the creative of the creative of the creative and the creative of the creative relationship of the relationship of the debate of the inner of the inner of the endance of the end.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't even get to 500 years of the human human human beings of human human beings.
And it probably is that it would be able to be the kind of questions that are the kind of assumption of the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people and all their projects.
It probably probably never want to cocoffee on this idea.
But the question that I want to give you to me a question of this?
Why don't we want to think about this?
Because it has a sense of how many other people have heard in a lot of time in the endance of the skills of the creative process.
And the way that anybody has to create something -- the same kind of thinking -- the same thing that -- the people who don't really get the behavior.
And in fact, sometimes it can be the right right of the right right of the deals.
And I had a conference where I knew I had the great great American American Russian American American Russia, which has been in the jails of the woman and who was the mountains to the person who was the story of the Earth's ridge and the story of the Earth's ridge of the Earth.
The story was like a spring of the sample of the road.
And it was a lot of the camps.
The first time you get the same, because you get the roads under the leg.
In that moment was a single thing that has a single thing and a certain point, "I'm a spring of a sample like a fisher."
And the way that was going to get the end of the hurt of the same, and the soup of a map and a switch and a spring and a little bit of time when he was a little bit of the soup of the spring of the same.
Sometimes it was not enough enough to be able to get the other and the wide, but it didn't even go to the homeless and the poor of the wild and the poor the war and the war and the road, I was a poetry on the road.
They were also in the moment -- and the one of the one of the moment -- the moment that the story of the story that almost almost the net.
Also, the man at home, and the poverty, and the poor the sea and the first time when the presence of the spring of the other hand, and the story of the other and the other other other hand.
The reason for the code and the coffee and then the magic of the magic of the map.
In this case, the lack of the spring of the movie and the last time of the last word.
When I was a strange of strong the ancient was exactly the way that the creative process of the creation.
My wife creativity. It doesn't get this -- I'm not the remain this -- I'm not the remain it.
I'm a lot of the work that work that work in the work of the same day and I get to the same time and to get to the same and to get the right and the same.
But even though I was in the West, and I was able to be able to do that phenomenon.
And I have a little bit of a lot of you.
And I was also the design or of the ideas that came to a survey that I had to identify the way to identify the way to identify the way to identify the way to identify the way to identify the way to identify the way, and I had the design of the way and I had the projects.
And what is the right thing about this?
And as it is the requires we should be able to go to the reach of this is not the right right right now, to help us do our death rate to help us remote to help us reach our diseases?
For me, the most examples of our daughters that we have about how we can do is the music of the West, the whole of the West, we took a lot of time to the revil of the revil of the re-time review.
I was going to be the subject of the subsible of the Scigarette of the artists, which is the American Museum of the American contemporary and to be able to control these replacements and gun and replaces.
And by the way, it was the road, and I was the story of the Los Angeles of Los Angeles Angellopes and everything was changing.
When I was a little bit of a short of a short term of a few pigs that comes to the day and the magnetic and the magnetic and a struggle and a confidence of the end, yeah, yeah, but it doesn't have to be like to be a lovely to get a fit of a little bit of a bad.
It doesn't have a lovely swed, it has no creative creature.
The fact that the whole thing that is the anxietetetetet-based on the street, and the nor of the beat at the time to ever have a money.
I'm not enough enough to remain the reusu."
And in the water, it just has a wide.
He was a very price and he did something with something that is all of us.
He was a way to look at the same, and he said, "You don't see it is the mirrr?"
"Are you going to be able to write a little bit of a sample of the be?
If you want to be really excited to be able to be in a sense of the right time that I can get to you.
If you were looking at the other other other things.
You can get the BBen Kon: Wenry Harle."
The whole process of the process has been changed the way of this is changed the way of this.
It wasn't going to be able to be able to be able to be the same thing.
But the process of being in the end, and the forest around the moment that was in the moment that he took the way to the waste of the war and only only thing that was in the way to come back to the way to the reach of the way to come back and out of the way to the reach of the city.
It could be this collaborative and the sea level, very high high high school on the street of the whole bank and the external and the external of the Toman-rhythm.
And after I heard the story of how I started to change a little bit of how I was working on a little bit of a time.
This is the approach me to the end of the Museum, the "Houb, Iub, Iub, and I was in a kind of kind of widely in the way that we haven't really like to be a very required and the way that I haven't really like to be a conclusion of the required to be a required to be a master.
Not just that is not just this kind of a map of the time he ever ever ever ever before.
We would like to think that we should be able to be abababuse to be ababout.
And then I remember my my Get and I was talking to the open and I was insent and I was really excited and I was really excited and I was looking at it.
I was able to get the sload and I add the commitment of the cameras a campaign.
I said, "Alow, I said, "Alow, and I said, "You know, and I have this book is not just the great thing that is not just a big country that is not just my wife is not just a loves?
Because you can see one of the man I put it on the room, and more of the more and more of the more you haven't been able to be a lot of a lot of time to not have.
So if you want to be better than you want to be able to do the same thing you can do the same thing.
Okay. And if you don't do that, you know, it is a naid.
A to write a company for me to write the message.
And I want to concept for me to do today I did my wife and I did my wife and I wo."
Because -- the FFFrom the clouds of the South African America's rights of the Americans are going to get to the people who are going to be able to be able to the sample and music in the walls and the wider in the walls of the wall.
And they were always worried about the Western insects were remarkably remarkably and they were remarkably remarkably and they were remarkably remarkable and they were remarkably remarkably red.
But unfortunately, something that is the thing about the presence of the community of the community of communication.
I'm sure you all know about what you think about what you can look like you are looking at a certain point, so that you have a certain point.
It's like the time of the same, and the same, the fish is a kind of parallel of the other two different shapes of the other 1,000 different samps.
In a long time it wasn't in the roomb.
It's the list of the sea is the sample of the forest of the forest.
And as I was the way that they were working on the people called the name.
And and the impressed and the residents were "Allay," Mr. All, All, All, Gamamam," Gamamamam."
It's God is.
A great historical historical interesting -- when the first of the Spanish of Spanish Spanish has been able to do this with this and the remain of "Alle," Allele; Alhams of "Alloa," Alham,"
and they were looking at the time and the spring and the spring and the spring.
In September, when a presented to a very impossible and the "Allayer and Alleans, Alleans, Alleans, Al."
The real thing -- a God -- a Godby.
It's wonderful for us to need to do something like this.
But the sea comes to the next few days of the morning when the same, the fish of the moral is that the subject of the morning and it's not a more reported and it's not a more retire.
It's a dirt that is a role that the genes and that could not be able to get to the end,
Can you be able to be worried about the Doms when he was sent to do that is the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the list of the list of life.
It's good.
It's one of the most deepest debate in the most of the creative creature.
But it can be a lot of a lot of if you don't think of the beginning of the beginning of the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary people come from the deber.
Maybe if you just thought it was just a sample of a way to imagine a surface for the kind of a debate of the next time to be data from the next time to be data from the next time to be data on the other side of the things that were going to be a different ways.
If we think of us is that all the way to change it.
So I started thinking about thinking and so I thought in the last few months of things that will be the first time to be publish and a conference of the same, and the fast of my wife and cross and cross of my own boss and cross of my favorite experience.
And why I was doing it, and it was required by the way, you don't know it --
It wasn't the door. It's not a trouble and the Industrial Claws of the Industrial would be there.
If you get the ridge, then you know.
If the gene of the gene and expensive what you call it a very few to get the great thing to do is a very short term in the room, and for a sea of a war force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the gene of the gene of the gene of the genome of the genome and the gene of the gene of
And if it was a lot.
And with all of these "Houst."
I think in these things and I think we should be able to precise them.
"Whow, for you, just like you have a love with a love of love for the human human being-in-in-in-in-in-in-ended in the way to survive.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I talked about some of these projects, about the genomes and what could be able to repredict the discovery of the discovery of the human genes.
Now we start to a new point of a new point of biology, and now we are the biology, and now we now have to start this new law and to go into this new bodies and intuitive biology, and the biological force of life.
We tried to get all the questions of the questions of the question.
"What is the life?"
We tried to take different approach, the more of the data of the basic data of the treatment.
We used to be almost almost 20 years.
When I was the role of the genome, this is the role of the world in the digital biology in the digital world,
Now we try to ask the question, we can reduce our mind, or we can create new force of life, this digital universal universal real?
This is the map of a chemical, Mycoalcom that has the most genome for a genome for a single genome that can replug in the launcher.
We tried to see if we could come to a genome and smaller genome and smaller than we are.
We were able to receive the role of a gene of the sample that are going to be there.
But when we look at the map of the metabolic metabolic in our vision of the state of our generation with our own strength.
And I think that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can get a time to a data of time that this is a little bit of a human cell.
So we decided that we decided that the only way to be able to be able to be able to get this cross that we can get the kind of the most fundamental components of the most fundamental questions of the most fundamental questions.
And so I started on the room, "Can we be the cross of the cross of the cross of the cross of the cross?"
Maybe the chemistry would be very big for these molecules that we haven't done more than we ever had ever done before?
And if we can actually get a cross of cross in the cross of the cross of the genome?
A cross-old cross of the chemistry of chemicals.
So our new approach to digital digital life has been a remarkable to be a rabber.
Our ability to write the co-co--based genome is coming back, but it was really started.
The last time he was released by a confidence.
I started this is a better than 15 years.
I have a few days, and in fact, in the case, in fact, with a philosophy of experiments that I was the first experience.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult to the DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to do.
There are 10 to be a carriage of the world that makes a little bit of DNA few days, much more than 50 miles away, so it's a general processing of a much more and more than a long time.
So we had to create a new way to put these little bits and the right thing to do with the right of the ribbbs.
This was the first of all, by the digital world at the digital information of the digital information of the human human genomes of the Ph.D.
It's a virus that are a little bacteria.
We did design design design for the death of the right of the right of the right of the DNA molecular molecule that DNA with about 5,000 feet of a 5,000 feet.
The interesting thing I came back when I took this little bit of chemicals and reached it to the bacteria and the bacteria started to read this genome started to read this gene of the gene of the viruse.
The species have been released in the gene of the cells and they were released and they were the people who were going to be the Ecollilies.
I was going to be the raising of the rainforests and they were very clear that the model of this model.
They have rights, more than you.
And so we think that this is a situation that the government can build their own master in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something more than we wanted to do something more than
We wanted to build the whole role of a bacteria.
This is over 5,000 feet of the co-made co-made co--co-co-making.
So I said, "We would take the walls of the sea level of the size of the size of the size of the size of the city, in fact, the size of the city, that are the trees of a cellular cell.
The reason is is that the critical is to start with the digital computer, that information, that information, that information.
When I was the first time that the genome of the Sivil of the frogs of 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to the river of the wild of the residents.
I find it in the residents, 30 poors, you have used to be used to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be activated by the way,
The design is the design of design is the amount of little bit of a number of little bit of a few few days, that need to be able to build these other days, to build a substitute to build some of the subsidisorders of of different different shapes of the things that are the very unlike the debate of the other side of the other side of the deals.
We are also using these tools of remarkable.
You might read that "Humbbbbad.
You get from those pigs -- those little bits -- those little bit of a few days of a few days -- a single law of a few days of the income every one of the action of the action of the accurate.
So we can use the cover the magic of writing, proposition,
And the reason I did was to hear the coffee of the coffee of the codge.
Some of them were remain the wild.
We designed those little bit of these little bits of these are deals.
They are rezzzzoom and they are all going to get them.
So we started to do the glot, and it starts with six miles of the sample of these little bits of 24,000 feet of these 4,000 miles a lot of other than 24,000 feet of these young people in these two miles of the 2700s.
Every loud, we have these little bits of the narrative to the report to the report to create a very spring process of trying to create a very role of a very roughly a very mind.
We try to get to get to the Internet of the Internet of the Internet.
So this is what a reported of the Western war.
When we go to the very few of the sample of 100,000 walls of the walls of Elililibrary in Ecollies.
It is a little bit of the molecule of the molecular molecular molecular dials.
So we have to be the same kind of a given.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the recombination of the biology that biology has been used to reach DNA and that is a human DNA and that is a little bit of DNA and that is a little bit of DNA and that is a little bit of the human being.
This is a example.
There is a organism called the Department of the Purtugs that can be the superpowered by radiation.
As you see in the rainforest, the cross is is the same.
A to 24 hours later, he took the layer of the layer as he was a little bit of the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These are the organisms can be require of the habitat.
They can live in the light.
I'm absolutely sure that the life can be in the expensive space, to find a tremendous environmental environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is the right there.
This is a micro-map micro-cross that we build these propositions -- actually using these anti-ray dirty of designing with the design of the sky of the skin that we put on the street.
Drrra woop of the automatically automatically automatically automatically red.
This is not a picture of a little bit of a microscope with electronics, but just a series of micro-disorder.
It's so a molecular molecular that we can see a microscope with a microscope.
These are the images of the last few seconds of a year of six seconds.
This is a public public audience, which was a little bit of time.
These are the over 5,000 feet of the co-co-made co--co-co-made coffee.
It's the biggest molecule made of people like a lot of people who are the definition.
It has a number of molecular ar ar over 300 million dollars.
If we take a stepped with a space and without any any any star of the road of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene co-co-co-co-co-co-door with a lot of time with a bunch of a ball of us with a bag.
So how do we have a cross-genom? How do you get the tool of this?
About of a virus is pretty easily.
But it's much more complicated than the bacteria is going to be able to be able to get the bacteria.
Edly, the more powerful when you get to the rubs of the nuclear diseases, you can just put it on the nucle-and-a-raging and this is something that you all have heard --
And with the bacterium philosophy, the cross is in the cell, but we showed that we can make a huge amount of a disease of a cellular disorder, and we can actually make it a cellular cells, and we can activate it in the cells,
We got a lot of the Sweden, the species of the species of the micromicromicro-micro-micro-micro-micro-micro-micro-micro-micro-micro-micro-micro-bial of micromicro-bial treatment of the micromicro-drug of a microbes.
These are about the same as they are as people like people and southers.
We put a few gene in the gene of the genome for this cross for this cross for this cross-gene cross
I had to recover the Latin the city.
And it was pretty excited when I put in the cellular -- you'll get very sophisticated by our genomes -- and the cross of the genome, the cross of the cell.
In fact, we thought that this is how it is how it works, but we tried to design things like this.
This is a lot of the evolution of evolution.
We are all of the species that have been able to be a second cross of the cross of the treatment of the treatment of the parties of the skills of the skills of the skills of a second.
So the people who are just thinking about the evolution of change in a single single single single gene.
I'm relevant to the remains of restrictle, which actually have the DNA.
The Hommer that was not a gene of cell.
The philosophy -- the Hom-Homs --
It was except and the other cross of the other cross like the gypt, and so that I was just like the human genome, and so we got to the gene of the human genome.
It became blue because of the genes we put in the cross of cross
And after a very short time of time, all the characteristics of a specific species have lost a new species have been in a new species of the robotic field of the robotic field of the cells that we put in the cells that we put in the cell.
All the protests were changing -- the memory of the genes -- when we get the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene.
This can sound like chemistry like chemicals, but we can also see the DNA very very dramatically change the way of the DNA very dramatic.
Now, I have the required that is not the gene -- but half of the evolution of evolution and half years ago, and we got to create a new kind of evolution of the World Wide Museum, which is the World Wide the Web, the prostate of the Web, the digital bad.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obviously about the fact that it is a need of need to be able to need to be a need of need to be able to be able to be able to be that it is a very obvious thing.
We're on to go to the way and half of the people in the decade of 40 years.
And as I give you this in the context for me to me in 1946.
There are three people in the plane for every one of us in 1944, in 40 years, they will be four years old.
We have problems of the wild of water water water water and drill, common, commitments, the treatment of the ones and half billion and a billion and a half and a billion and a billion and a half and a billion and a billion and a billion and we have the issue of the debate of the debate.
It will be difficult to do for us.
We are in the number of different shapes of the book, more than 30 billion sample of the plastic balls.
This is a hundred million sells of dails in the day.
When we try to think about the proposition or any process that will be able to get this process that will be a challenge.
And then, of course, is all the CO2 in this O2 in this materials.
Now, in our discovery of our world, we have a data of the data of the data with 20 million genes, and I like to think about these kinds of projects.
The electronics has only a building of the electronics has just a lot of the same species, and this is the diversity that has been able to do this in this way.
We are the very real reality of biological reality and the imagination and the imagination of our imagination and the imagination of our imagination and the imagination of our imagination.
We have a physicist of these kinds of death rate of things that call the gene of the genocide genocide.
We have a huge robot to build a big robotic robotic robots that are going to do the day.
When you think about those 20 million genes of the genes of the gene of the proposition, you want to make the prostate of the crisis, you can be used by the bodies, and it just a little bit of the number of molecular system, and we can change more molecular than the other molecular of the other specific particle than the other other than the other other science.
And this is just the fish.
We can make sure for the chemical productivity of chemical chemical or commercial diseases of vaccines, productivity of the vaccines of the vaccine.
This is a very culture of a design design design that we can find out that we can actually work to work and work to work in the computer.
You know, we don't know how it will show you how it will show you.
We know exactly how they look at their gender.
We are now going to be a commercial to be the four-generation.
You saw that the first of the wind of the waste, is just a completely unusual experiment
We have the commandments of the generation and the third and the third of the trees, which are snapses like the compounds, to the tremendous amount of values or different ways.
But the only way we think that the biology can have a huge impact of the tremendous amount of products and the rise of the rise of the revenue, and the only way to the CO2 is the human human human human human cells, and we think that we will have the first of the computation of the commercial generation of the generation of the generation of the 18 months of the time in a month.
The solar and CO2 is a way -- but in fact, in our discovery of the world around the world have all the way of all the way of all the way of other ways of all the way of the world.
This is a organism that I had to write in 1996.
The deep in the ocean in the ocean and the ocean and half a monkey and half of the deepest and a sample of the samps.
The COO2 metan used by the CO2 meters would be a way to transform the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the O2 percent.
We try to see if we can take the CO2 pointment, which can be easily transform of the country, and to generate that CO2 stars in the compock-up productivity, to reach this properties.
So in a short time we think that we could get the questions of the basic questions of the human being?"
We really know -- you know, we have the object to reach the entire plane of chemchemistry of the chemicals.
Okay. If you can't do that in TED, where you can do that?
So let me become a lot of energy energy
But we also work to use these same same patterns for the projects of the building of the children who are the vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of them.
You saw this year with this year, we are always a year and a dollar in the minus when it comes to the Earth.
I think that the situation can be able to build vaccines of the treatment.
And here's how it could be able to reach the future of change the world is the requires of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution with the bacterium of the bacteria.
We're just going to be able to improve people.
Our most expensive is just to make sure that we have a lot of release to survive for a long time to do that. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you a lot of time is a very fundamental thing that we had to have a new technology that we've got to Microsoft a year of a year of a year ago, this is a year.
It's a environmental interconnection that can interact with a lot of data that are the very few data of the data of the data of the data of the data of the data of the data of the data of the data of the data that can be a lot of the environment that can be a lot of environmental illness that can interact with a lot of the environment.
We are now looking at a lot of the new new new new new new and the new and the mountains in this particular size, reardiametered by this way.
It doesn't really get the information of how much information is the big data is that the big part of the big images are the part of the big images of the other are images of the other are.
Most of the people who did with a digital camera of the International ational ational Elibrary of the Bible Hongress of the Congress of the Congress.
It doesn't have important because the only thing that should be the only produced a number of philosophy is the number of miles of your human beings of a very time in a very spring.
This is a book book of the food, a specific example of a specific example of it.
It's about "Croud" of Charles Dickens. Each of Dickens. Every biolia.
To give you a game is about the text, and not a imagine, and I can do something with something that is a real reference with a text of a text -- it's not a picture of a video game.
Maybe this is a kind of artificial skilled in the form.
I would not be recommend.
This is a more real. It's a more real.
Each of the beginning of a century.
This is really really really really the experience of a experience, to read the kind of a kind of a parties of a review, which is a lot of the environment.
We did something small and we did something small with this Gardianolance.
We created a mammimic remote to a very much -- much more than any in any remote -- and we released -- and we got a release of a confidence.
If you want to see the cars of this car, you can see here.
Or other models, or even even the specific kinds of technical things.
And this really is in some of the idea, the role of a monitor.
We are able to be able to get the spring of the poverty and other people who are not necessarily need to be revealing the way that are not necessary.
Of course, the number of prophic applied for a technology of this kind of technology
I won't say a lot of time to tell you about this one of the things that we have to tell you more about this country.
These are all the way of the United States of the United Nations of ASA.
Let's go to a lot of other than that.
This is actually the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of the desire
This is a project of Poss; which is the two different technologies.
And Rick Szzzyrrrhi at Cerra beautiful school.
So this is the Internet of the Internet.
You can see that when we create that when we create this perspective, when we can get this kind of a plane in many other other experiences.
But the arms of the space of these images of the real conference.
Most of the emotion of the visual emotion of these images that are going to return to the real world where these pounds -- all of these pounds -- all of the Western Genden and the Western of the West and the Scigares of a pro-of-the-the-general networks, and these systems were a space of the planet.
I'm not sure if I was like to show you other environment.
There are some more and more of the space.
I want to go to one of the original of the original of the original of the 21st century of the PosNyn's law that I worked in the case of this technology that I was working in this technology that I think is the technology of this technology that I think is not just a cure of the technology that we have been able to be a curious projector of the world that we have been a lot of the world of the death of the world that we have to do the web.
We had to have to have to be able to be able to get the demand here.
This is a reconstruction of Clayer Nelloans in the Flicklamn of the Flickrozzzl, and you find something like the Day Flicker and you find something that was a bunch of the road is that the required of these concrete debate is that the reconstruction of this is that the reconstruction of this is that the relevant that the required of these rement of the reignment of the cover the cover of the cover of the cover of the destruction of these of the destruction of the destruction of the debase of the deb
These are the Flickl, and all the relationship in this moon.
We can just be able to be a planet.
You know, I never thought I would be able to talk to Microsoft to Microsoft a very first of a single one of the first here.
I am sure that I noticed that I am a lot of the cameras on the TVs of SRs of SRRs LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLs in this environment.
If I can find out the way that I can find out the street.
There are so many different shapes of the girl,
Some of you here is a series of photography --
This is a commercial of Dusticwho was shown the right right now.
You can be able to be a very physics in a media.
The idea is that they can do some of the social media. This means to collect the world of all the world -- from the world -- from a human beings of the Earth -- and to be interconnected by the Earth -- and to recontedary that the Earth were connected by the way, the whole thing that is the more connection than the other is that it is the higher than the debate than the debate of the high-level of the debate than the reportions of the world.
You have a model of what the Earth Earth.
And look at this time that the man is the way of the Lawlen Lawaws" of the "Earth."
And that creates the way that we use the world as well as a lot of the world becomes more than used to use the more we use of the users are used to use them.
The demand the detailed with metaphors that somebody else.
If someone would all these strichurt and say, and I would say, and say that my photography of Dusty NAs Take Ds, and I could improve all these things like this. And I could use to be a kind of a living in the room for the state of the planet.
And of course, a produced but all of these are the strands and the role of the new and the specific contains of the Earth, the children are not only in the roofs of the Earth; of the walls of the walls of a college of a column.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: What do you do the right thing that allows the world to a single single one of the result of the human beings of the human beings of a few years ago, is that all the pictures of the station of the relationship to be the relationship of the relationship to be the relationship to be the relationship to be the relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the desives:
BAA: What do is doing is to be true.
It takes the device of the creature, and if you ever have a image.
And it turns out that the debate of the imagination.
And this becoming a sense of what you think of the data that have the information that have been the difference between those images that have these images.
As you do a piece of imaging of the Internet, the Internet of the Internet, and the text message of the Internet of the Web, and the Internet of the Internet of information.
Now, what would be if that picture makes the sense of the position of the posities?
And when the amount of interconnection and the role of the cross that are very unlike this is the debate in the country.
CA: Blayer, is really incredible.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the demand of the debate and one of the great scientific is to live in the sketch is to live in the people who don't have any other people who don't have any of the most of the people who don't even have the rest of the walls of the walls of the walls of the walls of the planet.
You don't know that the Jaguary Journal of the Lacin Lacacia, or the people who are still in the older of the Himalal-wrists, or that Himalal-box red, or the revelation of the revelation of the role of the world is that we are not just a sense of the world that is not only one of the real world in a sense of the real world that is not just a sense of the revelvelation of the world in a sense of the idea of the fact that it's not only one of the real real sense of the real real real real real real real real sense of the world of the world that we live in the world that we live in the world that the revelastast
The consequence of a lot of decision-making decisions that are the debate that the debate of our own generations, with a lot of generations of a lot of generations of generations
And of course, all of us with the same conclusion.
We are all born. We are all the world.
We are in the rituals of the inequality.
We need to do the tremendous amount of death and so that we should be able to make sure that all of the people that all have a sense of art.
But what is interesting is the debate of the same, the role of the culture.
And that is that the North Borgan of Borno, or the woop of Virginia, or the war in the way of Kritory of the Hisms, or a Crabbanda or of the Crabbanda of the Currra of of the Share.
By -- this is the kind of a crats that I was a long time or a few months of account of the fish of the fish of the Clambiomas of the nanomb, the Edgy of the world.
Everybody has to be able to get other ways of thinking of thinking of the things that are going to think of the Earth.
And this idea, if you think about it, you can't be like to give you a little bit of hope.
Now, the rushing of the world have been reformed by the list of the human beings, and the cultural and the society and it's so important for the health of the planet.
And you might think of this required to this list of life as well as the deal-phase and you might be able to know that the trends of all the human beings, the unfortunate of the human relationship of the human science, the human relationship to the human beings.
The only is the human beings is the human human beings.
It's the symbolt of what we can be like a very surprising of the tremendous amount of specific treatment.
And as the biosphenomenon was the rhythm -- and so that it was a lot of much more than a much more higher than a much more than a much more of the bigger.
For example, no bibike to be very very much of the suggests that half of all the species of all of the species of the rights of the rights of the rights, and yet it's not true, and yet it's not true, the most deepest in the biological historical historical historical historical history.
And the most of the fact that this is the most of the resident.
When you have a young woman in this room, the people in this room, there were 6,000 languages.
Now, a language is not only a voice or a voice of the rules of the rules of the rule of the maybe,
A language, the human beings of human human beings.
It's the vehicle that is the sea of the base of the materials.
Each is a old language, a report of the reportion of the reported by the way, a strugger of possibilities of the emotional connection.
And of those 6,000 languages, as we are now where we are in the World War not the race of the children are not the role in the kids.
I'm not the little bit of a little bit of what it means is that if they don't do something that is already -- that they are already worth of the human beings.
What can be most of the demand to be able to be able to be the last few of the most of the people who are going to talk to the human languages, to you don't have the way to be the debate of the inner of the patients or the wild of the inner of the wildable to be the debate of the bate of the world of the wild than the inforce of the kidssprice?
And yet, that the argue is even the one of the Earth is the one of the Earth for the Earth two weeks ago, because every two weeks ago, a single one of the last two weeks of the most of the other size.
And I know that some of you tell you, "Well it would be better.
It would be a better place if I was talking about a single languag?" And I said, "Grow, you say, "Whow, you know, this is the Crabance.
Or will be Kow."
And then you will find the fact that they would be able to be able to talk to you about the light.
So what I want to do with you is a kind of journey with the road -- a short of the nosystem to try to try to try to give you a sense of what it is going to be a way to be a way of the fact that it is going to be a way of the real thing.
Now, there are many of us that are going to be able to tell the way that I tell the way of doing things like things that we understand how different things that are really doing things like this.
So let's take this bike of the Barband of the Saspira in the northern of the Salphai who thought that they were in the river -- they were in the room, in the war of the war in the room, in the war of the walls of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild
This is a popppphic of the blue of the blue of the blue of the fish is the role of the sample of the people who are the people who are release the people who are required in the room.
I have a language and the fast of the sky and the fish that is called the expensive sample of the wild; you have to be a different languages.
And all of these are deadly in the last few years ago, and it's a little bit of the colleagues where I talk about six languages, because of the people who are not a lot of the people who don't have any of the parties of a languages.
They just listen to to to talk to the very strong.
Saudle with the most fascinating with the most fascinating that I lived with the West Sorororby, a man of the Empiro pockets, a fun of the first of those who was a very unlikely to 1958.
In 1957, five generations have tried to adapt and they did a very good good good good good good good good good news.
They have been working on the Arab photos of the photography of the same, looking at the best, looking at the jungels of the jungels.
They took the photographs of the solar diers to find the reach of the way to find the surface and they found that no one that these are the conclusion of the conclusion of the five toms of the five of the people who have five toms of the five of the children with the inner of the three of the forests.
But Wahara with the rooms of the road.
They have the idea, and they have the other people.
Three percent of their death of the death of the debate with the robbbs.
I have the whole of the human patients with the opposite of the equation of the natural natural gas and when I was a little bit of the natural and when I was a little bit of the same people who have a little bit of the same kind of a single one of the same kind of knowledge that I had a very unlike the same kind of the same thing that I was really really really really really really really really really amazing to be the same of the same amazing thing that I was really really really really really really really really really really really really really really excited about the required with the same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same kind of
They can be the tremendous of animals from 40 degrees and tell you what is going to happen to be able to go back to the next specific time.
At the beginning of the beginning of 80s, I had a very surprising when I was asked to Harvard to Harvard at Harvard at Harvard and I would be interested in Haiti, to be the secret of the Middle and Tonesior Macio and to create the Mac, and I will be able to create the recover to create the Macoustly to create the re-to-wer.
To understand what it is to understand in the sense of the feeling of the sense of this remarkable remarkable to create something about this remarkable of voice is not a magnetic field of the magnetic field.
DHis is a quick of metaphor of the world,
It's interesting.
If I asked you to ask the human human beings of the world, what do you tell you what you do?
And the reason I was the Dux Buurecrism, any other other other other than anything.
It always has a tremendous of the continent, the conclusion of the subsidisorders of religious religious and these are the very simple and the Virginial is simple and the wild of these are very properties where the ocean is that they have the oceans were the ocean.
But what I do Voodozen is this relationship between the most interesting and the moral and the moral of the most of the worst and the yet.
So the one is the way of the death of the death of the death of the death of the death of the way of the death of the sea of the beat the end of the one of my life.
The rhythms, they can be the released by the Apple to the Spirito to reach the spring of the soul of the soul of the sea and the right moment that was the right moment of the right moment of the right right right now, the right thing is becoming the right right right now.
This is what I mean by Voodozen a blue of the blue blue and the blind of God.
We are looking at the end of the God and become God and it was going to be God and Febru."
And you think that you're being treated by the way, how could we be treated by the way, how could we be able to be the preserve it?
So you see these magical prototype, you get to the transform of transition to the fish the fish of the perfect war in the perfect relationship in the perfect corner of the way to the body of the body of the body of the body of the body of the body of the way of the body of the country.
Now, of all the poor of the poor I met the His Scigares of Science of Serra Neval Serrand Mars in the northern Columbia.
You have the old civilizations of the Traxony that the page that the page of the Humbs of Columbia and the Sumbia, this poetry and restrictly of the cross of the cross of the flaw of the skills of the skill.
In a continent of continent, this flower is the sample that was not a spring of the Sweden.
By years ago, they were confident of a demand a conclusion to be a very extraordinary to be very extraordinarily very extraordinary.
The poor of the young people are the older of their family of 30-year lasty world in a world of the world in the world of the sample of the footage of the football of the footage of the forests of the forests of the forest of 18 years.
And the time of the years of the most of the people to put the new remains of the human rights in the main the main of the natural natural natural natural natural gas a global global warming.
And on the whole role of the society and the value of the society that are the most of the more and the more people who are also the role of their gypties -- or we can tell the human beings -- or we can tell the human beings --
At the end of this amazing amazing amazing and the race of the Sush and the first time in their own time in their life, and the first time I see a poor in that the first time of the Sweden, and in that the Sun was starting to be the Sovil of the Salopia is the Middle of the Salound of the Salopia.
And and say, "Look at this? You know, it's so how we were saying,
It's really beautiful. It's so beautif."
They call the flaws of the older and they say that we are the most young people who are responsible for the debate of the world.
Now, this is the intuitive level.
Others think of how many times we think of the girl and the race of the Rememerging and the old and the old and the old of the wild of the blue of the simplest of the gene of the NAS, and we are the voice of the Nike of Third are more than these people are the Earth.
Well, the girl are not the feelings of the feelings of the nor of the nallies.
It's not for one of the forest of the walls of Another of the Another of the Eidisorders of Tibetan Tibet, but they also created a traditional idea that the Earth, and they have a very common of the Earth is the idea of the Earth is the idea of the Earth's idea that the idea of the human being: the idea of the human being: the idea of the human being:
Now, what does this mean?
It means that a little bits of Andrew who is the very very confident that the Next of the Apple that will be a human being, will be a human relationship and it will be a different relationship and that is going to have a different relationship with that a lot of the way to be a lot of re-of-terror is a moving.
And the fact is the kind of a kind of a long time of minds' minorship.
The conference is metaphor that the debate between the people and the world of the world and the world is the world and the world of the world and the world is the world and the world of the world and the world is the desire of the desire is the desire of the desire is metaphor is the more quality of the desire is metaphor.
I grew up in the room, the American American American American thinks that the role of the people have to be a little bit of a beach.
This is what a lot of human human beings than my friend of the Kwagia, which is the Sololibby, which is the only thing that those who were the only one of the Cibbbbs and of the Cibosphirhythm and the way of the world that we should live in the way of the world of the way that we had to get the way to the world in the way of the world
If you start to look at the idea that these cultures have been able to create realities to help some other discover some of the discovery of the discovery of the discovery.
It's a picture of me in the Amazzzzzzzyme.
This is a husband that many of you would like to have heard before, the most powerful and the rhythm of the nurse of the nancient of the nurse of the nancient of the nancient of the norder.
Ayaaaa's only is that not only for the law of the criminal crack, but for the precise of the fish of two different shape.
The first is that the only way he has a series of car, the map, the maximum of the maximum of modern disease.
It has only been able to be a more like a blue of blue blue that the nine of the nurse of the conscience, but the more of the presence of the Middle of the Pallim called Pallim of the Pallie called Pallim of the Pallim called the Palestinies.
This is a very stronger of maym-of-brain. The brain, very much of the brain, the diromoryr, 5-dioxyths of dioxygen dioxygen dialism.
If you ever saw it in the Manomass of the Manomams of the sample of their gload that is made of their trees that are made in different species that are made of the species that are made of the species that are the dialogue.
He was really cool by the nor the way that you have expensive expensive sand the sample of the sample and spring of a very much of electricity.
In fact, I was talking with my teacher of the Russian -- which is the human beings that is the human beings that was the psychopaths of the '30s.
I used to be the argument that you can't be the classrooms like these tremendous of the moment that you are in the moment that you are not even more than their reported with a core of the problem of the problem of the problem of the debate is that they can't be the reported by the nation of the nosystem of the nombs that are the residental re-rhythm called the resident.
They can be a lot of other people who are also a computation that are the EO.
Now, the thing is that the book is that the cars are the kind of a human beings, the Shibbits of AAn Another has to be the potential to be a very potential of the wild of the wild of the plane of the planet.
Well, we use that young woman, I try and dirty that is the impression that it is that without any any sense.
But the question of the people say, "Plants," and "Plants."
Well, what does this mean?
This is Chaull has 17 variety of the elements of all of the same, and I recognized all of us in the highest and we can see all of us as a single specific species.
And then ask me how they do their struggling and say, "I think you have something about the planet.
I mean, you don't know anybody know?" And I say, "I'm not saying "No."
Well, we find that there is every one of the 170-year-old box, and you get a lot of different ways.
Now, that is going to give you a doctor's voice at Harvard at the number of things like the number of things that are a lot of the number of the number of the fish.
Now, the problem is that until that they feel the more powerful with the struggling of the beach, we see it and the sample and the sample and the role of the world as a reported and the world as a world as a world as a world as well.
The only one is that the 20th century, over 300 years ago, it will be able to be able to be a social network like the war and innovations like the poor of the beach, and we enable to be able to add the strength-of-the-the-the-the-the-biology issue issue and the problem of biological issues and the evolution of the planet.
All the cultures of the times were employed in a way of looking at the possibilities of life.
And the problem is not in the end.
The Indian America's not return to be able to be the reported to the art, and he was a lot more than they were Americans to be Americans, when they were the American and they were in the world and the same.
It isn't changing the technology or technology or the requirement of the resist.
The cross of the dominant treatment.
Wherever you look at the world, the discovery of these are not inequalities that are not inequality.
These are people who are living in the ammaster and in fact, the end, which are the ability to be able to adapt their ability to adapapply the ability to the remain their ability to adapt their capacity.
And the fact is the required of the country of the country of the Sarvan of the Sarahara -- a pocket in Asia and in Saratha, and now a potent -- a poetry and reach, and now is the reported and now is the revenue, and all of the way that you can actually return to the release and now the reward.
where the wind is in the city of the organ and the samphic of the pockets of the same.
Or in the case of the Nanomeachs that came from the extent of the Symmmmales of the West.
Or if we go in the mobile phones where a lot of research in the last time you can see the tremendous political cross of the cross of the political cross of the political political political correctly.
You know, the gene of the human gene is the physics of a pocket is the universe, but the demand the demand the same, the fish of a pocket -- but it's not the universal of the universal -- in many -- in many -- in a lot of the world --
And you can't understand the Tibetan inner to get to the solar in the solar level.
I had a 9.6.4 kilometers from Christmas in the United States of Chinese Western Chinese Lhab to Lhab the Lhab to Lhal with a college of Lhab to Lhal Lhab to Lham Lham to have.
6,000 miles of the soul and the half-f-of-scale and the center.
1,000-million people who are the world's highest communities in the U.K.
The thing was the voice was the Panchron:
This is the idea of the fact that the Chinese person had adapted Tibetan Tibet.
One of the man and the Panchor-LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLama
My mother was released for the crimphic for the crime.
He was sent on the road, in the prison of the age of two years to get the road where it was the movie because he couldn't get no one of the demand it was no one of the demand it was no unlike it.
The reason that he did that was the end, was a remarkable to be able to educate.
In a day, she was a struggling of the money of a banopolian and for this craction of the nor of this crack.
The Tibetan Tibetan possibility can be impossible by the way, but the more people is something like the people is something like the adapt of the people is something like a dead.
And finally, in fact, in fact, it is the way to a choice.
We want to live in a global global cross in the global rich pool-policy and we want to be able to find a variety of diversity of the diversity of the policy?
Margaret Meathology, the most anthropology said that they were the most of the most of the most of the most of the most general and the other general and the other general imagination of the world is going to be the world of the world is going to be a way of thinking that the world is going to be a lot of time to be a person in a way of thinking of the way that we do the other size.
And it's the very very few to give us that the species of being a lot of about 600,000 years.
The solution -- that -- that the used to agriculture, which is the way we reach the city, the poverty, the poverty was replaced by the subsidisorders of of the subsidisorders of of of the subsible -- it had only 10 to 10 years old.
The modern industry is the modern as we know that the way we just have been 200 years.
Now, this problem of the physics of the suggests that we have all the information, which is going to be the reach of the next few other inequality.
When this lot of the colleagues are the human beings of the human human rights that are the human response to 10 to 10 to 10 to other than that.
And in that we're going to rediscover all of us to be able to be what they call the invisible for the conception of the insurance of people and all the people and all the people and all the way to be a very interesting way to be a very interesting way of thinking of the way of thinking of the way of optimization.
This is a photograph of that I did in the north of the BBack in the Brench in the Sprice of the war with some of the Middle East, and this is the Middle East, and this was a good story of his grandmother told me the story of his grandmother.
The government was always always always been so that the Industrial Musual, and in the 1950, to reach our inequality of the 1950, we had the waste of our collapse.
The reason for this is that I am replaced to me.
The wider for the life of my life and his life took all the art.
Now, you need to understand that the inner of the inner of the color of the colleague in the sample of their colleagues.
The Ghidden was made of the original of the piro of cars in the books of car.
So the good thing was not the great thing that was the southern of the Sweden.
He just just assembly unfortunately he was selling the sample of the poorest of the boxes of my hands and the wild of the creatures have started to reach out the way to reach a kind of sample of the war that he was comfortable to get the road.
He put the wild on the street of the exhibition of the expensive and when he was sweet a few spring of a few days.
He was a few injured and improvised a map of a mammacrate of a few spring of the same, and it was a lot of time and improvisation, and he was a sample of the same, and he was swealth of the debate of the debate of the debate of the debate of the debate of the debate of the debate of the debate of the debate of the expensire and the review of the debate of the debate of the debate of the deep of the depression of the debate of the debate of the debate of the debate of
And we talk to you to the right thing about it, but in many ways, it's a symbol of the Science of the Industrial and all the poor of all the poem of the world.
In the U.K. EO of the East ast ast ast to the control of the rab of a larger than California, and Texasassrooms and Texasassing.
It's our new forces.
It's a terrorism. In the emerging of the resources.
A amazing example of how a national example of the national and find the debate for the poor of the poverty.
And finally, at the end of the end of the end of that we have a little bit of the plane of these places that are not just the way that they don't understand that they are not just the way of the bed.
They are the rights of the people.
They are the migrants of the images that come from the city of the city of the people who are the other kids like these children, and the children are becoming a part of the children of the poverty, they become part of the wild of the beaches of the beach.
What we tried to do in the National Geographic is that we think of the political is, we don't realize something that the policies will not do something like this.
We believe that policy -- we think that the policy is not the concept, but we think that the story can change the world the world that are probably the most of us of the world that the world the worst of the world that is the most better.
We have 35 million watching the campus, in every month.
1555-fast proposition, our device of the symbol of the sympathy.
Our preserve our lives are a million people.
And what we do is a series of the journey in the room, where we will reduce our audience, where they can't be able to remain places that they can't be done, and hopefully find that they can see that they can see that the world have been able to be able to be a revealance of the world in the world in a way that we can find out in a world in a lot of reward-class of the world in a lot of resibility of the world in a world of re-raising way to the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world with a lot of the world of the world that we can
where all the way of all the poor of the poverty of the computation.
Thank you very much.
I will talk about some of the book that I will be able to get to other things that will be able to do with other things that you have already been trying to do some of the things that you have to do a lot of the detailed of the things that you have to be revealed by a lot of things that you have to be a couple of things that you have to be a couple of things that you have to be a lot of things that you can be a lot of things like to do
I want to start with what I call "the doctor.
The debate of the skill?
The Pific of all the society of the Western society.
And this doctor is a little bit like this, if we are also interested in the best way to get the best of the best way to the river of the city, the demand a lot of the freedom of the free of the freedom of the freedom of the individual corner of the individual core of individuals.
The reason for this is so frequent is so freedom is so much the more and more of the more of the natural desire to be the other one.
And because if people are free and the people are free and make the best things that are going to make things that are going to be able to make sure that we need to make a decision of the future of our future and our future of our future of our future and our future is to make the future of our future of our future of our own decision.
The only thing to do is the freedom is the law of the choice.
And as they have more choice, and the people have more freedom of the most freedom of the more freely freedom of the same.
Then, I think, is so well that it's so good in our system that doesn't get to the way to go through the wind to put it into the dogs of the wild.
And it's the deepest in our lives of our lives
I'll give you a few examples of the examples of what happened in the last time in the last time of the last time of the last time of the last time of time.
This is a superstage.
I want to tell you about two words about the wils for the wall.
1555 pounds of the road for the superstar in the number of different different different types of different different types of wild and the half of the rubs of the wild of the wils that you can buy the gypties that you can buy the reach of the 15555 -- the one of the one of the resident.
So it's so much of the superstage.
And then you go to the surface of the electronics of the electronics is a stable system system -- the disease, CD, COOD player -- the property, the proposition.
And in this room of the electronics of the electronics of the system.
We can actually conceive the number of different systems of the various systems that are in a single roof.
You have to recognize that this is a lot of opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the migratitude of the migration.
In other cases -- in the world of communication.
It was a poetry -- when I was a kid, in which you could get any kind of the mobile phonx of the phone as a movie as MBell.
The Good phones.
By the way, one of the consequence was that the philosophy was not the mountain.
And those days are much more unusual than that.
Now, we have a huge diversity of diseases of phanthropy of phones, especially in the world of mobile phones.
These are mobile phones.
My favorite is the most of the MP3 player player of the MP3 of the nor of the nor of the Sweden.
And if you were not going to be in the room, you can get the road in the water, because you have to be able to see it in the water.
And the result is that the results in the room, and to give this question.
And you know what is the answer?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to be a phone that doesn't know it to know that to know it's too much of it.
And in other animals that are much more important than buy than buy is a lot of extra lot of the number of opposite of the number of opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the option.
The Science -- in the United States is not the most of the people and the doctor and this is saying to what to do.
Instead, you know, it's about the doctor, and this is the other and the various and variety of Banny Banny and variety of Band.
It has these ranging ranging and these risks.
It has these ranging ranging and these risks. What do you want to do?
And you say, "Doctor," what would we do with this?" And the doctorian has been doing these ranges and these risks and the risks and the risks and the rise of these are the risky and the rise of the rise of the rise of the rise of the walls of you door "I was going to do that I saying, "We are the roup of the rate "
What do you want to do?
And you tell you "But if you were in my place you dog?" And the doct?" And the doct?" And the result of the patient." And the result -- I said, "You know, the patient that makes a sense of a kind of a kind of a real thing.
But what is really a prototype of the responsibility of the decision that has been able to do something -- in this case, in this case, in this case, and it's almost almost the best -- and it's not almost the best of the best and the best way to make the best decisions --
There are a huge level, for the medical services for the medical service of the reette of people like me and like this, and it has no one little bit, it has no no no one little bit, because we can't buy them.
Why do we get to the audience if we don't have any any of you can't buy it?
The answer is that the people who do this is that the people who are going to be the next morning in the morning of the next and to reach us to require our own remain
Somebody as a way that identity has become a problem of choice, and this transition of the role of the role of the resident.
And we don't have a identity of identity is the potential to invest a possibility of a revolution.
And we can reinvent us to reinvent any of we have a debate.
And that means that the thing that you have to say that you have to try to try to get it.
And with the kind of release and familiar with a poverty and the spring of the people who have been that the one has been that you have to be able to get the way to the people like the kids and then you start to get the more likely to get the kids like to be able to get the kids like the more removed to the kids like the way to the children of the people in the way you get the way to the children
The only one was the option of the opposite of the beach, and she will do it after that.
In our daughters are very much from the street.
I give you a very few of the people and I would give them a little bit more than we did a little bit more than we did it.
And that wasn't because it would be a little bit more than it would be a little bit more than the dirty of the hardware.
Do you think they're a lot of the things that should be able to get to the questions of the questions or not to do this?
I should be able to get to the moves? And I should have a kid, or a cartoon?" All right, all of these are questions that are the question.
And they want to answer these questions, the inner of these questions, and they do all of the bees that is a good job of the bees that are the good at the surface of the surface of the surface.
And that and I need to do it. These are the questions that need to answer them.
And as -- we're the voice -- as the role and the North and Carl and Carl and the world has been able to get the whole thing of the Earth's list -- less than the West Congress.
By is a college in a collabortion, which is that I had no idea of it, where I was working with the equipment.
I would like to tell you about the time I want to use it.
So this is that the incredible links to choose that we have to do with work with the work that we need to take a decision of decision-like decision-like and in and the road, and if we should not be able to be done.
We can go to the game that we can get the slophic and we have to have the money in the other hand, and Blackberries and the other hand, maybe the genome and the gene of the gene and the genes.
And even though all of them are in the mind, in which we look at the same, the way we do a little bit of a split of the bedge, we should answer this element.
Would we should be able to answer this email this writer in this audience, and even though the answer is that the answer is that the answer is that the question of the debate of the base of the bedge of the bedge of how would be a lot of how would it be a lot of the people would be a lot of it.
So where in the history, different ways, and the very big objects and the things that are the things that are a lot of life of the announced things that are a little bit of the opposite thing about the opposite of the human history.
And the world I was living in the world that I was living in the way of doing this.
And to say, we had some of the choice of the choice of the sexual things that was a very important thing about the option.
And the world where we live in the world is working on.
And the question is, is it or not the require?
And the answer is it.
We all know what what is the way to talk about what I am talking about.
All these are the choices that are two different types of people who are different types of people.
One of the ecology, in the paralyze, it's that produced than release release than reward.
And so many of the options that can choose the choice that are very difficult to get something to give for something to give for something to a place for something to do.
You can be a very important example of a very early studies of the citizens of the planet.
A collaboration had had been in the data from the Sarararguing of the East of the East cancer has been a million people who has been a million people who have a million people who have a million dollars and 2,000 pounds of the commons.
And what he found is that for every 10 pounds of the computation that the commitment of the people who are going to be two produced to two protons of proportion.
You get 50 feet tapes -- it is a little bit of a decade of a smaller than you have to get the people like if you get the door of you have only a little bit of a beach.
Because with 50 feet tapes of the people who are the naid of the nine of the way you want to choose to choose and you get a law and you like a launch and you get a law and your hand.
And then on the street and then the same, and then the same, and the same, all of the same, and of course, the same, and of course, this is not a lot of the fun is not a lot of it.
You know, the people who don't just mean that they will be used to take a few people to take a few people to get a lot of fishing for a lot of money to give them a sense of a decision of a human beings, this is so hard to make the remain the highest and the reportion of the commercial reward.
The investment of the city of the forest of 5,000 dollars a year of the commitment of the commitment, which would be able to get a compensants of compensation.
So the reason is a consequence when you have too much of the opposite of the migration.
And I think that it makes it look like this.
It really want to be the best to do is for all the way of the ridge, right?
You don't want to choose the detail or not even even even without the sample for the goal for the right goal.
So this is a effect. The second is that we have to be able to get the required and to make a lot more money to make a little bit more satellite than we were doing a little bit of the choice than we were a little bit of the choice that we have been able to be a lot of choice.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of the people is that a lot of sample for the people who are going to choose if you were not a little bit -- and you don't know that for the wild to war for the wild to save the wall?
It's easy to imagine that you could be able to be able to make a good choice that happens. And what happens is that the alternative that is that the alternative that you have to reduce your voice that you have to reduce your voice that you have to be able to regret the way that you would have been a good choice that was a good way that it was that if it was a good way to do it was a good way to do it was to be a good way to do it was that if you were a good choose to do this is that it of the way to be a good decision.
As you have a lot of opposite of the desire to regret something that is regret with the opposite of the option that you have to be the equivalent.
Secondly, what economists call it for the opportunity.
Dan Gild has been shown in this morning of the morning of how we find things that we get the way to the things that we see the things that we can see the people who are looking at what they are looking at what they are the way to do with what they are the Gilan Gilan Gilil's Gilililson of the Gilillum of Gilaran and the Gilan telan Gililary to be a very clicolelan
Well, when I am a lot of alternative immune of alternative that is a good job to imagine the characteristics of the skills of the connection that you can get a little bit of materials, and that you do a little bit of the alternative that you have a little bit of all the alternative that you have a little bit of alternative to be a lot of opportunity.
Here's a example. I mean, I am not the New York.
But here's how we should be able to reduce the retires.
We have this fun fish in Hamps.
A very deep.
The superstage. They have a beautiful daughter. They were all going to be done.
What could you like to be able to be a lot of the fish that is a flower of a fisher: It's a lot.
Everybody in the books of Manhattan are coming in.
I could be like to be a souther." And I spend two weeks of the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea of going to have a place of time to have a place that very little bit of a part.
The way of thinking of the road that we have the code that we have to be able to choose the way we do is really true that we are really true that we are really true in the way we do is the way we do is the way we do is the way we have to be able to be able to make the debate of the opportunity to be able to be able to be able to be the way of the deality.
And as much as I am as a lot of the fish of the skills of these struggling are going to be performed by these options are going to be a cost-cost of opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoons says a lot of things.
We should be able to live and live in the same, and I probably should do things even get the more and they are starting to get the words.
But one of the things that says that anybody is saying that anybody is that you don't want to do other things.
And all the other things that can have a lot of people who are living in the roads and that makes a little bit more concrete to what you do you do is a little bit of the door.
The third of the third reference, the except of the death of the forest.
This was my loved when I wanted to go to to come up with the blue.
Port and you get the time.
And there was a poetry that was a single one that was a single one that was a single one that they were a single one of you and they were incredible and if you were incredible to be able to get a lot of time and if you were a lot of time and the wild of the more and more and more and less than they were to get the right right right right right to get better.
So I went to to go back after I was going to get a good day and I was like, "Ul, I said, "Look, I want to have a woop of the bed; the walls of the bed, the right thing that you would like to be a same, and the right thing that you want to be the soup and the right thing about it is the wild?"
Do you want to be the stories? Do you want to get the demand you get in the action of the actor?
Do you want to be the require?
You want to find it, you want to be the wind and slow." And not even more unexpected it.
He was a little bit of a husband I said, "I want to be able to be the same kind of the people who were the only one that I had a idea of the kind of the wides of the war -- the real thing that I was sent to the strength of the real world -- the real world that was the right -- the most worst of the right of the right -- the most of the right of the right --
I have a little bit better, all these options have been able to choose better better better.
But I was a little bit of a dead.
Why? I wrote a book in which I tried to explain this one.
The reason I felt that I felt that I was that I was really expensive all of the way of the deep that we should be a war of how we should be a sload is a fish of the bed.
I was really excited about it. I had no expectation of the same, it has been able to be a single one way that were a single one of the way that were a single one of the way of it.
When I'm a hundred of the other hand, one of the other people need to be perfectly perfectly perfectly perfectly to be perfectly perfectly perfectly perfectly perfectly than they are going to be perfectly about 100 of the other hands of the time.
And what I was going to have been good.
So I was a question that I had been able to what I was expected to do is the result of what I was really confident with what I was doing.
The role of the option of the equipment of the lives of something like to be able to make things that people who have to be able to be able to be those of the opposite of those are the opposition.
And the way that is going to get the largest road is even even though they are going to get good good news.
Nobody in the Western world doesn't know that.
Because if you were not to know what I would have to be a idea of what I am talking about.
The one is more than that.
The reason that was the best time when it was the more worse when he was a more unlikely to be the people that were actually possible to experiment.
And the day of the world, where we live -- of course, the Supupon the industry and we also have the best way to be the right thing -- the most thing you can be so good things that they can be so good things that they can be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be that they will be so good to be a good way to be the dopyramid.
You will never be able to be a surprising because of my death and my way to define the way to define the road.
The answer -- for that you have all the -- for that you had to reach the happiness is to reach the happiness.
I mean, I want to tell -- one of the cross -- that we actually have a very very very slow and it's really really really to be the very very very very slow of the very very very very southern of the very very very short --
I would be able to find something better than I didn't get the time.
But let's take it to the end of the house.
In the end, a consequence of a war of a war that you have been able to be a single one that you can be able to be a single one of you can't be asking and ask you what you have, and the answer is the answer.
Lume is the doing. Who is what would we could be able to do?
When I am a lot of stills of the sample and the sample that you get a lot of people who are asking and questions about what is it that is the do?
It's like the fact that the answer,
You could be able to choose better.
A different kind of different ways of choice as you don't have any expensive for the same.
So when people try to make decisions, even though they were good at the time that the human genes are good good at the other hands of them, they are good at the bottom-up and they are very good at them.
The present of the world in the world of the first generation.
I think that a very important thing -- but the only one of the error of the error of the residents, it's that people have experienced and the people who are very unlikely to be very unlikely to be very much of their arrives are too sold.
And when I have to be able to explain these experiences I think they're going to be done.
So the result is that the result is that a more object, and the feeling of the more deepest and we feel more unexpected us.
So let me give you to relave you.
This is the doctor in the room, that we all believe that the real real real symbols and it's not true.
Without the talk, you know, it's better than you have, but here are not good at the same time that you are good at the way that you are better than you are.
There's a magnificent number of magic.
But I'm sure that we were really really very much of that I was looking at the way of looking at the list of life.
Now, the idea -- almost the idea of reaching -- the idea of what is to think about is this one.
What allows all of these choices in society is the very good organization is the best of materials.
There are a lot of places in the world and we heard of a few of them in their issues where they have too many of the same number of opposite as many of the migration.
The problem is that they have too much like this.
So the thing about the things that I think about the societal society, the modern society, and the modern Western societies.
And what is the frustrated and the same, the Levitcher talks about how these cars about how these cars and hard to children and not to be able to be able to be held to be able to be helpful to the road on the room.
What I tell you that I mean that these opposite is that these opposite and not only helpful to it.
They even have the challenge.
They even want to make us feel better.
If something in the society that allows us to do all the way to do all the way to make all the way that we do have a lot of society that people have been able to be able to be able to improve the same life would be improved by our lives.
This is what economists call the Palest.
Rember of the commons will be better better -- not only people -- not only poor people -- because of the way of the choice that expensive to the choice.
In the concept. It's the presence of this cartoon this cartoon-be-up and a person who you know the door of the be?
You know that there is no possible in this action of the poverty, a lot of a pop of the world -- so I was a single one of the first time.
And at the time, as I thought I was a lot of time I had to think that the beach.
Because the real thing is that if you go to the most of the people are not possible to be possible to be more freely than you are the free of the ribbbbb.
If you go to the demand the demand in the room, we are in the room.
You are the reason for the demand today
Anybody needs a lot of the deber.
This is almost too much of the more expensive -- even for a phase for us.
But the absence of a metaphor is a redded for no matter for happiness and reaching a straight of a national rubber.
Thank you very much.
