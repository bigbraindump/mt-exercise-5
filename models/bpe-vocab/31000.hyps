And the year we looked at these two diet positions to demonstrate that the big polar polar polar that in the last three million years of the last three million years of the last three million years of the big amount of big seven, which was the little amount of flower than 40 percent of the Earth.
But this morning, this is serious problem because it doesn't look at the size of the size of the size of the boss of the boss of the country.
The polar is in a way that the heart of the global climate system.
She was expanding the finger and the flower finger fingers.
The next next step that I will show you will show you a lot of what happened in the last 25 years.
Ghe's pemancy is the marcably married.
As you can see the white white flower inchis.
This is the anual annual on the street.
And it goes to the summer.
Asad the guy, the fecal guys, with a old old or more than it is almost like the sanger you can see that it's almost like a body of a body.
In the 225-year-old years to this one.
This is a problem because the inner is the challenge of the flow around the ocean around the ocean around the audience around the audience around the audience of the ocean in the article because of the ocean in the audience.
Which is a massive amount of carbon quality that when it comes to the fish, it's sweet in the micro-organisms.
Comparing with pollution of the global warming of global warming will take this into the atmosphere could take this point of extreme possible.
Alaska little lacks in the Alaska is in Alaska is the soup of the water is the soup of the water.
The Katey Walter Walter Walter was on the Alaska little terea's team at another lac of the team at another lack of the past.
Oh, oka! The Go! The question is OK if we are going to be then.
And a reason is that enormous "wor" is the Grenots in the north of the north of the north of the north of the north.
This is a rare all over the annual everybody.
But the volume are much more than that.
This is the Kangerussuain the Swin the Sround Groom.
If you want to know how the big creation of the big base of the topier on the street of the soup where it comes in the big place.
These debate very quickly.
And at the other end of the planet, Antarctica of the world's biggest monster on the planet on the planet
The last last last last few people have reported as the end of the continent of the continent of the Antarctica bunch of Antarctica, which is submarine submarine sulfur from the island of the island of the insult of the income all over the fast ways.
This is the equal in the big levels of the big level, as in Groenland.
In Himalaya, the great guy, the third side, on the street, on the street of the new formats, which was the new formats, which was the bonds.
40 percent of the population of the population of the world of the water in the water of these topirs.
In And, this guetime is the source of the water water for this one.
And the algae range.
But when it goes to the same way that it happens.
In California was a 40-percent of the flow in Sierra Sierra.
This is the water reducing rainforest.
And predictable, as you read it out.
On the entire global hase has been driving a dramatic creative creature.
And disasters on all the globe, they have absolutely great, and the fall of the fall of the time.
four times more of the last 30 years in the last 30 years of the 75 years of the age of the 75 ancient of the 75 years.
This is an absolutely unsustainable model of it.
If you look in context you can see what happens.
In the last five years we add the last 70 million tons of dioxide in every 24 hours of the ocean in every single day.
And here is going to take the end of the rest of the United States, walking up to the Western Indian where the subcontinent of Indian where the subcontinent of the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the rest of the ocean in the rest
The biggest because the only one of the global warming global global warming, which repressed 20 percent of it, is the reviewer of the fossil of fossil fuels.
The page is a problem and the grandgrandgrandgrandgrandmother.
The United States is one of the two great emitting applications.
And the proposition was to build a lot more factory for good cars.
But we start to see a whole change.
Here are the ones that have been the last last last years with the environmental alternative alternative to be propose.
All right, there is a policy of our country in our own own own policy.
And the carbon industry and the oil, the oil and the oil spill.
And the good news to what is a rich rich oil.
This image of a reminder of something.
In the Kracian Cracial in Tennesian alopian alopia was imprastid.
You'll probably see the stirts.
This is, on the top of the taribbbbble-prevent Council Crace.
One of the great reclams of the good books of Cracia, was this one.
Video: ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ The man is the book, the grandmother is a sletter and sets her girl.
It's from abundance, here in America, and it helps to make economic crease.
Frosty, the man with the good book, it becomes the things that go on the day and more curriculum.
It's also a blind and adorable workers are slowly soup swees.
Al Gore: This is the great character in Virginia in Virginia West.
The most of the great beston the great career is the great seedy of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenn: I want to be clear the far. Thanks -- the Nanks of the Nanks of what I talk about.
Al Gore: So the Aligain, for the Climit has launched the next campaign.
This is one of them, a part of one of them.
Video: Actually, CALy CALy new climate change in our business changes like our business.
And that's why our main is to spend a lot of money for food for food for food to help us show us about the good force to help us look at the good book.
The real thing is, in fact, the good books is not dirty the grandmother.
We think it's curved -- and I think -- and I have good and good.
So you won't get to the climate change for climate change for climate change.
You know that in our way.
Video: Actor: The good news is a great great bunch of it.
So let's make a look at this kind of a cafeteria of installation of the book of the cartoon the cartoons.
I said, "Masinaria is a noise.
But that's the sound of the technology of the good technology of the good book.
And as the good books are the main the main the world of the global warming technology technology to the technology of the good technology of the good book.
Look at the same time is this is technology today to be the technology of the good book.
Al Gore: In the alternative advice is the positive economic challenge of the economic challenge and the problem of security and the problem of security and the problem of the nationality.
Video: Nard: America: The crisis, the economy, economy, the climate crisis.
The thing that is the leading of all the dependence on the bottom of the forest of the forest of the forest: the good news but oil.
But now we have a new solution to the unbelievable to the incurcle to the incurious one.
You can potentially take America with electricity 100% curate, in 10 years ago, in the next 10 years ago.
A plan to put America in the entire world, and then they do more meaning and help us stop the global warming.
In the end, a solution that is to help us solve our problems.
You can turn America. You get America. You get more and more like.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: It's about the re-in-rising re-in-rising re-in-rising America.
One of the most difficult ways to release the most rapidly anothers of the old bustils that we killed our planet that is here -- the Life is here Vicy, the Life is here -- the Life is here -- the God of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the most rapidly enough.

Al Gore: Exista proversion of the African who says, "If you want to go down the right thing to go down the only one --
If you want to get it to get it back.
We need to get it to get it back.
Thank you very much.
And the year at TED, I did a LHC.
And I promised to come and give you a data data about how this is working.
So this is what they hadn't been here, the LHC is not the biggest experiment, which was the biggest scientific experiment -- the Cumphilosophy Street Street is to create the consistent of a billion feet of the consister of a billion feet of the universe -- the flower of the 1600 billion times a second.
It's extremely quick to be so much more than that.
This is the Genevely.
We do the photograph of these mines of the "Big Bang" in the footprint.
I work at this point. It's called ATLASS -- Lunders -- Lunneline of 22 meters of a 22 meters of ATLALS here is in the construction of the ATLALSS in construction.
On the age 10 seven, we went to the first time on the first time.
And this image was made of ATLALAS.
He caused a great celebration in the room.
It's a picture of the first piece of particle that has been quote to the LHC, the LHC, SHC, SHC system is a part of the LHC is detector.
In other words, when I saw that image 10 seven-seven-the-the-function device that is a huge success.
I don't know that if that he got the biggest best, or that, when somebody went on the Google and I saw it as the first page of the same same.
It means that I did a cultural impact on the stream of the intelligent impact of the intelligence impact on the end.
And then about a week I had a problem with the device that actually had to do with these days, these days, these days, these days, these daily best.
Those are a transportation of the falls when the car works.
Now, engineers in the rooms and say, "You can't transport." They're a little bit of the attack of the slawying."
But I can do this because when they're at temperatures become what they call the superconductive of the superconducting.
So as a 271 degree -- the hospital the hospital between the stars, those are the cold of these steps can transport these box.
On one of the layer of the laws of the LHC, was a factory of factory --
So as the company has been sweet a little bit, and the 13 thousand-ended resistance of electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impression, that is more than 20 tons of tons and moved over 20 tons and they moved almost 30 cast.
So we determine about 50 magnetic magnetic
I had to take the outside, which is what we have to do.
I reconcusion, we repair to the top, we repair it.
And now we take magnetic in the subteran.
And at the end of the March of the March of the Mars of the LHC will be like new stories.
We will start to get it from the time and get us to get data in the unity, and we're going to keep the research of the universe that are the tools of the universe.
Now, of course, that in a way, those accidence accident of the important scientists and engineering, is the important thing to break down to the extreme is going to break down the way.
I think that it is so much more difficult to do it is so much more and more inalso, this is the important thing to the experts like LHC.
And so I'm going to leave the words of a scientist Humphrey Davy, Humphrey Davy, which, I think that the units protected experiments that was Michael Faraday, "Nic" is not more dangerous to the human mind is not more perhaping our science are not the same mythical triumps, as are not the same mysterious as not as our sterious as are not the same mysterious as are find."
Thank you.
I want to start with the rate of the child, when you play with the board, you will play with box.
And on the top of the source you to get them and get them to get them and get them to the bump them in a few intelligent problems.
The hope of the spatial is profoundly a lot of the world of inconception.
So, in the quality of the Runit of IT interviewed by our physical interactions with our physical objects, -- impression, my physical consultant of my Jeevan Kalan's collaborator -- we would start to enter the computer of this unique -- we would be when we use a computer to the entire digital cursor a computer that would be so much more digital dying.
And it turns out how to not?
And this question was so much of the fascinating as we hooked the researcher answer, we had the answering Sisset.
In short, Siftable is a computer interactive of the size of a bisckets.
They can be manufacturer -- they can perceive the forest can perceive the other one and a radio screen and a radio of the base of the wireless of the wife.
The most important is that they're palpable, like the game, like the game, you can just just just as they apply it to the mom and you get them out of them.
And Sif-the example of an example of an ecosystem to be the digital manipulation of the digital manipulation of the digital power of the digital power of the digital remain of the digital world.
In the great source of what these instruments are becoming more and more constitute to their mission of other, and the consists of the nutrients of our nutrients and destroyed new and destroyed.
I'm going to start with simple.
This Sifting is configuring out the video, and if it is a video, and if it is the movie television of the other part, if you include in the other part, they are the window.
These are the interactive interactive are the ones that are the other side of the other.
So, if I put them one of the other.
If they are inconcepted and they will get a little bit of confused in confused in the confused to be a little bit of a confused in the confused in the concusion, and if they are unconfidented in the concusion, they will be a little bad, and they will become a little bit.
And they can also feel the mission and inclining.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of interacting is that we can use the muscle has no choice to manipulate the data, how we would be to put the data that we would be to the cold a liquid of a liquid of a liquid of a liquid of the very much of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction is that
In this case, we have three Switwitwitnesses like yetets, and they can use it to the center in the center of the center, where they will be among the center of the center, where they want to be among the one of the case.
If we can get too much, we can take it a little bit of back.
There is also a interesting possibility for education, like how it would be games and logical symmetries and logical senses that we want to want to try to see the results of the things that are immediately immediately immediately to see the results of the immediate results.
So here I -- this is a Fibonacy, which is a simple program that I do with a simple program of equation.
Here we have a game game of the words of the words of the Wabble and Boggles.
And so in every single first first of the first first one letter on every Sif, and the main which the shapes the motor of the words -- they are great, they are greened with a diction-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-enter votionary of each other.
And then after about 30 seconds of the letters of the letters of letters, and you have a new set of letters and new possibility of intimate.
Thank you.
These are the kids who came in the Media Laborator Law to the Media Laborator and remains to the way and filmmaker a material.
They like them to die.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of applications is that you don't have to give them a lot of instructions.
All you have to say is "From the words and they know exactly what to do.
Here are others who are people who are asking them.
This is the most tank, the other test of our right way.
It turns out that everything that he wanted to do was to make the Siftable of one over the other.
So for him was just a cupy.
This is an application of animating.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who invent language.
And this is Felix.
He can put us on the stage, just the stage of those Switwitches on the movie that they find their personal
And that's where the sunlight switch.
Video: The answer.
David Merrill: Now he introduced a stage in the stage.
Video: The interface of the portrayer.
Very yeah.
When Sweet the sun and assume it can put them on one of the other person can make the characters of the people to interact -- Video: Ham!
DM: It takes her own nart.
Video: Oh, yeah.
DM: It's a open-up story, and he decided, and he decides.
Video: The peak pyo!
DM: And the last example that I have time to show you today is a tool, and interpretation of the live of the work that we built the recently, and the role of sound that we would be rhythm and all bad.
Each of these are four different variations that you want to use it.
And you can inject the sound of a succession that you can have asasasasasasasasased the guy as well.
The sound is the soup of the sound of the sound of a Sweet Stall of successful to success.
There are effects that you can control the lights, like the reverberary and the film.
You ask, you ask, and then you can also get it to help it to help it reach it to give it to the way it is.
And they are the general effects like the foot and the volume of the intrees of the income in the His to see it.
Video: DM: And I will start with a riting rito in the second Switch in a serious amount of it, we would also take a serious amount of it.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: DM: Now adcent the fingertips.
Video: And now I'm going to add the top, to control the top, to control the lights.
Video: DM: You can get the insects of the inclining inclining in a part or the other.
Video: I will like this baggas for a bas for more expression.
Video: YM: And I can do the long time in the long time.
So I don't have to do the plan, they can improvise, previous or a bunch of the walker.
Now, eventually, I can receive the whole bagging of the Sifwscscan of the volume of the volume of the trip of the sun in the stag.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is my passion of new interfaces that are right to the way that they work better with our brain and our body body of our brain and our body body body body and our body.
And we had time to show you a coordinate coordinate this new spatial of design, and a few of the possibility that we try to take out of the lab.
The Ganda that I want to retiny is that we are at this new general tools of interacting with the new tools that will bring the digital rules that will bring information into our world.
Thank you very much.
And so I think about.
I'm a writing bonds.
He wrote the books is my teacher, but it's more than that.
It's all my mom and fascinating the love of a life of a life.
And I don't have that this to change the time.
But that was like, something like this, and a little bit of life in the neighborhood of my career who determined me to receive me to the work with work.
And the strange thing is that I wrote this very book, this is the "Manana, the Roags, Iubeste," which is the Rageste," which is the great way of any other people who have the books of any other people who have been so important that the reason why I became this international seller that is so important that the international seller seller that was this international bid.
The result is that anywhere in the case, people go away.
Serios -- the confused to the nuts;
So for example, in the enemy and they say, "You don't know -- it's the theme -- you don't have the good news to you can't even do it more passworry about it?
You don't know that you will continue to write your life on the top of your life that is going to take a book on the world that ever fear the world on that ever wo?"
It's very linked to true.
But it would be more rich if they didn't know about 20 years ago, when I started to marriage people -- I started to marriage -- I want to become a teenager -- I want to become a writer, I wanted to get the same African reaction of the same African reaction of the same African reaction of the same African reaction of the same African reaction of the same way that I was not a way of the same kind of as a result of the people --
And people were saying, "Not to be the theme as you haven't have no more success?"
You don't know that the human beings will be going to be killed to kill your ide?
You don't know that your fear that your life in this field of life in this field of the field of here and you will never have a dream of the flying of the flying of the flying of the flying of the flying of the flying of the heat with the heat of the heat of the heat to the whole bunch of your neighborhood of the entire field of your life in this field of the field of the entire field of the field and this field of the field of the field of the field of
Something like this.
The answer -- the short -- the answer to all those questions is """""""Yeah."
Yes, you feel the theme of all of those things.
And it always meet.
And you feel the theme is the end, and they don't have any other things that they can't intuitive.
As an example of the big algorithms that are crying.
But when it's about the work that I was always thinking about the last time I have the last time for the last time is "Why?"
Is this a rational?
It's the logic to do it is to be the work that they feel like to do that they feel like to do this Pame.
And what is so specific initiative of creative creative creative that seems to us in the support of healthcare in a way that other teaches don't do it?
My father was the attempt was an engineer chemistry and not remember as a engineer of the 40-year-old engineering, it is a chemical engineer to be a chemist.
It wasn't happened, John, how does the chemicicics?
It's just not going to be happening.
But as we are certainly chemists, as a group of chemists, as a group of sequences of being alcools of being maniactive maniacative maniacative maniacative al-pressures.
We write the inss; we have this reputation, and not just written -- but the artists, and the artists, and it turns out that this reputation of being a human reputation to be powerful in the real sense.
And we have to do is to look at the numbers of mortging the 21st century, in the 20th century, in the 20th century, which have died by the young people who died by young people and often died by the way, and often often often often worth of their own man.
And even those who didn't have the own one peak on the own destruction of their own own own own talks.
Norman Mailer, even before the last interview, in the last interview, he said, "Each me my book, she said, "Each me a little bit more more than my book."
An extraordinary ary ary work on your own own own life.
But they don't have the cloud when we hear somebody else on the sad because we heard these things like things that we heard a lot of things that we have absorbed and unacceptable the idea of creativity and the idea that creativity and the unfortunate of the creative and the art's end, it will lead it all into a hurt, it will always lead to the end of the meaning.
And the question I want to add this is that you all of this is all the idea, are you all the idea?
You can comforget -- because as it looks like like the library of the library of the library of this Aipotea.
I think it's stopped.
And I also think it's dangerous and I don't want to see it in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage the great artist's to travel to the big artist to try.
And I know the case of my case, in my situation -- -- it would be very dangerous for me to the neighborhood of this applied the neighborhood of this is a circumstance.
As for example, I'm a pretty tank, we just just about 40 years.
We probably probably have the four years of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of four days.
And it's probably probably that all of what I'm going to write this moment to be judge by the work that came after the work that came after my career was the reference of the last book, right?
What would be to say to the men, because of the same way in the same way here we are all the best successful of my best successful to be happened.
Oh, God, what God!
This is the kind of gas to put it on the way to the near the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I want to make this message that message that I love it.
And then, the question is what it means: howe?
And so I think it would be a lot of meditation, that I need to work now, to try to make it a kind of a psychological construction, right?
I had to say, in a way to find a way to fear a distant distant distant that the mom that write, the famous thing to do is now before before we were in the way before I write what he wrote at what he was writing.
And as we all look at the last year in this sense, we started to look at the time, and I asked to find other society to see other society to see how if they could have better ideas to be held to be held to be held of how to make people creative risk to be held inherent to the risk of the risk of the risk of the risk of the risk of the risk of the risk in this sense.
This is the research has been taken me in Greece and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma Roma and Roma Roma Roma is that he went out to this this research has been taken me to me this in Greece.
So the next one, you know, the certainly inchitches the sky.
But in Grection Grection and Rom's Rom's received people don't think the creativity of the human being, right?
People thought that creativity was a spirit was a income come from people from a source to people from a source and unintelligent and unintelligent and unintelligent and unintelligent and uns.
The footage of these spirits of creative creatures of the famous equipment of the terrorists.
Socratic was famous because he believes that he has a department that the wish of the wisdom of the wildlife in the department.
The Romenter had the same peak, but they called the immoral spiral of the genius.
What is great, because they don't think they have a very good individual genius was a very long individual als.
They thought a genius was a kind of magical entity that the magical entity of the wall the way of artist's walls, in a way that Dobbby, the sweet of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the workforce of the workers of the workers of the workers of the workforce of the worker wastedom of the worker, which is the result of the work
Absoldier -- this is the distant that is the distant that I talked about the psychological construction that you can protect your work of the workforce of the workforce of the workforce of the workforce of the workforce of the workforce of the worker -- that's the way to the works.
And all the world is that this is working that way.
So the artist was protected by certain things, like certain things, like too much narcisism, right?
If you have the work was straluca, you couldn't all the way to her, the whole world for her, the whole world of the base that has helped us do it.
If you think about it was criticized, it wasn't completely the south, it doesn't it?
Everybody stand as the genius as the genius was kind of ignorant.
And so they looked in Vest Vest creativity for a long time of time.
And then came to the Renasting and everything that was change, the great idea of the great idea of the great person to put the man in the center of the universe of all the mysteries of all the mysteries that receive the state of the world that received from the desire to the desire the revenue.
It was the human switch and people started to create the creative creatures that the creativity of the individual of individual individual individual people.
And for the first time in history in the history of people started to refer to each other between artists, in place to get a genius.
And it must be married, I think it was a huge error.
And you can see, a simple person, a simple person, and it's actually the receive the receiver, as the receive and the mysterious and the mysterious good's sell, created, created, created, the unexpected of the fragile psychic for the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile gence of the fragile
It's like you have a few clever houses of the house.
And just inco-inco-ended and they make all these astetheless catastewots on the performance.
I think that the pressure of this killed us one after the last 500 years of the last 500 years.
Well, if it's true, and I think that is, the question is, what do we do?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we go back to the older senses of the relationship between people and the mysterious myself.
It may not.
Maybe we can't just want to sterile human human rationational-minded talk, by a little talk.
And it probably as a public question that would raise the meaning of the science of the scientific questions on the the, in fact, which actually lead people present the world press and all the people present around the projects over the projects over the projects over the projects over the projects over the projects over the audience of the audience that would be in the audience that would be a lot of the science of the world that is that they would be the same scientists
And you may not be coopt to this idea.
But the question I want to ask is -- why not?
Why don't we think about this in the way of this thing?
Because it has sends the way that anything else we've heard about anything that we heard about the inner skills of creative process.
It is why anyone who has been asked to create something -- basically all of the ones here -- it doesn't always use.
And in fact, sometimes it can put it in the right paranormal.
I had a reference of where I met the American American Rutch of the American Rutch of the American Rutch that was now about 90 years and that was the bridge that was the bridge of the country that she told me when her child was going to work on the room, and it just told me that she told me that she told me and she feels and she just hearing a poet on the room, and he just hearing a poetry to work on the room.
The story was like a vast vast rich of the air.
And it was a catching over the rops.
And it turns out, because it's income is the yellow of the flow under the legs.
In that moment has one thing to do, and that is, "Let's get the applataaaway" as a applataa."
And they go to the mark to the marine the marine of the stage of the map of the map and a piece of map and a bunch of map and to the way it was doubt to the map.
Sometimes it wasn't enough enough to be a lot of it and runs and running it and runs up in the house and the people and the people and the people and the people would lose and the people will lose the robust and the people who were going to lose the room, I read the other poet in the room of the room, and I read the other poet."
They were also the moments in which -- and this is not going to look at the story that the story that almost almost loss in the loss.
And the house, the case of the main and the moon and the car and the car drive the product that the drive the person to the other person and the story that he was received by the other man's and the other man's cleaning and the street.
And the result of the cool of the coal, and then it turns out what it is the math.
In fact, the case, the people on the top of the perfect map of the perfect and it's not a last time at the first one worst of the first worst worse.
When I heard it -- it's the suprantum of my own creates my own creative process of creative process.
My creative process doesn't match it doesn't limit to that -- I'm not driving it.
I'm a catching where I work on the same way to go to the same day, and they are going to be able to stand and smoke.
But even I mean, in my inner and I was so much to me and sometimes that I was so --
And I imagine that as the same as many of you.
And I had projects or ideas that they were able to make me from a source that I don't know it to be a identify identify to it.
And what do you present all of this?
And how to prepared us to report us to the mind, as we don't lose our minds, the right thing to help us reach our heals?
For me, the most relevant example of how we can do is what we do is the music of Tom Waits, we took a bunch of the Waits, we took a lot of the review.
I was talking about this subject and all of this is almost all the way to the enemy of the artist of the Chinese contemporary of the Chinese contemporary of these impulses, to control these impulses.
With the time it was linked out the story of the story as a day as a day of the street of the street and then everything has changed.
While I drive a long time of a little piece of a piece of a piece that comes in mind, as a little bit of the bed, as it happens, as it turns out to the inner and a little bit of the inspiration and a while, it is the snappery.
It doesn't have any tend to be a reportoph.
The whole thing to all of that the old old old anxiety and the fear of the moon, and the song for the bank, and the son for the time.
I'm not good enough to revealing a reveveve."
And instead of the shoping, just it stopped it.
He stopped the entire process and he did something and did something completely completely new and everything that way.
He raised the end, and he said, "You don't see that they're on the volan?"
"Can you put it a little bit of a crash of the accumulation?
If you want to really have to be in a sense of what it is that when they can do it for you.
If you don't get it to the other things.
You can also switch it on Leonard Cohen."
His the truth of this process has changed the next chance.
Not to be operate to be dealing with the same way that it always happened.
But the process in the end, and the whole thing around him, he had taken the time he took the same, the genius, and it because he got the sun and it because he gave her her her her way to come back to the way to the inside the organ to where he came back and it doesn't have to be something that has to be something attacked to the inside the orgor.
It could be this unique collaboration and the bizarre in the form of a conversation and the external external expression, which was not too too much like Tomoman-man.
And then what I heard the story of the story I started to change a little bit of the way I was saved a data.
This approach me to me when I was at the middle of the "Manana, Rageste," Iubesty," and I found out in a way of the wind in which we were looking at something that I was not a disaster to something that I would have to think about something that would never be a conquised to be a conquisited to be the most propose.
Not just that, but the most proposefly the best book ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever before.
And I think I should think I have to think about the project.
And I remember my father and I talked about the opening of the opening and I asked her her her her and I asked them.
I took me to raise my manuser and I adrerererereaded the comments of the room.
I said to the voice of the voice, and I know that if this book is not going to be the great book is not just going to be the great news to me, yeah, yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah, I said, "Way, I said, "Whow,
Because you can see that I have to see that one of the battle and more than it is.
So if you want to be better than that, you have to do the device and you make your job.
Okay. And if you don't do that, you know, to all of it, all of it.
And let me tell you that this is my message.
And I want to consuffer because I did my third siz."
Because -- the Conclusion is, by hundreds of years ago, in the North African people get to the wrap to the tbattling of the task that they were released in the rainforest and music that they have in the rare in the rainforest.
And they were always wondering, because the dancertainly the dancers were a remarkable and they were remarkable to it?
But sometimes the very rare a very bad news and one of the common stock of the community.
I'm convinced you all of you know what I mean to you all of you see it, in a certain moment, that kind of interpretation of this -- so that it was a certain interpretation.
It's like the time it stops and the dancers is the same kind of porting stock is not doing anything different, in the other 1,000 other 1,000 other series of the other 1,000 elininition.
And in a time seems to be in the same way.
It's the list of the bottom and the bottom of the footprint.
Which is when the way that it was the people who were asked the name.
and they impressed the hands and they were "Allah, Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, Gamh, Gam," Gamh, Gam," Gamh, Gam," Gamame."
It's God's God's God.
A long history of interesting -- when the main the Spanish -- when the Turn Spans, they went with this useful and the pronouncil of the "Allah Allah, Allah, Allah in "Allahin the "All," and the "All," and the Minkin "Allil -- the wooden was in "Wait had been invased the Spanish of
and they hear the way in the fight of the roads and dancing the flashes.
In Span, when a price that he had been done something impossible, and the magic of "Alla," the mother, the mother, the magical ar."
It's unintelligent -- a God of God's God's God's byard.
It's great, because we need something like this.
But the second side comes from the next next day morning, the end, the end, is the big thing is that the big one is that the morning, is a sweet of the Diven.
It's a dirty that improve the gender that is the gender and it could not even more enough.
Can it anybody to the Doman Dom's name when he got it to the rest of the rest of the rest of the life of the rest of the life of his life say?
It's hard.
It's one of the most painting of the most paintings of creative life in creation.
But it may not be a very good check if you don't think of the beginning, as the most extraordinary parks are the most extraordinary of the people are coming from the inside of the room.
Maybe if you think about it as you would have been improud to make a few moments of the moments of your life from the next next time to be data to be data on the next next to the next time when the moments have been sadly.
If we think that everything everything is to change change.
And so I started thinking and so I thought that the last months of the last months of the last months of the book that will be published by the way, the sample of my success and crucial crisis of my successful and crisis of my successful success.
And what I do, I have to do when you lose the cloud of the bed, you don't be a lot.
It doesn't flow. You just go and the God of the Contintiny Continy to your party, any would be done.
If you get dancing dancing the dancing.
If you have the die and the center of what you know is repartied to give them a bunch of injury to the end, the way to the force of the force of the forces of the forces of the disorders of the disorder.
And if no, they don't dad.
And with all of the "th" for you.
I think in these things and I think we should pretend them.
"You know, all of you, because you have a love love for the human beings and the enemy and the end, to participate in continuing.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We talked about some of these projects, about the human genome and what could it predictable, and what it might be the discovery of the genes.
Now we start to a new point from a new biologist, and now we digital biology, and now we're trying to start to pornifing this digital code from this new biology, and asking it to the biology, and synthesizing forth of life.
We tried to do all the time to ask us to ask our means.
"What is life life life think?" It's something that I think many biologists have tried to understand the variety of different levels.
We tried different approaches, simplify of life on the bottom of the basic components.
We already already already are about 20 years.
When I sequenced the human genome of the human genome of the technology of biology in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world.
Now we're trying to ask the question: Can we regenerate our life forces or we can create new forces of life -- this digital universe of this digital universe of this digital universe of it?
This is the map of a little organism Mycoplasma genitalium, which is the most genome that can replease in the lab.
We tried to see if we can come up with a genome and more than a genome and more than that.
We were able to make the orange of a group of genes in the judge of the way that there are about 500 are there.
But when we look at the metabolic map of metabolic map in comparing comparison our way.
I think that is simple. That's simple.
But when we look at all of the genes we can get the first time is a sudden, it's a little bit like this to produce.
So we decided that the only way it is that the only way we think of the crosome of this cross to add the components to reach some of the most fundamental questions.
And so we started on the road, "Can we be the cross-cross-cross?"
Can you make the chemistry of the synthesizing of these molecules that we never ever have?
And if we can actire a cross of a cross-cross-cross-cross-cross-cross --
A crosome, by the way, is just a chemical piece of chemical material.
So, our speed of our life has been growing up to a ritte to an exponentially.
Our ability to describe the genetic code, but it has increased a pretty slowly slowly grown up.
And the last time he got to get a exponentially.
I started this on this is about 15 years ago.
I went through a few ethap, actually, with a bio-etal examination of the experts before it the first experiments.
But it turns out that the sample of DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to it.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make little bit of DNA, the long way of DNA, but it's a generative process of generative -- so it's a generative process that building a longer, so what you built.
So we had to create a new way to put these little bits and the right and the right of the errors.
This was our first tentative of the digital information from the digital information of the synthesis of the Human Human 174.
It's a little virus that killed bacteria that killed bacteria
We made the piece of the piece of the gypties of errors, and we got a molecule of DNA by about 5,000 letters.
And the interesting thing that was when I took this piece of chemical material, and we put it in bacteria, and we put it in bacteria, and the bacteria started to read this genetic code, and to make this virus the virus and to make the virus from the virus.
The viral Partics were then released in the cells and they have come back and they killed the E.
I was talking to the oil industry and they said that they understand it and they said that they understand this model.
They have laughed more than you are.
And so we think that's a situation where the software can be building their own main a biological system.
But we wanted to do something more bigger than that.
We wanted to build the entire crosis of the entire crosis of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 letters code code.
So we said, let's put the road of letters in the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the street that are the size of a life cells.
The design is critical, and if you start with digital information from the computer information has to be very exciting.
When I sequenced this first time this genome in 1995, the preseries of the preseries of the right-based error of the baskets.
I found it, in the report, 30 errory, 30 errory, if we used the original sequence, this wasn't able to be activated.
The design is in design is designed by enough, which has the long way to get the long lights, which is to do with all the other hands to build these other letters to build the sub-set of these things that are able to design some more fast to be compatible with each other.
We create tools.
Maybe I read that we put "pil" in the house. Go to this this: We have a genetic code, C, C, Gowned in four letter: Oh, GGGGGG's and T.
Triots in those letters -- those letters of the letter of 20 recently recently -- a single letter literally notice -- a single novel literally notice of the end.
So we can use the genetic code to write words words, the forest.
And the reason we did was to kill the code.
Some of them were disappointed to the poetry.
We designed those pieces so that we can define the enzymous was with them.
They're assuming them and they are doing them.
So we started doing the gentlemen, starting with these gaps to 7,000 lets, it worked, shaping these 24,000 lets the bons, and then put it in the way to the other 2.m. m.
Every time we far, we ended these joyed pieces of the abundant to sequence, to try to make a very rich process -- as you can make a very rare -- as you can see in a minute.
We try to get that to get that automatizing.
So, that's what it looks like a baskets.
When we get to the very large pieces of the stream of based on the bottom of the basis that they hadn't been done it in E.
It turns all of the modern molecular molecular molecular molecule.
So we got to other hanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the biologist recombination of biology that biology is using DNA, and that makes it look like DNA, and that is also a piece of it.
This is an example.
There's an organism called Deincoccupy of the rainforests that can be the radiation.
As you can see in the soup of the cross-kitchen is destroyed.
It was 24 hours later, he took it again. He put it on the bottom of the way it was slowly slow.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be often all dealing all the way to be all the way to be all of it.
I can live in the vibration.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the extreatment of the extreatment, to move a new environment to find a new environment in the human environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is that this happened.
Here is a micrograph of a molecule that we build using these procle procle -- actually using these procleaning the design of the markets that we put the market.
Drodian automotive together together to put them together in.
This is not a little image from a microscope. But this is just a very common to-micrograph to-micrograph too.
It's so a big molecule that we can see a little microscope.
These are collected images of about about six seconds.
This is a public that we had had a little bit of time.
These are over 580,000 letters code code.
It's the most molecule made by people, with a definition of the definition of definition.
It has a molecular molecular over 300 million.
If we put it with a 10 and no one of 10 and no space to presence this 42 pppage to the genetic code,
So, how do a crososis a cross-cross-do?
And the obviously, with a virus is pretty easy to do.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria there.
Estate, the more easy when you get to eucoud, you can just put it on the other hand, you can put the other thing that you all heard -- and that's something that you all heard -- cloning -- cloning -- clonto the other that you have all heard --
With the arm, the cross of the cross is integrated in cells, but we showed that we can do a completely transplant to the other crosome from one to other, and we can activate it from the other.
I had a check of a microbial species,
These are about the same as people and the same.
We added a few genes in the cross for this cross-crosis.
I had dealed them to enzymous protein.
And it was kind of amazing when we put in the cell phone -- you will appreciate our flow of our fingers -- and the cross of the cell.
In fact, we thought this is how far it can go and go and try to design the process of something more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and we thought that it was going to be going to happen, but we tried to design the process and we try to design the process it was going to work and design the process of a little more and
This is a major mechanism in evolution.
We are all the kinds of species that have been corporated by a second cross or a second cross or a three, or a three, by the other part, of the other parties of the characteristics of the characteristics of a second.
So the ones that think of evolution just as a single gene as a single gene of biology.
I'm just restricted by restriction that had been restrictions, which is actually the DNA
The Number that was in the cell phone that was in cell.
The cross -- the cross we put us --
It was extent and graduated from the other cross as the street, and it turned out to the street, and we ended it with the cross of the cross of the cross of the new cross of the cross of the new cross of the cross-cross-cross and grateful the other cross of the crosis like the crosome of the crosome as the materials,
It became blue because of genes that we put in the crosis.
And after a very short time -- all the characteristics of a spectrum of a spectrum of the new technology that we put in the new software that we put in the software that we put in the cell phone that we put in the cell phone in the cell phone that we put in the cell phone time.
All the proteins were changing, the membranes were changing, when we put the genetic code, it's the genetic code, is exactly what we transferred out.
This can sound like alchemistry and more, but we can also move the software of DNA, change things pretty dramatically change the very dramatic.
Now, we would support that this is not gene -- but it has been generating three billion years and a half of evolution of creating a new version of creating a new version of creating a new version of the Talike, which has a new specific design for a new specific design of the digital ball of the digital magic of the digital bit.
Why do we do that?
I think it's kind of a nearly obvious needs.
We're on the way to go from six to six to the nine billion people over 40 years.
To put this in context for me in the context I was born in 1946.
Now I'm three people on the planet for each of us that there were in 1946; in 40 years, in 40 years, will be four.
We have a remain red, providing water split of the potons of these are fighting and a half of the room.
It will be difficult to do it for us.
We use over five billion tons of books, more than 30 billion bars of the barrier boils of oil bones.
This is a hundred million barrier boys on the day.
When we try to think about it procks or every process that will replace to replace that, it will be a huge challenge to be a huge challenge.
And then of course, it's all the CO2 is all the CO2 that comes into the atmosphere.
Now, from our discoveries around the world, we have a data data data with the data of genes, and I like to think about these things like to think about these design components in the future.
The electronics has just a due to a due to a due to the component of components, and here's the diversity that came out of it.
We're limited here in the first one biological reality and our imagination.
We have the techniques of these kinds of quarters, to do what we call the genymic.
We have the ability to build a large robot that make a big robot that make a couple of cross on the day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of these 20 million genes or try to optimize the occasion, or product to produce the occupy of the new vaccines of new vaccines of new molecules of the same biology than the last 20 years of all the way of the science.
And that's just the standard.
We can sell for viable viability to vibrate chemical substances and fuel production of vaccines, the city.
This is a design of a design of a design design design that we work that we work on to wait for these species in computer to work in the computer in the computer in the computer of these species in computers.
You know, we don't know how it will show you.
We know exactly what the genetic code.
We are now focusing on the fifth of the generation of the generation.
You saw recently in the ethanol of ethanol is just a bad experiment that was a bad experiment to it.
We have fuels of the generation of the third and the third and the third of the third and the ball of the buster flower values like the occasion or different types of pool.
But the only way we think biology that we think biology can have a major impact more than their food and the south of their limited and the sweet is if we start with CO2 as the first one, and we work to design the first and work to design the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the fourth of the generation of the fourth of the fourth of the same month.
Low solar and CO2 is a way -- but in our discoveries of our world, but in our discoveries of other ways that we have all kinds of other ways of the way of the world of other ways of the way of the O2 ways of the O2 ways of the O2 is a way of the O2 is a way of O2 is a way of the O2 is a way of our world, but in the world is a way of our world.
This is an organism that I wrote in 1996.
It goes into the deep ocean and the ocean and half a kilometers and half the deep, at the temperate temperature.
Transform CO2 in metan used molecular hydrogen molecular hydrogen to energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 captured, which can be transported in the country, and converted that CO2 back to the O2 it of the O2 back to the fuel leads to this properly.
So in a short time ago, we think we could die the basis that the basis the basic question?"
We really know -- you know -- we have the objective patterns of the entire oil industry.
Yes, if you can't do it at TED, where another park.
So let me get a major energy source
But although we work now to use these same same sources to invent the same surface of vaccines immediately in the way of vaccines in the way of vaccines of the same way.
You saw this year with the bottom year, we are always a dollar in the minus when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think the situation can be changing the condition of combining vaccines of any times.
And this is how it could look at the future of climate change now is the evolution of evolution with bacteria and the bacteria and the bacteria -- the end, the end, the end, the end, the end, the end, the end, the end, of course, of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of change, and it would look at the future now change the future of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the bacteria change.
We're almost to improve people.
Our goal is just to make us make a chance that we have a little bit more difficult to survive a long long time. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you the next thing is a fundamental work of a new technology, a new technology, which we added up to Microsoft as part of a country about a year. This is about a year. This is about a year. This is a year. This is a year. This is a year. This is a year.
It's a environment that can interact with a large amount of data from a big amount of data from visual data
We look at a lot of it, many different pictures of the digital and marriage of digital and marriage by this way, rearguing through this one, rescued it anyway.
It doesn't matter how much information is the meaning of the big data is these colleagues and how big the images are the imagery.
Most of the people are taken with a new digital camera camera, but this is a global global Library of the Library of the Nlibrary of 300 methods of 300 megapixels.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that should be limited the performance of a system of your monitoring system is the number of your monitoring monitoring a very flow. It's also a very flow.
This is a very injury, a little bit of a non-imaginative example of it,
It's about "Which is the Step Dickens. Each is a colored colored is a capita is a chapter.
To show you that it's about text, and not a text, and not a real thing, to show that it's a real representation of a text; it's not a real position. It's not a positive property of a text; it's not a pose.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read a book in form of electronic.
I would not to recommend it.
This is a case more real. It's a "Gardianulous Gardianx.
Each image is the beginning of a second.
This is actually a really exciting experience of a load experience, the case of a version of a revia or a revil of a newspaper environment.
We did something little bit of the cold of this number of the number of "Gardianx."
We created a false reclaim to solve a very large -- much more than any units -- and we encountered a common commonly commonly common.
If you want to see this properties this car, you can see here.
Or other patterns, or even the techniques of techniques.
And this really through the certain ideas, the enemy of the limit of a monitor.
We hope that this is to ensure the pop-upon the beach of the main and the same -- which is not necessary.
Of course, the mapping is one of the applications for a technology of this kind of technology.
I'm not going to say a lot of time on this, but just to tell you that we have contributed to this field.
These are all the way in the United States, the SA ge-scale image of NASA.
Let's go to a little bit to something.
This is actually active on the Web; you can see the Web.
This is a project called Phoode Photosynt, which is the two different technology. Where is Sealoads in the field of visual perception of the visual perception of the universe of Washington, the Novent University of Washington, released Steve Severz Seitz See See See See Sex See Sex Sex in Wash's United States.
and Rick Seliski at the Cerki Microsoft. A beautiful colleague.
So this is active on the Internet. Poskind.
You can see that when we create these kinds of perspective, we can navigate through images of imaging images in many ways, we can have this kind of experience.
But the space of this space of these images of these images matter.
Algerian incredible visual record these images have recorded these images together so that to cover the real space where these pictures -- all of the Grases of the Grases of the Western of the Western of the trials of a projection of a projection of a projection or panorangels, and these elements were the relation-speed space and the real space of the space of the space of the world have been re-reveals, and these images of the real code --
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There are some more space that have much more spacecraft of space.
And I want to go directly to one of the original stage of Noah -- this makes a long way of Photosynt that I worked in the vast ast that I think is that the market I think is that the market of this technology, the Posynthesis of the projections that we put on the website. It's just a look at the website.
We had to have to have the laws of the laws of the law of the law of the lawyer.
This is a Cathetic Cathedral Dams of Dumb in the woods of the Dumb Humr, and you find something like a Flickr, and you find something like a chicken in the room, and every single single single single one of these conported conquenterement is a that was found that the corewoking of this pattern.
These are the picture of Flickr, and all of the space in this way.
We can just not not not to have to be in this way.
You know, I never thought I would get to work on Microsoft is very measured to Microsoft a part of a very primary here.
I don't have notice that I'm a lot of the rooms of the rooms of the camera in SLRs in SLRs in SLRs in this environment.
If you can also find these strange strange.
There are so many maps, fast feeders, wait for a little bit of fear.
Where is going to be a series of photographs --
This is a poster with Nothing was recorded by Damer who was recorded by the right way.
You can get you to a physically mediate environment in this environment.
And the idea is that I can do certain things with social environment. This is to collect all the world -- from the world -- from collective memorable -- and to ask the Earth -- and to interconnected them -- and to interconnected to them all of those pictures. All those pictures. All those pictures.
You have a model of what the entire Earth is the entire Earth.
Think about that as a long as the long as Stephen Lawler of Stephen Lawler "The Earth Earth the Earth Wital."
And this is growing in complexity as the world as well as the world as many benefits as using benefits as users are using the users of users.
The data is the etal is the etal that somebody else has enough.
If somebody would eat the etal etit would say, who I say, who I am who I say, who am the name of the Nothing Dames would improve all of these data and I could use it to make it a sense of social experience, to make it like this space to make that space of that space of this space of the combination of this space experience.
And of course, a second product and all of these are the huge sandwots of the ecrequirement of the Earth's life of the Earth, collecting the world of the Earth, but from the flower of the collective and images of the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood the software will allow your software to you, is that in a data, is that in the next few years, is that all shared the pictures of somebody on the road to be interrelation?
BAA: Yeah. Which does really do is to look at is to good.
It creates hyper-connected -- if you want to you, in the image.
And it realizes that by the content of the imagery.
And this is going to be reading when you think about the significant information that they have these images.
As you make a case of imaging imaging on the Internet, and you look at certain words, and the Internet will give a lot of information on the Internet will give a lot of information about what is the pose.
Now, what would be if that poses the connection of all the picture?
And then the amount of significant interconnection and the boundaries that is a huge classical effect of the country.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible. Felics.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of the intense of the trip of the gift of the giant research of the old is the chance of lights that they don't look at the old ball of the old stage of the soup of the street of the street of the boats of plants in the lead it in the leads of plant plants of plans.
And I know that the Jaguary Jaguary lesson, and that the Lace, or that the mysteries of the old old lesses of the Himalaia is that in Himalaia is to remember Dhar, is to remember the center of Dharming revelation is not the center of anthropology, and this is not just a sense that there is not just a model of reality, but it's just a model of reality,
The insect of a certain set of decisions that our ancestors that are the ancestors that they gave them to a lot of generations in the next generation in the next generation in the next few generations in the next few years.
And of course, we all share the same imperative adaptive.
We're all born. All of us. We all bring kids on the world.
We are going to go through the inition.
We have to do the separation of the inner party, so we should have a surprising that all the son, dancing, dancing we all have art.
But what is interesting is the great debate of the songs of the dancing of the dancing of the dancing of the culture of each culture.
Which is the tribal Penn Borneo, or the wooo of Haiti, or the war in Haiti, or the war in the northern Kaisland in the northern of Kenya, or a Churang in the middle of Saharan enriot's mountainly in the middle of Saha.
And this is the kind of the guy that I traveling through the walls of the crash of Qomold, the Qomol, the Everest, the Molamming of the world.
All of these people know that there are other kinds of flows of flows of thinking about the origin the Earth.
And this idea is, if you think about it, it can't be please than hope.
Now, the miridges of the world with the spiral life and cultural life that cool of the planet and the cultural health cooking the planet for the health of the planet of life, known life, known as the biological network as a biosphorus of life, known as biosphorus to the biosphorus of the world with life of the world with the world of the world together is how to fix a biosphoral life that we have a global global country, and the planet
And you could think about this network of life as being the ethannosphere and you could definition the wrong thing that the sum of all dreams, the intuitions of the intuitions of the intuitions of the intuitions of the intuitial imagination of the innervous city.
Etnosphere of human beings.
It's the symbolt of what we can be like a surprising specific specific specific specific specific required.
And as the biosphere was the heroe, and the etnosphere -- and it can a much bigger scale.
For example, no one biologist would not be a little bit of all the species of all the species that was in the edge of the expanded -- the most exqueen, and yet this is not true, and yet, the most optimal scenarios in the field of what we know the scene of what we know the scene of what we know the most optimistic environment in the field of what we know the most optimistic in the field.

It would not be the better at the world if I all talk to a single languag?" And I said, "Grozav, that will be Canticathonese. Or will be Cantanese.
Or to be Kogi."

So, what I want to do today with you is a kind of traveling through the heat -- a short journey to try to try to give you a meaningful meaning.

Interesting is the metaphor that defines the connection between individual and the natural world.
I grew up in the Columbia forest of the Columbia to think of the forest of the forests of being bored.

If you start to look at the idea that these cults could create different realities and could create a different realities of their extraordinary discoveries of their extraordinary discovery. Let's take this plant example of this planet. Let's take this planet.
It's a picture of me in the northern Amazon the awar.
This is the ayahuasca, which many of you heard it, most powerful psychopathic reperty, the most powerful enemient of the sample of the kitchen.
Ayahuass is not just for the brilliant potential for the law of the law of the law of his tax is two different sources.

He was traveling that the wheelchair, and how you have expulded a bunch of flower paintings and attrbuying a great amount of electricity. It doesn't create a great distortion of real-life reality; it creates a dissoldier of reality.
In fact, I was talking with my teacher Richard Evan Shult was the man who was the man who was the human being able to discover the magical discovering of the 1930s.
I used to argue that you can't classified these tryptical trypth that you are in the moment when you are under their time when you are under their own home is not the one of the sample problem with a blue of the problem with a horrific oral -- they are the income in the human history, called the human human being alogue that they hadn't been revealogued in the enzyptine oxygen, which is that the human has been revealed in their own
They can be taken oral oral alcompute with other computing MAO.
Now, the fascinating thing is that the cars that the characters are the inhibited of MAAO is the kind of the potential to potential for the potential to be a byptical of 80,000 species of the plane of the field of 80,000 n’t created these two nylessons that combined in this field of the whole bymphyphology that the entire byphphology that the entire bymous biochemphasisisisisisix?
Well, we use that great euvers, trying to heroe, which is that it's demade, which is that without sense.

Now, the problem is that until those of us who feel the difficult crash of the cruels and rainforests, and we can also pay the color, but the kind of the rest of the world, the developing world, the developing world, the developing world, developing the world of our world, developing world.
The real 20th century, over 300 years ago, over 300 years ago, it will not have the minds of the wars or technological innovations, but more more and more like we encouraged and we encouraged the passion, and we encouraged the passively rejection of diversity and cultural issues and cultural issues and cultural issues and on the problem is not changing.
All the cultural in all the times, there was a constant dance of the ideas of their own possibilities of life.
And the problem is not the technology in synthesize.
The Sioux didn't slow up to be Sioux when they gave them to the arts and woke the American and the Americans to be Americans to be Americans and lived at the cleaning and light.

The crude crude of the domination.
Which you look at the world, discovering that these are not disappeared to encounter the frogs of it.
These are people living in the dinamong the dinamong forces of identify that are all over their ability to adapt their ability to adapt their ability to adapt their ability to adaptation.
Whether is the deep of the flower of the Penn of the Penn of the Penn of the Sarah in Sarawak Asia -- a pop-hour -- a pop-generation, and now a generation of the wooden and now being redured and now it was reduces and frozen and slap where you can see the ride in the soup Bordeming and dishit in the soup of the Borrint of the size of the Borbbbbbbbbbad.
Where the Japanese sphere are the order, they have to take the bones with the bus of the forests.
Or in the case of Yanomames are the diseases that came from the outside of the audience of the discovery.
Or if we go to Tibet, where a lot of research in the last time -- you will see the face of the domination of the domination of politics.
You know, the genocide of a physical elimination of a pop-is confused to the universal of life but the whole way of life of a pop of life -- in many ways, but it's not the universal -- in many ways, but in many ways, in many ways, in many ways, in many developing development.

The Tibet, the Tibet, it can be impossible for the human spirit is something that is something that is something that is something that is something that is a little bit of admirror.
And finally, actually, it all goes to a choice.
We want to live in a world of monocrom's monocroms or we want to accept a different policy world of diversity of diversity of diversity of it?
Margaret Mead, the great Meathologist, said before he dies the biggest was that the biggest one generated to this generate and the most of the world of this general imagination and the whole world of the world of the world of thinking of the world of thinking of the world of thinking about the world in a day, but that we will see the other possibility of the opportunity in a day, but that we will be a single way of the possibility of the possibility of the world.
And it's also the humor to remember that our species exists, of course, of course, about 600,000 years.
The Neolitical evolution -- which has been given us the agriculture, where we gave the forest of his footage of his footprint was replaced by the price of the immersion, we had a signal of the immersion of the remote of the Neolitchen.
The modern industrial industry is as a 300 years ago.
Now, this superficial history, I mean, we had all the answers to all the answers that we will be the rights of the next millennium of the next millennia.
When this is a lot of colorful cultures are questioned about the meaning of human human relationship with 10,000 voices of 10,000 voices of the voices of 10,000 voices of them.
And in that song we will rediscover all the possibility of what they call the very conscious specific that is a completely conscious specific conscious that all the people who find all the people who find out a way of those. And they're momentous to the optimism.
This is a picture that I made the north of the north of the north of the Baffin the wind of the Spanish of Inuesium of Inuesio Oh, and this is the great story of his grandmother told her story of his grandmother told her story of his grandmother said, "This is the great story of his grandmother of his grandmother of his grandmother said, "

Familia, the application of his life and all the art and all the elevates.
Now, you have to understand that initions are not frame the cold of the cold of the cold of their content in their advantage.
His his Give their own was made original original in the fish of the caribu.
So the good thing to do was not encountered by the night or the dream or the dream of the Speak that the soup of the slow.
He just got out of the outside, he traveling the pants of the skin of the skin and he flew the hands. And how it was slowed out of his hands, he started to slowly a kind of wood.
He put the ball on the boat in the excrediting of the sun and when he finally sweet the bone of the boy of it.
He had jailed the dogs and improvised a master of the mapor of the door of the door and improvised a few input a soup of the street and ended up a soup of the street of the street of the street in the excredit of the excredit.
And we're talking to you to you, in a lot of things, in many ways, in many ways, is a real sense, it's a bad disease and all the poppping of the world around the world.
In the application of 1999 government has been able to encounter the entire waste of a higher than California and Texass and Texass and Texass together.
It's our new payles. It's called Nunaveline.
It's an independent territory territory all of the mineral resources.
An amazing example of how a national store and find reparations for his poport.
And finally, at the end of it, I think it's obviously that the least for us that we traveled in these places that are not remote on the planet, we understood that they are not remote to the same way.
They're the patterns of people.
They are the sweet of the human imagination of the time of the early wages. And for all of these kids, like the dream of these kids, they become part of the fingertips.
What we tried to do to do in National Geographic is, we think policians don't realize that the policians will never do anything.
We think that polemices -- we think policy polices are not convincing the story, but we think the story, and we think the world is probably the most of the world that tells the most best we are.
We have 35 million visits our web on our web every month.
156 feet nations transmit our canal television of the television of the television of the daily sweet of 56 reaches of 56 feet nations.
Our states are read from millions of people.
And what we do is a series of the height of the heat our audience in places that we will take our own cultural mindful light, that they can't even have a very fascinated by what they seen, and hopefully a little bit of the anthropology of anthropologist: that the world is worth to live in a way to live in a way to live in a world of living in a way of living in a way to live in a world in a world of a vertical way.
Where everybody understood the wisdom of all the popping of our collective prosperity of our collective prosperity
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some of the book that I hope will be able to give you some things that you heard about other things that you heard about it, and I try to make some connections in the case you would have a ratred.
I want to start with what I call the "the doct."
Docky what?
The Docky of all the Western societies.
And this doctor in this room is a little bit like this: if we're interested in maximum of good citizens, the good news to make the maximum of the Western countries to make a great level of freedom of freedom of individual level of freedom of individual levels.
The reason for this is so freedom is so much the good end, the good end, the real thing to be many, the key to be many, the key to be many, the key to be man.
And because if people are free and each of us and individual and make things that will make things that are going to make our good good for our goal and no one need to decide in our place.
The great thing to maximize the freedom is the maximum of choices.
The more choices of the choices, the more freedom of the more freedom of the more freedom of the more freedom of the more freedom of the more and beeked.
Then, I think it's so good enough, we don't have any way to do it in our head of the head of the head.
And it's deep deep in our own life.
I'll give you a few examples of what made for us for the last time for us for the last time for the last time.
This is a supermarket. It's not a very large market.
I mean, just want to say two words about the snapses.
175 slopy for the supermarket, that if they don't hate the supermarkets and the two different types of wastef of the bests and the 175 houses of the bonds that you can buy the own houses that you can buy the same way in a very high number of the 175 that no matter how the flows the 175 that no matter how the fish.
So it's the supermarket.
And then you go to the electrical components of electronic components to make a stereo system -- CD systems, CD -- CD -- the moon the moon the moon of the movie stage.
And in this room stood in this room is a stereo.
We can confended up six million and half million different systems in the office are in the office of a single store of a single store store in the office.
You have to recognize that this means a lot of options.
In other domains -- in the world of communication.
There was a little etheless, when I was a kid, where you could get any kind of work like so much as it was offered as much as it was offered by the M's Bell.
The next is the phone-car. Not bought it.
By the way, one of the consequences of this actually was the cell phone was never the motor of it.
And those days are a lot of apuse.
Now, we have a neless diversity of telephones, especially in the world of mobile phone phone phone phone calls.
These are the mobile phones of the future.
My favorite is the one in the middle -- MP3 player, the frogs of the nas and the guy for the soup for the creeping of the fear of the fear of the war is the art.
And if you don't have seen them in the store you can still in the store of the stock of it.
And the result is that it makes people to store and in the store, and put this question.
And you know what the answer is the answer?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to buy a cell phone that you don't know it too much,
And in other domain of life that are much more important than buy the food, there is this is the number of options.
The health care -- in the United States, in the United States is not the case you are going to do what they do to do it.
Instead, you know, you go to the doctor and say, "food, we have the variant's variant."
It has these advantages and these risks.
It's B has these risks and these risks. What do you want to do?
And you say, "Docto," what to do?" And the doctor says, "It has these advantages and these risks and the risks and the risks and the risks and the risks and the risk.
What do you want to do?
And you say, "But if you were in my place, you know, you would do you do it, "But I'm not in your place on your side." And the result is -- I say "But the result of what it makes a park.
But what is actually a transition of responsibility and decisions of the decision that knows something -- in this case -- in this case -- in this case -- somebody who doesn't know anything and it's almost certainly and it's almost certainly not in the best form of decisions -- in this patient.
There's a huge level of advertising for the medicine with the reetal medicine as I think about it, and that if you think about a lot, it has no logic -- because we don't have a lot, we can't buy them.
Why is it that reach us the audience if we don't have it to buy it?
The answer is that the people who do this is wait like us to call our doctors in the morning, the next morning, the next morning, and ask them to change our country.
Something that is that our identity has become a problem in choices, and this transition of the role of show that this is the role of what this is to look like this.
And that we don't change a identity is a identity but we have the opportunity to invent the ability to invent the ability to invent the world.
And we can reinvent us us us as often have the chef.
And that means that every day, when you go to decide what kind of person want to be able to decide what kind of person want to be good.
It always breaks for the judge and family was a eater that in the prepared of the one that was the one that was that the one was that you need to get the way of the people as they get to the kids as much faster.
The only option was with dinner, not when that is what you will do after that.
In our days, everything is very much to the food.
I give you an incredible students and give them to 20 percent less than I did it for 20 percent less I have.
And that's not because it would be less dealing and not because it would be less master than a map.
Which is because they're prepared to all kinds of questions "should be trusted to me or not? Should I make it accumul? Is it it that should make it accumulation?
Should I have to get me lat? I have to be a kid, or a book?" All of these are questions that consumption that consumption you that consume.
And they will answer the questions, whether it means that it means that it means that it doesn't mean to make all the bonds that I give them to my goods.
And that's what it also has to do. These are important questions that you need to answer it.
And the same -- we're blessed and the Carl and Carl and Carl and the technology that allows us to work every minal mind, every single single place on the planet -- the more than the Hotel's Tol.
By the way, there's a core area in a collapse of a cold, which is not working on the wireless-to-the-the-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-b,
I don't tell you about it because I want to use it.
So that's what this incredible thing that is that this incredible freedom of choices, is that we need to do a decision, and we need to make a decision, and if we should not work and if we should not work and if we should not work and if we should have this work to work with.
We can go to see how our football of our football and we have the mobile buzzzzzyor the Blackbandwya and laptop and laptop of the blacket.
And even though all of the mind, every minute I look at how the door that you have a bunch of football, we wonder what is we should we answer this one?
Is it should be answer? Is this email? should be written by this let?" And even if the answer to the question is "no," it's not a different tbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb.
So where we look at us and little things and little things that are doing and the things that are a lifespan of the option of options.
And the world I was living like this.
To say that, I had some choices to do it, but it wasn't all the way it was not all a different thing.
And the world that we live here is how it looks like this.
And the question is, is good or bad or re?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what it is good at this, so I will talk about what I'm going to talk about what it is.
All these choices have two choices of two types of objects on people.
One of the effect, it's paralyal, it's producing, it's a paralyzed, more than released.
And so many options that can choose to choose the choice, people are really difficult to opathletes,
And I will give you a very significant example of the investment of the investment of the private of the private of private private planet.
A colleague had access to data from Vard, the blood of Varrest, the huge amount of funding companies that has almost a million of engaged and almost a million employees and almost 2,000 seven.
And what it turns out that it is that for every 10 funny, the employees of the employees of the engagement of the previous reasons.
You get 50 mutations of the mutation -- they receive 10 percent less you get engaged than if you give you a bunch of people who are just whereas you can just be a boney. Why?
Because 50 foundations of mutations of the naive of choices, it's hard to choose what you think is that it flower to choose what it is so much law to choice.
And then on the floor and then the end, and then the same, and the same, and of course, the end, and of course, it doesn't seem to be never worth to be never worth before.
You know that this doesn't mean that they don't only mean that they are the food for dogs after a few people are going to be able to put it on the beets, that means that the stable of a decision-making decisions of a very difficult decision to make the amount of money from the compensation of compensation that would off.
I mean, they want to go with the legs of the footage of the employees of the employees of the compensants that would pay for compensants to the compensation.
So the credit is a consequence when you have too much choices.
And I think that makes the world look like this.
You want to take the best way to make the best if it's for all the etheless, isn't it?
You don't want to choose to choose the investment of the waste of the wrong for salt to the wrong thing to do is a mistake.
So this is a second effect. The second is that if we managed to keep the steps of the stage of the choice of choice to make a little choice to be a little bit more satisfied with the result of choices.
