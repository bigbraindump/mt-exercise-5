And the last two dies we arrived to prove that the police police police that in the most of the last three million years of the last three million years of the last few million years of the big big size of the big big big size of the big waste.
But this moral moral moral issues because it doesn't look at the size of the fancy of the fancy of the fossil of the fossil of the morning.
The police is in a way that the future of climate that has been a global system of climate change.
She expected the waste, and the contract.
The next thing that I will be able to show up to what was going to be a very quickly about the last 25 years ago.
The peak pump is the marriage of the marriage of the mice.
As you see the blue of blue whales are expanding.
This is the anuity of the house.
And it goes to the past.
About the fish of the fish of a five-year-olds can see that it's almost like this is almost as a genders when a core of the body.
In the 25 years of the time of this one.
This is a problem because the quality of the death of the ocean around the ocean.
where it's a massive amount of carbon carbon disorder, when it rejection -- it's transformed in the metaphor of the microorganisms.
Comparing the pollution of the global warming the global atmosphere of the atmosphere of the atmosphere can be able to do this in the extreme point of the extrem.
We protect the little lacks of Alaska is at the Alaska is at the bottom of the metal disease.
The Katan Kati Walter in Alaska was on the Alaska team of a team of a little bit of a little tapp of the past.
Oh, yeah. An Gore: An Oh is if we do it.
And a reason is that enormous "words" is Groenenza.
This is a rich rich room.
But volumes are much more than that.
This is Kangerlusha Suslushan Groenland.
If you can see how the fish the whole bunch of the fish of the fish of the fish of the sample of the sample of the same.
These debate they grow very quickly.
And at the other end of the planet, Antarctica of the most main the planet.
The last people have reported as the end of the continent were the initiative of the continent is the negative of the Antarctica of the Antarctica range of island in the areas in the airplane on the island of the waste.
This is the equipment of the size of the sea level, the way in Grrrrrors.
In Himalaya, the third of the third of the third of the new ways, you can see the new force of the new force of the new fifth of the new fires.
40 percent of the population of the world get a half of the water of the water of the water of the water of the base of the topier.
In the day, this guy's source is the surface of the water for this one.
The fact that they have grown up.
But when it goes to the water and the water water and the water water and the water water
In California was a 40-percent of the Sierra Sierra Sierra.
This affects the water is the water of the water.
And predictable, as you read it, they're serious.
On the world of the world has been able to a dramatic creature.
And the disasters on the whole world grew up with a great rate of the conference.
four times more of the last 30 years of the 75 years of the 75-year-olds of the 75.
This is a completely unusual.
If you look at the context in the history of the history of the history of what happens.
In the last five years we add from the last five million dioxide in every 24-year-olds in the ocean 24-year-olds in the ocean.
The Up to the Spanish of the Pacific Spanish of America, and every part of the subject of the subject of the subject of the oxygen of the oxygen in the ocean.
The most of the world of the world of global warming the global warming, which reintroduces 20 percent of the fossil fuels.
The bottom problem is a problem and the best cards is the most serious one.
The United States is one of the two big emerging of China.
And the proposition was to build a lot of factors for the car.
But we start to see a whole change.
Here's the people who have announced in the last years with alternative alternative to prove proposition.
Everything is, there was a fight in our own country.
And the industrial industry and the oil, and the ownership of a billion dollars in the last year of the last year of the quenenenentic field.
And the good reason is a forest.
This image of the image of something that is a lot of it.
In the Croute Cracial Tenness, a billion gallons of geeane cartoon the cartoon was imprastid.
You probably see it on the stir.
This is all the way of the second desire in America was made in the presented of Corgeous Corport.
One of the base of the base of the book, a bit around the Cracial of COOOOne's been this.
Video: I mean, I mean, it's a same, it's a fifth and I see it and I lived.
He's from abundance, here in America, and help the economy.
Frosty, the man with the book, it gets to the day better.
He's also adorable and adorable workers are removing.
Al Gore: This is the very important source of Virginia Virginia Western Virginia
The most famous thing on the most degree of Massey of Massey of the Calsey of the greatest boat.
Video: Don Blan: I want to be cloud. The Gore, Nanbut Pelose, Harry Reio Reihabis not about what I talk about.
Al Gore: So this kind of Alie for Climate Climate Climate the two cameras well.
This is one of them from one of them on one of them.
Video: The COALi we see new change in the climate change for our businesses.
And that our main is to spend a big money for the money for the helping us to help us look at the skills of the force of the good book.
The device is the good, the grandmothers is not diding.
We think it's soon -- and I have a little bit of it.
So it will not be able to make the climate change for change.
You get this in the way of doing it.
Video: Actually, the Cars -- you heard a map about it.
So let's do a chance to do a tube to do a chance of the forest.
USS: Oh, I think it's about the gyppppeaky of it.
But this is the sound of the technology of the book of the goal.
And while the cards are the magic of the main the global causes of global remarkable technology to the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of change.
The assumption of this is the technology of the book, this is the good news.
Al Gore: In the conference of the positive economy and with the challenges of the economics of nationals.
Video: Narrator: The Spanism, the economy, the security of the national security crisis.
The thing that is that you get all the way to the base of the forestation of carbon on carbon carbon carbon on carbon carbon carbon dirty but ogue.
But now we have a new solution to the unlike the incurious solution.
You can take the electricity of 100 percent of the power of 100 percent of the time in 10 years ago.
A plan to get America to the third of the time of the world and help us to help us to help the world to help the world to make the global warming.
In the end, a solution that is to help us to help us solve our problems.
You can be American. You can do a lot of it.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: Narrator: It's about the re-risk re-rise re-in-rise of American.
One of the most quickly efficient of the old base of the old computation of our planet didirty of our plane of Barble: the Viese world is here -- it's a new requirement of the energy required.
Barbley nrrrh.2: We invite the good job.
Narrator: Rememembracing America.
Al Gore: Exista reverse: "If you want to get it to go away, you want to go ahead and you go ahead and you go ahead and you go ahead and the only Gore?"
If you want to get back to the wire, you go back.
We need to get back to the right thing to do.
Thank you very much.
The year at TED I did a TED FL.
And I would promise to give a data data about how it works.
So I was going to go. And for the people who were not the most scientific experimental scientists that was the largest experimental scientific experiment -- Cirumble-Street Street or is to recreate the confidence of a billion feet in the universe, in the universe, the fifth of a billion in the '600 billion a seconds of the '600 billion of the year -- the Spanish -- the largest of the 19600 billion a seconds --
It's extremely fast of both sides.
This is the Genevelevation.
We do photographs these minds of the Bangs' in the decade of the deck of the deck.
I work on this one. It is called the ATLATLATLSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSTLS TLS TLS TLS LATLS
On the 10 ppphase we went to the first time I was the first time.
And this picture was a picture of ATLASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSTLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATL
It caused a huge remote in the control of control.
It's an image of the first picture of the city that has been able to enjoy the Western systems in LHC, SHC. HC is deeply to the LHC is detector.
In other words, when I was a 10 sedimental picture of the 10 sex of the work of functioning to functioning to a huge successful of a huge success.
I don't know if this was the greatest oils, or when someone went on the Google and I went on the Google and I would see the first page,
It means that I had a cultural impact on the screen impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the effect.
And after a half a hamian of the device with the device, which actually had to do with these songs.
Those are transported to the translate 13 thousands of amepers to the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of power of the power of power of the power of power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the transport of the transport of the power of the translate 13 of the ladder of the residents of the lamepers.
Now, engineers from the war and says, "I'm not going to be transportation of the amepers. I'm not the five."
But I can do this because when they're going to get what they call the galls are called the ball of the superconductor.
So this is 271 degrees of the hospital of the hospital of the steps can transport the fire can transport transport these things like this.
At one of the layers of the '90s in LHC, was a define of factory of factors.
So the company has been sicking a little bit of the 13 thousand ample of the resistant resistance.
This was the result.
This is more impressive to the magnitude of magnitude in 20 tonies, and they move almost 30 seconds.
So we had deeply about 50 magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic --
We had to take the end, what we did and do it.
We reconted it all the way we received.
And now we take magnetic magnetic and then in the subterm.
The one at the end of the marriage of the LHC will be like the new LHC will be like to be as a new road.
We will start to get it and we get to get the data in the housin or the research, and we're going to continue to find the universe.
Now, of course, the inner accidents that make a discussion about the important thing about the important thing about the important thing to do is rejeck to the extreme to rejeck it.
I think that it was the fact that it is attacking to the fact that we have young people like LHC.
And I'm going to the words of a man who is the Britanic man Humphilosophy Davaveling the protection of the protection of the protection of the food products of the food progress for the mindsame, he said, "Numumbi to prevent the human rights are not the endless natural gentlemen, they are not the inquire of the natural gesture.
Thank you.
I want to start to remember the kidney to remember your childhood, when you play with the box.
On the top of the surface to get them and get to the focus and get them to the clothing to do to the problem, and to solve problems and manipulate the relationships.
The hospitals is proven by the law of how we understand a big part of the world of the inconconcedence.
So in the quality of the IT Rinspired IT interruption with our physical interfaces -- impressure of the physical objects -- the Jewish of Jeennian Kalananese -- I would start to do when we use a computer, I started to do a computer, in this unlike the computer that we can use a computer to be on the planet.
She's going to do it for it?
The question was taken by fascinating the fascinating thing we would have to try to make the question of the Siss built Sisms.
In a short Sifttable is a computer interaction of a big computer of a big phase of a bit.
They can be manufactured by the resistant can persuade the waste of one theater, and they have a radio of the radio of the radio of the radio of the radio of the radio of the wire.
The most important is that they're palpable to the game, like the bodies you can just get it like to get it as a mission of the games of the games of the mountains to the subject of the most important thing to get to the game, it's the most important thing is the hopeless of the game is the palpababled, like the peak of the game, you can be the rich of the games.
And Sifting the cameras a new ecosystem to the digital disorder.
On the map of the tools become more palpable-driven products of the mission of each other, and the consequences of our nutritions and frogs of our active and frogs and frogs and frogs and fall of interaction.
I'm going to start with simple.
This Sifting is configuring out of the video, and if you include the film, if you include the film, if you include in the other hand, the park of the other part, they get to the other.
These are interactive interactive to each other.
So, if they put one on the other langle other, it becomes interesting.
If they are inconconcedence will be a little confused to become a little confused to be a little confidence.
And I can feel the risk and inclining.
We realized that one of the implications of interactions is that we can use the data is that we can use to manipulate the data, how we can make a lightening color to the lighter of a light.
In the case we have three Sif-shutting spined up and they can use to the color and can use to the color in the center, where they will be asidea.
If we can get too much, we can get too much, we can get the back.
There are also opportunities for education, how to educate visions and the mathematical games and logical senses that we want to know the possibility of what we want to see the results that quickly enough.
So here I -- this is a rich of the Kbonaca, which are doing with a simple equation.
Here's a game game of the words of the words of the rule of the Scrabs and Boggles on the Scrabs and Boggle.
And so that every one of the first steps on the end, and the main every Siftable, and the magic of the worst -- they are green to a dictionary.
And then after 30 seconds of the second seconds to return the letter of the letters, and you have a new set of incities.
Thank you.
And this is the kids who came to the Media Laborative Laborator Media and we receive them to make a material.
They would like to get the crazy of it.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of application is that you don't need to get a lot of people to get a lot of people who are to get to the structure.
Everything you have to say is "F: "F: they know exactly what to do.
Here's another cause of people to get them to the people.
This is the most anthropy of our hands in the right way.
It turns out that everything everything else wanted to do was to do with one of the other one over the other.
So for him was just a little boat.
This is an application application.
We wanted to build a tool, for the people who invest language.
And this is Frix.
He can introduce new persons in the stage of the Sif, just the sample of the Sifting the person.
And here's the sounds.
Video: The rights.
David Merrillrill: Now he introduced a tractor in the stage.
Video: The traveling the wild.
Very of course, y!
When Sif, the sample and assignals and the one of the way to interact -- Video: Ham!
DM: I create the narrative and the narrative
Video: Oh, yeah.
DM: It's a story with open, and he decided, and he decided.
Video: Zoboard.
DM: The last example I have time to show today is a set of a design and interpretation of the museum of the role of the role of the role of sound like Sif, and the rate sounds, and all be.
Each four different variations of these different variations that you want to use it.
And you can get the sound of a succession that you can get the same thing you can do it.
The sounds of the sounds of the sounds of a Siftar Sifttable of success.
There are effects you can control control the way you can be reversed, and the filmmaker.
Irably Asplit and then includes to help them to help to help them to help it.
The next effects of generals like the pipeline and the volume of the sequence of the sequences of the century of how you can see it.
Video: DM: And you start with a second Sify cameras we have a successful of successful success, we can get a serious serious amount of a serious amount of it.
Now I put a conference line.
Video: DM: Now I add the waste.
Video: And I will now add the top, I will see the whole of the screen to control the effect of effect.
Video: DM: I can see the third of the inclined inclined or the inclining of one or other one.
Video: I will now be able to do this for many of the expressive stage for many exexpression.
Video: DM: I can do it in the time of the long time.
So you don't have to do the planet, I can improve or a short or a short or a short or a short of the word.
Now, I can see the enemy of the same, I can use of the volume of the volume of the volume of the volume of the food.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is the creation of new interfaces that are better to the way to the way that function and our body body body functioning the brain.
And today, we had to show a new coordination of this new hospital of design, and how to make it from possibility to make them from the law to the law of the law of the law.
The thing that would like to retiny is that we are at the generation of interruption with the interface, which will bring the digital layer of our digital rules, which will allow our rules to our rules in our world of our rules.
Thank you very much.
And these fisheries to talk to you to all of you to get you.
I'm writing the writer.
He describes is the teacher is the teacher -- but of course, more than that.
It's my mom loved and fascinating a vibrbrbrating.
And I don't have this wisdom to change the time.
But this is what it was told by the way, and in the book, and in the book, which release release to me to require my relationships.
And the little bit of the work of the book, this is the proposition, the Ragement, the Roaging Ragedwood -- the way of my career to the initiative of my feature's world for a very important thing to a real world for a very important kind of a very important piece of international international conference.
The way is that the oridin the experience that people are going to be convicted by the parachute of the part.
Seriopia -- the convicted now!
Very example of the people and you tell you, it's not going to be the theater -- not you can do it for the passenger to the performance of performance that?
You don't know that you will continue to write the foot of the forest of the flower of the world that will ever do it on the world that ever do this?
It's very linked line.
But it was also the more I would not be able to remember that 20 years ago, when I started to start by the people -- when I was adolescent to the same as I was writing the same thing -- I want to become writer as a African reaction to become a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of initiate that we haven't been a kind of a range of removed by the same range of remmustusters --
And people say "I'm not going to be able to be the one of the success of success?"
Do you don't know that the pleasure of respect to the wind of the wind?
You don't know that you're going to work in this field of the field of life and nothing will be going to be in here and a dead of a dream of the endance of the endless of the endless of the endy?"
Something that is what it is.
The answer -- the short -- the answer to the questions is "Yes."
Yes, you feel the theater of all things.
And always let me reach.
And you get the theater of the door of other things that people can be intuitive.
As an example of the big example of the big things that are crosses.
But when it's about the work I was looking at the last thing I was looking at the last time is "Where is what I was "why do you do that?
Is it something rational?
It's the logic is to be able to be able to be able to do it was to make it for a way to do this Pame.
And what is attractive of the creative consequences of creative initiative initiative income to a healthy income to a healthy inertivists not a way that other teachers don't do it?
And my father was a chemist engineer and not to remember that in 40 years of you don't get it in 4-year-old chemical engineering to be asking somebody else's asking to be a engineer of chemistry.
It doesn't happen -- John, how does it go to the chemical product in engineer?
And it's not just this thing happened.
But we will be honestly in-engineering engineering as a group of century not too much to be alcools of the reputation of the properties of the depression.
We write the insects we have this reputation, and not only writing all the way to the other kinds of things that they seem to be strongly strongly powerful to be strongly strongly strongly strongly strongly powerful to be strongly stronger to be a lightful of the inssssmiles to be a reputation, and not just this reputation,
And everything we have to do is to look at the numbered the numbered in the 20th century, in the 20th century, in the 20th century and the resistance of the minds of the way that they died by the way, and they were didn't.
And even those who didn't have to be able to be really sicking the own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own income to the own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own lighter.
Norman Mailer, even before the last one of the first time I said that I was saying that I had a little bit more tonight."
The great great great thing about the work of a life of a life of a life of a life.
But you don't have a clip when we hear somebody says, because we heard this because we heard this because we heard a lot of things that we have absorbed and unless we accepted the idea of the creative and the suit of the creative and the suit will always get inherent and as it will always get to the end.
And the question I want to advertising, you are all here with this is all of this is we all of this idea?
You can combine it -- because it sees -- because it sees -- I don't get the wind of this poverty with this guy.
I think it's like then.
And I also think it's dangerous and not to give you the future.
I think it's better if we encourage to the artistic artistic to the marriage.
And I know that in my case, in case -- I would be very dangerous for me to start to start to start to start to go to the carry of this is about the circumstances in which I think is a circumstance.
As a result of example, I'm just a range of 40 years ago.
We probably have been four decades of the work of the work of work.
And it's probably very likely to write the innocent of this moment to be judged by the last thing that was going to take the last few of my favorite of my last career and I said, "?
What would be to say the fall the way to the ones that we are already the most of my father is probably the largest successful of my success to my greatest success to the largest success of the largest conjudgments.
Oh, God, what Gam!
This is the kind of the way to get the back to the end of the morning, and I don't want to get that person to get that person.
I will make it in continuing this message that I love.
And then, then, the question of the question of that?
And so I was looking at a lot of my meditation, like to work now, to write a psychology to write a psychological produce, is by making a kind of productive, right?
I had to find a way to get a distant way to the consistent of the whole natural law that write, and my father who would write the natural legs that will be before before I was just before he describes what he safe.
And as we were looking at the last year of the last year we started looking at the time, and we try to find other society to find other society to get other society to be better and healthy to make better and health, and healthy the risk of how to make creative choices of how to make creative emotion.
The researcher has been taken me and Roma and Romome.
So the big thing you get the inchance of the circle of the sky.
But in Grush and Roming the Roming of the income from the surface of the way of the way of the way of the door of the way of the door of the way of the door in the way of the Grectal Grecrectness, and in the Grush and the human human ants.
People were thought that creativity was a spirit was a spirit of people who are going to get to the people in a surgery and ununited by the way, and unintelligent and united.
The lack of the simple core of creatures are the require."
Socrats was the removie that he had a demon the department of the department of the department.
Romans had the same peak of creature, but they were the accountless according to the genius.
What is great, because the novel was not the romantic genius was a strange of ended.
They create a genius was a kind of magnitude of the wild of the war studies of the wild of the wild of the wild of the arm that the car, the south-in-enable journey and ended up the worker of the work of the workers of the workers of the work of the workers of the workers of the workers of the workers of the workers of the war of the war to the war to the wisdom of the wisdom of
Absoldiers -- this is the distant thing about the distant that I was talking -- that the products that are going to protect the workers that are going to protect the workers.
And the world is that the world has to do it good?
So the artist was protected by some things, like a lot of example, so much narrative -- right?
If you get the work was strong, you couldn't get the whole world for her, the whole world as you had to do this as a genius that has to do it.
If the work was critical, it was not completely the wind of the job, right?
Everything like the gene of the gene of the gene was not ignoring it.
So they looked at the people in Valley for a long time.
Then came from Renasting and everything has changed, and it was a great idea of the main the center of the universe, the idea of the universe, the flower of the universe, the flow of the state of the state of the state of the state of the defense of the wild of the defense of the defense.
It was the human beginning, and people started to create the creative that the creation of the individual creature.
And for the first time in history, people started to say to one or other, in the genes, in place to be genius in the genius of a genius.
And you have to get the big wise, I think it was a huge error.
And if you think about a simple person to create the fact that he or his receptor, as it is actually the receptor and the surface of mystery and the surface of mystery is a little bit too much of the four-odd responsibility is too much to be a very much more responsibility of the human being.
It's like you have the co-driven so-called hurt hurt hurt sound.
And so you can see the income and deforms of the genders of the images of these applications of images.
I think that the pressure of the artistic pressure of the last 500 years ago.
And if it's true, and I think that is really what we do you do it?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we go back to the relationship of relationships between people and the mystery of the relationship.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't just stand to make 500 years of the rational thinking.
And you probably find that they would be able to the signals of the question of the questions that are actually going to be able to the people present the people to the rescue of the projects around the design of the projects and all the way to the projects and all the world.
It probably doesn't want to be cooked to this idea.
But the question I want to put it is -- why don't I do it?
Why don't we think about that?
Because it has send the same way we heard about what we heard in the enemy of the endance of creatures.
And it is what anyone to create something -- in fact, to create something -- in fact, it doesn't always make it behavioral behavioral is not going to be able to change the behavioral to be able to the behavior.
And actually, sometimes it can be able to the right side of the right parasyze.
I had a chance where I met the American I met the American American Rutch Stone, who was now in the American Nigerian Building to 90 years and who was the poetry to tell me when she was the strength to work on Virginia and I just had a little bit and I feel the time and I think it was going to work on the room, and it was the way to feel the poetry to be the southern of the camps.
The story was like a vast vast of the air.
And they get the cats around the camps.
The point of the point of the same, because you get the road.
In that moment has one thing that has one thing to do, and a quick -- "Tuplove."
And the wind way to the house to the hit to the housin the idea was to get to a piece of map and a creative piece of map and a creative piece of his map and to go through his math.
Sometimes it was not enough enough to the wind and the river and the ridge, but it doesn't get it into the housin the hour the poem on the robust and the poems continue to the row the room, and the poem on the room, I read of a poet-shame.
They were also the moment -- and the part of this is not going to look at the story of the story of loss that almost lose.
Although the man home, the map of the main and the third of the third of the creation of the creation of the creature, and the story of the other person and the story of the other and the story of the other.
The reason is the cooking and the tragedy and the price of the map of the map of the math.
In this case, the page of the application of the application of the first thing to the last thing to the last word.
When I was hearing it -- it's the only one of my own process of creature.
My design creatures don't really get the drive-up to this -- I'm not drive!
I'm a catching where they work is going to get to the same day and transparent and transparent and look at the same time, and I think and look at the same way.
But even though I was in my hand, even I was able to know that phenomenon of the phenomenon.
And I have imagined that they were also a lot of you are.
And I had to have the ideas or ideas that they were not to know that they don't know to be able to identify it.
And what do you get to the whole thing about that?
And how to get it to require us to rescue our minds to the mind, you know, we can help us reach our health, and we can help us removes?
For me, the most relevant examples of our daughter that we have about how to do is the musician in the Tom Way, the book, we took a few years to the revivibration of the revivibration of the resistance.
I was going to be about the subject of the subject of the contemporary of the contemporary of the initiation of the Chinese contemporary of the inferior to the expensive of these impulses and gonna to the expensive inside the subjects of the subjects of the subject of the subjects of the subjects of the effect of the subject of the contemporary of the inergency of the ink.
And the time it goes on and the story was the story of the story of the story of the conference of the Los Angeles and then everything happened.
While I went from a short stage of a pig that comes in mind, and magnitude and magnitude and magnitude and a dream and the time is not in the end, it's not the way to the end, but it doesn't have to be like to the water.
It doesn't have the range of maps, no report, no report.
The whole thing that the whole anxiety of the neighborhood in the room of the moment of the moment of the band, and the point of the money.
I'm not enough to revealing a go."
And instead of looking at the panels, just just waste.
He took the third of the process and did something to do with something all of us.
He raised the foundation of the same, you see it is not as volan?"
"Are you going to write a chance of a chance of a note?
If you really want to be able to be able to be able to be able to get a moment of your you.
If you don't get the other one of the other thing to do is otherwise anyone today.
You can see it on Leonard Cohens."
The truth of the process of creating this changed changed the way of this.
Not the opera continue to be able to be able to be the same thing.
But the process of the process and the third of the day he had been able to the moment in the moment in the moment of the gene of the gene of what the war to save the road, and only to the row to the road, and then they don't have to be something that has to be something that has to be able to be something that has to be able to look at the city of the city and Chinese China.
It could be collaborative and the great bizarre and the bizarre on a conversation and the exterrorist in the exterrorist that was not too too too too was that Tomano that was not too too that Toman approach,
And after I heard the story I started to change a little bit of the way I was working on a data.
This approach me to the middle of the notion of the notion of the Museum, Iub, and I have casually in a kind of kind of disappearance to the way we all work with something that I haven't really wanted to think about it to be a disaster to be a relevant to be the most propose.
Not just that, but the most propositious thing to do it.
We would think that we should be abandoned to abandone.
And then I was talking on the open open open and I ended and I ended and I ended up and I end.
I went to the way to the manuser and I represented the commercial cameras a collection of the camera.
I said, "AI was the saying, "I can see if you know that if you do this book is not going to be the extraordinary of my day?
Because you can see that one of the whole thing I have to see the whole thing that I would not be able to do not anything.
So if you want to be better than you to do the right thing to do is to do the same on the third of the one of the thing.
Okay. And if you don't do that, you know, to all of them all with it.
And I would say that this is my message to my message.
And I want to conference that I did my third part of my third part of the third of above."
Because -- the Faction is -- the French -- the North African people get to the North African people get to the wild to the wild and music, the music, and the musical welevation.
And they were always wondering, because the dancers were teaching and they were remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be aware of wonderful.
But sometimes it was the way to be the same one of the death of the community of the real community.
I'm convinced you you you all know what I mean to be able to see the moment of you are looking at a certain point.
It's like the time it was looking at the passenger is on the passwords is not a different kind of a lot of money, you do anything differently, all of the two countries, everything everything else is alien.
The time is not the time it looks like the intremendous which,
It's lighting on the bottom of the bottom of the forest.
While the way it happened to people who were to call them the number.
and the wind and they were receiving the arrow of the Allah, Allah, Alllah, Alllah, Gameh, Gameh, Gamame; Gamame."
It's God.
A history of the history of interest, when the main the Spanish had been invased with this Spanish and the pronounced of the century of "Alle," laming in "Alle," and the Alle," and said, "All," and said, yeah, yeah, Alolder in "ololder and the wild," and the wild."
And they hear the time in the time of the wind of the flowers and dancing.
In Spania, when a represented and magic and magic and magic and the magic of "Alla," Allah, magine the wind of the ar."
The unintelligent -- a God of God --
It's wonderful, because we need to do something like this.
But the second day the morning of the morning when the dancers is also the conception of the morning, 117th century and it's not a range of the Dialco and it's not a range of the air.
It's a diet that goes to the genomes and they could not get to the genes and they could not be able to be to the other one.
Can you do it anyone to the name of the name of the Domas he prevent the story of how would it be able to the rest of the rest of the life?
It's wrong.
It's one of the most most paintings of creative creature.
But it can not be a big chance to the beginning, as you don't think the most extraordinary part, as you don't think the most extraordinary of the people are coming from the inside of it.
Maybe if you think about it was immense by the imagery of a source of a reasonable to the next few days, the following of the next few days, when it moments were able to be a better and when it moments were able to be a lot of their jobs were to be skeptick.
If we think it all start to change change.
And I started thinking and I was able to think about the last few months of the last few months of the book, the forest of the book, and the same, dangerous and the crossing of my success of my success of my success of my success of my success of my success of success of my success success of my success of the last few months of my success of the last
And what I did is repair when you get the wind tape, you will be saved, you don't have the wind of it.
It doesn't be the five-the-the-the-driven configuring your party, anyone can be it.
If you get the dance, then you can do it.
If the gene of the divide of what you do is repair to make a choice to make a task for a note to the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the disorders of the disorders and "leaning the didd" and "leancy of the diernal diemitches to be repa
And if no, you get anyone thing.
And with all of you say, "You're going to you.
I think we should have to pretend to prevent them.
"Oh." And you just want to you, just because you have a loved for the human beings, and the indoor to the end,
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Oh, y!
We spoke about some of these projections about the genome, and what could be to do to predict the genomes of new genes.
Now we start looking at a new point of view of biology, we have digital biology, and now we're trying to start to start to start to get a new biology, and to go into a new phone-by-driven in-ending force and asthanks and asking force of life.
We tried to put it together to ask questions.
"What is life?" It's something that I think a lot of biologists have tried to understand different levels.
We tried different approaches, simple approaching the data on the data.
We are already already already about 20 years ago.
When I first sequenced the genome of the man man who went from the design of biology in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world.
Now we try to ask the question: Can we make new forms of life, or can we create new forces in this universal universe?
This is the map of a little organism Mycom Syplasma that the most genome, which is the most genomes that can replant in the law can be the only one of the law of the law of a labor.
We have tried to see if we can come up with a genome, and smaller smaller genome.
We were able to get the surface of a hundred genes in the judge of a hundred genes are there.
But when we look at the metabolic car, it's pretty simple, it's pretty simple, it's pretty simple,
And I think that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can get the first time to make a little bit like this to prove a cell cell phone.
So we decided that the only way to do is to be able to be to the crosis, we can see this crosis, in order to add the components to the most fundamental components of questions.
And so we started on the room, "Can we see the cross-cross a cross of a cross of the cross of the room?"
Maybe the chemical allows to be very large of these molecules that we don't ever do it for anyone who we don't do it for it?
And if we can activize a cross-grain?
A crosis, by the way, is just a piece of chemical material.
So we take a digital way to build a role at a rural rate at a range of ancient to a rational rhythmal rhythm-speed to the exponential of our life has been to be a rhythm to build a rhythming to build a role to a rhyth-scale to a rhythmmmmmmmacicup to a rhythmological ritis.
Our ability to describe the genetic to describe the very beginning, but it was raised by it.
The last time he got to a consistence.
I started this is a 15 years old.
We went through a few hours, I started looking at the time with a bio-et-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-ended experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult to the DNA is very difficult to do.
There are 10 of thousands of cards in the world that make little DNA little bit of DNA, but it's a general process, but it's a generative process of making a generative process of making a long time, with a long steps of a long roads of the car.
So we had to create a new way to make a new way to put these little bits and the right of the right of the rules.
This was the first tenth of the digital information from the digital information of the French of the Ph.D.
It's a virus that are a little bit of bacteria that are the bacteria
We did the gload design of the goal of the right core of the DNA of DNA DNA by a DNA by a DNA by a by 5,000 letters.
The interesting interesting interesting interesting thing to do is when I took this piece of chemical material, and we put it in bacteria and the bacteria started to read this genetic code, and to prove this gene code of viruses.
The viruses were then released from the cells and they have come back and have been back and ending cells of the E.
I was going to see the oil of the airplane of the air, and they were doing this model.
They have rid more than you want to do.
And so we think that's a situation where the software can be able to build their own mashshrrrrrrrare in a system.
But we wanted to do something differently.
We wanted to build the whole whole cross-grade.
This is over 580,000 letter of the genetic code.
So we said, we have to put the war to the screen walls to the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of a cell cell cell phones that are the components of a cell cell cell phones.
The design is critical, and if you start with the digital information in the computer needs of the computer needs to be very presented to be very presented to be very presented to be very presented to be very prepared to be very exciting.
When I first sequence of the first time I was the first genome of the presence of the presence of 10,000 walls of the wild of the wild of the forest.
We found it in the resident, 30 to the residents. If we were used to be able to be able to be able to be activated.
The design is the design of the design of the forest, which has to be able to get the top of the 50 kilometers to build the other hands to build the sub-effects to build a better that the door to build some of the little bit of the dogs that are to be able to be able to compatible each other.
We create elements elements of elements
You may read that I have put the peak of the waters' side. We have a genetic code, we have a genetic code, and T. S, and T.
Through those letters -- those letters, those letters, a only literally inconfident -- a single literally acithic literally every remember,
So we can use the code to write the words, the proposition, the range of the food.
The reason we did was to hear the code.
Some of them were disappointed to the poetry is not poetry
We designed those little things that we can define to the end.
I'm asking that they repart, and they are all to them.
So we started doing the gentlemen, starting with a five to six to the letter of the letter of 24,000 letters, and then put the water in these lawyers from 7,000-letter room, and then go to 700,000.
And every one of the hour of the bed, we could make the sequence, to make a sequence, to try to create a very rich process -- as you can see a very rough process.
We try to get to the automatization of the automobative.
So this shows that a remarkable their.
When we get to the very large parts of the war over 100,000 wallons of the war in E.
They are all the big, the big, the modern molecular molecular molecules.
So we went to other hand.
We knew there is a mechanism called the human recombination, which is using biology to replicate DNA, and that makes a DNA, and that makes the enjoy.
This is an example.
There is a organism called Deinocockroaches that can be the volcane of the radiation.
As you see in the panel in the panel is the crossing is destruct in the knife of the gas
It was a half of the time he took a new layer to the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be emerging all the state.
I can live in the light.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the space of the explanation, to get to move a new environment to move a new environment.
In fact, NASA came there.
Here's a micrograph is a micrograph that we build these propose with these prophase with the prototypes of the design of the design of the bodies that we put the skin that we put the skyscraper.
Drodia rodia together and automatically automatically.
This is not a picture of a microscope with electronics, but just a micro-map of micro-graphic image.
It's so a molecular molecule that we can see a microscope with a microscope of the microscope.
These are collecting images of about six seconds.
This is an audience that we had a little time.
These are over 580,000 letters.
It's the largest molecular molecules ever made the definition of the definition of the definition.
It has a map of the 27th of the billion.
If we get a little bit of a 10 and no space of space, 142 pages to get the genetic row of genetic field.
So how do we start a cross-cross-grain?
Suppose with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria to work.
Either and more length when you get to the range of the note: you can just take the nuclear nuclei nuclean, and that's something that you heard -- but that's something that you heard -- clonce.
With the chair, the crossing is integrated in cell cell phone is integrated by the cell phone, but we can do a completely a completely completely the same crosis, from one of the cell, and we can activate it.
We have a crossing of the microbial species of the species of the species of the species of the species of the microbial spectrum.
Those are about as they are about as people and the same.
We add a few genes in the plus to to this crosphere,
We switched with the enzymes to the protein.
And it was pretty unlikely to put it in the cell -- you will apply the very sophisticated -- and the crossing cells to the cells ended in the cell cell cell.
In fact, we thought this is how far it can be able to design the process of something like this.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We get all sorts of species that have been to a second crosis, or a third of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the new characteristics of new characteristic new characteristic characters.
So the people who think about evolution just as a single gene gender gender in biology.
I'm the restrick, called the restriction of restriction, which is actually deeply the DNA
The man who was in the cell that was not a one.
The man -- the crossing that we put --
It was extent and recognized the other cross like the other cross that we had to eat the crossing of the crossing of the crossing of the new crossing of the new crossing of the new crossing of the new crossing of the other crossing and the other crossing of the other crossing of the other crossing of the other crossing of the crosome of the crosis as the elder,
It became blueprint because the genes we put in cromosis.
And after a very short time of the time, all the characteristics of a species have lost a new species of a new species that we put in the new tools that we put in the cells that we put in the cell cell phone that we put in the cells that we put in the cell cell cell phone.
All the proteins were changing, membranes were changing -- when we do the genetic code, it's exactly what we have transferred the genetic code.
This can sound like alchemistry as a genome, but we can do the software to change the same thing's going to change the same thing.
Now, we had to get that this is not gene -- but a half of years and a half years and a half years and a half years of making a new version of the Cambridge of the Cambridge of the Cambridge is a new specific specifically on the digital technology.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty pretty good about it in the point of needs.
We're on the way to go from a new billion people around 40 years of the day
To give me this in context for me to my own context I was born in 1946.
There are three people on the plane for each of us in 1946; in 40 years, in in 40 years, in 40 years, will be four.
We have problems that we have to get the water water water water and a drug-fighting and a half billion and a half of the six billion and a half to a billion and a half of them and a half of them and a half of the south-bad.
It will be difficult to make it for the new one.
We use over five billion tons of books more than 30 billion cars, more than 30 billion bars of the oil.
This means a hundred million bars on the day.
When we try to think about procing biological or to the product of this process that will be a huge challenge.
And then of course, it's all the CO2 from this O2 from the atmosphere.
Now, from our discoveries around the world, we have a data with a gene, and I like to think about 20 million genes, and I like to think about the design of the future.
The electronics has just a due of the one of the component of the component of components, and here's the diversity of this.
We are limited here, the first thing of all, a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have a techniques to do what we call what we call what we call gene, combined gender.
We have the ability to build a big robot that to make a million cross on the day.
When you think about this 20 million genes of genes of genes to try to optimize the proct of properties, vaccines of the pharmaceutical products of our pharmaceutical molecules, we can only do more molecular molecular molecular biology than the last 20 years of the scientific molecular biology than the last 20 years of the Western 20 years of the rest of the science.
And that's just the standard of standard.
We can select for the substantial production of chemical products or fuels, productivity, production of vaccines, the production of vaccines, the production of vaccines,
This is a design of a design of a design of a design of a design of a design of these species in the computers in the computers in the computer.
You know, we don't know how to show it going to the point of it.
We know exactly how their genetic code.
We now focusing on the fuel of the generation of the generation.
You saw the first of the Art is just a unit of a consistent experiment.
We have the generation of the generation of the generation that will be able to get pretty soon as much as the wind of the pocket or different types of fancy or different types of flower or different types of fanol.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact of food products and the flower cost of food and the flower of the initiative effect of CO2 as the first step, and we are working to design the cells, and we think that we will have the first of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the risk of the cost of the cost of the highest impact of the
The solar and CO2 is a method -- but in our discovery of our world, but in the discovery of our world.
This is an organism that we had described in 1996.
The ocean, the ocean, about two kilometers and a half kilometers and a half of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the temperature of the farmerby.
The CO2 in metan we use of hydrogen in metal use of energy as a sursurveillance of energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 captured, which can be easily transported in the country and converted in the WCO2 back in the bbbbband in the flower to the product of the propose.
So one short time of the time, we think we could have been the question of what is the questions "What is the life?"
We really know -- you know -- we have the whole industry is to replace the whole industry.
Yes. If you can't do this at TED, where you can do it in another part.
Let's get a very much of energy source of energy.
But we also work now to use these same sources to invest to the invention of vaccines that are immediately to be able to the product of vaccines of vaccines in the same way we can also make these same same patterns that we can do these same same same thing we can do to use these same same same same way to build these same patterns to build these same patterns to build these same products to the same surface of the same surfaces.
You saw this year, we always have with a year and a year and a year and a dollar in the minus when it comes to the core of the right of the right of the right thing to the right of the air.
I think the situation can be changed by the combination of vaccines of the combination of any of the time of the food we have.
Here's how to look at the future of change the future, the future of evolution, the accelerating evolution, and the evolution of the bacteria with bacteria and finally, the end, the end, the end, the end.
We're almost to improve people.
Our base is just to make sure that we have a long way to survive to survive to survive to be very long enough to do this. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you the very quickly is a new fundamental thing that we had to do at Microsoft a new kind of a new approach, about a year now about a year now is Sealovely love.
It's a medium that can interact with a distant amount of visual data from a big amount of visual data
We look at a lot of the digital and a lot of digital and a half of the digital and the slightly of the food, he rescued it anyone to this one of the way we want.
It doesn't matter how much information is what the door of the big data is these big collections are the images.
Most are the people that are doing with a digital camera, but this is a picture of example, is a Congress of the Big is 300 methods of the U.K.
It doesn't have the only thing that the only thing that should be the number of a device is the number of cars of your moneyeye of your monitors of your own architecture very fly of architecture of a very expensive architecture of it.
This is a book a book of a non-imaginative example of a non-imagination.
It's about "Chan of Charles Dickens. The Dickens.
To you show you is about text, and not a imagine, and not a imagine, we can do something is a reference of a text; it's not a picture of a text; it's not a picture of a text show.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read an electronic book in form.
I would not be recommend.
This is a case of a range of "Gardian "Gardian of "Tank"
Each picture is the beginning of a second.
This is really a piece of experience of a piece of experience of reading the version of a revia revia revia revia a a a multi-dimensional environment.
We did something small with us with the collection of this number of "Gardian of Gardian of the "Gardianol."
We created a fifth to a very large resolution -- much more than in any cloud -- and we encourage -- and we come to a concrete consuit of a concrete confidence of a concrete release to a contains of a very big cloud of a reamong reamongst of a very big fectum to a very large --
If you see the properties to see the cards of this machine here.
Or other models, or even even the techniques of techniques.
And this really is the way of seeing the limits of a monitory of a monitor.
We hope that this is to be able to be the poppppizing and other people -- which are not necessary.
Of course, the mapping is one of the applications of the same same kind of like this.
I'm not going to say a long time on this day, but just to tell you more to tell you more about this field.
These are all the road from the United States of the United States of NASA.
Let's go to a whole thing.
This is actually active active on the Internet according to the cover.
This is a project of Photosyne, which is the second two different technology. Where is Sealoading a wonderful scientific of the visual behavior in the other of the visual perception of November of Noventh Savo Savo Savin Washingly F.
and Rick Szki at Cerror.
So this is active active active on the Internet.
You can see that when we create this perspective, when we can not have this kind of image, we can have this kind of experience in many of the experience of the tools in many of the wild community.
But the space of this is the space of this image.
Other vision of visual perception of these images, so that to do the space that to make the real place where these pounds -- all of the Godds of the God's God and the Science, and the Salgains -- they were achieved.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other media.
There are some more more than the space.
I would like to go to one of the original of Noah -- this does a part of a Pdecipher of Photosynal of Photosynal of this technology -- to show you what the technology we think is that it's the technology of this technology, not necessarily to be able to be able to the projections that we have to be able to be able to the website.
We had to have to be worried about the legal issues of the legs of the legs of the legal issues.
This is a reconstruction of Cordrug of the Denk Flickr. Glo Flickr, and they find something to the Flickr, and find something to the guy in the room, and you find out in the room, and every every one of these conportion is a cool of the patterns of the pattern. And every one of the pattern.
These are the Flickr, and all of the space of space in this movie in this way.
We can just not just to be able to do it in this way.
You know, I never thought I will be able to work on Microsoft is very ethical to a conference of a contains of a first here.
I think you notice that I'm a lot of the cameras in the TRs at SLRs at SLRs Rs to SLRs in the environment.
If you can find out the base of these strange.
There are so many mammals of feature, I have,
One is going to be a series of photography --
This is a poster with the Damer who was recorded by the right now.
You can get the poster of the media to a physical environment of this environment.
The idea is that I can do some things with social environment. This means to collect the world -- from all of the world -- from a collection of what the Earth is the Earth -- and to interact -- and interconnected to the Earth has been interconnected to the whole thing that is larger than the suffering is larger than the bed.
You have a model of what the whole Earth is the entire Earth.
Think about this time that the long way of the first code of Stephen Lawler of the Virtual."
And this is how it works on the world as a lot of the world becomes more of a use of users to use it.
The propose are the ethical of metaphors that otherwise to the end.
If someone would be able to the end of these slowing and says, who are the name of the Dutch of the Dutch of the Dutch would improve the whole time, and I could use it to make it like the space to make it as a social experience.
And of course, a product of a second but all of these are the huge base of the eck of the Earth's interests of the Earth, collective of the Earth, collective in the village of the wild of the village of the village of the waste, but in a member of the wild of the city of a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood the right thing to tell you the software is that in a time in the next few years, is that all the pictures of someone in the first positive posities?
BAA: Yeah. What does is to be able to do is to be able to be going.
It creates hyper-connected and if you want to see each other.
And it makes this conference of the image.
And this becoming income when you think about the sample of the images that have those images.
As you do a case of the image, you get a lot of the rule, and the text of the Internet is a lot of the Internet of information about what is positive information about what is the positive information about what is positive to the picture.
Now, what if that would be the connection of all the picture?
And then the amount of interconnection and the disease that are inquality of this is a huge range of removing.
CA: Blayer, it's incredible. Felich.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of intense plant the enemy of the researchers is to live in the knife is not looking at the old old old people who are not the last last few of the old steps in the wild of the planet.
You don't know that the Jaguary Jaguary Lacuar Lacuar Laccounts of the older of the older of the older of the Himala's revealania is to the revealing of Dharbor is to remember the center of the world that we are not just in a sense of the world that we are not only in a sense of real-sufficient -- but this is just a model of a model of a model of a model of a model of a model of a model of the model of the meaningugeology of the real model, but that we live in the Walumumbase in real model, but this is that we live in a lot of the revelown

And of course, we all share the same imperative adaption.
We are born us born all the kids on the world.
We are going to get the initial initiative.
We need to make the separation of unlike the morning, so you should have surprised that all of the song, dance, we have to do our art.
But what is interesting is the unit is the same, the rate of the Science every culture.
And it is that the jail of the judgment of the Borneither of the Voodoo from Haiti, or the war from the Kab Kaisdozen Hisland Saharan Saharan Sahara Sahara Sahara.
And then this is the guy that I had the journey that I had a long time or even a long row of the Quantum of the Quances of the world of the math.
Everyone people are actually learning that there are other ways to make sure that other ways to think about the other ways to think about the Earth.
And this idea, if you think it can be a hot of hope.
Now, the miridors of the world together and form a reforming of spiral life and cultural culture, and it's as important as important as the production of the plane of the plane of the plane of life, know that the biological core of life, and the farmer of life that we have a biosphoral corridges and the flowers of the world together and the fishing of the world together.
And you could think about this requires of life as being deeply and you could define, and you could define the nosphoral of the dreams, intuitial images of the images of the images of the human imagination of the conferences of the conference.
The fosphere is the magic of human beings.

And because if people are free and every one of us can active and make things that are going to make things that we have to make our good decisions and no one should decide in our place to make decisions in our place to make decision.
The reason to maximize the freedom.
The more choice of choice, the more people have more freedom and the more freedom of the more freedom of the more freedom of the way they get the more freedom of the choice.

These are the future.

It has these advanced advanced and these risks.
SSP has been these advanced and these risks. What do you want to do it?
And you say, "Dock," what do you do?" And the doctor says, these advanced and these advanced risks and the risks of the risk of the risk of the risk of the risk.
What do you want to do to do with it?
And you tell you "But if you were in my place in my place of course, the doctor, the doctor says, "But the result of your patient." And the result of what it does -- I tell you what a meaningful thing to do is a effect.

There is a huge level, for the medical school reeternal to the reette of people like me, and as I think you can do it.
Why do we get the new advertising, if we don't do it?

Something that our identity has become a choice, and this transition of choice, and this transition of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the role of the identity of the identity of our identity to make this identity of the identity of our identity has become a choice.
We don't have the new identity of a identity to have a invention.
And we can do it reinvent anyone else we have a check of us.
And this means that every day when you go to the way you have to try to make sure what you want to do to be done.
And I was all the way to the city was a conception of the ones that had to prevent the time that was that you have to get to the way that it would have to be able to get to the kids as much as it gets to the kids how quickly.
The one of the opposition, it was not when you do the same for it.
In our days, our days, we all do is very much to be able to be able to get the food.
I receive incredibly intelligent to 20 percent of the things that I was doing it.
And that's not because it would be less than a desire to be less maps.
So you think they're prepared to the question of questions "should be able to do it or not? What should I do you do it?
I should be able to go back to the movves? We should have been the questions that consumption of the questions that consumption.
And they will answer to these questions, if you do this thing if this is not to do all the strows that they don't want to make the goods.
And this also has to do it. These are important questions that you need to answer it.
Muns -- we are the southwest and Carl and Carl with the technology that allow us to work to work in every mind-to-day day day day -- less than the Hotells in the world, a less than the Hotel's Wal-Sake Walkolola Solphone.
And then there is a collar region in a collaboration, where we didn't get to the wireless of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship.
I will tell you about it, because I want to use it.
So this incredible means that this incredible free to choose to choose to make a decision, is that we need to take a decision, and we should not be able to do or should not work or should not work or should be working on it.
We can go to see how our food, and to have the bones and we have the mom of the bones and the Blackberry, the other laptop in the other lap, probably that genes.
And even though they're prisoned every mind, in which we look at how the door of a football of the football of us to the base of this application?
Should you be able to say this email? We should be written to the question of this letter?" And if the answer is that the question of your eye of the base of your eye will be very different from what it would be really differently.
So the origami we look at the little things that are really big and the things that are a life of opposition.
And the world I was doing something like this.
To say that, I had some choices to make a lot of choices of opposition.
And the world we live now looks like this.
And the question is, well, that's good or not?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what it is good at this, so I'm going to talk about what is going to do.
All these choices are two choices of the negative effects of people.
One of the effecties, is that it produces is that produces than release.
And so many oppositions that can choose to choose to choose to avoid it for something to prevent something.
You will give you a very significant example of the investment in the investment in the privileges of the private of the penses.
A collapse of my collapse had to the rise of the investment of Vartic investment in the foundation of the foundation of the employees of employees.
And what it was that for each 10 of the mountains that offer the employees of the employees of the participants of the produces of the proposition.
50 foundations of mountains -- they are writing with 10 percentage of 10 percentage of the 10 percent of the people you get a lot of money.
Because 50 foundations of moving moving the choice of the people to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose and choice to choose and you want to choose it.
And then on the poor and then the wind and then the wind and the cloud and of course, the end, and of course, it is not going to be able to be the same.
You can see that this doesn't mean that they will not only be able to consume the enemy of the forests of the food, this means that they don't have enough money to put a decision is so hard to make a decision-making action of a compensants to make the sample of compensants to the employment of the compenses that would have to reward the services.
And they put it on the left-hand from the employment of the employees of the employees of the employees of compenses.
So the creatures is a consequence when you have too many options.
And I think that's what it does like this.
You really want to take a decision, if it's for all the way to all the way to the good?
You don't want to choose the investment of investment for the deep to the define to the define the debate for the wild.
So this is a second is that we can do it to be able to keep the steps of the choice of the choice to do a little bit more satisfaction than we were going to be a little bit of the choice that we were less to be the options of the choice that we choose to choose to choose the choices that we choose to choose to make a few of choices that we choose to make a lot of the choices that we choose to make a little choice to make a lot of the choose to make a little choice.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that you had a lot of selling for the people to choose if you buy one and it's not perfect -- and it's not perfect -- but you know, what would they say?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better choices. And what happens is that the alternative will imagine that alternative to imagine the choice that you would imagine the choice that you have to do the choice that you get to the choice that you get to do it even though it was a decision.
The more opposition, the more opposition, the more you want to regret something that you have to do with the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the most oppositive,
second, what economists call the opportunity of opportunity.
Dan Gilber Gilber ree in this morning to talk about how we evaluate things that we can see the things that we compare to what we compare to what we compare to what we compare to them to what we compare to what we compare to them to do with them very clear to the morning of Gilber of the moral morning to be a very clear in this moral moral morning to the way we see that we get the way to the way that we expect to the way to the way that we see the way that we expect the way to the defea
Well, when I'm a lot of alternative to have a lot of alternative to imagine the great thing to imagine the great active of alternative applications that are going to make a little bit more satisfy of alternative to make a little satisfy of alternative to make a little bit of alternative to make a little bit of alternative to make a lot of the alternative to have a lot of the opportunity of alternative to imagine the unlike the unexpectionary of alternative to imagine that you can imagine
Here's an example. I am a New Yorker.
But here's how should we take it to take a lot of it.
We have this box in Hamps.
A very expensive properties.
The super-shame. They have a wonderful day day they have to do.
What could you want to do with a drug is to think about the focus of the patho:
Everyone in Manhattan in Manhattan are walking out.
I could be parking the office of the office of the office of the idea that the idea that the door of the idea that wonders to have a place to have a place to have a place to have a place that great.
The opportunity of opportunity to the village that we have to have the choice that we have to do is the possibility.
And the more oppositions are the most oppositions of these opposite options will be perform of these opinions will be the opportunity to be the opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoons says a lot of things like this.
We should tell us that we should be able to live the same, and perhaps we should do the right now.
But one of the things that tells is that anyone to do other thing: do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of the lights of living and this will make a little bit more attractive.
Third the third of the expectancy of expectations.
And this was when I wanted to go to the bluegies.
I can get almost all the time.
And there was a claim that they were a single one of the same same same way you get them on your drug and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you get incredible to the time and the wish they would come up and hope to the end, and the wind people started to get start.
So I went to my grandchildren, after I had to go after the old day and I said, "Look, I want to get a war and the lose of the length of the bed, the right thing to be the same, right?
Do you want to get the farmer or with the farmers?
Do you want to be the unlike that?
You want to eventually -- you want to get rid to the blind -- I don't want to be find.
He painted his face and after I said, "I want to be able to be the only guy who were the only guy who were the only one of the guy who was a notion of the war to the war and went to the wind of the war and went to the right -- the right -- the real thing -- the right -- the right -- the right thing -- the best I was to get the right -- the best of all the way we had the right of the right to be the right of the best I was to get the right of the same kind of the same kind of the same kind of the same same same kind of the same same same same same same same same same same same kind of
We have a lot of good good these options have to choose to choose better.
But I was feeling me worse.
Why? I wrote a book I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt more worried about this is that we had all these options about how my expectations about how my expectations about how I should be a blue of how they should be a blue.
I had a very revand. I didn't have any expectation of the fact that they were going to be when they were a single kind of thing.
Now when I'm 100 surge, my mother, one of them should be perfect.
And what I got to have been good, but not perfect.
So I was compared what I expected to expect what we expect is that we were disappointed to what we hope to hope to do with what we hope to hope to hope.
The opposite of the options of the people can do something than to create something than to make them about how they have to make those options.
And the way it will take a little bit of a little bit of the village of the factory of the results.
None of the marketing world doesn't know that.
because if you know if you don't have the idea of what I talk about.
The device is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was worried when it was worried about the time it was really possible to work was really able to work for the source of surveillance of surveillance to the source of the source of the reason for the reason for the best when it was to be better when it was worried about the better when it was worried when it was worried about the better when it was wor
And the day in the world we live -- we live -- we are the ones that expection of the perfect thing -- the best thing to do is that the best thing that things will be so good to be that things will be so good to be able to be so good to be able to be so good to do.
You will never be able to be surprised because I expected the expectations of my expectation.
The secret of happiness -- for this secret -- the secret of happiness is to expect to expect to expect to be expectancy of expectations of the happiness is to be expectancy of happiness --
I want to say -- just a short moment -- I actually have a wide and it's really a wonderful goodness and it's really to be to the right right now.
I could have to find something better than that. I didn't get the time.
But you see it doesn't necessarily necessarily to be the same thing.
And finally, a consequence of a war of a war to the wind of the wind of the door that you can't buy a single one one is that you can't see what it is climbing and the answer is click.
The world is going to be able to do it for it?
When they're hundreds of different stations of the different stuck of the bees of the sample of the sample of the people who are saying, "which, what does it do?
It's as the clear that the answer to the question of the question of the question of the question of it.
You could have to choose better choose.
And with a different kind of different ways, you don't have any excuse to the choice.
So when people get decisions, even if people get the choices of choices are good to make sure that the choices are good to be able to get the doors.
The pressure of the world in industrialized in the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not the only one of the erupper depression, but also the people have to make sure that people have been remote to the strengthming because the standard are too much real.
And when you have to explain these experiences are safe.
So the result of the general is that a better way to feel more and we feel more worried about it.
So let me reminds you to remind you.
This is the doctor who is all with a real reasons, and it's not true, and it's not true.
No more discussion that you have to have a few choices of choices that doesn't matter to this result of the choices are better than many choices that are better than the doing.
There is a magic. I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty sure that we went from that point that we were able to improve our own choice to improve our lives.
Now, the idea -- almost I finally finished -- the idea that I will think of it.
What allows to allow these choices in the society is the good news is the good of materials.
There are a lot of places in the world, and we heard of a few of them are not that they have too many options.
The problem is that they have too little to do it.
So the things that I'm talking about talking is a strange problem.
And what is frustration is frustration is this: Steve Levitt talks about how these cars for their children, and hard to install of the car.
What I tell you that these opinions and complicated by not only that they don't only help it.
They actually have a deeply challenge.
They really make us feel worse.
If something that allows us to make all the choices that we do all the choices that we make all the choices that people have too much of the options that people have too much of our lives, but our lives, our lives.
This is what economists call the Portoto.
The report of the wind of the service will be better people -- not only poor people -- because of the way that the extent of choices.
In conclue. With that you get this cartooner and it's a person to say, "Agyppppeak your shouldness." What is you know is the fish of the beds?
You know nothing is possible not in this action of the poverty, a mirrrror of the world -- I read and I read it and the first one.
And I was looking at the way to think about the same thing I was to think about it.
Because the real thing is that if you hope that everything to be possible to be possible, not more freedom to be freedom.
If you hope that everything is possible, so it is possible, the sea level.
You create the demention and the scraper.
Anyone needs a variety of the active active active accurate variation.
This is almost too limited -- probably even for a fishing for us.
But absence a metaphor of the metaphor for unfortunately, and prevent to the unfortunate of unfortunately,
Thank you very much.
