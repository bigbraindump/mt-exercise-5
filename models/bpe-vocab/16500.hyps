The year I was able these two diameter to show that the second reager of the crisis that the major 40 million years ago, the most important thing was about 48 million years old, was the size of 48 percent of the size of 40s.
But this moral moral issues because of this specific issue because of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of this moral moral moral moral moral moral moral in but this moral moral moral moral moral
The other police is a way that the future of the global world that is the global system.
She is also the extension, and the desire of the way.
The next positive positive that I will be a very quickly required to what happens.
Give the phanthropy is the marriage.
So you can see the blue blue of the blue of the blind.
This is the ancient of the water,
And it is the moral morning.
Ask the coast, with a old old old old old or more you could see is almost almost like the same, you can see that it's almost almost almost almost like a gene.
In this 2-year-old girl, this is about that.
This is a problem because the insurance of the deep challenge, the falling of the ocean.
where it is a strange amount of risk of the nasty that they have received in the metal of the metaphor of the metaphor.
Comptic police with the crisis to the global warming the atmosphere of the atmosphere of the atmosphere.
In certain cases in some of the Alaspiano of Alaska is about the ancient of the nosa is at the same.
The Katman Walman Walter in Alaska was on the Wala was on a nine of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the past.
Oo: Oh, Go! Go: The story is the AIDS is if we can do.
And a reason is that the word "Ya" is Gringers' is Grushenenabyet.
This is a range of announced.
But the pumps are a lot of it.
This is the Kanglersan Grushed Gragon.
If you want to know how the great it of the big level of the base of the sky of the sample is where it is the same.
These are very quickly.
And at the other side of the planet, Antarctica larger top.
Lone of the people who have been rejected by the continent of the continent is the treatment of the Science of the Antarctica of the sample of the country.
This is the equal of the size of the moon, the quality of Grushed Groad.
In Himalaya, the third of the third of the treatment of the new forms of the new forces, which is in the circumstances.
40 percent of the population of the world of the world of the water of the water of the base of these different miles.
In this case, this little little bit of the water is the bon-wild for this orchestra.
The other people have been released by it.
But when it comes to the water water and the water water water water and the water water
In California was a role in the straight of the Sierra Sierra.
This is the properties of the water.
And you predict how you read it, they're seriously.
In the world has been working on a crime of a crime of the crime of the insects.
And the same kind of global movements have been a great role of a great role and the extendency of the country.
For four times more of the last 30 years, the people of the 70s of the 75 miles.
This is a very straight of the insector.
If you have a context of context of the history of the history of the story.
In the last five years we ended up about 3,000 dollars a dioxide of the virus of the planet.
The other is going to be to the Pacific Pacific Simico to the West and the one of the subject of the epidemic in the ocean, the virus of the ocean.
The biggest because the global warming world of global warms, which requires about 20 percent of the reportion of the sample of the same.
The size is a great problem and the good news is the most important issue.
The United States is one of the two big initial of China.
And it was going to build more and more and the good news for the good news for the book.
But we start to see a change.
Here are the ones that have the last last last years with specialized specialized by the specific properties.
However, there were a police in our country.
And the industrial and the oil and the oil was finished a 30-dollar planet.
The good news is what is a taspiror.
This image of a picture of something like this.
In the COOctober Tenna, a billion sello region of the skyetal was impressed.
You would have to be able to get to the galls.
This is the other thing that is the big fast of the United States has been in the preparing of Country and the COOctober the COOOctober of the COOctober that is all the way to the COOh, this is all the way of the war is all the way that is all the way --
One of the remains of the cartoon the Western of COOctober was this was this one.
Video: Wow, the good book, is a good pelly, is a same, and you know,
This is the ababuse of America, and helping to make the design of the creation of the creation of the economics.
Frow with the good book, it becomes a little bit of what happens in the more computation.
It's also also also also a lot of workers and work of the same.
The Go: This is the big cities of the Virginial Virginia.
The biggest line of the most parties is the great thing of Massey of Massey of the Give of the Sassy of the Sassy of the Saspiring of the most part.
Video: Don Blanennan Genz: The Gow, Nanny Go's Goo Russia, Harvard Russian Russia.
The Go: So the same kind of RIlular County, the COOctober two cameras.
This is one of them, a part of the one of them.
Video: The Western COLake we see the climate change in our innovation is very serious for the business.
And the fact that our main is to spend a great money for public public health and the audience that we have to help us understand the good news and we have the good news about the car.
The device is not the good books is not didn't.
We think it's a little bit -- and I think it as well.
So you don't have to be the climate change.
You have this in fact that we find it.
Video: The ma: You heard a map of it.
So you can do a guy, this kind of a crisis of the cartoon the cartoon the cartoons.
With the wild! The ggymnanomever.
But this is the sound of the good technologies of the card.
And as the good cars is one of the main the global main the global world remarkable technology that you see the technology of the technology of the technology that you see here.
The other is going to be able to be the good technology of the good news is the good news.
The Gove the end of the conference of the real challenges with the challenges of the challenges and the problem of the climate change.
Video: Narderia, is in the economy, the economy, the economics of climate crisis.
And the thing that is the same as a computation of the computation of the prototypes of the sky of the skills of the skyetic.
But now we have a new solution to the needle of the wild of the cast.
Trying America with electricity to Chinese electricity, in 10 years ago, in the decade.
A hundred years ago, and then the third of the country, and it makes us more symptoms and to help us to reach the global global warms.
In the end, a big solution to help us make us a big solution.
You know, the risk of America.
Secone: This is the last one.
Video: It's about re-risk energy.
One of the most deep deeps we have been able to encourage the Sweild disorders that we have died the Barbo Barbo is here -- a new remarkable new product of the product of the emergency of the genetic various of the genetic struction.
Barbo 2: 2: We invest to create the road.
Narar: R-Policics. It's time for the action.
The New Government of African African African arm that says, "Gove you to go away,
If you want to get to the slow, you get the door of the door
We have to go ahead and wake up.
Thank you very much.
The year I was going to do a TED BHC.
And I have to go and go to to to get a data data data about how it works is the prototype.
So the other side, those who didn't have been here, and the most people who were the most people who was asked the most people that was the required by 27 kilometers -- the Cumphic or of the Streatment of the presentation of a 30-year --
It's extremely extremely unusual way.
This is the Genive Gense Genene.
We make photographs of these members of "Big Bang" in the decade of the decade.
I work at this point. It is called ATLS ATLygymous 44 meters of 22 meters of 22 meters here is about the images of the ATT-ATT-A-T-A-T-A-T-A-T-A-T-A-TS project.
In the 10 clock of the first year, I was the first step.
And this picture was the ATLATLATLATLAS
It's a certain kind of a very large roppping of control.
It's a picture of the first one of the major role of the Law HHC, the HHC, the HC C, the free of L.C.,
In other words, when I have seen that picture of 10 clock that I have learned that the creation of the work of the work of the work of the work of the device.
I don't know whether this has been the largest est est est est poor anything that he went on the top of the top of the first place.
It means that I did a lot of the ranging of the impact of the evolution of the evolution of the impact of the evolution.
And after a little bit of a nine problem with the step, which is actually made with these days, that was the bike -- these guys.
These are the spread 13 thousands of among other three of the mountain of the power of the moon.
Now, we can go to these days, and they can actually form the plant and they can transform the diametes.
But I can do that when they are at the temperatures become the prototypes that are called the properties.
So as 27th century, it's more -- it's more than the same, those of the beach, those are able to the peak of the box.
At one of the laws of 9,000 magnitude LHCCCCCC, was a remarkable of the factory of the factory of the factory of the fact.
So the government has been a little bit of the 13 thousands of among among other three of among the electricity.
This was the result of the result of the result
This is the most important thing that they have been the magnitude of 20 to 20 times the pest, and they have been able to 30 miles away.
So I have a about 50 magnitude.
I had to put it on the door and I did it.
I reached all the way we did it.
And now we take the magnitude and then in the subject.
The second one of the great Science will be like the HHC will be like new adapers.
We will start to get to the phase of the data data and you can get into the parallel and the research of the science of the universe.
Now, of course, as a consequence of those who are opening up to the fact that we are also the important thing to do is reach.
I think that the fact that it is that we have been able to be able to be able to be important to the WH.C.
I'm going to be able to the words of the British people who are Duminum Dumint Duminelinated by the way, I think that it is a Freadaaaaay, "Nha" is not more about the previous approach to the minister of the preventing of the nurses that are not more likely to be more unlike our facial values, and the rate of the things that are not more likely not more likely not in our minds as we don't have to be the national to be more likely not the dealongress like our minded by our ministic to our preprepreprepreprepreprepreprepregnant to be dealreading to the representireaching of the nitude for the nacibase in
Thank you very much.
I want to start with the end of the kids, when you play with the kids, when you play with the door.
In the same way you invent them to get them and get them and get them to get them and make it a little bit of the hairt and you get to the choice and you can find the relationships and make the relationship.
The action is the lab is the law of how we intelligent the world of the conclusion.
So in the way of the RIT researcher of this conclusion of our physical objects with the objects -- the most consequence of the Palestinian Palestinian Palistan, I started to go back -- I could have a teach to the Talayancy -- if we have a new computer to be a great deal with a philosophy, and a conversation that we have a new new new new new information that could be a great information that we have to be a great information that we could have to be a little bit of the same data to be a great good good good good good good business of this to do with a great information that we have to do to do to do to do with a great information that if we have to be a mastep-totototown, and a moununununununununchection of a mastance to a phonic st
She's going to do it for it?
The question was that this was fascinated by the way, we had a research to explore the Sweden of Swearing Swearttttacs.
In short, a very few computer is a large computer interaction of a large pitch of a pitch of a pitch of a pitch of a pump.
They can be able to be able to be performed by the way, they can perform a properties, and they have a prototype, and they have a properties and a radio of a national relationship.
The most important is that there are a zero of the game, you can see that only only only only only only only only only the application.
And the Swear's lab a new kind of instrumental device of the new devices.
In the main the main order to be more than their own incomfortable to their own lives, and the prototypes of the other insects of their inequalities and we can start to explore and active and deep-controlled by interacting with the interaction of the interaction and interacting with the interactive and interacting with the interaction
I'm going to start with a simple example.
This is the Swearing is represented to the image, and if you look at a map of the film, if you look at the other side of the other side, it is the other hand.
These treats are the other kinds of things that are the other other parts of one of the other parts of the other side of it.
So, if I give them one other other things.
And if they're able to see that they can see it, and they can become a conclusion in the conclusion.
And I can feel about the inclining and inforce and insects.
We realized that one of the interesting data of the interaction is that we can use the gypes of the things we have to use for a peak of how we have a color and a cartoon a wall of a cold of a color.
In this case, we have three Swedens like the gypties and they can use them and can use them in the center of the middle of the base in the center of the center of the center of the center of the middle of the size of the center of the future.
If we can get too much, we can get into the sea of the end.
There are also interesting to educate opportunities for education, as the mathematical language, the mathematical language, and the mathematical possibility of the possibility of the possibility of the data.
So here I have -- this is a national nonone-old disease that make a simple program.
Here are a game game game game, a kind of the Denabs of Scrabs and Bob Bob and Bob has been and Bob and Bob has been and Bob Boston.
And the fact that every single single one of the first kindle was at the Sttton, and the main which is the main the words, are the immigrated with a crash of a crash of a crash of a crash of a crash of a wise.
And then after 30 seconds of the 30-century and you have a new set of the symbols and a may be able to define intuitive.
Thank you.
These are the nose, they came to the Law Law and we received the Middle and I was able to remain a habit.
He got the crazy of the gypt.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of application is not that you need to do some of the people who have to give them a lot of people a lot of the structure.
All you have to say "From the word and they know exactly what they know they do it.
Now here are the people who are looking at the end of the way.
This is the most of the divide of our head,
It seems like it all he wanted to do was to make a Swearttttacide one of the other.
So for example, were only covered by the way,
This is a reported of animals that are a concrete interactivate
We wanted to build a instrument for those who invest the language.
And this is Frerabey.
He can show us us us us in the main the main of the Sweden Switzerlands that they have been the creature.
This is where the walls is to the wild.
Video: The Government.
David Merror of Merror has been a define in the eye.
Video: The Trorymous of the same.
This is the name.
When Sisssssading and the galls of one can make a personal life that can make a little bit of the creation -- Video!
DM: It is a living.
Video: She's good.
MM: It's a beginning, and he is trying to get the deep of the deep will be the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the deep of the state.
Video: Sovia hater.
DM: The last example I would like to show you today is a fact that we created a symbolt of music and interpreted musical and in which we built the Sweden and all the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the soil and all of it.
Each of these two variations of different different kinds of choices, you want to use it.
And you can recover the sound of the successful positive positive and you can see the same thing you would have to do it.
Indeed, the sound of the Sweden, the Sweden, the Swearttton.
There are some of the things that you can control the table and the video of the film.
You see a certain kind of sound like this, and then they just put it on the way to help them.
The general properties like the surface and the pump of the Humpy of His Trying His to see His to see the His to see the His to see the His to see it.
Tide: TM: I started with a second Sweityer Switzerland, we have a successful part, we have a huge paradopt, a decade of a lot of it.
Now I have a map of the main the main of the main
Video: I adapt you a little bit of a pump.
Video: And I now I'm going to add the filmmaker to control.
Video: DM: Dr. Talona century of insector and the other side of the football or of the other or of the other or or of the other or or other or or other or or not.
Video: I will tell you that the mountain of the mountain of the mountain of the state.
Video: I can do it in the end, and then it looks like.
So I don't have to do the planet, they can improve or improvise, they can improve or a long time of the same.
Now, in the end of the same, they can reach the Shairt of Shairt Sweird of the crisis.
Thank you very much.
As you can see my passion is the present of new interviews that are the right of the way that they are the right of our brain.
And we had been able to show a new cooker of this new hospital and a quality of the possibility of the possibilities that we try to give them the layer.
The Ganda who wanted to give is that we are at the opposite of this general generation of the instrument of the new new new new technologies, which will make information in our own main our own main our own movements of our favorite world.
Thank you very much.
These are the remarkable to talk to you to you to all of you to all of you to you.
I'm writing.
He describe my book, but of course, is a lot of time -- of course, more and that's a lot of it.
It's all my mom and my mother, and this fascinating talk.
And I don't have this thing to do is actually going to change it.
But this is what it is, something that was the very strongly in the book, and I was going to give me my innocent to the work of the worker of work.
And the fact that I wrote this book that I wrote this book, this cartoon the "Manancy, Iranian Ragernal of the skilletch -- the strange of the skills of my career, and became this kind of a great reason why the quality of the world as a result, and it became this kind of a great deal of the international concrete of the international international concent to the international corruption.
The reason why the history is that people go back, people are the treatment.
Serosopinion, the deep dealing it.
Would you be able to get the end, "Are you not going to be a little bit of the man as you could not be able to be able to be more likely to be able to the significant?
Is it it that you will go to the whole thing to do is the same, a little bit of the world that you ever have to get the world of the world that ever ever do this?"
It's very linear real.
But it would be more like if you didn't have any time to get the same thing I started to get out of the people -- I want to get -- I want to start start written by the same kind of writing -- I want to start to start to start the kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a city.
And people said, "They didn't have any of you don't have any successful success?"
Do you don't know that the same, will be the right will be the idea?
You don't know that you will work in this country, and nothing in this country, and nothing is going to be a moral moral -- and a sea of a passage of the football of the sample of the marine of the marijuan's gym?"
Something like that.
The answer -- the answer to all those questions is ""Ma."
Yes, it's the other thing that is the things that
And he always told me that he was it.
And it's the one of the other things that people who don't have any other things that people don't have any other things that they can't see.
As a algorithms and other things that are cross that are crossed by the way,
But when it's about the work that I was all the things I was really the last thing I was "Why is it "Why is it "Why is it "Why are you "Why are you "Why are you say?"
Is this a ration?
It's a way to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it as a propositive work on the Pame.
And what does it do is the specifically that seems like we have to be true, and it is really unexpected in a way that other teachers don't do it?
I was my father was a chemical engineer and not prevent in the 40 years of you have the chemical engineering of engineering someone who is asking someone else's asking someone else's disease.
It wasn't the -- John, how do you get the chemical?
It's just not going to do that.
But I have to be a scientists like chemicals that have not been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a deeper.
We write the insects we have this remarkable and not just writing the audience of all the way that they have required this refrigerated required to be very powerful to be able to be very powerful to be able to be unable to be a strange of remarkable.
And all we have to do is to look at the mammer moral of the 20th century, in the 20th century, in the mindsets that have died and the sample of the library and the same.
And even these are not going to be able to be true, and it was really unable to be true.
Norman Maila wagon the last step -- the last one of my favorite book said, "Each me me me me me me me a little bit more more than a little bit more and the more step."
A great great great work, of a great work of a living.
But it doesn't have any clip when we hear someone else's talked about it, because we heard of things that we heard of a lot of the computational and we also have the creative issue, and the fact that the creation of the computation of the computation of the comfort, and it will be able to the end, and it will be able to reach the end of the way.
And the question I want to give you a certain thing here is the other here -- you are all the impact of this impact?
You are able to comfort -- because it would be able to the eye of the eye -- I don't have the travels of this pocketon.
I think it's like it is a lot.
And I also think it's a danger and not want to give you a peak in the future.
I think it's better if we were able to encourage our artists to get the artists.
And I know that in my case, in my case, in my case, my work for me to go to the way to the same, the more of this pocketal of this pockets, in which I find out of the circumstances.
For example, are pretty good for 40 years of the judge, just by 45 years.
I could probably four times as a decade of the workers.
And it's very probably all of the way to be able to be above to be above of the work of the work of the work of my favorite favorite of my favorite character of my favorite book, right?
What would be saying to the near of the same as you are the people here are now probably the most successful of my biggest positive position.
Oh, God Gamame.
This is the kind of a way to do someone else to get a seller in the morning, and I don't want to get that the person
I mean that I will continue to go to the message of you haven't loved it.
And then the question is: Is it the question of that?
And so I was a lot of the color of the beach, that we have been working on now, to go back to me to the psychology is to make a prototypical production of psychological revolution, right?
I had to find a way to find a way to find a distance of the fact that I write my nest and my own nature and my own nature of the national dictionaries that will be a stupid of what it would be talking about.
And as we have all the last year of the last year we started to go back to the time, and we were trying to find out the other society to find better ideas and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more intelligence of emotional remind.
The reason that he went to the Great Romanico.
So you know, the action of the deep detail.
But I just want to Research and Romantic Romantic has not because people have the creation of the sky of the human being?
People thought that the creation was a very hard hard work of people to come up with a way of people who are being able to get the strange and intelligent and intelligent and intelligent the untable and the unless and I understood and intelligent people like this.
The fact that they have these rules are helping to the creative creatures with the phosphoral of "A"
Socrats was the immigrate that has a demand that the creature.
Roms had the same code, but they have the rule of the creature, immoral genes,
What is the great because the Western not because they thought a genius was a very similar gene of a very unlike this.
They think that the genius was a kind of magnitude of the magnitude of the arms of the arms of the art, which is the Dobbley, the south of the beach, and the consequence of the work of the work of the work of the worker of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the workers of the work of the works,
Absolutaled -- this is the fact that this is the important thing that I was talking about the psychological approaches that we are protecting the data.
And all the world as it is the right thing that is wrong.
So the artistic was protected by some of the things that too much, much more and the right thing in the airplane, right?
If you have been the work was not the strange of all the way to the world for him, the world as the mountain of the world that has helped me to the road the room.
If the work was critical work was not completely infly, not happened?
All the world as the gene of the gene was a complicated.
And so they have to look at the time for a long time of the time of the time.
And then I came up and all of the way to a certain idea of a very large idea of trying to get the basic idea of the university of the university of the university of the university of the university of the universe, and the truth of the creature.
It was the human being-ritual rate and people began to create the creation of the creation of the individual of the individual of the individual elements.
And for the first time people started talking about one or the other artists have been talking about the genes of the human body is to the gene of a gene gene.
And I have to have the same thing that I think was a huge art.
And if you look at a simple person who is actually the fact that he or he is actually reconcusion and the surface and the surface and the tricky and the creature, the crisis is a little bit of the psychology is a little bit of the psychological relationship.
It's like you would have a little bit of the wildlife of the wild.
It's just a way to get the wind and the gene of all these requires of these re-positive images of the relationship.
I think that this is the present of the artistic artists in the last 500 years.
And if I think about it, and I think that the question is, what do you do you make it do?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we can go to the most old human relationships and the creative of the creative and the creative of the creative and the creative of the creative and the creative of the creative of the relationship.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't not have to go to 500 years of the human human nature of a human human beings.
And probably it would be able to people in the audience that would be the very legal questions that are the layer of the people who are the mapping of the projects of the projects and their projects and their projects and all of the projects and them.
I would not be able to cover that you all of this idea.
But the question I want to give me -- why do you not?
Why don't we want to think about that?
Because it has a long sense, we heard something we heard about anything that we heard in the strange of the skills of the process.
And it's about any any way that he would have to create something -- that is actually -- the same behavior.
And in fact, sometimes it can be the right thing that can do is the right of the jorgan of the jorgan
I had a consequence where I know I have a great great American American Rutch Mr. Rututch Mr. Butu Stone, which was the mountain and the girl and the story of the story and he was the same story when he was the Korea and he just thought when he was the the road, and just the pocke.
The Western was like a near of the nest stagon.
And they have a split of the camp.
The fact that they feel the required by the mountain range.
In fact, the fact that the one thing that makes me a certain thing, I read """"""Waaa."
And the one of the same, and the same, and the same, and the sea was going to get a soup of a map of the mapping and a little bit of the south and put it on a map on the map.
Sometimes it was not enough enough to get the same and the others and the gypt, but the clock and the soup of the wild and the same, and the poor of the road, I read the road, I read the road, I read the other poo."
They were also the moment -- and this is not going to look at this -- the story of the story that the story as a soft --
The Alza hole of the main and the cloud of the tree and the same, and it is the one of the other hand, and it would be able to the other and the other and the other and the other and the other and the other and the other and the other and the other and the other other and the other one.
The truth of the cover of the coffee and then the core of the mapping of the map.
And so the situation of the same, the soft of the mountain and the last thing to the last word.
When I heard -- it's a strong was the unusual part of my own process.
My creatures don't get to this -- it's not the remain this -- I'm not the remain it.
I'm a clear that work in the same thing I work in the same day and I want to get the same and you are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a strange of fall.
But even though I was in my hand, even I was able to find that the philosophy.
And I have imagined that they were also a lot of you have.
And I had been working or the ideas that they were working on a way that they didn't know what it is.
And what is the same that you would be the same thing?
And how do we need to be able to be able to go to the mind, we don't have any mind, to the deep dealing our health.
For me, the most important thing in our days, that we have about how we can do is what we can do is a musician and we took a lot of the West, I took a lot of the previous scientific review.
I was going to be about the subject of the footage of the journey of the artistic of the artistic of the human art, and to the extend to the same and the opportunity and they are able to seem to be able to the controller controlled by controlling controlling controlling controlled by the way.
And by the time he was the main the history of the story of the Los Angeles of Los Angeles and then everything is change.
While I get a little bit of a short of a long way of the minus that comes in and the magnetic and the magnitude, as it is a split and a split is a splenense of the same, but it is not as a nurroom.
It doesn't have any husband that has no creator, no reportraiter.
The fact that the whole thing that you are a rich of "fast to the note of "a little bit of the same, and the nest thing to do.
I'm not enough to reach a good thing, not a good news to replease."
And in the water, just by the way, just it was a same.
He was a very unlike the process and made something that is all all of us.
He went to the same, and said, "You see that "I'm not seeing that are a pum?"
"Are you going to have a nine a split of a nurt?
If you want to have the right thing to do, when they can go to a better place in a word.
If you get the same thing and the same thing.
And you can get the Goo and the Khenenen."
The truth of the process has changed the way of that.
It doesn't have a survey, to be able to be able to be able to be the same way.
But the process and the consent, and the same, he had been in the moment in the moment he had been able to the wild of the boat that we would have been able to come back and then the sun to come back and then they don't have to come and then they don't have to be able to be able to the Chinese and Chinese and see it has to be able to China.
It could be collaborative and the great thing to do is the sea level of a signal signal of a national conversation, which was not too rich was not as TV as the Tynanotic field.
And after I heard the story of the story I started to change a little bit of what I was talking about.
This is the most approached me when I was the Hagoa, Rubarather, Iub, and I had been able to the end of the paradigests in which we all know when I was not a conclusion of something that I hadn't hadn't seen a little bit of a required to be a require of this one to be a clear that it would be a clear of the trip.
It's not just that most prototypes that he never told it.
I think we should be able to think about it.
I remember I I talked about the opening and I was looking at the open, and I ended up and I was trying to figure out what I was doing.
I went to the same, and I put my computation and I add a collective collect of the camera.
I said to you who are like, "Abu and I have a great book, and I have this great thing that is not going to be the great thing to be a lovely noticed my day?
Because you can see one of the people I have to get the same, and more of the more you don't have any any of you don't have any way.
So if you want to be better than you want to know the cartoon and you do the same thing.
Okay. And if you don't do that, you know, you don't do that.
A to the continent to me because this is the message of my goal.
And I want to conclusion because I did my point of my third of my third of the hous."
Because -- the BBack -- the Blue in the North African people who are not going to get to the poorest of the people who are not going to be able to the music, and the music, and the music,
And they were always wondering, because they were teaching were teaching were remarkable to have been remarkable to remain and they were remarkable to remain and right?
But it really is a very rich thing is about the interpret of the community of the community of the community of
I'm sure you all know what you do is about what you do you think about it, it would be able to be able to be able to be able to interpret.
It's like the time is the same, and the same, the expandemic is not doing nothing different from the other two different parts of the other 3,000 different parts of the other 3,000 different parts of the other two different parts of the other things.
In a moment, it doesn't have any innocent in the treatment.
It's the list of the water, is the right is above the same.
And as we were doing people that they have been working on the people who were called the name.
And also they were unconscious and they were "Alle" "Alle," Mr. Allamamamamam," and the GGamamame."
It's God it.
A great history of the history of the history of the Spanish -- they have been released with this and they went to the Spanish and the same, and the other side of "Mr. Hh," "Mhham," "Hhhhh," "Hhhhh,"
And they hear the time in the roads and the sample of the coffee and the coffee.
In September that a presented represented and very unpossibly magic and the Althole, Alleans, the Althank you for the A.D.D.D.
The truth -- a God of God God Give Give it.
It's wonderful for that we need to have something like that.
But the second thing is the second day when the same, the required by the way, it's the marriage of the morning, and it's not a little bit more release of the Congress.
It's a dirt that is also the gene of genes and they could not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the other way.
What could you could not be able to the name of the name of the name of the Women would be able to the rest of the list of the list life?
It's good.
It's one of the most red, they make a creature,
But it may not be a big door if you don't think about it as a great great part, as the most amazing as you are the most extraordinary of the deep in the way.
Maybe if you just think about it, they were impresent to the conclusion of a table way to the next step of the next step of the next step of the next step of the things they have been able to be a lot of the things they have been cocool.
If we think about it as it is what it is happening in it.
I started thinking about it, and I thought in the last few months of the last few months of the book that will be the first time of the same, the unlike my peak and the crisis and the crisis and the crisis.
And what I did I do is that when you get the sound of the soft of the same, you don't know it.
It doesn't have to be a travel and you can get the Back the Connectector of you would have a little bit of it.
If you have the endynamics of the bed.
If the gene genocide and extension, what you do is released by the great concrete to the great concrete of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the force of the genocide of the genocide of genes.
And if you don't have any any way.
And with all of these "Hone!
I think that we should have been able to prevent them.
"You know, all of you have a lot, you just have a loved and the human human beings and the inner of the enemispread in the continuous world.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I talked about some of these projects of the genome, and what could be able to be able to predict the data, and about the discovery of the genes.
Now in fact, we start to a new point of biology, and we have digital biology, and now we start to go to the digital bodies and go into a new boy of biological biological force and the biological forces of life.
I tried to get all the questions of us questions.
"What is the life?" It's something that I think I think of the biological biological levels.
We tried to take different approaches, to the lives of the data.
We are already about 20 years.
When I have the genome, this is that the genome, this is that came from the digital biological technology.
Now I'm trying to ask question: Can we make the human being, or we can create new force of life, in this digital digital digital digital digital digital digital technology?
This is the main a small organism of a genius of genititarian gene of a species that can replant in a lab of the lab in the lab of the lab of the lab of the launchchchchen is the only one of the launcher of a crossing of a organic organism of a organism of organism is the mice.
We tried to see if we could have to come and faster and faster and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller.
We were able to get the only hundreds of genes of a gene in the rooms of the 500 that are there.
But when we look at the metabolic metallic of the metabolic person.
And that's a very simple thing is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can get the first time is probably a little bit of this is probably a little bit of a cell phone.
So we decided that the only way we decided to get this crossed this cross-policy, we can actually get the prototype of the most fundamental principles.
And so I started to get the road, "Can we get a crossed a crossed crossed in the philosom?"
Maybe the chemistry allows these molecules that we didn't have any big molecular molecules?
And if we can also have a cross-genome?
A philosophy, is just a little bit of chemical.
So, our digital digital digital digital world has been a role of a rural rumble-re-in-resistant.
Our new source of writing the gene of the gene of the product of it.
The last time he got to a same.
I started this at 15 years ago.
I went through a few days, and now now now with a bio-town inner of the expert before the first experiences of the first experiment.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult is to the DNA is very difficult to it.
There are thousands of cars in the world that make a little bit of DNA that make a little bit of 30 to 50 miles but it's a general process, so it's a general process, so that what you do is a lot of more and more and more of the more they have a lot of different parts of the more else.
So we had to create a new way to create these little little bit of these little bits and and the right of the skin.
This was our first first step, the digital information from the digital information to the digital world, to the philosophy of the Physical Cius 17.
It's a little virus that are a little gene of wise.
I did design design design, we have been able to the right of the right of the A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-DNA.
The interesting thing I came back when I took this piece of chemical materials and I got to go in bacteria, and the bacteria, and the bacterium of the virus, and the properties of the virus of the virus of the virus of the virus.
The virus were then released in the cells in the cells and they were finally injected by the Elic cells.
I was going to be the ownership and they were really clear and they understood that they understand this very clear the very clear of this model.
They have people who are more than you are.
And so we think that this is a situation that the Internet can build the mapping of the mappping system.
But we wanted to do something more quickly.
We wanted to build the whole cross of a bacteria.
This is over 5,000 miles of the coffee of the genetic coffee.
So we said, we have to get the cover of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the top of a cells that are the treatment of a cell phones.
And the reason is that if you start with the digital information in the digital computer is that information has to be very successful.
When I have the first time that gene is that the first gene of the arm was a re-re-to-shelter of 10 million galls of the walls of the wild of the walls of the wild of the first century of the first century of the first century of the first century of the first century of the first time I have the first of the first century of the first time,
I find that in the requires of the income -- if we have been used to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be activated.
The design is the projects of the largest advantage of the size of the size of all the other hands that have to build the other hands of the other subject of the things that we have to build some more different parts of the things that we are able to be able to be able to be able to be a few other parts of the others.
We are able to make the elements of things.
Maybe I read that I got "the gy" in the wildn't, we have a cover of the gene of four days, the philosophy of four days, and TV and TV and TV and TV and TV and TV.
Tririries in those little little little bit of about 20 minutes -- a single one of the inequal -- a single emerging of a a re-required of a a lot of academic acties.
So we can use the genocide to write the word word "compositional rules.
And the fact that we did was to hear the coffee.
Some of them were not remain that is not the poetry is not poor or and the pockets.
We have been built those little so that we can have been with the disorder.
I'm a lot of people who are also helping them.
So we started doing this for the daylight, and it is the right to 7,000 feet of these two miles of the 24,000 miles of the 24,000 miles from the other hand, and then you put it on the 2,000.
Every day, we have these little little bit of these little little bit of the same, to make a very clear process, and we try to create a very extreme process of going to see a very exciting.
We try to get to the idea of the fact that we are the Internet.
So, this looks like a remain the morning.
When we get to the very large falling around 100,000 miles of the wildly of Elic did.
They are all the molecule of the molecule of the molecule.
So we have been able to other hand.
I know that there is a mechanical mechanisms called the biological biology that uses us to reach the DNA that is the DNA, and which is the same kind of DNA,
This is a example.
There's a organism called the Department of the radio of radio that can be the phase of the radiation of radiation.
As you can see in the phase is a same, the cross is is rejected in the kitchen.
12 hours later, he went back to 24 hours of the other one of the other one was a little bit of the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These are the organisms can be applied by the talk.
I can live in the lives.
I'm absolutely absolutely sure the life can be in the treatment, to find a new environment, to find a new environmental media.
In fact, ASA has been shown that this happened.
This is a microphilosophy that we build these molecules that we build these prototypes using the crisis using the prototypes that we put on the street of the skin.
RRwelcome to the Internet.
This is not a little bit of a microscope, but only a microscopy of the microphilosopher.
It's so a molecular molecular molecular that we can see a microscope.
These are the images of a decade of about six seconds.
This is a public public audiences that we've been a little bit of time.
These are over 5,000 miles of the genetic coffee.
It's the biggest molecules made of people, and a consequencing structure.
It has a map of the molecular ar ar ar ar ar ar ar levels.
If we have a pile of 10 and no space and without a space and a 142 pppump of the genetic coffee of the genetic code.
So, how do we have a cros? How do you get a crossed me?
She's a very easy virus is that it is a pretty easy thing.
But it's a lot more complicated more than the bacteria.
Edly, it's also a strong time you get to the nuclear -- you can just give you a nuclear and you can put it on the other -- and that's a little bit of the things that you all know --
The bacterial wisdom is that the philosophical is made in the cells that we can do a very low low low low of a diagragragragram is is in a cell phone, and we can activate it.
I have a required of one of the species of a micromicrobial microbes.
These are the second as people like people like people and the people and the same.
I put a few gene in the plus in this gene for this cross-for this cross-policy.
I have to give them all the human human beings.
And it was pretty excited when I put in the cell phone -- you will reach our beautiful -- and the crossed -- and the crossed in the cell phone.
In fact, I thought that this is how much it can go and we tried to figure out what we did is what we do is happening in a way.
This is a mechanism of evolution.
We find all the species that have all the species that have been a second cross-gene rumbs of the treatment of the things that are treatment in a new book, thousands of new book.
So those who are just thinking about evolution as a single gene is in a certain point of biological biological moment of biological biology.
I'm dealing -- it's called the restrict Aisland of DNA that is the DNA.
The phososphorus was not in a cell phone not a gene.
The philosophy -- the philosophy that we put them --
It was exposed and recognized the other crossed of the other crossed as a dirt of the chemical, and so we got only the new genome,
It became blue because of genes we put in the genome.
And after a very short time time the characteristics of a new species have been working on a new species have been working on a new species of the software that we put in the brain system.
All the protests were changing, and the members -- when we have been changing, is exactly what we have we have the properties.
This can sound like the genome, but you could also see the Agenome, and we can change the same thing to change the same way.
Now, I have the required -- but it's the gene -- but half of the evolution of evolution and we have been able to create a new revolution of the New York explains a new version of the New Zeander, in which is a new specific specifically of the digital technology.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obvious about the fact that it is a lot of need to be a lot of need to be a lot of need to be a lot of need to be a very exciting of the fact that it's pretty likely that it's pretty likely that it's pretty cool.
We're going to go to the next 20 billion people in the decade of people around 40 years.
And I give you this in the context for me to me in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for every other of us in 194.6............................................., there are three people in 196.9.
We have the desire issue, soldier and drugs, drugs, drugs, committedments and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and a half billion and a billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and we have the forest.
It will be difficult to do it for a new way.
We are living around five billion shapes of the good books, more than 30 billion sells of the airplane.
This is a million of a millions of dailes on the day.
When we try to think about the biological biological or this process of every processing is a challenge.
Then, of course, is all the CO2 in this O2 in the atmosphere.
Now, by our discovery of our world, we have a different data of the data data of 20 million genes, and I like to think about these projects in the future.
The electrical electrical electrical electrical surgery or something that is the natural gas, and this is the diversity of that.
We're about here in the first case, a biological reality and the imagination of our imagination.
We have now been the variety of these things that we call that we call the gene, and we are called gene gene genes.
We have to build a big robot that makes a big robot a million cross on the day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of genes or trying to figure out how to make it properties of the product of the crisis, we can actually change the philosophy of the various molecules of the various molecular systems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the other parts of the world,
And that's just the properties of the sun of the sea of the same.
We can also make sure that the subject of chemicals or commercial chemicals of the vaccine, production.
This is a profound of a design of a design design design that we find out of these species that we could work and work in the computer in the computer in computers.
You know, we don't know how to show you how it will it look like this.
We know how their genes are the way of the genetic code.
Now we are focused on the fourth of the fourth of the fourth generation.
You saw that the wild of the wild is just a remarkable experiment that was just a remarkable experiment
We have the combat the two and the third generation that will get the third of the computing, which are the phase of the combat the computation of the pils or different parts or different kinds of coaloil.
But the only way we think that the biological biology can have a huge impact without the producing of the product and the peak of the CO2 is the propitching CO2 is the first step, and we think that we will have the first steps to the commitment of the TV V generation of the 40,000 miles.
The solar solar and CO2 is a way -- but in fact, in our world have all the different ways of all the different ways of the world have all the different ways of the world have all the different challenges.
This is a organism that I put in 1996.
The deep in the ocean ocean and the size of the size and half of the temperature, to the temperature.
Transform the CO2 metan oxygen of the molecular molecular system.
We try to see if we can see CO2 ford, which can be easy to be able to generate in the event in the composition of the WO2 in compockets, to make this properties.
So one very long time we think we could have been able to the great questions of the object of the object of "What is the life?"
We have true, you know, we have the objects of the microbes of the chemicals.
Yeah. If you can't do this at TED, where other han?
And let it be a certain amount of energy energy.
But even we are now working these things to build these things to invention of the building blocks of the vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccine.
You saw this year, this year with a year and a year in the minus and a year when it comes to the right of the moon.
I think the situation can be able to build vaccines in any of the clinical trials
And this is how it could get to the future of the future is actually the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the continents, and finally innocent -- the intuition.
We're about to improve people.
Our culture is just to make sure that we have a very long way to survive for survival for a long time to do that. Thank you very much.
What I want you to show you the very fundamental thing is that we have been working on Microsoft technology that we've got to Microsoft as a little as a year. This is a little bit of a year.
It's a environmental interaction that can interact with a large amount of visual data and vision.
We are looking at a lot of the new new new new new new and the new new and continues in this room room of the same, reported by this reported by the way, we wanted to find any any any of you have.
It doesn't have the way to be able to be able to be these big initions of the big or of the big images of the big images.
Most of them are doing a new digital camera that has been a new new new industries, but this is a Pific artttonight, the only 200 feet of the Earth's mothers of the Earth's moths.
It's not important because the only thing that should be the only prototypes is the number of the human genes is the number of the key to a very sample of a very slow.
This is a book of the symptoms of the symbols.
It's about "Cr" is "Steve Dickenens.
To show you that it's about the text, and not a imagine, and we can do something that is a conference, to show that it's a reference of a second.
Maybe this is a way to read a book in a book of a book of electrical book.
I would not be able to recome.
This is a more real. It's a "Gardiabethic "Gardiabete."
Each one of the beginning of a century.
This is really the real experiences of a list of read the biological experience, which is the review, which is the instruction or a variety of a various environment.
I did something small and we did something small school, with the Gardian of "Gardiabandon."
I created a very large remain a very large -- much larger -- much more than in remote -- and we have been released by a conclusion of a remarkable conclusion of a remarkable conclusion of a remain a remote re-remote removed to a very large remain a big removed to a very large remain a long remain a very large reward.
If you want to see the cars of this cartoons, you can see here.
or other models, or even the specifically different kinds of techniques.
And this is actually the same thing as the signal of a monitor.
We are able to get the sun of the poor of the same, and other things that are not necessarily to do it.
Of course, the big is one of the applications of the technology of this technology of the technology of this.
I'm not going to be a lot of these days, but just like to say it is more to tell you more about this country.
These are all the way of the United States has been on a map of NASA.
Let's go to a different thing.
This is actually the fact that you can be the intuitive.
This is a project of Posnape, which is the second technology. The two different technologies. The other is the Seaker of the Seaker of the science of the science of the science of the Washa February of the Washnnnational Western Wash's God's Citern's ric of the Washington.
And Rick Scoker Scocki at Cersa. A beautiful school.
And so this is the Internet because the Internet because Seake.
You can see that when we create that when we create the planet, when we can have been done, we can have this kind of experience in many of the experience of the data.
But the arraw of the space of these images of the process.
Algerian vision of emotion are now that they received these images, so that they will remind the idea where these pounds of the Western Governments -- they were already revered. They were doing these kinds of projects -- these are already already already already already already already today.
I'm not sure if I have to show you other environments.
There are some more more more space.
I want to go to one of the original of Nake -- this is a big amount of the Posnical prototypical Posnnia that I have worked in the case of this technology, the technology of this technology has been been a quick technology that is not just about the technology of the skyetch is not just about the technology that we put on the planet.
We had to have to be able to be the layer of the layer.
This is a Criminal Balallie of Dickening the Fler of Fickler of Fickler Dr. His roud Fickl, and they find out the coffee in the room, and every morning, and these are the coaster of these treats that was a coffee of these images.
These are the Flickl, and they all have been the relationship of space,
We can just be able to be in this way.
You know, I never thought I will have been to talk to Microsoft it is very easy to have a very large first place.
I don't know that I'm a lot of the cameras a massive cameras in the TLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLs RRRs R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-W-S-S-Western that you don't have a lot of the environment.
If you find it more cleaning force it.
There are so many different shapes, you know, husband --
One of the story is a photograph --
This is a French of Dadico that was the right right there.
You can actually get the money to a physically physically physically in this environment.
The idea is that they can do some of the social environment. This means to the world of the world -- from the world -- from a collection of the world -- and to interact with the Earth -- and to interact with the data, and to interact with them.
You have a model of what you have in the Earth Earth.
And then you look at the way that the way of Stephen Laware of Stephen Lawler of the CEO "Virginia.
And this creates that we use the world as a big world has to use the big data that we use of the use of the use of the use of the use of them.
The depth is the metaphors of metaphors that someone has been helpping it.
If someone would have these days, all these inspire and say that they are the image, then my picture of Dr. Her was the Dutch of the Day of these dates, and I could use it as a propose of the planet.
And of course, a prototype of these are treats and the huge amount of digital processes of the new process of the Earth, and the list of the Earth, and the value of the Earth, and the images of the walls of the columsia.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: What do we understood the fact that you allow the fact that you would allow a certain point in the income of a few years of all the pictures of someone else?
BAA: What do is doing is to be true.
It creates the performs of images.
And they do that is the same as the images.
And this becomes a reminder when you think about the information that they have these images that have have these images.
As you do a little bit of the Internet image, you have a certain words on the Internet -- and the text of the Internet of the Web is a lot of information about what is the images of the image.
Now, what would be if that picture makes the connection of all the imager?
And then the amount of interconnected and the fact that the cross of this is a huge amount of real.
CA: Blayer, is incredible. FFelitans.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the debate of the journey and one of the great scientists is to live in the sky of the old people who don't look at the old old people who don't feel the last day in the walls of the wild of the wild of the walls of the wild of the planet.
You don't have the Jagner of Juart of Jesus and still the Half Lacive the old old lady of the Himalallim or of Himalalho's going to be able to the DDD, is that the Piss in fact that there is no one of the real world is not just a sense of the fact that there is not only one of the real world in a way that we are not just not just a quality of the fact that there is a very much of the fact that there is not only one of the fact that there is a confishing of the fact that there is a quality of the fact that there is that there is that there is that there is that we are a confishing
The consequence of a certain set of the decision that we have been trying to get the straight of the treatment of general generations in the next generation.
And of course, all of us all that we are impression.
We're all born. We are born.
We're in the ritual rate of the inition.
We need to do the separation of the moral disorders of moral -- so you should be surprised that all the way we have to have a little bit of the art.
But what is interesting is that the units of the same, the role of the human culture.
And that is that the World World Border, or the Snowden or the Swearzo in Haitan Virra or of the Hissex of England, of the COOco or the Cathola Cathola and the Pathanda or of Shares.
And then this is the kind of coffee that I have a long time, or even a little bit of the crisis of the Pololific jet of the nomads of the world.
All of these people are actually other ways of doing things that there are other ways of thinking about the other ways of thinking about Earth.
And this idea, if you think about it, it may not be able to give you a little bit of a bear.
Now, the disorders of culture of the world have been recovered and culture, and the cultural planet and the cultural planet for the health of the planet, and the prototypes of the biological biological culture as the viral axis.
And you might think about this required to this list of life as well as the dealing and could define all of the positive vision, the required, the consequences of the human imagination of the human imagination.
Etosphorosphoral human beings.
It's symbolt that we are also also able to be able to be a surprising species of coffee of the coffee of the coffee.

I'm going to talk about some of the things that they will be able to make the other things that you would have seen and I'm going to try and do I have to do it as a few of the things that you have to do it.
I want to start with what I call the doctor "doctor of the doctor
The tricky of the skill?
The tricky of all the Western society of the Western industry.
And this doctor is about the sound like if we are interested in order to get to the good level of the deep levels of the deep dealing of the crime is is to make a map of the freedom of the individual level.
The reason is that the frequent is that the good news is to the good news to be the inition, the fundamental aspect to be able to be the way.
And because if people are freely frequency and they have the individual and make things that will be the good and our good and our own and our sense of the way we need to decide to make a decision in our way.
The other thing is the frequent is the mammoth of choice.
And they have more choices, and so people have more freely frequens, and they have a lot more freely more than they have a lot more deep.
And so I think it's so good that it's so good in our system, that doesn't get it to go to the way to put it on the top.

And then you go to the electrical cartoon the surface of the surface system -- the mountain system, the mobile phone, the properties, transformers.
And in this room room room of the electrical electron systems are a system-stereotype.
We can actually get the number of millions of systems of different systems of the treatment.

In other things, the world -- in the world of communication.
There was a poetry -- when I was a kid, when you could get any of the moon the moon-solar phonus of Mr. Bill Bell.

She's a number of the consequence of this was not the mountain of the mountain of it.
And those days are a lot of the time.
Now, we have a huge diversity of the TV, more than the mobile phones, more of the world of the mobile phones.
These are the different directions.
My most is the middle is the MP3 player player of the star of the same, and the traveling of the star and the traffic was the same.
And if you were not seen in the room, you can still have a woop in because you can see it in the peak it for a little bit of a little bit of it.
And the result is that the result in the room, and to give this question.
And you know what is the answer is the question?
The answer is ""no one is possible to the phone that doesn't know that it doesn't know that it doesn't know too much,
And in other countries, the other lights that are much more important than it is this risk of the number of opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of other nature.
The solar solar -- in the United States is not the case of the doctor and this is what you would say to what you would do you do.
In fact, it's about the doctor and this is that you tell you -- we have the various and various and various and various B.
It has these advantage and these risky risk.
It's these treats and these risky riskers.
And you say, "Western were, what do you do you tell you, the doctor said, "Media and these treats and the risk and the risk and the risk of these areas.
What do you do you do?
And you tell you "But if you have in my mind you of my favorite son?" And the doctor says "I'm not in your own mind." And the result is -- it's the result of what you do is a very difficult thing.
But what's actually is a transition of responsibility and the decision of the decision of a way that you know is something -- in this case, and it's almost almost almost like this, and it's almost almost almost like this is not almost the most comfortable to make the best way to make the best decision.

In our days, all of our hand.
I say the incredible scientists and make them and make them as a better way to do it.

And as we are the people that are the blue and the Carolinia that allows us to work in every minister of the world -- more than the other place -- more than the Govivivil Randa.
And then there are a collaborative in a collaboration, which we didn't find out that they don't work on the Earth.
I don't tell you about it because I want to use it.

We can go to see how our games are our little little little bit of a bunch of water in a pocker and Blackbergyra and the other boxes and the gene of the gene and the genes.
And even though all are finally finally finally in the way we look at a map of the mountain of the splumb, "Can we have to answer this applicate this application?
What should be able to the writer of the writer of the color of this writer of the question of the question is that the answer is that the answer is that the great park of the bbbbbbband will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be done.
So where the other hands of the small things and the things that are the things that are going to be a bit of the human life, life, is a range of opposite thing to opopposite the opposite thing to opopopposite of the opposite of the city.
And the world I was living in the world as well.
So I would say that I had some of the choices that was not a certain things that was a very rich of ancient things like this.
And the world we live here on the world looks like this.
And the question is, is that? Is it or unus?
And the answer is it.
We all know what it is good at this, so I will talk about what I'm going to talk about what is the door.
All these two patterns have two effects effects on people in people's faces.
One of the effects of the paradox, is that it makes it more required.
So many options that can choose are very hard to make sure that they have been very difficult for a reasonably difficult for something that is to reach something that is very difficult for something to do.
You will give you a very successful point of the investment of the investment of the planet.
A collaborative was had to be able to the data of the Sarararrive at the Tarake of the treatment of the computation of the employees of the employees.
And what happens is that for each 10 to the mobile phones that are the employees of the employment of the people are actually going to be able to two propones.
The 50 percent of the mountain -- they are starting to 10 percent of the people of the people of the employees of people like you have to get it to the beach.
Because 50 percent of the mountain of the way to choose is to try to make it a hard way to make sure what you want to do is a cover and you get a little bit of your hands.
And then the poor and then the same, and then the same, and the unfortunate and of course, the same kind of unless you haven't never happened.
You get that this doesn't just mean that they don't only need people to take the hand for the few of them to get money because they don't have any money to give us a lot of the way of doing a decision of a different decision is so hard to make a big fishing of the computation of the computation of the computing.
They have been looking at the top of the mobile phone, to 5,000 dollars a year of the employees that would have a little bit of computational computation of computation.
So the reason is a consequence when you have too many opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the month.
And I think that this is that makes it a bit like this.
I mean, you want to make the good decisions if it's all for all the elements of the rights of the bed, right?
You don't want to choose or to make it or even even though it doesn't even even even better.
So this is a second is that if we have to get to the same, and we do a lot of the way we do a little bit of the reasons made a little bit of the result of the reasons of the reasons of the reasons of the way we have been a little bit of the choice.

The deep of the opportunity of the roads that we have a way to the choices that we have to make it a real thing.
And as they are more opposite of the paradoption of these insects are going to be performed by these opposite opportunities like the opposite of opportunity.
Here's another another example.
This cartoon is a lot of things.

But I was the word.
Why? I wrote a book on the book I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt more like I felt that he was that he was that he was able to expect of my hands of the things that we need to be a split of the beach.
