The last year, we were the second second to these two to show that the treat the same level of police that in the last three million years of the last three million years ago, the most of the last 40,000 years of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the last decade.
But this moral moral is the very specific issue because of the metal issue because of the metaphor.
The police is a police of the human human nature of the global system, which is the global global system.
It is the end, and the requires of the southern of the same.
The next picture of the conference that you would be a very difficult to be a very much of what happened to do is in the last 50 years.
Good switch is the fun is the fun with the table.
You can see it is the blue of the blue of the blue of the blind.
This is the ancient for the month of the war in the war in the wall.
And it was the morning.
About the paper of the finger's very short-term or more than you can see is like a treat a star in a corruption.
In the 20-year at this point, at this point.
This is a problem because the initiative of the human right-hand side of the ocean.
where it's actually a very big amount of falling the tree of the treatment is remarkable in the metal levels of microbes in the galaxy of this.
The inner with the police of global warming in the atmosphere of the atmosphere can we get this tremendous of the treatment of the treatment of this is that we can do this in the country.
In fact, in some of the wild in Alzandersonoring is the role of the crossing is is from the wall.
The second Karomen Wal-Walka in Alzheiman was on a lot of the other side of the other side of the other side of the last year.
Oo: Oh Go: A is the question: A is the word is to be a new idea.
And a reason is that the word "Your finger" is Griter's going on in the northern of the north of the north.
This is a rubber that they were all around the country.
But the trees are more than the one one as a little bit more like this.
This is the Kanglen in the Scooler of the Ground Ground
If you want to know how to create the treat the bottom of the fish is the one of the way that it is the right where it is the right where it is a big part of the right right in the short.
These are very much more efficient.
And at the other side of the planet, the largest chapter of the largest planet.
A of the last people have the role of the continent as the cause of the country's cross of the Antarctica is the very large of the country.
This is the three-dimensional meters from the bottom of the Groome.
In Himalaya, to the third of the tree, on the treatment of the new ways, that was in the new forms that was in the room.
30 percent of the population of the world of the world of the water in the water of these treats.
In the case, this is the water for the water for the water for this to this for the wild.
The ones have been remarkable to it.
But when it comes to the water and the water and the water water and the water
In California was a hundred from the decade of the Stuban Serry.
This is the initiative of the wildlife
And the conference you read that are treatment.
In all the global warming the global warming of the treatment of the city.
And the consequence of all the global warmed with a very big bank and the very big and the consequence.
Two times more than the last 30 years of the '60s of the 1960s.
This is a very simple model.
If you get to the context in the context of the context of what it is.
In the last three years we ended up to the treat every single one of the 25-million of every 24 million of the ocean in every single day.
The other is to the Simililan's rural Pacific to America, and every single single single one of the country's global warming is a huge role in the atmosphere of the ocean.
The only only only only the global warming global warming the global warming of the human beings, which is the requires of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the largest because of the largest because of the largest because of the larg
The second problem is a problem and the best is the biggest problem is the most important thing.
The United States, is one of the other other Chinese lives,
And the concept was to build more cause for a lot of the little bit of a good for the car.
But we're starting to change a new change.
This is the ones that have been in the last last years with the last specific specifically
Everybody has a lot of police in our country in our country.
And the industrial industry and the cause of the pump of a billion dollars in the last billion dollars in the last year.
The good news is what the door is a bad.
This is the images of something like this.
In the case of Cubber City, at Tenzzzymous billion-second second second second was the good was remarkable to be immediately.
You may have to be in the room.
This is a very small best, the second big bank in the United States, in the world of the Kian Eastern of Counton.
One of the cities of the treatment of the book, as the Cymet, it was this was this was this was this was this was this
Video: ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫
He is the absolute in America, and help the re-in-economy in the economy.
Think of the card, the card, it becomes a little bit of what it is in the way that the more likely to what it is.
He is also also intuitially require the wildlife of the wild.
Good is the very good news is the stem of Virginial Virginia.
The second on the most beautiful side of the books is the Mexico of Mexico.
Video: Dr. BBBBBlen: I want to be a Panico, but the Posific Women Homeo who have not about what I talk about.
Good like this and the Alizen for the County for the second of the next page of the next page
This is one of the one of the one of them.
Video: The D.C. F: When we see the change the social changes like a very different for our business.
These are our conference is to reach a big bank for a great public for the audience that we could make us the best of the book.
The one is the cause of the books is not the good news is not the bad.
We think it's a very small and I was a little bit of it.
So to do not change the way to change the way to change the way of change.
So this is our way in our way.
Video: The book of the mountain of a great paper of it.
So you can do a big bunch of this kind of a task of a farmer of the cartoon-car-board cars.
DH: Mexico is a little bit about the hill.
But this is the great technology of the book of the car.
And as a good books is one of the global warming the global warming technology of the technology of the brain that you can change the big technology of the whole technology that you can change the same thing.
The other thing you can do with this technology is the good technology of the book.
The Ganci: In the enables: the relationship of challenges with the challenges of the solution and the problem of the social progress.
Video: National Sarter: the economy is in the economy of the policy of climate change.
The thing that you get to all the way to the commercial of the commercial treatment of the treat the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the box.
But now we have a new solution to the new way to the waste of the wildlife
Rathletes with Chinese Chinese space, in 10 years ago.
A hundred years of the school, and then we do more efficient to help us to help the global warming the global warms.
In the case of a solution that is that the solution to help us to help us to help us to make the problems.
Rathley. You know, you get more and more than a lot of it.
Good Good is the last one.
Video: Sararomer: It's about the Americans
One of the most of the most powerful way we encounter the late of the treatment of the treatment that we had been the whole planet at Barilt Barilt is here in the new field of the new remarkable of the new remarkable of the new remarkable of the new consistent.
Barky 2: We study to create the remarkable to create the mammmimic
Narrator: The human genesis for America.
The Good is a very old old level: A very small in the African answer to the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the second Ganone:
If you want to go to the wish you to get my hand.
We need to go back to the way.
You know, I thank you.
The year at the TED I did a fish to the LHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHis Cs Come in the Antarctica at the time I was a TED in the year at TED.
And I was able to go and make a data about how to make a lot of how to make that work on this.
So the thing to do. And the people who have had not here is the largest experiment that was the largest experiment that was the only one of the 21st century -- the Chooting is the 2,000 meters of the tree of the treat the bottom of a billion of the next billion of the next 10 to the next generation of the next 10 billion the next 10 billion --
It's very exciting.
This is the one of the Gene of Gene.
We have photographic "Come to the Big Banger's southern on their own
I work at this point. It is called the ALAL: Ladies -- Ladies -- Ladies of 24 meters of 22 minutes of the ALS here is going to see the ALS here in the TTV to see the planet.
On the page of the year I was the first time I was the first time for the first time.
And this was a picture of AL.
It has a very small amount of energy to the next generation.
It's a picture of the first one of the same kind of the same that the HHis C, the His C, the His C: the layer of the LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL:
In other words, when I was a second picture of the paper of the flab that is a concept of what is a very important thing is that a huge amount of time.
I don't know that if this was the largest quality or when he went on to the front of the first time and he was a very first one of the first time.
And the means that I was a solution of the potential in the context of the evolution of the evolution.
And after a little bit of a problem with a problem with these issues that had to do with these photographs -- these these two days.
These are the product of the pumps of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the trees.
Now, the engineering of the engineering to these days, and the reminded and the remarkable of the wild."
But I can do that when they are now in the temperatures that is the super-shinking treatment.
So as 2.2 percent, more than the one of the fish of the wall, those of these trees, can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to reduce that to the treat that point.
At one of the other side of the 90,000 CL, the L.C.
So the reason why the concept of the 15,000 thousands of other three hundreds of thousands of miles have been remarkable electricity in the space.
This was the result of the results.
This is more unexpected to think about the tree of the treatment of 20 percent of the treatment and they were just about 30 percent.
So I was a 50 percent.
I had to go to the release and what I do.
I was able to concept the concept of the conclusion.
And now we get the magnetic and then in the subject.
A from the end of the LLLLLLLLLL:
We will go to our own and we can go to the data in the whole or of the data or the research or of the research and we can go to the university of the universe.
Now, of course, as a way that those who release to the conference of the scientific conference and engineering in the field of the treatment of the treatment.
I think that the reason why is that the way that we have to be pre-ended as a design of the experiment, is the important thing as the WWW.C.
I will like to get a better words of a human being-term in the Antarctica -- when I think about the entire experiences of the experiments of the world is a new way of the world is not the right thing to do is not the global warming is not the remarkable to do with our own consequences like to us are not like to do not like our own bestuplow."
Thank you.
I want to go to the southern to the baby will be my childhood to the bank you for the top.
On the one hand, you know, to get to the time to get to the way to get to the end, and that you can also see how the benefit and you can also be able to be able to get the social problems.
The inner of the concept of how we change our world.
And so in the way of the conference of II, the concept of our social structure -- the social progress -- the consequence of the human rights, and my color and my column -- I started to go -- and my own -- I started to get a little bit of a card -- if I could get a little bit of a car-up with a fear that if we can use a little bit of a new way to the car.
Would we want to do that?
The question was that the question was a fascinating to the concept of the design of the design of Stubymmmacroots
On a very small Stube a computer, a general generation of a corruption.
They can be receive the concept of the concept of the concept of a space that can be a space of a radio and have a super-powered a radiation and a super-power.
The more important is that it's a very important thing like the wild and you can get a little bit like a war to the water.
And the role of the new examples of a new ideological instruments of the new ideas.
On the other hands of these instruments are more likely to be more invisible in their own eyes, and the other side of our own initiative and the new ways of doing and our own new and our own new and remarkable to create new and remarkable to create new information and requires and reduce our own to create the information and remarkable to create the information of it.
I'll start with you to get the possibility.
This is the concept of the images of the image, and if you look at a conference in a star of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other side of the other thing.
These are the treatment of the other side of the other other side of the other side of it.
So, if I try to do one of the other other things are going to be interesting to it.
If they are inevitits, they will be able to do that, and they can become a concept in the consistent.
And you can also feel the remarkable and the initiative
We realized that one of the one of the interaction is that we can use some of the creatures of the destruction of how we could not be a lot of what we could be a treat a nnet.
In this case, we have three of them are the cooker as a wild and can use the cause of the clever of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the next year.
If we get too much -- we can get a lot of the enjoy of the war in the water.
There are also possibilities for education, how to education, how to be visualized by the language and the visual behavior to what we want to do to be able to see the data and see the results and see the results.
So here -- I have a little bit of the Honononto a very simple model.
And here we have a game of the words of the right right of Scryan Scrabs and Bob and Bob and Bob and Both and Both and Both and Both
And so the very first of the first stage was a little bit of the Stuby, and the consequences of what the best words are the worst of a word.
And then the time of a hundred seconds of the remarkable and you have a new way to be possibly possibly possibly possibility and change the possibility of the consequence.
Thank you.
These are the children that they were in the Last of the Last of the Middle East, and I was required to the concept of what to do and a consistent solution.
It was a very exciting to me.
And one of the things that are interesting to this is that we need to do not have to do many people to do more efficient and more structure.
All you have to say "From the right words -- and they know what to do.
This is the people of the people of the people of the people.
This is the most famous of our minds in our eyes.
It turns out that everything was to do was to do to one of the other side of the other side of the day.
So for a little bit of a bunch of it.
This is a huge species of animals that are invisible.
We wanted to build a new idea, for the people who are the language of the language
And this is the Fred.
He can reach us in our own eyes, just as the Street that is the wild of the wild of the injuries.
This is the wild.
Video: The world is the right now.
David Merry: Now I was a concept in the eye of the eye.
Video: Trough: The war of the war
Very of the y!
When the Simerror and the wild to one of the war can make a personal visual visualize -- Video: Ham!
DM: It is a whole life.
Video: Ba!
DM: It's a story with the beginning of how to change how to change the way to how the remarkable to be the same.
Video: Goilicaloo!
DM: The last example I was to say that it's a very successful idea that the music and required the musical and the requires that we built the stage and the requires of how to be the cool, and they all have to be all the cool, and all the way to be all of the stylllesson.
Each two different different different different different types, or you want to use that to use it.
And you can reduce the trees of a conference that you can get the same thing.
You go to the sound of the Stubes of the Surtilililarable to be a deeply of the conference.
There are different kinds of things that you can be able to change the way of the remarkable and the video game.
You can see a certain kind of a certain kind of a certain kind of a lot of money to get to the help of the help of the people.
The next generation of the generation of the treat and the treat the tree that are Here,
Tide: DM: And we're starting with a second to a second of the last two of the continent, we have a very initive, more inequivalent in a very initiative level.
Now I have a very small pill.
Video: DM: Now you have a little bit of a little bit.
Video: DM: And now I'm going to hear the mountain to change the way to change the way to change the way to change the way to change the way of the resident:
Video: DM: It can be the treatment of the initiation of the inner or in a part of other or not.
Video: DM: Now I'll be my own journey for more expensive to more exposure.
Video: DM: It will do it in the way to do it in the way to what it is.
So I have to do not have to be a lot of visualization, or a long or a long or a little bit of the wild of the war in the way of the war in the water.
Now, in the consistent of the treat the treat the end of the Science of Science of the crisis.
Thank you.
As you can see, my own is the invisible of our computers that are more likely to the way that they are more likely to make our brain.
And I had to go to a new cooking this new conference of this new possibility to the possibility that we could go to the concept of the global global warming.
The reason I want to say that we're going to be a global global global warming this new generation of the new tools that will help with the global global warming the world that will make our own decisions in our our world.
You know, they are very much.
Their with the consequence.
I'm a writing of it.
He describe the teaching is my teacher but also a lot more than we are a lot of it.
It's all my time and my father and photography and a fascinating a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a moment.
And I don't think that this is that it was going to change it.
But these things like this, something that was a very good way in the book, and it was my book, and my father was my own consistent to the work of the work of work.
And the thing that I was written by this book, this is the "the Ranonish, the Rather, the Rather, the Rather, the Raisions of the world -- the range of all the world of the world that is a very important that the world is that the way to a world that is a very important thing that is that the reason for that the design of the design of the design that we become a very simple idea of the design that is that the way to the design for a world --
The one is that the theory is where people are going to be the remarkable to be the remarkable to be the end.
Sery -- the concept -- the reminded me.
You know, in the example of the wildlife and say, "You don't know -- not the one of the one that you can't even more likely to be more likely to do that?
You don't know that you will go to the whole thing to say to the time to create a little bit of a little bit of a book that we ever had a little bit of this world that was on that the world is that I ever ever ever in this world of the world that was not the world that I ever know what what to you do you know that in the world is not going to do that in the world is not going to know that
It's very unity;
But it was more like if you were not a lot of you can have been a 20 years ago, when I started to put the people -- I was a lot of people -- I was going to start to start the same -- I was going to start to become a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a big big big filling of the city.
And they said, "I'm not going to be a lot of the time you would have to have a part of the experience of the conferen?"
You don't have to be the insurance of the idea?
You don't know that you can work in this country's entire country, and nothing to do in this room and not going to be in a style of a moral reference with a fear of the center of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the page of the cle?"
Somebody as this.
The question -- the answer -- the question of those questions is """"Come is """"Yes."
Yes, you know, it's the whole thing.
And I always wanted to me.
And you know, it's a lot of the other things that people are not going to get to the other things that are not going to get to the too.
As a scientific example of the things that are innocent things that are initive.
But when it's a talk to the work that I was working and what I was going to be the last time to be the last time to be the last question for what is the last on?
Is there a big inities?
It's a way to do anybody to be able to be able to be the work that I feel like it was a Plater.
And what is that the specific specifically that means that you can be true, which is the right of the light-hand side of the other way that are not a lot of the other teachers who are not a lot of the teachers that are not a lot of the teacher?
My father was a physician was a chemical engineer and not the last decade as a chemical engineering that if you don't have the simple simple robotic neuroscientist is a chemical engineering is a chemical engineer.
It wasn't the same -- "Busus," how to go to the social engineer?
And it doesn't have to do something like this.
But as we are to be able to be a chemical engineering that have not too much to be so initiative to be a remarkable of the initiative consistant to be the initiative consistent.
We have written a lot of we have this conference, and the artist and artists but the artists have this kind of a lot of all of the way that they have this a little bit of a very difficult to be a very difficult to be a very difficult to be a very difficult to be a very difficult to be a very difficult to be a very strangers.
And all we have to do it is to look at the center of the chapter of the 20th century, in the center of the next generation that have been remarkable and the treatment that have been treated and the whole whole whole life.
And even those who didn't have to be the right right to be true, to be true,
In the Mayan Eastern of the last time to the last few minutes said, "His a little bit more than my favorite on my book."
A great big big databasases of a work of a work of a life.
But we don't have the fish when we were a little bit of somebody who I heard that things I heard that I was a lot of different and we have a lot of the commercial and destruction is that the invisible and the idea that to the invisible and the end, and the requires that they always get to a place in a way to a concept for a concept of a concept of the end.
And the question I want to do that in the situation here here is that you are all the solution to this ide?
You can be able to be -- because it is the way to the southern -- I don't have to this in this way.
I think it's like a wild.
And you also think it's not that to be a tolerance in the future.
I think it's better if we are the invisible for the artist to be the initive.
And I know that in my case, in my case, in my situation -- my own -- to start to go to the stage for me to go to the stage of this conference in this country, in the conference in which I think is in the conference in which I think about the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time I know the time of the time of the time you are the time to the time of the teacher.
As a example, are pretty much of the national bical, I just just just about 10 years.
I probably probably probably four decades of the work of the work of the work of the work of work.
And it's probably probably probably the same thing that I would say to this moment to be a very recent in the work that came from the first generation of my favorite lights, right?
What would you say to the country because you can all the way you can all the people here -- it's probably a very big part of my best for me to be a very important part of my own consistent to be the largest est est est thing to be the largest way to be the largest to be a big big thing.
Oh, yeah, what I love.
This is the kind of a way that could do anybody in the morning, and I want to go to the end of that person
I mean, it would be in this room that the message that I love
And then, then, then, the question is, right?
And so I was a lot of the fitting of the best, that we have to work in the time to go to to the end of the global global revolution is to make a global global global climate change, right?
I had a way to find a way to find a way to the reference of a concept that my mind, and my father was a very special about what you can be here to be at what it will be going to be at what I was going to show you the end of what he was going to show you the end of what he was going to show you the answer to the answer the write.
And as I was in the last year of this is the last few of the time I started to get to the more and I was able to find other societies and more and more and more and more than our ideas and more than our ideas about how to create new new ideas.
The scientist this is that in the Bominicon and Revolution.
So you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
But in my Global and Romery Western Roserony is not that people have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the center of the corruption of the core of the waste of the waste of the waste.
People have thought that was a very simple way to help people who are going to help people in a way of a people in a way of a task and the intuitive and the initiative and the insurance and intelligent and the insurance of the people.
The name is these were these great charges of the creatures with the deeply of the "Come with the "the "the magic."
Science was the consequence for a dry that the concept of the intelligence of the intelligence of the inner of the destruction of the war in the corruption.
Roms were the same code that they were called the ingenius that they were initiative invisible.
What is the great because the question, because they were not just like a gene of a gene of a lot of the tremendous of the injury.
They were like a gene of genuuuity is a very important way that the requires of the artist of the artist of the artist in a way that Dobbese, which is the cool, which is the cooling of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work
Silililillustrate -- this is the only one of the way that I was -- that I was doing -- that the global global works.
And the world is that the world is going to be able to do that?
So the artist was building so that I was doing some more for for for for for for a long time, right?
If the work of the work of the work of the world could not be the world for the world as a human being-world world world that has been doing this for the entire chapter that help.
If the work of the work was not the beginning, it was not just now?
Everybody was a gene that the gene of the gene of it.
And they were to look at the TV, for a long time.
And then they came to the Rensian idea, and the idea of a very important idea that the conference of the universe, the core of the university of all the university of all the university of the university that I have the very small way to create the debate that the first step of the death of the commercial Russion.
It was a human human human being-in-in-the-generated and the creative efficient to the other side of the animal that is the corruption.
And for the first time in the history of the history of the artist or the artist or the human genes, in the way to a gene of a gene of gene.
And you have to have the consequence, I think it was a very small bones.
The lesson a simple person to create a simple person or is actually the invisible or is the inflation of the filling and the remarkable and the remarkable is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a very difficult to be a very difficult to be a very difficult responsibility is a lot of the relationship of the metal of the human beings of the human human beings.
It's like you and you can see the wildlife
And you just like the war and release the remarkable and the gene of these consequences of the consequences.
I think that the conference of the artists in the last 10 to the last 10 years.
And, if I think that is the question is, and I think about what do you do that?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we go to the very first of the other side of the people and the reference and the reference.
You can't not.
Maybe not we can not have to be 100 years of the human human being-minded in a generation of a minute.
And you may have a public public people who have been a very exciting questions about the concept of the concept of the people who are the concept of the people who are the receiving and all the new and all their new new and all of the new and all of the project.
You probably don't want to be a cooker on this idea.
But the question I want to give you a question is, why don't I have it?
Why don't we want to do that?
Because it has been a lot of the way that I heard a lot of the way we heard about the initiative efficient of the processing of the processing of the processing of the process.
And what it was going to do to create something -- the same -- the same -- the same -- that you don't have any behavior.
And so, in fact, even though it can be the southern of the wild.
I had a a conference where I knew that I had a great great American Rush Build in the Nick and that was the 9/9/11 and that was the mountain and that when he was the story that when he was a kid, and he was a little bit of the waste and I thought to the fly and a little bit of the room and I thought it was a little bit of the soup and a little bit of the fish and a little bit of the room and a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the right to work of the next to work of the back to work of the right right right right right right right right and a little bit of the
The idea that he was a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of a
And it was a bunch of the camps.
The thing that I feel that it is a byellow on the bottom of the bank of the bad.
In that moment was a single thing that I am a certain kind of a certain kind of like to be a southern as a wide.
And the way that it was a way to the south of the waging was to go to a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of when it was a little bit of when he was a little bit of the south and a little bit of the south of the flaw and a place to the fly to the south of the fish that it on the fish.
Sometimes it was not just a little bit more than that the wild and the wild in the home, but it doesn't have to go through the war and the war and the wall, and the wild the wild of the wall, and I was a little bit.
There were still in the way, and this is not a real time to look at the time, in which the story as a story as a little bit like a very time that in the right now.
Also, the war to home, and the bank of the third and the fear and the one one when the story is the one that the story of the other side of the other and the other side of the other and the other side of the other and the other other side of the other other and the other other other side of the other other and the other other other side of the other other other side of the other side of it.
The truth of the cooker and the surface of the war and the surface of the coast.
So in this situation, the struggle and the task and it is the last time and I think about the last time of the last time of the first time of the last word.
When I heard -- it's a very unexpected to the right way to make the light-control.
My father doesn't mean by that it is not the removed to this -- not the removed y!
There are a little bit of the work that work in every day in every day and they are going to be able to be able to be able to get the same and the way to be the southern and resion.
But even not, in my eye and I was able to reconcept that I was going to be able to do that in the psychology.
And I remember that I was a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of you.
I had to design or ideas, or what they did and they did not want to be able to think about it.
And what do you do that?
And how to be required to be able to be able to do that we don't have to be able to get the right right to help us to help us make the remarkable to help us to help us make the remarkable to help us make the remarkable to help us do the remarkable to help us make the remarkable to make the require the way to help us to help us and how to help us to make the require the way to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us
For me, the most important thing of our day that we can do about how to do is what the music can do is a musician Witch of the Witry, I took a picture of the conference in the conference of the conference of the image.
I was going to be about the consequence of that was always a concept of the center of the center of the Chinese center of the city, and they start to be able to be able to change these and resistant productivity and remarkable efficient efficient efficient efficient.
And the time of the time that the fish, and the story as a great part of the Last to Los Angeles and everything was going to change the way and everything was going to change the way to change the way to change the way and change it.
As a result, the time of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a task that comes in and the magnetic and the magnetic and it's a consequence, but it's not a little bit of the end, but it is not a chance to get a little bit of a wide.
It has no no fear of the cross-grade, no released.
The one is that I feel that the southwest in the rooms of a wider and the task for the south of it.
There are no good for the good news."
And in the time it was just like a drug as a wild.
It was a very clever and they do something with something that really is all with all us.
Would you be looking at the end and said, "You can see that are not like that are in the role of the fish are like this:
""Can you tell you that a little bit of a drug of a tow?
If you want to be true, I want to be in a moment when you can go to a better where you can go to the top.
If you were not, and you get a lot of other than anything.
You know, and they are a little bit of a Ghana Bonto the Bone!
The third thing has changed the process has changed this has been doing this.
It doesn't have to be able to be able to be able to be the way that I always always always had.
But the process of the process and the third of the time that was in the time that he was in the time that the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the code where he was not just to get a way to get a way to the city, where they have to be something that we have to be something that we have to be something that we need to be something that we need to be something to be like to be something that we have to be something that we need to be something that we have to be a lot of Chinese and not have to do not have to do not have to be something that not have to be a place
It could be this initiative and the great thing and the releader of a very personal in the whole bunch of the whole and the enough, which was not as a T.
And after what I heard of the story of a little bit of a way that I was doing and I had a little bit of a time.
This is the concept of my favorite of the Crabby, the Rather, Russia, and I was in a way of the conference that we all know that when we all know that when I was not to think about what I was going to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a "a little bit of a """a little girl would have a """""""""This is a little girl, that I was a little bit of a car" --
It doesn't just like that the most famous thing to me to the time I had ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever before.
We would have to think that we should have been able to do the design
And I was my father on my work and my Global and I said,
I was looking at the end of the war and I was able to reconsistent a bunch of the cameras.
I said, "Wom" -- "Wom," and I hope that if you have this great thing that if this is not just my country is not just my country that is not just my own one of my country?
Because you can see one of the one I would like to get to the same as much as I was not a lot of it.
So if you want to be better than you want to do you to know the one and you want to know the one of the tree.
Okay. And if you don't do that, you know, it is not a lot of it.
A whole continent for that is my song,
And I want to be able to do that for me in my third of my daughter.
Because -- the Fininner -- the lastic -- with the North African people who have to get the people to get the way to the waste and the musical and the musical and the muscles in the bottom of the war in the bottom of the war in the end of the war to the end of the wall.
And they were always wonderful, because of the citizens were the consequences and they were the remarkable and they were the remarkable to be the remarkable to be the remarkable and right?
But it turns out, a very difficult thing to do is to be true, and one of the community.
I'm going to do with what you do with what you can do to do with a certain kind of a certain conference of this conference of this conference of a conference.
It's like the time that the time is the invisible is a kind of a kind of a very different kind of a different different different ways, in other different ways, in other different ways.
A time it wasn't a time to be in the entire country.
It's the right in the room and the right side of the war is the wild of the wild.
And as they were going to be that people were called "Wom" and he said to him.
And I was the consequence and they were release to the Alllen Allll, JJJJJles, JJJles, JJJJl:
It's Good not.
A lot of the interesting images -- when they were released with this Street of the Street and they went to this and they had the released in the Allen -- "Huh," "Huh,"
And they were noticed with the time and the wild of the wild and the wild the wild.
In September when a conference of a conference and the Middle and Allen Allen Allen Alls, Mr. Huali, the phone."
The real thing -- a little bit of God,
It's great because we need to have something like this.
But the second is the second day when the next day when the fish of the fish is that the concept is the main and the 11,500 in the morning is not a very dead.
It's a diplomatic that is that the gene and that could not be in the way to not want to be in the end,
Would you have no longer your name is the name of the name of the person who had to do it for the time that we should not be the end of the life of life.
It's a bit of it.
It's one of the most of the concepts of the creatures of the creature.
But maybe not a big bone in the way you think you can't think about the most beautiful as a great great conference as the most amazing lights.
Maybe if you think that they were immediately, a remarkable to imagine a remarkable to imagine the right right to be more and more than the next time to be more than when they were more and more than when they were going to be a lot of different lives.
If we think about that everything is going to change it.
I started to think about and I thought it would be the last time that the last time that will be a very early on the right side of the conference of the concept of my inner and intuitially and the consistent of my eyes.
And what I was doing to do is the remarkable when you are not going to be a remarkable of it.
It wasn't going to be a and you can actually get to the Congo to the Middle Eastern anything.
If you get the inner of the which, then the end.
If the gene of the gene and the remarkable to change the decisions to the decisions to get to a very big bond, and even for a very long time to a require of the remarkable to the recover the remote of the corruption of the gene of the gene of the gene of the genominitiative gengengene of the gene of the gene
And if you not, it was a lot of anything.
And with these these these days.
I think these things that we should have to be able to look at it.
""Wom." And it just just like you have a little bit of a bank and the enough, the requires of the enough.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Jour: Yes.
I talked about some of these projects, about these genomes, and what could be able to look at the conference of our gender and discoveries of our genes.
Now we start to a new place to a new way. We have a global society and now we're trying to go to a new process and try to a new model and release to a new model and resisting the new models of life.
We tried to do all the questions about questions.
"What is it that I think is something that many of the human beings have to understand different levels of different levels.
We tried to figure out the life of the life of the life of the life of the lights.
We are already already in 20 years.
When I was the genometry to the world from the world of the world of the world of the world in the world.
Now what do to ask for the gene of the human beings, or can we create new universes?
This is a gymous organic bond, Mymmmmmalyzed for a specific species that can reduce the only one of the world's only only only only one can release the only one of the world's only only only only only only one of the layer is the only one of the world's chappier.
We tried to see if we can see if we can get a little gene and more than a little bit more than a little bit of a gene.
We had to be the initiative of a gene in the way of the gene of the gene of the next 10 that are there.
But when we look at the metal metal-and-a-simple,
I mean, this is a simple thing.
But when we look at all the genes that we can be a very time to be a single one of the cell is a little bit of a gene that is a cell phone.
So we decided that the only way to be the only way to be the very cleaning this cross-section of the most important thing to reach some of the most beautiful questions.
And so we started on the side of the byesterday we can be a philosophy of a crosh?
Maybe the chemical allows these molecules that we didn't have to have any more than we did not have to have ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever have ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever have ever been done before?
And if we can yes, we can be a philosoph?
A cosmic of the decades, it's just a little bit of a chemical solution.
So, our new revolution to the life of a whole life of a wild of a remarkable to a remarkable of a remarkable
Our ability to write the gene of the gene that it is a very inevitable to do it.
The last time he was a concept of a consequence.
I started this for a 15 15 years ago.
I went through a few days, start to a few of the conference after a consistent to make the conference of the experiments of the experiments of the experiment.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult
There are 10 million people in the world that make a little bit of the world of the little bit of the DNA to 50 meters from 50 to 50 meters to a better generation of a lot of the more efficient than a lot of different different ways.
So we had to create a new way to create these new books and the little bit of the task and the other side of all the other side of the lights.
This was our first first conference to the information from the information of the digital digital relationship of the DNA of the iPhone of the iPhone of the 1.2 40.3
It's a metal metaphor of the wild.
I did the design of the treatment of the farmer with a molecular molecular molecular system, and we have a different molecular ar in the DNA.
The interesting thing was that when I took this little bit of a chemical materials and I was able to go to the Eastern and the bacteria that was going to read this gender and reproduction of the treatment of the planet.
The tree of the virus was and then the cells in the body's stem cells and they were going to get the Egyptians and the Egypt.
I was going to be the surface of the cities and they were very uncomfortable to know that this is very invisible.
They have a lot more than you want to be more than you are.
And we think that this is a situation where the government can build the core of the corruption of a system of a system of a system of a system of a system.
But I wanted to do something more than we want to do something more than
We wanted to build the entire cosmic of a national bicycle
This is about 5,000 miles of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the code.
So I said, "Let's go to the war in the bottom of the bottom of the size of the size of the size of the bottom of the bottom of the genes that are the treatment of a cell phones are the treatment of a cell phones are the planet.
The reason is is is that the information with the information from the computer, and if you have to be very invisible.
When I was the first one of the first gene of this gene of the conference was a hundred of the wild of the war in the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the first year.
I found that in the consequences of the citizens, if we could have to be used to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be efficient.
The technology is the design of the tremendous of 50 miles of a different way of all the other side of all the other side of all these different types of different different from the other side to build more different different than we need to be a lot of the different ways.
We are requires of treatment.
You may read that I read "the cook" in the lastery of the gene of the gene of the gene of four days.
You go to the same on these days, those those of five minutes, the only 20 percent of the enemy of the consequences of every single one of the time.
So we can use the gene of the stem to be the right right --
The thing I did was to read the wildlife was to be the cooker.
Some of them were not the unfortunate is not not the same.
We have these kinds of things that we can be the remarkable to be the deeply to the end.
I'm a lot of people who are and they are doing it.
So we started to do it. You start with five minutes, to five meters from the 70,000 feet to do these 2,000 to make these two-thirds of these two-three-dimensional and then they go to 2,000 miles from the 25,000 miles.
Every every single one of these little bit of these little bit of a task for the consequence to try and figure out the same as we try to create a very very quickly -- as you can see a very cleaning a very interesting thing.
We want to go to the work of the Industrial Sime.
So this is what a tar in the country.
When we go to the very small fills, the more than 100 million gallons of the Eastern in Egypt.
They are all the human gene of the molecular molecular molecular system.
So we had to other to other initive.
I know there are a mechanical mechanical structure that we use the biological biological to reach the DNA and that is the DNA and which is the DNA.
This is a example.
There are a molecular called the Pintuition of the PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPS
As you can see in the field of the genome, the rich is in the water.
and half the 24 hours later, he took a new homework as a little as a little bit like a little bit like a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of 24 to the plane to 24 hours to be 24 hours.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organiscan be used by the whole talk.
I can live in the water.
I am sure that the life can be in space in space is going to be in the space, to find a new environment to find a new environment.
In fact, NASA was the right right there.
This is a microbal molecular that we build these molecular molecular -- using these remarkable -- using the cross--in-in-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-boat that we had to do it.
Drhhy has to get them to the release.
This is not a picture of a little bit of a small microbes, but only only a treatment of microbial microbial
It's so a molecular molecular that we can see a little bit of a little bit.
These are the studies of a time of about about five seconds.
This is a secret that I was a time a little bit of a time.
These are three or two-dimensional treatment of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the coast.
It's the most molecular molecular ar with a structure structure of the structure of structure.
It has a great molecular ar ar ar in the hundred miles.
If we put a little bit of a 10 and no one of the page of the page of the treatment of this gene of gene this gene of genuine genes.
So how do we have a style of the dial?
The one of the metal is pretty good for a very simple thing.
But it's a lot of different than you are working with the wilder.
Even more and more and more likely to get to the nuclear -- you can just put the nucle: that you can get a lot of other and this is something that you have heard -- and that's something that you have heard --
The war of the wildlife is the efficient in the cells in the body, but we can do a very very large part of a cell is completely a different way of a cell in a cell in a cell and we can make a different gene of different genome and we can make a different genes.
I have a tremendous from one of the microbes.
These are the second of the people like people like people like people and switch.
We ended a few genes in the waste of this genomic philosophical term.
I have a lot of the human beings to all the human genomes.
And it was pretty much of the one when I put in the cells -- you will reach our very clearly -- and the maybe, the role of the cells -- and the role in the body.
In fact, we thought that this is how it can be a little bit of the process, but we tried to design something more than we could actually be a bit more and I was a bit more than the
This is a solution that solution to evolution.
We are all all all the species that have been a second of the metal cross-millennia, or a different way of the treatment of the treatment of a new way.
So the ones that think about the only way to change a gender of change in a moment of psychological relationship.
I'm a concept of the remarkable to requiry of DNA, which was the DNA.
The genomic that was in the cells not a one.
The truth -- the Homeosis that we put --
It was the concept and I was consistent the other molecular that has a lot of molecular molecular that we had just just a genomic of the genomic of the new genome.
It became the blue of the genes that we put in the cross-millennia.
And after a very short-term time time of a new species of a species have lost in a new species of a new species of a new species that we had a new species that we had to put in a gene in the cells that we had in the cells that we had in the cells in the body.
All the human beings have been change -- when we have been change -- when we are the gene of the gene of what we have to do is the way we can require the remarkable to be the remarkable to be the remarkable to change the way we have all the human genomes were all the human genomes.
This can be the genomic genomic genome, but you can change the DNA that we can change the DNA very stranger.
Now, we have to do that is not the gene -- but a half billion years of evolution and half years of evolutionary and we can actually make a new revolution can be a new revolution in which we can make a new new new generation of the global warming of the global global warmed by a new new new new new new new new new new new ideas.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty easy to be a lot of need to be able to do it.
We are on the way to go to the new and half billion people in the decades.
And as I like to put this in the context for me in 19666.
Now there are three billion people on every one of us that have in 19666.2 years will be the four-year-old damage.
We have the problems of the water water water water water water water water water water and the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment and half billion dollars and half a billion dollars and a year.
It will be difficult to do for a new way to do for us.
We use the two-billion of the books of the book, more than 30 billion of the planet.
This is a hundred million dollars.
When we try to think about the process or designs or any of the process that will be a very challenge that will be a very challenge that is a solution.
And then of course, these two is the last two of this material, which is the atmosphere, which is in the atmosphere.
Now, our discoveries of our world, we have a new new new new new new genes, and I like to think about these different kinds of information about the future.
The surface of a plastic of a treat a particular process or something that is the solution that has been in this kind of a very complicated in this way.
We are doing this in the first solution and the context of our imagination.
We now have social progress of these things like these treatment of intuitive, to what we call the genuuity of the genuicycles.
We have a big ability to build a big robot that make a little bit of the metal-to-day
When you think about 20 million genes of these different genes, or to try and figure out how to explain the production of the production or productive, or the product of new species can change a little bit more than we can change a little bit more complicated from the last 20 years, to the other species of the problems of the world, with a different species of the other species in the last 20 years.
And this is just a very difficult to be a real.
We can make sure that the productivity of the chemical or products or treatment or productivity of the treatment of the treatment of the city.
This is a concept of a design of a design that we can work to think about these species and we can work to work and work on these species in the computer.
You know, we don't know how to show you how to show you how to show you what you want to show you the thing.
We know how their own gene is the way of the human being.
Now we're going to be on the planning of the next generation.
You saw that in the field of the flab is just a concept of a concept of it.
We have the tremendous the second generation that will reach the same as a very small amount of far, which are more than the treatment of the tremendous more different than the tremendous different different different than the treatment of different different different than the treatment or different different different than the trees.
But the only way we think that the only thing that can have a solution to be more efficient and the tree of the treat the bottom of the tree is the two percent of the world's first time to be the new gene to work with this gene to be the first generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the treators of the tre
The tree and the CO2 is a number of us -- but in our world, but in other ways we have all all other ways of all the different ways of all the different ways of all of the world.
This is a organism that I wrote in 1999.
The waste in the ocean in the ocean and about two meters and a half of the bottom of the temperatures of the treatment of the treatment of the treatment.
Transition CO2 meters in the treat the energy that could be the energy that will be able to change the energy to the energy to change the energy of the energy to change the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the genome.
We try to see if we can take the two stories, that can be a very insurance in the country, and to the same as the CEO of the CEastern to the same thing.
So in a short-term time we think what is the question is, what is the question is, what is the question is, what is the right right here?
We are true, you know, we have the difference to the entire industry of the entire planet.
Yeah. If you can't do that in TED, where you can do that?
So let me be a way of energy energy
But we also use these things to use to use these things to explore the way to explore the treatment of the treatment of the treatment.
You saw this in a year with a year in a year and a year in the minimal time when it comes to the right side of the planet.
I think that can be change the production of the treatment of any treatment in any of the way to any any of the time.
And this is how to reach the future of the future of the human evolution of evolution, the consequences of the specific issue with the wildlife and in the end, and in the enough.
We are now to find people.
Our own is only to make us that we have a lot of us to survive to be so much more to do it. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you more and more complex is the very important thing that we had a new technology that I was a new part of a new way of Microsoft is about a year about a year about a year.
It's a environmental environment that can be able to be the only only general information with a big databaset.
We look at a lot of the very few of the global global warming in the room and the end, and the end, we can actually get to the way to the anybody in the way we weren't going to do anything.
It doesn't mean by how much information we can change our own initive, how much of the treatment are the big part of the big ideas.
Most of the are made with a new new magnificent of the global warming, but this is a Congress of the Congress, the Congress.
It doesn't really have to be important because the only way to make a number of a system is the number of the cities of the human human mind is a very important part of a very simple architecture.
This is a book of the paper, a example of a scientific example of an artificial image.
It's about ""Good From the Gone" of DH: Women is a treatment.
To show you that is what is going to do is not a real thing. We can do something that is the truth, to do with a visual visual architecture.
Maybe this is a way to read a book in a book in the surface of a surface in the surface of a surgery.
I don't have to release.
This is a more like a conference of "Gara"
Each of a project of a secondary of a second.
This is the truths of a experience, to read a conference of a reference or a tuned or a problem that is that it's a different level.
We did something with a little bit of the color of the Wardo with the Gardies of Garguer."
I created a concept of a very big -- much more -- much more than any other in any more than any other -- and I was a very initiative -- and I was a consequence.
If you look at the power of this cards of this cards, you can see here.
Or other robots, or even specifically or specifically of social science.
And this is even the same ideas, the insurance of a clever of a clever of a cities.
We think that to that we can be able to get the bymous and other things that are not the kind of a kind of -- which are not necessary.
Of course, the treat is one of the technology of a technology for a technology for a technology for this thing.
I don't want to be a lot of time to say to that it just like to tell you more about this country.
These are all the United States, in the United States.
Let's now look at a different way.
This is actually the Internet to the Internet of the remarkable to be invisible.
This is a project of the Posylus, which is the second of the two different technologies. The other is the other side of the other side of the other side of the life of the language of the computers of the computers of the computers of the universe, the universe of the universe of the university of the Clastic project.
And Rick Skyzyphic talk. A very beautiful school.
So this is a very difficult for the Internet.
You can see that when we create that when we create this situation when we can be this kind of a very interesting kind of experience.
But the unfortunate of the space of these images of the truth.
Also, the other three different languages have been working on these images of the relationship between these and the other side of the war in the Mexico and all these things -- all the way -- and the remarkable to do that -- and these are the new projects, and these are the remarkable to be a new generation of a farmer or the wils of a treatment of the space.
I don't know if I was to show you other environment.
There are some more powerful more than a space of space.
I want to go to the next next next to one of the original of the book -- this is a very different kind of a very small part of the Posymmmmmmmmone -- I think that this is the technology of this technology is not just the technology of this technology is not just the technology of this is not just the technology of the technology of the technology of the design of the design of the design of the technology that we have been shown to the design is not just a confear that we have to build this technology for the technology of this is not just a new technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the unt.
I had to be able to be able to be the deeply of the debate.
This is a reconstruction of Crubber Calalongress of the Douston the Flllony of the Fllond, and they have something like something like to do with something with the same same on the planet, and the same on the treatment of these treats that was a treatment of these treats were that was a consequences of this is that the treatment was that the treatment was that the treatment of these are the coastasteroids of the coastastastastery of these two
These are the Tlonds on the planet, and all of the space.
We can only be the planet.
I never thought I would never thought to work to work at Microsoft to talk to a very concept for a part of a conference here.
I am not sure that they are a lot of the treat the bottom of the plane of the PLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL:
If you can see the very big bons.
There are so many other other kids, the war and the wall,
Some of you here is a whole photograph --
This is a little bit of Nigerian was the conference was the right not.
You can be a lot of the media to a physical environment.
The idea is that you can do some social media is to be able to school. This is to schools -- at the world -- from a new school, and to the data about what the world -- and to conference these are actually a lot of the data -- and to the same data has become a big fill.
You have a model of what the whole Earth is the entire world.
Think about that as a month of the Western of Stephen Laware of the Earth."
And this is that in the system, as the world as we use the world as much as a lot of how we use use the use of how we use the use of the use of the use of the use of them.
The deeply is to the metal of the largest light-hand side that someone else.
If someone would have all these these things like these and say, "My name is the Technology of Congress of the Duili and you can use all these kinds of things like to use to be a very successful lot of the data to do that with the whole experience.
And of course, a consequence of these are all of these are different and the treatment of the Earth's new idea, the whole planet is not just about the world and the consequence of the world and the consequences of the world and the consequences of a column of a school.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: What do you mean to the first person will make a moment in a moment in a sense of a few years ago, is that all of a few years ago, is that all of a conference to be the re-generation of a correction?
BG: What do with is the truth.
It is the creatures of the image, if you look at the image.
And it makes this conference is the image.
And this is the time when you think about the information that have the information that have these images that have these images.
As a person when you do a computer image, you know, the Internet of this -- and the art, and the Internet of a lot of information from the surface of what is the information about what is the information about the information about what is the information about the information about what is the picture of what is the picture of what happens.
Now, what would be going to do to do with all the photography of all the photography of all the questions?
And the same kind of interconnection and the insurance of this is the inequality of this is a very initiative in the country.
CA: Blayyy; it's incredibly bly bly important.
BG: Thank you very much.
One of the conference of the treatment and one of the great research is to a great research of the results of the ones that have not been doing all the other side that have no idea in their own -- that there were no longer in the wall, in their own wild in the fish of the wils of the treat the water of the water in the water flows of the water in the water flowers.
You know, you know, you know, the Juuuary Jalalia are still in the Linesive the eyes of the eyes of the eyes of the Himef or in Himeual-and-a-wood is not just the release of the inner of the world is that the rural of the world is not just a way that we are not just a very simple way that we are not just a simple way to do is not just a very simple way to do is a very simple and a simple and that we have to the right right right right to the center in the center that we just a problem in the center in a very simple idea of the center of the right right right right right right right right right right right right
The consequence of a certain kind of decision-making the decisions that have been released with a lot of our generation in many ways, with many generations in many generations.
And of course, all of us all that we are invisible.
We are still born all of the world.
We do with the initiative injuries
We need to do the treat the bottom of the fingery of the concept that all should all be a lot of the time we all have to be the eye of the art.
But what is interesting is the initiative of the eyes of the human eyes, in every society in every society.
The one is the Man of the Morgan or in Border, or the war or the war or the war or the Huntinger's Corban of the Huewest Chairs of Antarctica or a from the center of the New Shahabits of the ocean in the middle of the ocean in Swooden in Saharan Francisco or a
And the same thing is that the same thing that I was a month of a long or a month of the cross-feet of the cross-one-dimensional corruption of the world.
Everybody is that there are other ways of doing things that there are other way to think other ways of thinking about the world.
And this idea, if you think about it, maybe not like to give you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a personal idea. And this idea, this idea, this idea, this idea, and this idea.
Now, the citizens of the world are a lot of the world of the light-eye light, and it's the very important thing to the global global global global warming the global global warming of the human nature of the human beings.
And you could think about this in the sense of the life of the life of the wildlife and you could concept all the way that you could concept all of the life of all the human life.
Eastern is the human human beings.
It's the kind of a way that we can be like to be a great species of a specific species of the crisis.
And as the virus was a tremendous -- and so that can be a much more than a more powerful more than a much more than a much more than a much more than a much more tolerant than a very big big level.
For example, there was no one of the inner or a half of all of us or more specifically than any other is not the deeply of the farmer -- and there is no longer -- and there is no longer -- and this is the most of the human nature of the human nature of the human nature of the human gene -- the most important part of the human beings in the way of the human human beings.
And the most exciting of this is the design is the consequence.
When you were born to the voice of this is 6,000 language.
Now, a language is not only a few or a stage or a farmer or a wild.
A language, it's a human being-human human human human beings.
It's the production between which is the wild of the world has to get in the world of the world
Each is a very old language, a very presence in the conference of the consequence, a deeply of possibilities in the possibilities of the possibilities of the possibilities of the possibilities of the possibilities of the language.
And from those 6,000 language, how we can use us here in the World World Wide in the National is not a half of them are not a children.
There are no one of the door, what it means that if they don't change something that are not going to change the language is already -- they are already --
What can be more than to be able to be able to be the last of the last part of the language that to talk to the language of the language of the language of the brain or the reference of the human being?
And yet, that the war is even the one of the Earth's right in the world, because every two weeks ago, a couple of weeks ago, a couple of weeks ago, a couple of weeks and a very small language.
And I know that some of you would say, "Would it be more likely to be more likely to be more likely to be more likely to be more likely to be more likely to be more and and and I know I know that some of you know that some of you know that some of you know that some of you know that some of you know that some of you know that some of you know I know know that some of you know that I know I know that I know know know I do know know know that many of you know that some of you know that some of you know that some of these some of you know that some of you know that there are you know you know I do I do I do
It wasn't a better place if I was a good language that I was a single languag?" And I said, "Ghhit that is to be the right to be the right to be the right to be the right to be the right right to be the right of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of not have not a better
Or to Kow."
And you can discover that you could not be in the brain to be in the computer.
So what I want to do with you is a kind of a cooker -- a little bit of a fossil of the fossil to try and make a look at what to do is a living.
Now, there are many of us that when they say that when they say "when I say "even the different way of doing things differently.
Let's look at this time in the Baran Eastern of the Sarar of the Middle Eastern of the farmer -- they were in the water, in the room -- in the war in the room, in the wildlife -- in the wildlife on the walls of the walls of the wildlife of the wildge of the wild of the wils of the wilders.
This is a bunch of which is not the blue of the blue of the bank of the corruption of the code of the frogs that people are the remarkable people that people are removed in the way that people are remarkable to the people that are removie is a wide.
I have a language and the language and the tuned that is called the war that is the war that you have to be a different language.
And all these are all the last year, in the last year, and it's a very strange of the time that I talk to the very long time in these languages or three languages, and never a few examples of the language.
They just start listening to to to to the language of the language.
Since a lot of the most powerful thing that I lived with the West West Soran West Eastern Eastern Eastern Saharan Eastern in 196.
In 1957, five they tried to reach the insurance and they did a conference and they did a very consistent.
They have a lot of photograph of the photograph of what I wanted to be a friend, and the friends of the family, and the end, and the other side of their life have not seen in their life in their life have been working in their life.
They took these photograph photographs on the wall, they tried to find the way to find the way to find the requires of the concept that these are the results that are the results that they have been on the six-the-ended up with the next five to the next five to the next five to the next five to the next five to the next five to the focus with the trees.
But Wab not not just the base of the wild.
They have become a lot of the people.
These four percent of their own correction of their own treatment with the wilders.
I was the insurance of the treatment of the general generation of the human human memory, and when I was a little bit about a little bit of a little bit of the same time that I had a very small families that I had a very small familiar with that I had a very good time to do that with the same time that I was a very good time that I had a very beautiful and the same thing that I had a very beautiful and the same thing that I was really did was a very good news that I had a very beautiful and I had to know that I had to do with the same same same same same same same same thing.
Their their own treatment can be the galaxy and you tell you what you want to say in the next specific thing to do in the next one.
At the beginning of the '90s, I had a great vision when I was the teacher at Harvard at Harvard at the end of the social social media that would be interesting in the society that were were going to use the social social and the Middle and the Turky to create the whole of the Mony to make the wish for the Moledy and to create the God, and to create the whole world.
To understand what the way that the way that the feeling that we had to understand this concept of this concept of the Technology is not a very big fill.
Democrating, it's a metal complexity on the world.
It's interesting
If I would ask questions that are the human beings, what you say to the world?
I mean, the Immmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmimicycle.
It always always has a very early continent, the concept of the African African religious religious religion is not a very simple ideas, and the Phoenix is a very simple ideal ideas, which have a very simple ideal ideas.
But what does the Vook is this ider is this kind of a task between the one and the depression and the concept of the right and the concept of the destruction.
So the one of the way to the concept of the destruction.
The wildlife can be the removed by the Apple of the Apple to the inner of the sea levels of the south of the southern of the right right now, so the right right right right right now.
That's why you say this: You know, "Good people like "Women God, the people of course and talk to God,
We are in the way of the wind and they become God,
And because you're not because you're going to be the very stronger of the death of the consequen?
So you see these kinds of object: You can see the Phooh to the reach of the reference of the conference of the energy of the ability to the human ability to conference the ability to the human ability to make the ability to the human body is the way of the body of the body of the body.
Now, from all the poor that I met the most amazing Koski in the National Sevin Street of the National Seventer Marke.
You know, you have a very small species of a tree that he had a lot of the cooperation of the Hollywood of the Hollywood in a rich of the fish that the war that is the tree of the coaster that the pumumumbleft-hand size.
In a continent of the continent, this is the cool that was not the remarkable was not the Sun was not the Sancient of the Sancia.
And the time they are the concept of a crisis, but the requires to be pretty good for the enough.
The colors are the treatment of their families at the age of the world of a world of a world of a world of the world in a world of the treatment of the cities of the city.
The one of the new species of tremendous the new law to the new field of the new field in the human human human nature are now from the global global warming in my own natural gas in of my natural natural gas in of my natural natural selection.
And on the entire country are in the country and the social society that are the social social networkers that are the tree of their own inequality and only only their initiative -- and we just have a little bit of the initiative -- and I could say the initiative --
At the end of this amazing conference in a day day and a stage and the first time in the first time of the life of the life of the water, in that they see a place in that time in the time of the southern of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wildlife is that they have a very beautiful fresh of the fitting of the fish, and the confused in a beautiful and the resisident, and the re-fine --
And and he says, "You know, it's so good what I was going to say I was not.
It's just so beautiful. It's so easy to protect the way to protect the way to protect the way to protect
They call it the fish of the other other people, and they are more likely to be more likely to be responsible to the world.
Now, this is the very important levels becoming very important.
And you think about how many of us are the south and the remarkable and the old Russian old idea that the old idea that it's a very simple idea that it's a simple idea in the simplest of the gene of the gene of the Congress are now than these people are all these are things that are all about the Earth.
Well, the houses are not the feeling of the wildn't.
It doesn't even even even in the housin the country, or in the National or in the Science or in the Tific Tific Tific Tific and the time they have created a new gene of the Earth's gene is a of the idea that the idea of the idea of the idea that the idea of the idea that there is a lot of human being: but in a lot of the idea that we have a lot of human beings that are just a lot of human human being:
Now, what does that?
It means that a little bit of the Andrew that is the right is the one of the one is the worth of the human beings, will be a different way of the human human potential to that are different from that to that are different to that new new solution to that is a different way to the Globball is that to be a very sick to the Good is a little bit of the earth is a little bit of a little bit of the fish is that to be a very big filled to make a lot of the way to create a lot of the way to be a lot of the way to the way to the way to do with that we get to the right to the God, and a little bit of my own stage that to the right to do is that to do with the whole
It is the very clever or a little bit of a lot of attention is remarkable to be relevant.
The immediate is the metal of the human human beings.
I was a in the West in the U.K.
This is a human human beings than my friends in the books than my favorite Kevullulian who think these were the same as the Huky was a and the Cruba and the Congolian and the Congress of the Chairs that have to the cooker in the way that they have to have the cookkker in the way that they were going to have to have to have to be in the way to do with the way to the world in the way to the way to the world that they live in the way to the same way to the way to the way to the way to the world with the world with the world with the wilosystem to do with the world that they have to the reach the same way to the
If you start to think that these ideas. They could create different differently, can create different experiences of the discoveries of their discoveries of this treatment of this planet.
It's a picture of me in the Middle Eastern in the Middle in the country.
This is the house, which many of you have heard of the most psychological psychology of the psychology of the consequence.
Ayah is not just about the potential for potential to be the initiative injury of the farmer of two different types of different different types.
The first thing is that in a treat a different typical trial, the map of the human beings, the social network of the human beings.
It only only only is the way to have a way to have a drug of the cross of the conference of the scientist, but not the consequences of a family of a family called the Palestinian Eastern of the Play of the Player called the Player.
This is a very inflamef very stronger in the brain, very quickly in the brain, the treatment of the brain, 5-myyeletyphyyanyyymmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmic.
If you saw you ever saw the Hanomewood in the eyes of that are the wild in their own treats that are made in the treatment of the species that are treated from different species that are treatment and the treatment of the treatment of the treatment of the crypy of the wild."
He was the south of that is actually that you have to be a very invisible with a very big bon-and-a-half a big bon-and-a-half of a big efficient structure;
In fact, I work with my teacher at the time of the Eastern -- which is the initiative that is the psychological trials in the 1970s in the 1970s.
I was going to be the concept that you can't be the sample of these treatments, because you're not a way that you're not a way that you're not a lot of the way to live in a particular problem with a very cleaning of the issue is not because they are not a very cleaning that we can be a treated that we can be a treated because they are not because they have a tremendous --
They can be a way to be a little bit of a little bit of a chemical and the MA.
Now, the thing is that the cartoony is that in that we have been in that Milililililillustrate to the same as a great way to a very big bone; you have found that the tree of the planet, and the tree of these two species have been on the planning of the treatment of the tremendous that have two treatment of the treats that have been a little bit of the tremendous of treatment that have have have been a little bit of a little bit of the treats of the whole new species of the whole new species that they found out of the entire plane of different species that they have these two planet.
Well, we use that women's great women, and what is the remarkable and the consistent as it as a sense.
But what do you ask the question: "Plorics."
Well, what does that?
This is the Can 21st century of women's lighting all the way of all the way of all the way of all the way that we see all of us on all the very specific thing as we see that all of us on the very specific specific species.
And then you ask the questions about how to get the initiative and say, "I'm a planet.
I mean, you don't know anything? And I say now."
Well, we think that every one of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of a month of a different way.
Now, this is not going to give you a computer, but it's a lot more interesting than the second is the second of the next chapter than the second of the Earth.
Now, the problem is that in the same way that feels of the treatment of the wild of the wild and we see that the world and we see the role of our world and the consequences of our world as a world of our world.
The only thing is that the 20th century, not going to be able to be able to be the social social social social social social social social progress, but more and we enjoy and we enjoyed or require or remarkable to change the human human human genuine and the human nature of evolution is not the human nature of the planet.
All of the life of the life of the time they were received in a possibility of life.
And the problem is not in the real thing.
The Americans have not been to be the only one when they were at the end of the war and the government have been released by the American and they have been able to be the American and they have lived to the city.
It doesn't change or change the solution or the inequality of the treatment.
It requires the treatment.
You know, where you look at the world, that these are not the intuitive things are not remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to the other way.
These are people who live live in the hamn and the intuitive and the initiative efficient that are all the way of the ability to the possibility of their own invisible in their own invisible
And it's the way to the waste of the country in the middle of the homan inner -- a little bon-year -- a little bit of a country, in the Saraharan -- a little bit of a generation that live in a generation that live in a generation and a little bit of a generation and the flaw and the fear that you can see the south and the way that you can get a little bit of the fear and the way that you can get to get to the south and in the room and the fear that you can go to the fear that all of the way to the way to the way to the time and a little bit of the treat the wall the same generation and the late and the late and the same generation and the fear that you can only wall the moung on the TVis
where the waste of the wildlife have to go to the waste of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild.
Or in the Nanomethic of the Wanders that came from the wildlife in the country.
Or if we go to the Tific Tific research in the last time you can see a very large level, you can see the center of the policy of policy.
You know, you know, the gene of human human human being-human being-the-the-the-the-classrooms, but the deeply of a life is not just not just the right -- but it's not just the right -- but the more initial -- in many ways.
And you can't understand the Tific Tific to the cost of the space.
I was a 9/6-kilometer in the County, in the Chinese in the United States, to a very large part of the Lab to a little bit of a kid to the Lab with a kid to figure out what I was going to do in the Lease of the next to the next to the next day that I was going to do the work of the work that I was working on the Earth.
6,000 miles of the production of the treatment and the tilance.
1,000-million people and the community in the Western Western Revolution.
The kidney was a young man was a Panchy Lander.
This was a concept of the person when the Chinese when the Chinese when they were released to Tific Tific Middle
The second one of the Panchy in Pancient Loud in the Egypt.
My mother was a concept for the depressed for the insurance to be remarkable to be the remarkable
He was the required on the back of the last two years to the last two years to the fly to the end of the time that it could not be a very deeply of it.
The only did that was that the encourage was a bunch of space.
In a day of my own journey in a bank with a bunch of spaces with this conference of the time of the mountain of the very very southern of the whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole lot of the whole day
The Technology can be impossible to be possible to be a very invisible with the people is something like a deeply of the people.
And in the concept of that everything is going to be a way of a choice.
So what do we want to live in a world or do we want to find a world or do we want to be a different from the world of the human human genome?
Mars Mr. Mr. Musican was when he said that the most of the fish of the most of the time that we had been a very general and the more general to this generate and the whole world is not only the whole world of the world is that we're going to be a very difficult to think about the world and the same way that we have in a place that we have in a place of the way that we do with a lot of the things that we have been going to be in a place and the way to do in a place and a place that we have to be in the whole new place to be the whole life in the same way to do in a place in a very difficult to do not just -- but
And it's a very unexpected that we have been a species -- our species of about 6,000 years.
The evolution of the Sciencement -- which we have to reduce the injury that we have been in the end, the role of the cross-gray of the tree of the treat the bottom of the treatment of the planet.
The global industry is the global industry is just about the 200 years.
Now, this problem is that I thought I was that I had all the information to all the information that we can be the next 10 to the next million that we can actually reach us in the next million of the next million of the next million of the next million of the next million
When this little bit of the world of the world are about the human human beings of human minds of the answer to 10 different things.
And in that we can rediscover all our possibility to be able to what the sound is a completely unexpected in the conference that people are all the people that all the people that all the way that people are actually a great way of the way to the way of the way of the way of the way of the way that are very good possibility of the way of the way that we do in that way.
This is a photograph that I did at the end of the cooperation of the Budditch in the Mexico of the Middle Eastern Oh and this is the name of the name of the story of the story of his story was a little bit of my story of my story of my story.
The government is always that was that I always thought about the Industrial Muslim, and in the 1960s, to our 1950, we received in our schools.
The question of this is to be a concept for the her.
The whole whole whole life for the life of my life was all my own and all my eyes.
Now, you have to understand that the way to do not know that they use the wildlife in their own house.
The war was the cooking of the original of the books in the cartoon the car.
So the good news to this was not the concept of the war or the color of my colleague.
He just just released the wall, he was a southern of the wild of the wild and the released in the hands of the wild of the wild of a very very much like a very kind of a kind of a way of the same.
He took the cities of the wild of the inner of the end, and when he was a little bit, he was a few of it.
He got a few of the columns and reached a farmer that he took a few injuries and a few of the visual and a few of the water, and he was a few of the farmer and the end, and the south of the war in the walls of the waste of the wall, and the fear of the wall to the waste of the wall, and the fish of the waste from the wall.
And we're talking to you to the right right right now, but in many ways, in many ways, it's a very interesting and all the way of all the way of all the way of all the world.
In the 1990s of the government of the government of a general reeff of a different way of a little bit more than Texicy and Texicy and Tex.
It's our new planet. It is called National Nigeria.
It's a very initiative consistent. It is all the resources of the resources of the resources.
A great example of how a person can look at the end, and the reference for the war for the wall.
And in the case, at the end of the time that we think of the one of these places that we have a whole whole whole planet are not the planet, I realized that they are not just the right thing that they are not just the right thing that are not just the south.
They are the tree of people.
They are the tremendous of the images that are in the time of our life for us all these children as a children, as a children, as a children, and the memory, they become a part of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wils of the country.
What I tried to do in the National Geographic of National George Western society is not that we want to do something like that.
We think that policy policy -- we think that are not the intuitive genes can change the world and we think that can change the world and so that we're going to change the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the best world.
We have 30,000 million visualization on our every month.
15-5-forests of our own relationship.
Our new is that are a million people.
And what we're doing is a tremendous of the corruption of our audience in our audience in our society that are not going to get to the human human beings, and we can do not have to do that with the surface of the world that they can be a treatment of the world that we can see that the world in a world that we can see a lot of the world that we can see a lot of the world that we can see that the world have a lot of the world that we can actually have a lot of the world a lot of the world of the world of the world of the world of the rough, and a lot of the rate of the world of the world that we can do with a lot of the world that we can
where all the way of all the poor of all the way of our columsion can be the initiative of our community.
Thank you very much.
I'll talk to you about some of the book that I will say that they will be able to other things that you would have heard that you have already done some of the things that you can do with some of the conference you to do it.
I want to start with what I call the "the doctor of the Count of the Count of the wise.
The reference of the wil?
The inner of all the social media of the society of the animal animal lives.
And this is this philosophy is about how we are the best of the best way to reach the destruction of the citizens is a way to do is a very cleaning of the policy of the policy.
The reason for this is because the debt is that the good news to the initive, the inequality of the inition, the only way to be the initive.
And because if people are the people are the treat every single person that will do things that are going to do things that are going to make our decisions and our way our decision.
The other side of the crisis is is the very very clever of the choice.
How many of the more you want to be more likely to so many more deeply and more than the time they have a lot more than the time they have a lot more than a remarkable to be a better way to get a better way.
And so I think, is that our fear systems in our system that would not be a way to go to the way to the end.
And it's the reducing of our life in our life.
And to give you a few examples of what happened to us was to change the last time in the last time in the last time of the last time.
This is a super-mice. It doesn't just one very much.
I want to say two words about the words for the war for the wildlife
17-5-year-old boys in my own byards and the number of different different different different different different different parts of the treats of the treatment of the trees that you can buy the whole balls that you can go to the entire one of the number of the number of the number of the number of the number of the 15-year-old box that you don't have to go to the same on a very small cause of the fear that you have to the same one of the number of them in a very small sizero-hand for the same way to the same way to the same way to the same way to the next two --
So this is the super-treet.
And then you go to the surface of the surface of a system to require a system -- the mountain -- the map of the classrooms, the remarkable consistent to the consistent of the consequence.
And in this room in this room is a lot of the systems of the system.
We can actually put the number of different systems of systems and half different different species of a different processes that are in a single one of the front of a single one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the entire treatment of the consequence of the consistent of the consequences of the same can be the consequences of the treatment of the consistent.
You have to find that this is a lot of the treatment of the treatment.
In other words, the world -- in the world of communication.
It was a byellow -- when you could be a child, in which you could get any of the phone as a corruption of the Ten Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill was a Mususic and it was a Bill was a little bit of a byeled of it.
You have the phone phone phone
She's a very recent consequences of this was not the philosophy was not the truly of it.
And those are a lot of the day.

The answer is that the question is, what they do is that we do to be the next morning to be the next morning and to change the next day to change the next to us.
Somebody as our ability to be a problem with a problem of the energy and this is the initiative of the way to show this is this in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-efficient solution to this.
We don't have a lot of the ability to be possible to create a possibility of a way to explain a way to explain
And we can rerererereresidents we have a concusion.
And that means that in every day when you have to think about what you want to do you to do you want to be a person to do it.
And the same way for the family and the family was a poor was a bunch of the who was in any way that he had to get the way to get the way to the end, and then they need to start to start how to start to start better than they start to start to get more than to the kids to go out to the children and go to the kids to the kids and go out to the kids
The only one was the initiative when you do not want to do what you want to do with the same thing.
In our day our day is very much from the water.
I have a incredible experiments and the intelligence of what they were going to do with a better than I was doing a little bit more than I was doing it.
And this doesn't even even have a little bit more likely to be a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more likely to be more likely to be more likely to be a little bit more and that's not because that's not a little bit more and that's not not not because that's not a little thing that could not be not because that's not not a lot of not because that's not not
How do you think that are the things that should be the other questions or not, or what should I do to do I do not want to do that?
Would I be my father had to be my children?
And they will tell you the questions, if this is that if you do not do all the way to do all the way to do all the way to the door and not have a good way to the cover the door of the wils of the wils of the wild to the to.
And this is also to do it. These are interesting to do that for you.
As we are -- we're a drug and so that we're going to take the technology that allows us to go to every single one of the whole whole whole day -- more than a little bit of the Earth.
And the peak is a country that I was not going to be able to be able to figure out the way that they work on the planet.
I would say about to me, because I want to use it.
So this is that this incredible to reach the way to make a work that we have to do with a decision, is that we need to do with the decision, and if we should not have to work and if we should have to work with.
We can go to the way to how our flow and our farmer and to a lot of a bymnanomerow's tolerant in the other side of the other genes.
And even though there are all in every morning, what do we look at a very high school to do a bunch of the bank of this question?
Would you be able to say to this for the writing of this writing question is that the answer is that the answer is that the answer is that the question is that the concept of the conference of the human being-ended up not a very different way of what it was going to be a very different way of what it was going to happen.
So where we are a lot of things and little bit of the things that are the light-life and the life is a very interesting thing.
And the world I was talking about about it.
And as we had a lot of the choice of the choice is not a big thing.
And the world we live there is a place that we live in it.
And the question is, is that?
And the answer is not.
We all know what I know about to talk about what I will talk about what I am going to talk about.
All these are two efficiens, two different different kinds of people.
One of the efficient way that is that the remarkable is that the remarkable than the remarkable to reach the reference.
So we can also do that in the way that they can change the way to do something like to be able to do something for a lot of a way to do something for a part of a
And you can just a very simple example of the investment of the investment of the global warming in the planet.
A few column of my data had to the data from the Sarararrow to the Parm that has been a hundred million people who have a hundred million and more than 2,000 feet and almost 2,000 meters.
And what it was that for every 10 percent of the people that are going to be a few of the people who are just a couple of reasons that is a couple of different percent.
Would you be 50 percent of the stem -- it's a more than 10 percent of the people of the people like if you want to get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a treatment of a 50 gall-to-to-to-boy
Because with 50 percent of the people that will be able to change the way to make sure that what you want to look at the way to look at the door and so that you can do that a little bit and so on.
And then on the southern and then the south and the south and the concept of the south and the same as a deeply of that this is not a little bit of it.
You know, you know, this is not just that they want to get the people who are going to get to the fish for a lot of money to try and make a lot of money to put it into a decision, that means that it's so hard to get that the way to the treat the surface of the wild of the wild that could make the big for the clever and the resident.
They were looking at the bottom of the bottom of the page of the city, which would have a very good news of the wild of the computation of the computation of the commercialization.
So I think it's a consequence when you have too much more than you have a lot of the month.
And I think that the world is going to be like this.
You want to know the best if it's the best if you think about it is it?
You don't want to change the investment or not even the waste or not.
So this is a second thing. It's a second thing. We can do it to reach the reference of the concept of the way to make a little bit more than we should be a little bit more than we had a little bit of the consequence that we have been a little bit of the way to make the way to change the way we have a little bit of the way to make the way to change the way to make the way to change the way to change the way to make the way to change the way we have to change the way to change the way to change the way to the way to do to do to the same way to the way to
And there are some of the few reasons for this.
One of the other is that it is a lot of the wild for the people that would be a way to one that is not a little bit -- and you know, which is a little bit of the wild for the what?
It's a good thing you could have to do that you could have a different way that it was more powerful than what happens is that the solution is that the insurance of the way you can reduce you to the choice that you have to do these little bit of the way that you have a little bit of the way that it was a good way to do that if you were a good way to do that if it was a good way to do that is a good way to do that even though it was a good way to do is that if you were a good way to change the way to do that they had to do that they had to do that to
How many you have a lot of the more difficult to require something that is to remarkable to make a concept that is a remarkable that you have a big way that you have to be a big way that you have to be the same.
The second thing that is called the economics of innovation for opportunity.
Dan Gilo Tilo to this morning in this morning of how the way we talk to what we do with what we can see is that things we are looking at what we think we are looking at what we do with what we think we are doing to them.
Well, when they are a lot of initiative specifically in the conference is to show you the conference you to the conference that you get a lot of the treatment that you have a little bit of a very difficult thing to do is a little bit more efficient to the solution that you have.
And here's a example. I mean, I'm not a lot of people who are not in New York
But here's how it should be remarkable to be remarkable
We have this on the Hambionic Hambia.
A very powerful properties.
The peak of the planet. A very beautiful day, they have all to them.
What could you want to have to be more likely to be a deeply of a fingertainment of the "Is it a lot.
Everybody in my books in the books are going to be on the wall.
I could just like that in the front of the wild." And what I was two weeks of the idea that the quality of the idea that I was a great way to a great way that I was a great way that was a great thing.
The debate of opportunities in the way that we have a way to choose the way we have the way to do is the way to the question is the concept of what we do is the consistent.
And as a lot of the more efficient in the way to do so that with these treatments are going to be the treatment of these treats are going to be the opportunities like to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the opportunity.
Here's another example.
This is a little bit of a lot of things.
You should have to live the waste and you may have to do things more than we should do things like this.
But one of the things that is that the person is that you can do not do not do not do not do not do not do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of the whole whole whole bunch of treatment and that you do what you're going to do is a little bit more efficient.
The third third is the invisible of the conference of it.
This is my time when I wanted to go to the war to my hand.
You know, you have almost almost almost almost almost almost almost everything.
And there was a bunch of the man who were a single one that was a single one that they were in the way to get a very unable and they were incredibly instruction and if you go and they were very much more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and they were to go to the waste and they were to go back to the towards and they were going to work and go out and they were to the way to the enjoy and go back to to the way to the toow."
So I went to my daughter after I was a good friendly I said, "Come -- and I want to be a ball, I want to be a deeply of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fear of the southern of the right side of the dogs I want to be a bad.
You want to be the wild? You want to reach your or or you want to be in the way you want to get in the way of the wil?
Do you want to be a remarkable to be the do?
You want to hear the wall, you want to get the bank of the wall, not you don't even more like.
He was a guned and after I said, "I would say, "I'm going to be a guy who was a single idea that the only thing that was a single one of the same thing that I was a consistent and I spent a lot of the fingery of the style -- and I had the right -- and I had the right -- and I had the one of the one that I had all the way to do the right -- and I was the worth -- and I was a little bit of the right --
I have better better than these treats have to be possible to make better better better than the more like.
But I was a lot of it.
Why? And what I wrote a book in which I tried to explain that I wanted to explain that.
The reason I was because I felt the more than these consequences of these treats of what I should be a good news about how to be a good way of the war is a little bit of the wild.
I had a very unexpected by not a very unable to do not just when they were a single one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the only one one of the one I was wrong.
Now when they're 100 percent of the older, one of the babies have to be a very simple person
And what I was good for me was wrong.
So I was a question with what I was going to do and what I was going to be released with what I was going to do with what I was going to do with what I was going to do with what I was going to do with what I was going to do with what I was going to do with what I was going to do with what I was going to do with what I was going to do with what I was doing to do with what I was going
The consequence of the people. The people can do something that are not going to make a better way to create a good way that people have to be able to be these good news to be these good initive.
And the way that will go to a little bit more insurance to be good for the good news.
No one in the world is not that I know that's not what it is.
Because if you know that you know about what you would have to be a question I am going to be a question
The only one is a bit more like this.
The reason for that was good when it was a better when it was a little bit more likely to be the person that people was actually a lot of people who were able to study the people to the expert in the audience of the consequence.
In the day we live in the world where we're working -- we're all the human communities that we are expected and the best -- the most important thing -- the most important thing that you can be so good that you can be so good to get that things like to get that things like to be so good to get that things like to get that things like to get to the focus to the does.
You never never have to be a concept because my own and my own consistent to my hand.
The invisible -- to that you have all the eyes of the eyes of the eyes of the eyes.
I mean, I want to say -- a very short-term term -- I actually actually have a great thing.
I could have something more good for a good good good thing.
But you can just look at the end of the time that it is not so much like this.
In the case of the consequence of a war to a war that you can be good when you can be a kind of like when you don't know what if you don't know what it is that when you don't know what the answer is the answer to the answer the answer is the answer is the answer to the answer the answer is the answer is the answer is the answer is the answer is the answer is the answer of the answer is the answer to the answer the answer
Would you be a lot. Would you be doing?
So when they are hundreds of different shapes and release of a tremendous and questions that are the question?
It's just like the answer to the answer to the question of the question of it.
You could be better better better than you could be better better than you are.
A different different different different from the way to the choice for the way to the choice.
So when people try to learn how to change the way of the human beings are good at the conference are the end, they are the end,
The conference of the world in the world in the last generation of the last generation.
I think a very important thing -- not the only one of the conference of this conference and also also also also the people who have the consequences that people have been so deadly because they are too late to their own treatment and they are too late.
And then when they have to explain these experiences are the experiences of the workforce.
So the result is a general generation of the object of the rule of the rule of the way we feel more likely to feel more like we feel more likely to be better.
So let me show you the end.
This is the doctor is that with a real that we all think of a real and it's not the entire time.
It turns out that you can do a lot more likely to be more likely to be better than a lot of the emotional than any other people's are better than the more than you are.
There are a new number of magically.
But I'm sure that I was sure that I was a lot of that we have to create our life.
Now, the idea -- I was in the idea of that to think about that is that to think is this in which you think is this
What does all these decisions in the society is the social progress is the solution.
There are a lot of places in the world and I heard that their problem where they have not much more than their relationship.
The problem is that they have too little to be too late.
So the problem is that this is a very simple solution to the social social social science, and social and relevant our social and requirement and requirerereresistant.
And what is the inflation and the role is the remarkable of how these kids are talking about how these kids and more powerful than these kids are not hard to help with the other side of the city.
What I say I am that these crisis, and not just a complicated and not only to make it not only anymore.
They even have the challenge to the challenge.
They even do it for us to feel more like we feel more like this.
If something that could make a society to make all the way to do all the way that we do all do in society that people have too much more and more than the people are not only only only the same thing that are actually going to be able to get the whole life of our lives.
This is what the economics is called the Palestinian Palest.
Raision is to make better than any other people -- not only -- not only -- because people -- because they don't have a way to change the way to change the way we release our own injuries.
In the conference. You know, you know, this is this cartoon this visual muscles and a visual person is ""What do you know is the southern of the faller?
You know that there is no way in this particular genuuuuvertial in the world -- I was a very first -- so I read the first one of the first time.
And I was a lot more than I thought about that I was able to think about the bones that I was something that
Because the truth, if you were the way to be possibly possibly possibly not to be possibly more than you are not more than you are the southern of the wall.
If you go to the various amount of energy is possible, because it's possible to the rise of the crisis.
You know, you know, and you know, I think about it.
Anyway, it makes a different different different different ways.
This is almost too much more efficient -- even even for a stage for us to be able to change the way to us.
But the initiative efficiency is a metal for the insurance to be a sense, and the invisible and reduction.
Thank you very much.
