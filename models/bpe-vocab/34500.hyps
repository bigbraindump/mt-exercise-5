And last year, we showed these two two diamondance to demonstrate that polar polar that was the police that the main was the size of the last three million years ago was a little size of a small march of the marine of 40-percent of it.
But this mormorning, because of this specific issue because it doesn't show the gross.
The police is in a way of the body that the heart of the climate system, the global system.
It was extended to the top and the contract.
The next slide that I will show you is going to be a quickly quickly on what happened in the last 25 years.
The pemancy is the mark is the mark with the smell.
As you can see the blue of blue inche.
This is the anual for the year.
And it turns out the summer.
This is how the guy's guy's flew for a five-year-old or more than you can see is almost as the blood flow in a body.
In 25 years he went from this to this --
This is a problem because the inquote death of the death of the ocean around the ocean.

And a reason is that enormous "words" is the Groenland is Groenland in the north of the north of the north of the north of the north of the north is that a lot of this is that this enormous "words" is that a huge "words" is that a whole "words" is the Grooms of the sun is Gro
This is a race that was all over the year.
But the volumes are much bigger than that.
This is the Kangerlerussuade Groenland.
If you want to know how the creative crew the stage of the sun is where it is the place where it gets a big place.
These debate growing very quickly.
And at the other end of the plant, Antarctica of the world's largest planet.
The last few scientists reported the rest of the continent of the continent is the negative balloon is the negative Antarctica lot of the island of the insult of the insult of the insult of the island of the scientists on the island of the scientists have reported in the entire world is reported as well.

And in the day, this guette is the source of the water.
The fact is growing up.
But when it happened, so that it was happening,
In California was a 400 percent of the Sierrrand in Sierra.
This affects the water's reserves water.
And the predictions, as you read and they're serious.
On the whole world of the uscaught to a dramatic creative creative creative credit of incentives of incentidies.
And disasters on all the world grew up with a graduate rate with the most most extraordinary and the fall of the precedence.
And for four times more in the last 30 years of the 75 years of the 75 years of the 75 year.
This is a completely unsustainable model of sustainable.
If you look in context you can see what happens.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of carbon dioxide in the carbon dioxide every 24 million tons in the ocean.
Up to the stage of the rest of the Pacification of the Pacific, and every part of the Indian where a radical network of the oxygen of the oxygen of the oxygen in the ocean.
The biggest because the single single single global warming global warming, which is the remote of the fossil of fossil fuels.
The Petror is a problem and the best thing is serious about the most serious one.
The United States is one of the two big emits,
And the proposing was to build a lot more factors.
But we start to see a change.
Here are the people who anulated in the last few years with the ecological alternative to be removed to the same way.
However, there was a policy in your own country.
And the carbon industrial industry and oil was spending a billion dollars in the last year of the last year in the last year of calendary.

Thank you very much.
Last year at TED I did a LHC.
And I promised to give you a data about how this works on the device of how this device.
So this is my job, and for those who didn't have been here, LHC is the biggest scientific experiment that was the largest 27 kilometers or is the 27 kilometers or is to recreate the presence of a billion times more than a fraction of a billion of seconds -- the whole thing -- the panel of the second of the universe -- the panel -- the panel of the universe.
It's extremely as well.
This is the device under the Geneva.
We make photographs of these minds "Big Bang" in the decades.
I work on this. It's called the ATLATLAS -- Lunged 4,000 feet of 22 feet photograph of the ATLS here is the show of ATLS here in the building of ATLALS will see the proportion of the ALS is in the building of the ATLALS is TLAS detector.
On the 10 seat 10 year we went on the first year.
And this picture was the ATLAS --
He caused a great famine to the road room.
It's a picture of the first particle that has gone that has gone through the LHCH, cooking the LHC system is a part of the LHC deliberate in the detector.
In other words, when I saw that 10 words, I knew that the seven, I knew that the device is a huge success.
I don't know if that was the greatest guilty or this, when someone went on the Google and saw the first page of the first page of the same.
It means that I did a cultural impact on the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the man.
And then about a week of a week with the device, which actually had to do these days, that he had to do with the golden fighting gold.
Those are fighting 13 million of the ampons of the motor of the power.
Now, engineers in the room, and we say, "Not can transport the amphip of the amps. They are being.
But I can do that when they're at temperatures are getting sicking up with the superconductive of the superconductive bedles.
So as a 271 degree of the star, and the spot of the stars, those fires can transport the board of the state.
At one of the laws of the laws of the LHC, was a LHC, was a factory of factory in the Port.
So that the company was sicked a little bit of the 13 thousand and and of the 13 of them resisted electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressive, that you know, the magnets that are being sicking over 20 tons and moved to 30 centimeter and it's about 30 cents.
So I was deteriorated about 50 magnetic math.
We had to take it out of what we have to do.
I reconvicted all of them, I repairy.
And now we take magnetic in the subteran.
He was at the end of his marvelous marvelous LHC will be like new LHC will be like new again.
We're going to start with again, and we get to get this data in the iunited and we're going to keep the research tools that are the basic basic elements of the universe.
Now, of course, that is in a way, those accident accident of science and engineering the signals and engineering the extreme to be a reject. It's usual.
I think that it is so much of difficult, because of the fact that we have young insects as LeaC.
I'm going to leave that in the worst of scientists, Humphrey Davy, who I think -- when I think about the earth or the protected experiments of protected the other people who are not danger for human minds to the human emotion of our minds for human minds are not for our minds are finding human beings are not finding human beings in our minds are not in our own fairly natural philosophy, and as we are not fine."
Thank you.
I wanted to start with the rugly reminded you of the childhood, when you play with the box.
And on the magic you invent them to get them and get them to go and cool them and you actually learn how to get to solve the smart issue and shape and share.
The spot of the spatial is deeply to how we understand a lot of the inconclusion.
So in the quality of IT initiated IT inspired by this kind of physical interactions with the physical objects, and my collaborator with my own consultant and my colleague, and I started to go into this unit -- we would start to go through this unit -- if we use a computer, in this unlike the computer that would be able to do with a mouse of this unemployment of the digital disorders that if we can be so much more usually die and we could be so uplow,
Would we like that?
The question was so fascinated by the fascinating we hot the research, we would have the trial to build Sweet Sttable to research.
In a short, a Siftable is a interactive computer of a biscal biscket of a bism.
They can be manufacturer -- they can be perceive the law of the reef, and a radio of the other one and a wireless of the sun.
The most important is that they're palpable, like the game, you can just move them as a mission as I miss just just applying them.
And Siftours the example of an ecosystem new manipulation of the digital manipulation of the digital digital digital digital information.
On the magic of what these tools become more palpable, more and the conference of the other, and it is the active of the nutrients of our nutritions and funded new active of internel to interact with new styles.
I'm going to start with simplicity.
This Sifting is confident to introduce the video, and if you include it in a direction, if you can put it in the other part, it is a little bit of the movie, it turns out to the back.
These portraits are constantly constitutes of each other.
So if I put them one langer, they become interested.
If they're unconscious, they will not, and this is going to be a little confused and it was a little confusion.
You can also feel the mission and inclining.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of interactions that we can use the shadow of obises that we can use the data, as we would have to take a color as we have to get a cold of a cold liquid of the liquid of the very interesting implication.
In this case, we have three Siftapes like the voyeeth and can use the torn in the center of the center, where they will fit in the center of the center, where they will be amected.
If we were too much, we can get the road.
There are also interesting possibility for education, as if you were playing games and logical sense, mathematics and the possibility of trying to figure out the things that quickly can see the results in the immediately and see the results immediate results in the immersion of the education,
So here I -- this is a Fibonace, which I do with a simple program that I do with a simple program for equations.
Here we have a game game game game of the words, a combination of the Scrabs and Boggles.
And so in each one of the first first one of the first Sifttable, and the magic of what words, they are very great, and they are grew with a dictionary, they are grew with a dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds of the letter of the letter of letting a new set of letting new letter and new possibility of the sky.
Thank you.
These are the kids who came to the Science came to the Media, and I had to go through and reached them and filmed a material.
He loved them to craft.
And one of the interesting aspects of this apply is that you don't have to give people a lot of instructions.
All you have to say is "F" is "F" and they know exactly what to do.
This is the people are cative people who are inking out.
This is the most tanker testing in our right right in the right right in the right.
It turns out that all wanted to do was to do was to do the Siftable to do one over the other.
So for him were just a cuber.
This is a disappointed of interactive animal.
We wanted to build a instrument for those who invent language.
And this is Frenrench
He can introduce new characters in the stage of the Swe'd just put these Stretreet persons.
This is where the soarrivered.
Video: The Serror.
David Merrill: Now he introduced a stage in the stage of the scene.
Video: The portrayer portrain
Very yeah.
Mis-when Stable and assigned one of the langal-and he can make the person's person's person's person, Video: Ham!
DM: I create the narrative.
Video: Huna!
DM: It's a story with open-up story. And he decides how it will be debate.
Video: The Zboard.
DM: The last example I would show you today is a tool of created and interpretations and interpretation and interpretty, and where we built the role of the sounds of sounds like the sounds of sounds like the role would be race and all the baggas and all of the sounds that we would look at the same time.
Each of these four different variations that you want to use it.
And you can inject the sound of a succession that you can get the same thing you want.
The sound coming up the sound touch Sweet Sweet Star Stttable of success.
There are effects that you can control the lights, like the movie, and the filter and the filter and the filter of the filter.
You can see it in a certain sound of sound, and then including it to help it to help it it.
It works like the general effects like the football and the volume that is applying the insects of Helse's going to see it.
Video: The man started with a rhythmed in the second Street in the second Street, we were thrown in a serious amount of a serious rhythm.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: DM: Now I add a few danger of the danger of the danger of the footprint.
Video: MM: And now I'm going to add the movie, to control the movie.
Video: MM: I can tell the inclining of inclining in a part or another.
Video: Now I'm going to leave the bill of bill for a band-presentation.
Video: MM: I can do do the second while the quantity.
So you don't have to do the plant, can be improvise, pre-long buying songs or short song in the word;
Now, in the end, I can get to use the second of the Swe'd use of the Swescscscscscscscale.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is my passion is the creation of new interfacts that we are better with our brain, and our body as our body and our body as our body and our body as well.
And today, we had time to show you a coordination of this new spatial of design, and some of the possibility that we try to get out of the lab that we were trying to get out of the lab in the lab of the lab to show them in the lab to show you a coordination of this new spatially to show you a coordination of this new spot of this new spatial spatial of the world that we were to do in the way to take them in the lab.
The Ganda was like to retina is like we are the new generated by this new general tools with the miror of the digital printing of the world in our rules of the rule of our rules of our rules of the rules of our rules.
Thank you very much.
And this is the nerabundance to talk to you all of you.
I'm writing.
He wrote the book is my teacher, but it's more than that.
It's all my mother, and fascinating love and fascinating.
And I'm not going to change that is to change it.
But this was like, like, something like strange in the life was my career in my career and in my career that determined me to remove to work with work.
And the thing is that I wrote this book, this is that the book "Manannae Mananca, Rageste," which is the cross-in-the-in-in-in-in-and-a-a-ranging world for a reasoning that is so important to a very important international signal of the world that is an international mega-sensational method.
The result is like everywhere I go now, people are treated to the people that they were convicted to be a confused to be a connoted;
Serosopopposite -- the connote!
Would you be ingrights, and you say, "You don't know is the theme is your theme that you never have any passensend your passensensensense?
Don't you want to write your life as your life that he was going to take the time a book that you ever have a book that you ever have a book that ever se?"
It's very linking -- it's really cool.
But it was also more likely to be the same thing that we were going to be 20 years ago, when I was starting to marriage -- I want to become written by the same thing -- I want to become writing, I had the same thing that kind of African reaction on a kind of Africa's taught as a Africaway.
And people said to me, "You don't have any theme that you never had any of success?"
Don't you know that humility will kill you do?
You don't know that your fear of life in this field of life in this field and nothing will be going to be in here and you can get a filled of the mouth of the filled of the green of the screen?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the short -- the question is "Yese."
Yes, you get the theme is the theme of all of those things.
And it always was it.
And you feel like in the bound of other things that people are not going to die that people can die.
As an example of the marvely, and other things that are cross.
But when it's about the work I was always the thing I thought about what I was like, "Who is "Who is "Who is "why?"
Is it a rational?
It's logic to get that they were to do that they were destined to do this is destined to do this Pamt.
And what is so special about the specific initiatives that seems like we are truly in the healthy health of a human health in a way that other teachers don't do it?
My father was my father was the chemistry and I don't remember you in the 40 years of you have the chemical engineering of the chemistry of a chemist engineer to be a chemist engineer to be a chemist.
It wasn't happened, how John, how does the block in the chemical?
It's just not just happened.
But that we are honest, chemists, as group group is not too many of the reputation of reputation of reputation to be alcooling manipulaction of the manipulaction of the manipulaction of the chemicals.
We are writing this reputation, we have this reputation, and not just writing all the same artists, but it turns out that this reputation to be powerful in the real way to be powerful in the human to be very strong.
And all we have to look at the numbers of death the numbers just by the main the 20th century, in the 20th century, which died by young people and often died by young people and often often often often often died by young people and often often often often often eat is to look at the room.
And even those who didn't have their own own would be truly to be truly with your own own lights.
Norman Mailer, even before I did, he said that he said that "Every first of my carts" took me a little bit more than my cart."
A great great great great teaming of a life.
But we don't clear the time we hear somebody on somebody telling you that we heard that things like so many times and somehow many times and somehow we have the collective and the suective and the suit of the creative and suffer, the idea of how the creative is going to be able to the end of the suffer and that shows the suffer will always lead to a sense of that.
And the question I want to give you all of this today is all the impact of all the impact with this idea?
You can comfortable with it -- as as if you can see the library of the library of the library of this is the ipocket with this ipocket of the base of the bed.
I think it's a lot.
And I also think it's dangerous dangerous and I didn't want to see in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage to try.
And I know that I know in my case, in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to go to this one of the ipocket of this ipocket in which I find out the teaching of the ipocket now
For example, I'm pretty tank, I just have a 4-year-old for 40 years.
We probably have been in the work of the work of the work of work in the workers.
And it's very likely to do the point of all the moment of the human categories of human being being being judged by my last year after my own childhood of my last career, right?
What would be to say is to mention for the people here we are the friendship of the people here we are all the biggest successful of my biggest successful to be happened.
Oh, Doh, God, what sham!
This is the kind of gas that could be able to look at the time to fill it up to the nine in the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I want to do in the continue this message that I love it.
And then, the question becomes a lot, the question is:
And so it was filling a lot of meditative -- that manians have to work now, to try to keep me now, is by trying to make a kind of psychological construction, right?
I had to be in a way to find a way to get a distant distant that he write, and my father who was writing, and my father would be in the law that will be in the way that he was written by what he written in what he written in the way to what he wrote in the way to what he written a way to do it.
And as I always looked in the last year in this sense, I started to look at the time, and I tried to find other society and I could have better ideas and healthy and healthy even better ideas about how to be helped people be helpful to be helpful in emotional risk of how to create emotional risk of emotional risk of the risk of the risk of the risk of the risk of the risk of the risk of the society to see the way of thinking of how to make other society to be able to make better than what
This is what this is led me in Greece, and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma research.
So you know, you get the circle.
But in the time Grection and Roming Rome, and it didn't believe that people don't believe the creativity of the human being in the human inside of the human inside the human inside of the human inside of the human inside of the human beings of the Grection and the return to the Romen and the Rome.
People thought that creativity was a spirit was a spirit that the people in a source of people in a source and unintelligence and unintelligent reasons and unintelligent reasons.
The solutions were called these spirits creative creativity, "No-propelling terms.
Socratic was famous because he had a demon which is a demon that the wisdom of the wisdom of department.
The human were the same pells, but they were called the imattribute that creative creative --
What is great, because the romantic noymous was a genius was a very strange of destiny.
They think a genius was a kind of magical entity in the magnificent entity of the walls of artist's walls, in a way like Dobby, the sweet and the innitably assistance of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the workers of the workers of the workers of the workers of the workers of the workers of the workers of the workforce.
Abled, this is the fact that this is the distant that is the distant that I was talking about the result of your workers to protect your workers to protect your works.
And all the world has been working so good, right?
So the artist was protected by some of the things that too much narcision, right?
If your work was straluce, you can't have the whole world for her, you know, the whole world as you had this genius that has helped the body that helped us to do it.
If your work was critical, it wasn't completely the window, it was not good.
Everybody is all your genius was kind of ignorant was about ignorant.
So they looked at people in the West creative for a long time.
And then came to Rened and everything was change, and it was a certain idea of magic as the main is to put the human universe on all the way to the person and mysteries on all the way to the stmystery of the still, that I get out of the disordance of the disappeared.
It was the skier beginning, and people started to create the creative that creativity was coming with all of the individual in the individual individual in the individual in the individual world.
And for the first time in history in history of people have started to refer to one or other artists in order to get a genius in a genius.
And you have to married, I think that was a huge error a huge error not.
The box, a simple person to create a person or it is actually the receptor is actually the receptor and the synthesis and the synthesis and the synthetic wise, creatively fear is a little too much of the human being.
It's like you have a safe to get the wide of the sun.
It's just about incotton and they fit and genered, and it is that all these inimaginable astewelfish on the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of it.
I think that pressure that this is killed artists, one of the last 500 years.
And if I think that is, the question is, what do you do it?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we go back to the older sends of the relationship between people and mysterious and mysterious myself.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't just know 500 years of sure that the rational human beings with a rational speech of 18 minutes.
And probably that is that there would be people in the audience that would raise to be graduated from the theme in fact, who are actually going to get people into their projects over and over their projects over the projects over and over time.
It probably probably doesn't want to go to this idea.
But the question I want to ask is -- why don't I mean -- why not?
Why don't we think about this?
Because it has sends as much more than anything else I've heard about in terms of the completely unknown as the creative as the creative as the creative of the creative process.
It has been to be able to create something -- basically all the people here -- you know, the whole thing that it doesn't always behavior always has the behavior always has the rational rational ratial.
And in fact, sometimes it can seem to be the strength of the right paranormal.
And I had a re-inniece, where I met the American Ruth Stone, who now has been in the jewels that was 90 and that was the bridge of the entire Virginia and that he told me when she was a little bit of the Virginia and just felt the camera and he just heard a poet and it feels and just heard a poet and it just heard a poet of the room and just heard a poet of the room
The story as a vast of the sun of the same.
And it was the fish of the camps.
The idea was coming up because you have galls falling the fish under the legs.
In that moment he had a single thing that is, and that is, "To put it on the applat."
And he running the age of the urgent houses, and the whole idea was to get a piece of map and a piece of map and he had a long way to go through it and he had a lot of it on the math.
Sometimes it was not enough enough to run the way and running and running and running and running in the house, and the poems and the person would lose the time and the person would lose continue to the root of the roots of the room, I read "another poet on his shelf.
They were also the moments in which -- and this is not going to look at the story that he was almost losing the story that almost lose.
The whole whole house, and the main and the poems and the cars and the narrative that the nurse of his own demand he was deleated by the other way to the other man's demanded and he had the other man's demand,
The bridge of the coat and then the body and then he pulled it in the main the main of the main the math.
So in the situation, the poems of perfect and intact and unless and unexpected the last worse at the first worst worst worst worse at the first words.
When I heard it -- it's just the surprise, it was just how my own creative process.
My creative process doesn't limitate to this -- I'm not leak!
I'm a catching up, and the way I work in the same day and you can go to the same way and you can track and move wrong.
But even I was like, in my own housing, and I was so much of that phenomenon.
And I imagine that the same was the same of you.
And I had the ideas or ideas that were coming from a source that I don't know about a source that I don't know it.
And what is all the right thing about that?
And how do we support that we should report us so to get our minds to do our minds and the right thing to help us reach to help us the remote to report our remarkable to help us to report our reporters to help us report to report.
For me, the most relevant example of how we have to do about how the music can do is do the music of Tom Waits, we took a look at the demand in the demand in the demand in the demand in the demand in the demand in the demand in the demand in the whole day that we can do about how it is the music that we can do is make the music of how it is the musician
I was talking about this subject and all of this was almost all about his own contemporary artist in the modern artist of Chinese artist artist in order to control these these incontrol impulsout and gestablished creative impulsout of the creative impulses out of the creative impulse of the town of the toviet.
And with the time he was linking up the story of the story as a day that he was going on the basis of the Los Angeles and then everything was change.
And as I lead to a little bit of a short page that comes in a piece of the mind that comes in minds and magnificent and magnifty and a little bit of injury, it's not about it, but it has no way to do it is -- but it doesn't have a little bit of it.
It has no creation of making, no creative reporter reportop.
It was all the time that the old old old man in the rainfoundly fear and the song of the money for always is to get me for the time.
I'm not enough to remind, a nine to reveveveveve."
And instead of getting into the panick, it just stopped it.
He stopped the whole process of the trick and all this again.
He raised the question and said, "You don't see that they're not at volan?"
"You know, you might write a channel?
If you really want to be able to be in a moment of a moment of you in a moment of you.
If you don't take your fear and you get to angry.
Give it to Leonard Cohen."
The creative processes has been changed by this.
It doesn't operate to be on the same way that it was always as well.
But the process of this, and it was the whole thing that he took the time around it, and he had the gone that he took the mouth and he just took the way to get back to the road and then it was to go back and forth where he was going to be something that he has no China.
It could be this unique collaboration and the bizarre in the form of a conversation between the extent and the extent of the Toman and the human being.
And after I heard the story of the story I started to change a little way that I was working on a data.
This approach me saved when I was to be the middle of the "Manana, Ragest, Iubest, and I was in a kind of a way that we all go to something that we are looking at something that we don't look at the most of you might think that it was a disaster to think that it would be a disaster to be a received that he would ever write.
Not just that, but the most proposing that he never never had before.
I had to think that I should just be abandoned the project.
And I remembered to me all talking to the hospital and I tried to do it.
We raised it on the manuscris and I brought my comments a collect of the room in a cold of the camera.
I said to vote with voice and I love that if you can know that if this book is not just the great thing to be just the great thing to be just the great good?
Because you can see that one of the battle all I want to see the battery I don't know.
So if you want to be better than you want to do your device and you have to do the job.
Okay. And if you don't do this, you know, you know, naid all of it.
A will write to write my message because this is my message.
And I want to consuffer for me today that I took my trens."
Because -- the Conclusion is -- by hundreds of years in the North African people would have had to be able to get the moon the dances and music, and the music, and the music, and the music, and the sacred the music, and the sacred to the race.
And they were always wondering, because dance the dancers were the teacher and were remarkable, right?
But sometimes very roughly something happens, and one of the fact that the fact that the real song in the community.
I'm sure you all know what I mean is, because all you reference you see it, a particular moment, a particular moment, so that you all the interpretation.
It's like the time it stops and the dancers is by a kind of ports, deserve not anything differentiated with the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 ser,
It doesn't seem to be in the whole thing that was in the human being.
It's lighting, and it is liked by the bottom of the fire of the fire of the fire of the fire of the fire of the same.
And as I was when they were trying to get what was called the number.
They were the hands and they were going to get the "Allah, Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, Gamh, Game, Game, Game, Game, Game, Game, Leah, mother, Gamh, lah, lah, lah, lah, lah, lah, lah, lah, lah, lah, lah, lah, lah, lah, lah, lah, lah, lah, lah, Leah, Al
It's God.
A interesting among historical historical historical -- when the main Spany, they had taken this in Spanish and the pronounced in the "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, yer, "Leather" in the Ooll, oll, older."
and they hear the time of fight with the tails and dancers and dance.
In Spanish, when a interpret and he returned something impossible and magic was smile, the old, the magnificent "Allaw, the art."
The unintelligence -- a God buzza.
It's great, because we need that.
But the point comes up the second day in the morning, when the dancers is that the martia, is a is a sea in the morning, and it's not a sclipire of the Diff.
It's a diver that walking is and that you could not be more and you might not be more injured to be more in-to-time.
Would it be no longer invoice when he was the name of the Doms when he was supposed to be doing with the rest of his life with his rest of his life in his life with his rest of his life in the rest of the lives of his life in the rest of the name of the Domanoman of the Domanis that he could do it with his named the Doms of the Domnam to do with the
It's hard.
It's one of the most painting of the most painting in creative life.
But it may not be a lot of a lot of if you don't have the most extraordinary part, as the most extraordinary parks come from the most extraordinary of your life come from the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the world.
Maybe if you just thought that you were improud of a cave of a long time of life in the lives of the life of the life of the life of the life of the earth had data in the next stepped of the customed.
If we think that all start changing.
I started thinking about my fear and I thought in the last months of the last months of the last months that will be published in the book that will be publishing and crisis, dangerous and cross-cross-cross-cross-advanced of my success and the cross-advicage of the success of the success of my success of the success of the success of
And what I did was repetition, when you lose the cure is: don't be a the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-tech -- what I was doing, you know, what I was going to do with it.
It would not be the spreading of the Contintiny the Contintiny the Contintin.
If you look at the dance, then dancing.
If the gene comes and the center of what you do is repair decisions to leave you to get the extraordinary of your extraordinarily fear through your efforts -- then the "le!"
And if not, dancing anyway.
And with all of the word "bad."
I think we should have to teach them.
"Oh!" for you, you just because you have a load love for human beings and the headquarters and the headquarters to participate in continuous time.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We talked about some of these projects, about the human genome and what could be able to do is really interesting, and what could be the very interesting set of new genes.
Now we start with a new point in a new point of biology, and now we're going to try to get this digital code from this digital code of biology, and we go into a new flowing and synthesizing force and synthesizing force and synthesizing force and synthesizing force and synthesis of life.
We tried to do all the time to ask us to do the big questions.
"What is life?" It's something what I think many biologists tried to understand the variety of variety of levels.
We tried different approaches, simplicycle to the basic components.
We already widely almost 20 years.
When I sequenced the human genome ome to went from the analogical world of biology in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world.
Now we're trying to ask for the question, can we regenerate new forms of life, or we can create new forces in this digital digital digital university in this digital universe of this digital universe of this digital universe,
This is the map of a little organism of genitalium, who has the most genome for a species that the most of the species that can replant to the single lab in the lab.
We tried to see if we can actually come with a genome and smaller genome and smaller and smaller one.
We were able to assume that we had a hundred genes in the judge of 500 that are there.
But when we look at his metabolic map is pretty simple, it's pretty simple, it's pretty simple.
So I think it's simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can just get the first time is a little bit likely that that that's a little bit of life.
So we decided that the only way before is to stand synthesis, we can synthesis, so we can get the stage of the most fundamental components to reach some of the most fundamental components of the most fundamental questions.
And so I started to start the state, "Can we synomom?"
Maybe the chemistry allowing these synthesize these very big molecules that we never ever did before?
And if we can actide a cross-cross-it?
A crosis, by the way, it's just a little bit of chemical.
So our speed to digital life grew up to a exponential rhythm-exponential rhythm-rhythm-rhythm to digital divide the speed of our speed to digital divide.
Our ability to write code code code is moved by the beginning, but it was growing up.
The last time he went to a exponential curve to a nancient curriculum.
I started this 15 years ago.
We went through a few etheless, and in fact, with a bio-et-et-et-et-et-et-et-based experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis of the DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of carrying the world that are doing little DNA bunch of DNA long enough of 30 to 50 letter a generative process, so what you build a long piece of the longer, so what you can do is a little bit more than the one of those who are doing.
So we had to create a new way to put these little little bits together and the right of the error.
This was our first tentative of the digital information of the digital genome of the Nide Phi X 174.
It's a little virus that killed bacteria.
We made the kindness of the kindness of the errors, and I got a molecule of DNA DNA DNA DNA by 5,000 letters of DNA
The interesting thing was when I took this piece of the chemical material, and I put it in bacteria, and the bacteria, and the bacteria, and the bacterial code, and to make the virus that the virus is the types of virus.
The viral Particular Partics and then released out of the cells and they have come back.
I was talking with the oil industry of the cure of the curriculum of the rainforest.
They have laughed more than you.
And so we think that's a situation where the software can build their own main can build their own biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger
We wanted to build the whole cross-no-tech of a bacteria.
This is over 58,000 letter of genetic code.
So we wanted to put the letter of letting the little bit of the virus to the size of the size of the size of the size of a vil cells.
The design is critically critical, and if you start with digital information in the computer of that information has to be very accurate.
When I sequenced this genome in 1995, the assumption was a south of a 10,000 payments of 10,000 payments of the basic basis of the basic basic basis of the basic basic basic basic basic basic basic basis of the genome in 1995, the genome of this genome in the genome of the genome in 1995, the Science was a wisdom of the precision.
We found it was removed to remote the 30 errors. If we were used to be activated in the original of the original sequences.
The book is the design is the design of the kindness of 50 letter that has to be a little bit of all the other 50 letters of the other 50 letters to build the smaller sub-skills to be compatible to be compatible with each other.
We create unique elements of unique elements
You may read that I put "the mark" in the house. Give you a genetic code, we have a genetic code, we have a four letter letter: The T.
Trike in those letter letter the codiet of about 20 recently noticed a literature -- a single letter literally all the amino acid.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, the proposes, the proposes, the proposes, the circle of the footprint.
And all of the things I've done was to be shown the code.
Some of them were disappointed that it's not poetry is poetry and out.
We designed those little little bits so that we can determine was with enzymnes.
They're also the enzymes and they are done.
So we started doing the joy of the ke, starting with five to these six letters of them 24,000 letters of them 24,000 letters of these 24,000 lets the rest of these in the same way to 700.
Every peak we flew these pieces of abundant to sequence the sequence to fight the sequence of the fire we try to create a very red process.
We are trying to get to get to that automatization.
So this shows like a baskets.
When we get to the very big pieces, over 100,000 payments of the basic basic basic basic in E.
It turns out all the same modern biology of the biology of modern molecular biology.
So we went to other hand.
We knew that there is a mechanism called recombination of the biology that biology is using DNA that biology is using DNA that DNA is also a piece of DNA that is a piece of it.
This is an example.
There is a organism called Deincoccupy radio that can seem to be the radiation of radiation.
As you can see in the cross of the cross is is is destroyed.
12 hours to 24 hours later, he took again again again and again as it was to start again.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be delay.
They can live in living.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the extreatment, to move into the extreatment, to go a new environmental environmental environmental environmental environments.
In fact, NASA showed that this was going to happen there.
Here's a micrograph of a molecule that we built using these procle -- actually using these procolored law with the design of the pieces that we have put in the market.
Drojan automotive put together in the automatically
This is not a picture of the microscope with electronics, but a whole whole whole of micrography.
It's so a big molecule that we can see a microscope of the optic.
These are college in a period of about six seconds.
This is a published published a little bit of time.
These are over 5,000 letters of genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever made people, with a definition.
It has a molecular molecular molecular in the world.
If we put it with a 10 and without the space of 10 pages of the page of the genetic code, you know, 142 page of genetic code,
So how do we start a cross-gravy?
And the fact that with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
And then it also easy easy when you get to eucroughly your nuclear -- you can just take the nucleus and put it together, and that's something you all heard -- cloning.
With the chair, the cross is is integrated in the cells, but we showed that we can make a split of a completely cromosome, at a completely cromosome, and we can activate it.
We had a chance of a microbial species.
These are the second as people as people and the same.
We added a few genes in the plus to be able to select this cross-man.
We had deleded them to kill all proteins.
And it was pretty amazing, when we put in the cell -- you will appreciate our very sophisticated -- and cross the cross went into the cell.
In fact, we thought that this is how far it can work, but we tried to design the process of something more than that.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We all kinds of species that have been corporated by a second crosis, or a second crosis, or a third of the tree, or a new feet, thousands of new characteristic new characteristic new characteristics in a second.
So those who think about evolution just as a single gene of changing a moment of biology.
They're called the enzymnic restrictions that were delay.
The phromosome, which was not a cell not a lot.
The cross -- the cross we put new --
It was exposed to be the other cross-cross-cross-material, and so we just got it with the cross of the cross of the cross of the cross of the cross of the cross of the cross of the cross-received and he was finally and he was finally and he was just the other crosomes of the crosome is to the crosome as well.
It became blueprint because of genomosome.
And after a very short time of the characteristics of a species of a species of a new basic species, and it was a new basic specimen, and he put in the cell that we put in the cell that we put in the cell.
All proteins were changing, membranes were changing, the membranes -- when we put the genetic code, it's exactly what we transferred in the genetic code,
This can soon as a genomic alchemistry, but we can move the DNA of DNA that we can change things pretty dramatically dramatically dramatic alone.
Now, I supported that this is not genesis, but it has been in three billion years and half years and a half years and we support that we can be a new version of the Middle Cambrion, where he has a new specific specifically based on the digital math.
Why do we do?
I think it's pretty obviously obviously about it.
We are on the way to go from six and a half to nine billion people over 40 years.
To put this in context for me to the framework, I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet, for each of us there were in 1946, in 40 years, in 40 years, in 40 years, will be four.
We have a fears, providing the water supply, drug and a half billion and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half of a lot of feet.
It will be difficult to do it for new.
We use over five billion tons of the book, more than 30 billion bars of oil bills of oil bills
This means a hundred million barils a day.
When we try to think about biological processes or any process that will be a lot of this to replace that will be a huge challenge.
And then, of course, it's all that CO2 is all the way that CO2 is going to go to the atmosphere.
Now, from our discoveries around the world, we have a data set of genes, and I love to think about these genes, and I love to think about these design design components in the future.
The electronics has just a doubt of the electronics of the component, and this is the diversity that came out of it.
We are limited here, first of all, a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have the technique of these kinds of synthesis, we call what we call the genic genic genicycle.
We have the ability to build a big robot that to make a million cross a day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of genes of different genes, or try to optimize the occupy proper capita and product of new pharmaceutical products that we can change a little bit of biology than the last 20 years of all the science.
And this is just a standard selection.
We can select for viable viable to viable fuel or fuel production and vaccines, the citizen vaccines, citizens of vaccines, the city.
This is a design capture. The design of a design that we work that we are going to be able to go and work on these species in the computer.
We know you don't necessarily know how it would show you.
We know exactly how they look at their genetic code,
Now we focus on the busters of the fourth generation.
You saw recently in the ethanol of the mixture is just a unmanaged to be a need-to-it.
We have the second fuel fuel of the second and the third and the third of the same thing that are soap to fly more valuable to fly more valuable in the peak or different shaped the canda or different shaped of the same.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without the food that has increases more than their limited production is if we start with CO2 as a math of the first time, and we think that we will have the first of the energy of this generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the fourth generation of the fourth generation of the fourth grade of the fourth of the fourth of the flow of the food of the flower product of the food of the food of the O2 in the CO2 and the CO
The solar and CO2 is a method -- but in our discoveries of our world, but in our discoveries we have all sorts of other way we have all sorts of other way of other method.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It goes into the deep ocean, about two kilometers and a half of the deep, and half the deep, and a fierbing.
The CO2 in metan use of metan used molecular that surround source of energy.
We are trying to see if we can take CO2 captured, which can be transported in the country, and converted to the CO2 back in the pocket to leap this way.
So in a short time we think we could have this kind of basic question, "What is life asking "What is life life life is life?"
We really know -- we have the objective of replacing the whole industry of oil industry.
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where another part.
So let me get a major source of energy.
But we also work now to use these same same sources to invent the same source of vaccines in the vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of the same way.
You saw this year with the blood and a year ago, we are always with a dollar in the mind of the right vaccine.
I think that situation can be changing vaccines of all the way before before you have any of the knowledge of any of the journey.
This is how it could start to show the future of changing the future of change, accelerating the evolution of the evolution of the dark evolution with bacteria and finally, eukario.
We're almost to improve people.
Our ability is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive pretty long enough to survive very long enough to be able to do this. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you first, it's a fundamental work of technology, a new technology that I brought to Microsoft to Microsoft as a year. This is a year. This is a year. This is a year. This is Sealoop.
It's a average that can interact with a lot of visual data in a lot of visual data of visual data in the early data.
We now look at a lot of gigabaid digital photographs and the saming continuous and just just just about it as a result of this, we can actually do it.
It doesn't matter how much information is how big data are these collights, how big images.
Most are made with a new new new new new digital camera, but this is a scanning of the Bible Bott: the 300 methods of the Mgapixels.
It doesn't have important because the only thing that should limited the performance of a system of a system of the monitoring of your monitoring at a very flow. It's also a very fly of a very flexible architecture.
This is a book in the injewelf, an example of non-imaginative time.
It's about "Caway." And he is the Charles Dickens. Each colored is a capital.
To show you is that it's about text, and not a imagine, we can do that is a real represent is a real positive remain a text; it's not a positive reach, it's not a position of a text; it's not a position of textbook,
Maybe this is an artificial way to read a book in electronic form.
I would not recommend it.
This is a word. It's a deal. It's a "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian of the Gardian of a sad of a sad word. This is a word.
Each image is the beginning of a sequence of a century.
This gives you the joy of a joke of a plant experiences of a revia or a revia or a revia in the environment that is inherent environment.
We did something little and we did something little to the collect of the "Gardian "Gardian in the Gardian of "Gardianned.
We created a false reclaim to a very larger -- much larger than any larger remote -- and I have a common account of a suit of a support.
If you want to see the properties of this car, you can see here.
Or other models, or even techniques.
And this really clearly through some ideas, the track of a monitor.
We hope that this would be sent to the bridge of the bees of the kind of dirty and others are not necessary.
Of course, the mapping is one of the things that we have to have this kind of like this.
I'm not going to tell you a long time on this, but just to tell you that we have contributed to this field of work.
These are all the road in the United States of the United States of NASA.
Let's go to a little bit else.
This is actually on the Internet acquis; you can see the verifire.
This is a project called Photosyne, which is the two different technologies. One of them is Sealololoon and the other side of the visual perception of the visual perception of the University of Washington, the novel, the flowing of the University of Washington, the frozen Severtle Severton, the U.
and Rick Szeliski to Cerki Microsoft. A beautiful collaboration of the beautiful collaboration of it.
So this is active on the Internet. Posity.
You can see that when we create these kinds of perspective, when we can navigate through images of imaging through many of the resolution in many solving solar in a lot of solving the resolution of the wild.
But the space arresting space shows the real images of these images that truly truth.
The other visual algorithms have recorded these images together, so that to cover the real space where these pictures of the Grases of the Grases of the Grases of the Grases of the Grases of the Grases of the projections of a projections or panelements or panorordemice.
I'm not sure if I was going to show you other environment.
There are some of the places that have much more space of space.
I'd like to go right to one of the original Noah -- this is doing a part of a long time in a long time of Photosynthetic Photosynthetic resistance of this technology, the technology of this technology, technology of this technology, the technology of this technology, the technology of this technology, it's not just vision, not just vising the projections that we put on the web.
We had to care about the law of law in the law --
This is a reconstruction of Catcolleague in the images of the images of Flickr. Does Flickr, and you find something like a little bit of a little bit of a camera in the room, and you find something that was found a picture that was found a picture that was found that the corere: the cover would find the coreoffers the coreoff.
These are the pictures on Flickr, and all of the space of space in this way.
We can just have to navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I would get to work at Microsoft is very measured to Microsoft is a price in a received in here.
I guess that you noticed that I'm a lot of the camera in the room of the camera in the cell phones at SLRs Leas in this environment.
If you can find that strange of these strange strangers.
There are so many mamms, fine of few, yet.
One will be a series of photography -- ieventually --
This is a poster with Novel Dams who was recorded right now.
You can be removed to a physicist environment.
The idea is that I can do some things with social environmental environmental environmental environmental data from all -- from a collective memory, collective memory, and interconnected to the Earth -- and interconnected them all those pictures were all the same same same things that is more emerging than the summer.
You have a model of what the entire Earth is all the Earth.
Think about that as long as the long as Stephen Lawler Stephen Lawler "Earth."
And this is growing in complexity as the world as we use the benefits of benefits as users are getting bigger as users as use.
The pictures are the ethiched with meters that somebody else else to go away.
If someone would eat all these sfinds and say who I am going to be who I am in the NAsk Ds would improve all these data, and I could use it as a signal experience of that space, to make it as a social experience.
And of course, a product product of all these are huge amounts of the green and the virtual models of the Earth, collecting the Earth, collecting the ground, and images of the village of the village and images of the village of collective and images in the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood correct, what will allow you to get a moment in the next few years, is that all the pictures of someone on the way that the photos of someone on the glob to be interrelation?
BAA: Yeah. What makes it really care is to be able to look at it.
It creates hyper-connected -- if you want, between the picture.
And it makes this basic basically, the cause of the images.
And this becomes a quick quote when you think about the significant information that they have those images.
As when you do a picture of the Internet, you know, you look at some words, and the Internet is a lot of the Internet gives a lot of information about what the picture is the picture of what the pose.
Now, what would be if that picture makes you connected all the pictures of all your picture?
And then the amount of signal interconnection and wealth that the box, which is a huge classrooms in the country.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible. Felics.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense plants of the intense of the dnography of the knife research, it's the chance of lights that they still feel the past, who feel the past, they still feel the past, who feel the last fish.
You don't know that the Jaguanthropy, we still want to go beyond Calley Lace, or the myths of the old lady of the Himalaia is to understand the Dharalay, or the Dharmful of Dharmy, it's not just to remember the world that we have no sense of the world that we live in a sense of the world that we have no sense of reality, but it's just a model of reality, it's just a model of reality.
The consequence of a certain set of decision-making decisions that our ancestors have to do their own generations in a lot of generations in a lot of generations.
And of course, we all share the same imperative adaptive.
We all are born. We all bring kids to the world.
We go through the initial ritual ritual ritual ritual rituals.
We have to do the separation of the dead, so we should not surprising us all the son, fly with the art.
But what interesting is the unique is the unique of songs in every culture.
Whether is that the Penor Borneo, or the Borneo, or the war of Voodoo in Haiti, or the West Kisland in the northern Kisisisland in the northern of the Curano of the Shai.
By the way, this is the guy that I traveling through the desert of the seven, or even a hour of the Col, Everest, the Switter pants, the Search of the world.
All of these people learn that there are other ways to be other ways to think about other ways to think other ways to think other ways to be able to think about the Earth.
And this idea, if you think about it, maybe not to kill you for hope to be human,
Now, the miridges of the world with a spiral of spiral life that the planet and cultural life that cover the planet, and it's as important for the biological health of the biological network as a biosphorus as a biosphory.
And you could think about this network of life as being the whole life as being the ethnic and you could define the suit of all dreams, the intuitive of the intuitive of the intuition of the conscience, the intuitive of the conscience.
Etnosphere is the magic of humanity.
It's the sympathy of what we can be as a surprising specific specifically as a specific specifically as a specific species.

I want to start with what I call "the doct."
Dock your own car.
The Dock's Dock's Western societies.
And this doctrofy sounds like this: if we are interested in maximum of the good citizenship level, the quarter of the citizen of the country.
The reason for this is so freedom is so good, the word, the word, the basic thing to be humanitories, essentially to be human.
And because if people are free and every one of us can acknowledge and do things that will be our good at the good news and our own own own place.

Then, I think, it's so good enough, that you wouldn't have to do anyone in the headque of the headque to put it into the sun to put it in the head.

175 snapped in the supermarket, that if we don't cook and the 10 different types of the dog and the 175 different types of the balance of the balloons that you can buy the eyes that you can buy their own own body in a very big amount of the 175 of the 175 that no matter in the same cash that the 175 that no matter how the fish is the village of the 175 of the 175 different types of of of different types of of of wise.
So it's the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronic component to make a stereo stereo -- the housin a hx, the housin the tophone, the feetophone, amplific.
And in this electronic stereotypes have a lot of the stereo.
We can can see six million and a half million and a different stereo of the components that are in the office of a single store.
You have to recognize that this means a lot of options.
In other fields -- in the world of communication.
It was a bed, when I was a kid, where you could get any kind of a young phone service like the Bell.
The next is the mobile phone.
By the way, one of the consequences of this was not restrictly never had flag in it.
And those days are a lot of apuse.
Now, we have a diversity of almost immediately nelse, especially in the world of mobile phones in the world of mobile phones in the world of mobile phones.
These are the mobile phone.

And if you didn't see it was not in the store, you can still stay in the store you in the room you can see it.
And the result is that it makes people to get out of the store, and put this question.
And you know what is the answer to the question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to buy a phone, that you don't know too much.
And in other domain of life that are much more important than bugs that are being buying the number of options.
The health system -- in the United States is not the case you are going to do with the doctor and you tell you what to do.
Instead, you know, you go to the doctor and says, "We have the various various of B.
It has these risk advantage and these risks.
Be has these risks and these risks. What do you want to do?
And you say, "Doctors what do you do?" And the doctor says, these advantage and these risks and these risks and the risks and the risks and the risks and the risks and curve the risks and curve.
What do you want to do?
And you tell you "But if you were in my place, you know, the doctor says, "But I'm not in your own place is not the place your patient is -- I tell them the patient is -- I tell them what it makes a thing.
But what is actually a transition of responsibility and decisions and decisions in the case of somebody who knows something -- in this case, and it's almost almost certainly and it's almost almost certainly not in the best form of disease, and it's not just as the best form of decisions.
There is a huge level of advertising to the reetal reaches that if you give me a little bit of me as you think a lot, because you can't buy them.
Why do we get narrative that we can't buy them?
The answer is that the people who do this is expected to be the doctors in the morning and we want to change our own remote to change our networks.
Something that our identity has become a problem of choices, and this is a role of the role of the role of show this.
And we don't change a identity of us is to have the possibility of it.
And we can reinvent any of the reinvent we have a check.
And that means that every day when you get you notice you have to decide what kind of person want to be there.
With all the respect for the marriage and family have been a eaten that he had to be able to get the way that the started to get the way you get kids as much as you get kids as much faster and then you start to have children as much fast.
The only option was with dinner, not when you do that with it.
In our days, all we are very very remote to us.
I give you incredibly intelligence students and give them 20 percent less than I was doing it less than I was doing it.
And that wasn't because it would be less deeply less than the magic would be less made.
You think they're concerned with all sorts of questions "You should be able to get married, or not?
I should be able to get later? You should have children or a carier?" All of these are questions that consumption you who consume you.
And they want to answer these questions, whether it means that if that means not to do all of the town that I don't take and not take a good note to the curves of my curves of my curriculum to the curve of my curves to me.
And this is also to do. These are important questions that you have to answer them.
The grandmother, as the bed, as the Carl and Carl and Carl with technology that allows us to work every minister in every mind, a little bit of every day in any place on the planet -- less than Hotel.
By the way, there's a corner of a cold, which we don't reveil anybody in which is working on the wireless of the wireless of the wife.
I will not tell you about it because I want to use it.
So that means that this incredible freedom to choose to choose to work, is that we have to take a decision, and again, again, and you have to do it and even though we should have to work and if we should have to work with.
We can go to see how our football and we have the mobile and we have the mobile in a pocket and the laptop, probably the laptop, probably the laptop, probably in the genes.
And even though all I have gone that you look at how the dog is moving a fitbbbbbble-to-to-day -- "Is we should answer this water?
You should be responding to this email? You should write the crowd of this letter is "Not not that the question is that the story of your little bit of your bank experience will be very different,
So in the orientation, big things and little things that are the things that are the starts of life, is a little bit of options.
And the world I was living about it.
To say that, I had some choices to do it, but it wasn't all a thing was a thing that was a thing that was a very bad thing.
And the world we live now looks at this.
And the question is, that's good or not?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what we all know about it, so I will talk about what I want.
All these choices have two negative effects, two negative effects on people.
One of the paralyze, it's that that that is that proves paralyze.
And so many options that can choose choice, people can be very difficult to choose for something that is very difficult for something to be able to optech for something like this.
You give you a very significant example of a very significant investment in the private of private pensants in the private planet.
A college, my colleague had access to Valley the Valley of mutual founding companies that has almost a million sedies and about 2,000 sedies.
And what he found is that for every 10 funding mutual computation that the employees of the participation of two percentage of the participation of two percents.
You have 50 mutually mostly moved with 10 percent less people are less than the time you were just less person. Why?
Because with 50 mutations of mutual more, it's the naid of the naid of the naid to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose.
And then on the tuned and then the flower and then the flowing and the flower and of course, it was never coming back, and of course, it never comes back.
You know, you don't just mean that those people will be consuming their food for the footprint after the peak of the food is to put money on the decisions is so hard to put a decision-making decision-making decision-making money on the big compensation of the compensation of the compensation that would give the employees of the compensation of the compensation that would provide the employment.
We would give me the legs to the left-to-dollar footage of the employer that would pay their happiness fish compensate compensants in the compensation of the compensation of the legs of the legs of the legs of the legs of the legs to 5,000 dollars a year to the law of the top.
So the mention is a consequence when you have too much options.
And I think that this makes people look like this.
You really want to take the best way for all the ethernity, right?
You don't want to choose the foot of the wrong or even even the wrong thing for saving the wrong for saving the wrong for saving it for saving it.
So this is a second is that the second is that if we were able to keep the station of the requires and make a choice to be less enough to be less enough to be done with the result of choices.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that having a lot of soses for safety to choose if you just just just like a and it's not a perfect -- and it's perfectly -- and it's the sounds of the newspap?
It's easy to imagine that you could have been doing a different choice that would be better choices. And what happens is that alternative that is that alternative to regret your choice that you have made the regret and these regret regret and these regret that you have been a good decision-making choice.
The more option you have to have a little bit of easy to regret something that is disappointed with the option that you have the option you had.
Secondly, what economists call the opportunity for opportunity.
Dan Gilber has shown in this morning in the morning talking about how we can see things that we depends on what we compare to what you compare them.
Well, when I'm a lot of alternative alternative to have the way to imagine the characteristics of the alternative characteristics that you have a little bit more satisfy of alternative that you have a little bit of the alternative that you have a little bit of that you have alone that you have alphantom of the alternative of the alternative will be made by the way you had a little bit of the alternative to imagine the characteristic characteristices that you have to imagine the characteristics.
Here's an example. I assumptions of the people who are not New Yorker.
But here's how we should be able to raise it.
We have this bow in Hamptons.
A very expensive property.
The superbase pad. They have all the beautiful day to them.
What could they want to want more? Well, to think of drink -- it's a guy.
Everyone in my neighborhood in Manhattan are going.
I could just park in front of the office." And spend the idea that two weeks of the idea that the idea that the snails of the sticky parking parking parking parking parking for the parkelf.
The opportunity to get the village of the village we have to have the choices that we have to choose is exceptional.
And the more options are made in the way that the characteristics of these options are going to be perceived as we are perceiving as we are perceiving opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartooner says a lot of things.
We should be able to live in the mission, and probably we should be doing things slow.
But one of the things that tells is that any choice a choice to make other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of light-road lighting, and that will make less attractive less attractive and you can do what you do you do with the active.
Third the third of the expectation.
This hit me when I wanted to replace my bluegies.
Port bluggling almost every time.
And there was a lot of the people who were just like a single same same and you buy them and you buy them and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you had a lot of time and if you had to get them wrong.
So I went to replace my brother after I had been gotten for the old and I said, "Look, I want a wall of my old loud to my flaw the dot said, "You want to be a bad, the right thing to be smile, smok?
Do you want to have nasts or farm? Do you want you to get your flower?
Do you want to be able to fill in the do?
You want to avoid it, you want to get the bright -- and not finding it.
He painted me and he painted me after I said, "I want to be the guy who was the only guy who were the only one of the guy who was the only one that I was going to have a hour of the walls of the walls of the walls -- and I went out of the right -- this is the true -- the truth -- is the best of all of the right I had to have it.
I have gone better. All these options have done better.
But I was feeling worse.
Why? I wrote a book in which I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt worse is that I felt that we had all these options that I had to be a wall of my expectations about how should be a wall of the base of the bold walls have grown up.
We had very low-expected expectancy expectations when they were just waiting when they were just a single way.
Now when I'm 100 timening of the days, one of them must be perfect.
And what we got was good, but not perfect.
So I compared what we had to get with what we expect and the result is that we were disappointed with what I was looking for.
The option of options in the lives of people can't do something elfare that people who have to grow the expectations that people have to be those options.
And as it will take a little bit less satisfaction even less than it is that even though they get good results.
No one in the market, you don't know that.
Because if you know, you don't have the idea of what I am talking about.
The truth is more like this.
The reason for everything was better when it was bad when it was worse is worse that when everything was wrong was actually possible to expert was actually worried about the surprise.
Today in the world we live -- we live -- we live industrialized and industrialized that we expect the perfect thing -- the best thing that you can be so much as you can be so much as you expect the things that they will be so much as you expect to be as well.
You never have a surprised because your expectations and my expectations and my own fun to the circle of the sky.
The second of happiness -- for that you all came up with the happiness is to have expectations to have expectations to have expectations to have expectations to have expectations of the happiness of the happiness of the happiness --
I want to say -- just a short moment of biographics -- that we actually have a great goal and it's really great good.
I couldn't find something better was it. I didn't have any better.
But let's look at your house doesn't necessarily necessarily in the house.
And finally, a consequence of a wall of a wall you can't just buy a lot of you can't buy a single one as you can't just buy a single one as you can't ask you what is a clear and ask you why that is clear the end is clear to be clear the end of the point, the answer is clear to the wall of the second one is that you can't do it.
The world is coming from. What was I could be able to do?
When are hundreds of different stars of different stars in a lot of different style that you disappoints and you ask yourself why, why, why, whenever you can ask them?
It's as a clear that answer, the question is, you know,
You could have to choose better.
A hundred different kinds of different waves of blue to choose to choose no scale.
So when people make decisions, even if people make choices are good good at the choices are doing these things, they feel disappointed to the other and they are getting dying and
The Depression of the erupon the entire industrialized world.
I think a big contribution -- not the only thing -- but the important thing to this erupper depression and also is that people have experienced in the synthesis, people are too high in their own own own own experience.
And when you have to explain these experiences are the house.
So the general result is that the general not, and we feel worried about it.
So let me remind you remind you.
This is the doctrof, that all we think is truly and it's really true, and it's not true. It's not true.
Without the discussion that you have a few choices better than net, but here are the good news that many choices are better than a few choices.
There is a magic. I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty sure that we went out of that points of that choices are the way of life improvement of life.
Now, the idea -- almost we were finally finally find, the thing that you can think is this.
What it allows all these choices in industrialized societies is good good for material.
There are a lot of places in the world and we heard a few of them where the problem problem is that they have too much options.
The problem is that they have too few people.
So the thing about talking is that I'm a strange problem of Western societies.
And what is frustrating is this: Steve Levitt talks about how these chairs for children to smoke up and hard to installed the way to installed the mouth of it.
What I'm saying is that these options, expensive, except not just helpful.
They actually actually really challenged painful.
They really do even worse worse.
If something that allowed to do that in society to make all the choices that we do all the choices that people are too few options that people have too little that people have been improved the lives of the same way that the lights would be improvement but our lives would also be improved.
This is what the economy is called Pareto.
The income income income will be better than all -- not just poor people -- not just poor people -- because of the choices of choices.
In the conclusion. You know, you think that cartooner and being a sophisticated person you say, "Wo! What you know about the fish fishery of the stars?
You know nothing is possible in this account." Imagine -- a poorest of the world -- so I read it -- so I read it and I read it out and I read it out and I read it out and I have no time in the first time.
But the more I thought I was going to think that the fish I had to think that the fish knows something like that.
Because the truth is that if you sells the way to be possible, you don't have freedom of freedom of the wild.
If you switch the acquise, so that everything is possible, the scale of the village of satisfaction level.
You think about the mention and the scale.
Anyone needs a variety.
This is almost almost too limited -- probably even for a fish for a cavefish.
But the absence of a metaphor for new, is a network for new, and you know, the unit is a disaster.
Thank you very much.
