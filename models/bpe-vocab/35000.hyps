And the year we showed these two dieters to show that two diet to demonstrate that polar polar that the big polar that the moon the last three million years was the size of the big sion,
But this morning is serious serious issue because it doesn't show the size of the black box.
The polar polar is in a way, the heart of the climate system, the global system.
It is expanded to the wind and the fear and the fear and the fear of the winter.
The next slide that I will show you will show it a quickly slightly quickly on what happened in the last 25 years.
The pemancient is the marcaught with smell.

In 2-year-old years came from this to this one.
This is a problem because the inquality of the death of the ocean,

And a reason is that an enormous "words" is the Grenland in the north.
This is a race that was all over the year.
But the volumes are much larger than that.
This is the Kangerussuain the Suslack Groenland.
If you want to know how the other people are the big stone of the topiances on the six.
These are growing very quickly.
And at the other end of the planet, Antarctica of the planet.
The last people have reported as the nurse reported as the continent is the negative balance of the Antarctics on the top of the insult of the insult of the insult is all over fast.
This is equal in the way in the largest level, like in Genland in Genland in Genland in Genland --
In Himalaya, the third of the same as the marimmediately the new vision, you can see the new formats, which after they were the guartes.
40 percent of the population of the world are getting out of the water from the water in these topirs.
Today, this guettle, this guided of the order.
They have grown up.
But when it were, it was happening to the water water with the water water
In California was a 4-percent scaring in Sierra Sierra in Sierra.
This affects the water reserves of water.
And the predictions, as you read it, as a serious reading of it.
The global entire global growth has led to a dramatic creative credit of incenties.
And the disasters are all on the world grew up with a great rate with a great great rate and the fall of the time.
From four times more in the last 30 years of those 75 years of the 75 years of the 75 years of the 75.
This is a completely unsustainable model.
If you look in context you can see what happens.
In the last five years I added 70 million tons of tons of carbon dioxide every 24 million hours every day every day every day every day every day every day every day every day every day every day in the ocean.
Look at the point of view of the state of the American Pacific area from America, and every part of the subcontinent of Indian where the subcontinent of the ocean where it's a radical radicits.
The biggest because the single single global warming global warms, which is about 20 percent of the debate of fossil fuels.
The peak is a problem and the best is serious --

Last year, I did a TED I did a introduction to LHC.
And we promised to give you a data about how they work is how it works.
So, here is me. And for the people who were not here at the largest scientific experiment, which was the largest scientific experiments -- Cirumphyl, Cirumble-hour Street or is to recreate the conditions of a billion times of a fraction of a billion times a second.
It's extremely much more than that.
This is the device under the city of Geneva.
We do the photos of these minds "Big Bangs" inside the decades.
I work on this. It's called the ATLATLAS -- Lunged 44 feet -- Lunty, 22 feet photos of ATLS here is a photograph here you can see the proportion.
On the 10 years I went down the year we went out for the first time.
And this picture was the ATLAS facility.
He caused a great celebration in the room.
It's a picture of the first particle that has gone that has gone in the layer system, crossed around the LHC system is a part of LHC deliberately in the detector.
In other words, when I saw that image 10 I knew that 10 I was a big seat that the device is a huge success.
I don't know if that had received the largest oils, or this is walking on the Google and saw that the first page of the first page.
It means that I did a cultural impact on the layer impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of it.
And after about a week in a week with the machine that actually had to do with these days.
Those are a few few of the footprint when the machine works at the power of the power of the mass of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the motor of the power of the power of the power of the remote of the flows of the fun of the late 13 of the footprint of the length of the power of the mostly flow.
Now engineers in the walls and say, "You can't transportation the filles." They are bought to be five."
But I can do that because when they are at temperatures are getting what is called the superconductive of the superconductive bees.
So as a 271 degree, because of the sun of the state, that the hospital, those are the bodies that they can transport the board can transport the board of the bodies.
At one of the layers of the layers in HC, was a defect of factory manufacturererererererererehabilitation.
So the company has been sweating, and the 13 of ampers have been reminded of electricity.
This was the result.
That's more impressive, that you think that the magnets are spending over 20 tons of ton, and they moved about 30 cents.
So we have about 50 magnetic magnetic magnetic
We had to take the outside, what we have.
I reconconcusion, I repair it.
And now we take magnetic magnetic and then we go into the subterm.
Pana at the end of the marvelous March March will be like new LHC will be like new again.
We're going to start in again, and we are going to get data in a hulation, or we'd continue to find out of the universe.
Now of course, that in a way, that those accident accident about the important scientists and engineering the importance of the extreme and engineering to break up the extreme here.
I think that it is so much to the fact that it's so much about the fact that we have young people in the important thing that I have to have an important thing to the LaC.
I'm going to leave the words of a Britanic scientist, Humphrey Davy, who I think -- which, I think that the husband the experiments of protection, and that was Michael Faraday, he said, "Nimic for human minds for human minds are not the dangerous human rights of our scientific weaponons are not really excited, and so that we don't have been finding to our noses are not finding to our likes are not being being being being fine."
Thank you.
I want to remind you to remember the kidney of child, when you were playing with bodies.
You know, what you invite to get them to get them and go and take them and go and forward them and give them and solved how to pay and solve and sold and solving the spaces of the spaces.
The vision is profile of how we understand a lot of the world of the inconclusion.
So, in the quality of IT initially inspired by this kind of re-inspiring objects -- impressing my physical objects -- impressing my Pattissue Pattissue, and my color Kalanithanks -- I started to go to the computer -- when we use a computer, where they would be able to the next next next next to a computer that was going to be so much digital that we could be so much about if we could have to go into a little informed and
Did it for what we want to now?
And the question was that the question of the fascinating we have the researchers we had the answer to Siftable to build Sweet Sweet Sweet Stable to the question of it.
In short, a Siftable is a computer interactive interactive of a little bit of a bism.
They can be manufactured by the way, they can perceive the mission of one one of the other one of the other one screen and a screen and a radio wireless radio wireless and a wireless wireless of it.
The most important is that they're palpably palpables like the game, you can just take it for a lot of people to them.
And Sif, the example of an example of an ecosystem of an ecosystem of digital manipulation.
On the mapping of what these instruments are becoming more palatives their mission, which is a different way of the nutritions of our nutritions and fun of interactive nutritions.
I'm going to start with simple examples.
This Sif, this is confified to the video image, and if it is to a direction, and if it it it is a movie, if it is it in the other park movie, they go back.
These portraits are constellations of each other.
So, if I put one on one of the other hand, they become interesting.
If they're unconsciously, they will notice and this can be a little conusion.
They can also feel misery and inclination.
We realized that one of us in the interesting implications of interaction is that we can use the same gest, like we could use the data, like we would have a color like we would have a color like the wild.
In this case, we have three Sifwisdom like the galls of voices, and they can use them to be a color in the center in the center where they will be mixed in the center that they will be amones.
If we could get too much, we can get a little bit of time.
There are also interesting possibilities for education, how they would be games and logical logic and logical logic and logical possibility to try and see people who are immediately to see the results immediately and see the results immediately and see the results in the immersion of education,
So here I -- this is a Fibonacire that I do with a simple program of equative.
Here we have a little formation game game of the words of Scrabs and Boggle.
And in every single one of the first one of the first Sif, and on every Sif, and to formed, and to formed, they are they very grew up with a dictionary.
And then after a 30 seconds of the letters, and you have a new set of letters, and you have a new set of letters.
Thank you.
These are the kids who came to the excursions that came to the Media Law to the Media and filmmaker and filmmaker.
They liked them to crazy.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of applications is that you don't have to give them a lot of instructions.
They have to say "Find is "Wait just to do it.
Here's some people who are inhabiting them.
This is the most tank, we have a test test of our right in right.
It turns out that everything that he wanted to do was to do was to the Sifests one over the other.
So for him were just bodies.
This is a application of interactive.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who invent language.
And this is Felix.
He can introduce new characters in the stage, just the Sif, and they are the personajectors.
This is introducing the soarrivered.
Video: Serror.
David Merrill: Now he introduced a stage in the stage.
Video: The orange of the portrayer.
Very of good!
Misming and when Sweet and assigned one of the other one can make their persons to interact -- Video: Wam!
DM: It creanancy.
Video: Okay.
DM: It's a open-up story. And he decides how it will be debt.
Video: Yes, I had.
DM: The last example I have time to show you today is a piece of created and interpretation of the music I was doing a recently, and the Switwitzerlands that I had been rhythmic and all the role of sounds that would be rhythm and all bad.
Each one of those four different variations that you want to use it.
And you can inject the sound of a succession that you can have asasths you want.
Shei the sound touches the sounds of sounds of a successful of success.
There are effects that you can control control and control -- how you can reverberative and the filter.
You see it in a particular sound of sound, and then including it to helps it.
It's generally generally effects like the philosophy and the volume of the injuries of the same.
Video: DM: We will start with a rhythming in the second Switch in a serious Street, I was a serious expanded.
Now I now put a basic line.
Video: DM: Now adoptea.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the movie, to control the whole thing to control the lives.
Video: DM: You can get the whole century of inclining in a part of a or another.
Video: I'm going to take this little bit, and I will go for a lot of extent to a present.
Video: YM: I can do it in the long time.
So you don't have to do the plan, can improvise, previous or short towards longing or a little bit of walk.
Now, the end, I can get the whole century to use of the Swel Street Stretree in the sea of volume volume in stange.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is the creation of new interfaces that are right with how much they work better with the way that the brain and our body and our body is the brain and our body.
And today, we had time to show you a coordination of this new spatial of design, and some of the possibilities that I was trying to get out of the lab.
The Ganda that I want to retinder is like we are at the new general of interaction with the new interaction with the most interactive instrument, which will bring information, our digital rules in our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of the rules of our rules of the rules of our rules is that we are at the whole digital general to this new general
Thank you very much.
These are the nerve to talk to you all the way to be all of you.
I'm writing.
He wrote the book, but it is my teacher, more than that.
It's all my mother, and fascinating loads and fascinating.
And I'm not going to change that is to change it.
But this is what it was like, something that was happening in life and in my career and in the career that I deeply to recycled me to require my own relationship.
And the weird thing that I wrote is that book called "Mananca, "Mananca, Roagueste," which is Iubeste," which is a very unlike my cartoonists in the world for a few of my book, and it became an important signal, and it became an important signal of an international position.
The result is that anywhere in the way now, people are going to treat the same time.
Serios -- the convicted --
You know, for example, you and you say, "You don't have the theme is the theme -- don't you know, is you can't be able to be able to be able to be able to say?
You don't have the theme that you will continue to write your life as a little more creative book that will ever be able to take a book on the world that ever ever ever ever before?"
It's really linked to it.
But it was also if they didn't have any more than you don't have a 20 years ago, when I was trying to get people -- I want to become a writing -- I want to become writing, I want to become writing, I loved by the same African reaction of the same African reaction on the same thing.
And people were like, "You don't have any more you don't have any of you have never had a success?"
Do you don't know that humility will be killing your human being?
You don't know that you will work in this field in this field and nothing will be in here and nothing will be here and you will have a dream of the dreams of the dreams of the screen of the screen?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the short to the short to all those questions is """Da."
Yes, you have the theme of all of those things.
And I always was to me.
And you have a lot of other things that people can't do not reach them to not them.
As a result of big examples that are cross of these things that are crossed --
But when it's about the work I was thinking about the moment I was really asked to the last time is "What?"
Is it a rational?
It's also the logic to that anybody can be the theast thing that they feel like they were destroyed to do this Pame.
And what is that specific specific specifically that seems like we are really true to our own healthy healthy health in a way that other teachers don't you do it?
I love with you for example, it was an engineer, and you don't remember in the 40 years of you have a chemical engineering, he would be asked anyone if you don't have one engineering.
It wasn't happened, how how does the block the block of chemical?
It's just not going to happen.
But to be honestly, the chemisters like group not very few groups don't really read in the reputation of reputation to be alcools of maniactics.
We are insessness -- we have this reputation, but not just writing -- but the artists, they seem like this reputation to be powerful for the real reputation of being powerful.
And everything we have to do is to look at the number-range of morning in the 20, in the 20th century, in the 20th century, which have died by young people and often died by young people and often died by the way.
And even that that didn't have to be in their own fun is really funny of their own lives.
Norman Mailer, even before I was in the last interview, he said that "Each one of my carts" -- a little bit more more, a little bit more than I did a little more than I have a little more more,
A great great great great team.
But not the time we hear when someone elsewhere we hear that because I heard this is because I heard this is so many times and somehow I have the completed and somewhere and a collective and suffered and suffering and suffered and the fact that the creativity, and that the art, and it will lead to the suffer in a sense of the sufficient that I was going to get the to.
And the question I want to advertising today, all of you today is you all the impact of this idea?
You are comfortable with it -- because as the list -- I don't see the eye of the light, I don't care about this ipoverty.
I think it's a lot.
And I also think it's dangerous and I don't want to see it in the century in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage our great artists,
And I know that I was thinking about my situation -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to go to the caring of this ipoverty of the ipoverty of the ipoverty, especially the teaching of the hipoverty,
For example, there are pretty young for example, just about 40 years.
I have probably in the few decades before the workers before.
And it's very likely to be able to do this moment with this moment to be judged by the work that the work that was going to the last few days, and after my success of my last book, right?
What would be to say to the men, because of the people here are already here we are the friendly of my friend -- it's very likely to be happened.
Oh, God, what I did, what I did.
This is the kind of like to be able to take a look at the time to get to the morning to the morning in the morning that person.
I do to do in continue to do this message that I love it.
And then, the question is that the question is, what?
And so it was going to be slowly meditation, as I have to work now, to continue to write a kind of a psychological construction, is by creating a kind of psychological construction, right?
I had to find a way to find a way to find a distantue, one who write, and my father who write, and my graduate lawyer that will be in the law that I wrote about what he wrote about what he wrote about what he wrote here.
And as we were all in the last year in this sense, we started looking at the time, and I tried to find other society to see other society to see if they could have better ideas about how to be held better ideas about how to make people creative people creatures.
This is what this is led to Greece, and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma
So you have the insurance of the circle.
But in the Grecently, the antic Roming of anticonic Rome, and they don't think the creativity of the human inside,
People thought that creativity was a spirit was a spirit of a child who was helped people in a source in a source and unintelligent and untable and unintellectual.
The solutions called these spirited diframes of faithers with the term "terrorist terms.
It was famous to it was famous to think it has a demon which is a department in the department in the department.
The human were the same pared, but they called the creative creative, immersible,
What is great, because they didn't think they have been thinking about a very much like a very exciting individual enemy.
They think a genius was a kind of magicyle -- what the fact is the one of the wall the way that Dobby, in a kind of like Dobby, the sweater, and in the arrived, and the result of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the wall-up
Absolutely -- this is really the distantuish that this is the distantuish that I was talking about the result of the workers that are going to protect you from the workers.
And all the world is that this is working, right?
So the ancient artist was protected by some of the things that are too much narcisism, right?
If your work was straluca, you couldn't take the whole thing for her, the world for her, the whole world as you had this genius that have helped it.
If your work was critical, it wasn't completely the window, it wasn't really good?
Everybody is the strength as your genius was kind of ignorance.
They have looked at people in the West creativity,
Then he came up and everything that was change, and everything that was change, and the idea of a great idea of the man as the individual in the center of the universe of all the beings and myself, the mysteries and mysteries that are receiving from the defense to the define of the defense of the disability.
It was the sun of a rational, and people started to believe that creativity is coming out of the individual creativity.
And for the first time in history of people started talking to one or one of the artists, like being genius, instead of a genius.
And you have to married, I think that it was a huge error a huge error of it.
You can see the box, a simple person, or it is actually the received or it is actually the received and the syndry and the synthetic and the synthetic and the synthetic acoustic of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the human human beings.
It's like you would ask you to have the so-called soap harets.
They just have incovering and deforms and generates all these these things that are all these these things that are all these things that
I think that pressure that this has been killed by the time of the last 500 years.
And if I think about it, and I think that the question is, what do we do?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we go to the older senses, the relationship between people and myths of people and myths.
It may not.
Maybe we can't just know 500 years of a human human andivide in a rational talk,
And it probably in the audience that would raise the signal questions that would be known to the theme, the fact that people are actually going to the people and they are all over the projects and all the projects and all the projects and all the time.
You probably don't have to cooked you to the idea.
But the question I want to ask is -- why not?
Why don't we think about this?
Because it has a sense of just like any other we heard about how different we have been talking about the creative explanation of creativity.
It has to be able to create something -- basically to create something -- you know, the thing -- you know, it doesn't always behavioral behavioral behavioral behavioral is not the rational of any rational rational that they always can behavioral anybody that was able to do with the same thing.
And in fact, sometimes it can sometimes the passing can go to the paranormal.
I had a whole thing I met where I met the great American American American Ruth Stone, who was now has been the same at 90 years and who was now has been the poetry and life that he told me that when she told me that when she told me that she told me that when she told me that she told me a little bit of the room, and I just heard a poetry and get out to the room, and I just heard a poetry to work on the roads to the rooms out of the world.
The story as a vast vast of the ants of the same.
And it was the way that it was over the camps.
And the point is that the symbol is the gallery as as you are the leg.
At that point, it has one thing to do, and that is a single thing that is, "Let's get a huck."
And it goes to the housing to the housing houses and the whole idea was to get to a map and a map of a more, and a little creative and then he went through his map.
Sometimes it wasn't enough enough enough to the way that runs and running and running and running and running out and running in the house, and the poems and the poems and the people would have lost the roots of the rooms of the room, and I read "another poet "A other poe."
They were and the moments where -- and this is not going to look at the story that story is almost losing at all.
And he running home, the mother, and the poems and the people that they were the way and the moon the board and the story of his own husband he was going to the other and the other man and the other man and the print.
The poems and the poems and then the body and then the body on the main the main the main the math.
In this situation, the poems of the right and intact and intact and unless and unless and it is from the last worst word.
When I heard it -- it's just the surprise, it was just how my own creative process.
My creative process doesn't really limited to this -- I'm not drive!
I'm a catching and the way I work at the point I work on every day at the same time and they are going to be able to stay and trick.
But even I was like, I was in my house, even I was so much that the phenomenon.
And I immediately imagined that they were and many of you are.
I had projects or ideas that were able to have projects that I don't know it to a source that I don't know it.
And what do you do you do that?
And how about it should be reported to it in that we don't lose our minds, you don't lose our minds, you know, to help us reach to help us reach the blood to help us reported to report our blood to report our to report to report us to report us to report our to report us to report our to report our minds to report our minds to us to report our minds to reported to us to report our minds to help us to help us
For me, the most relevant examples of what we have about how we can do is do the music of Tom Waits, we took a pipeline years after a living in the demand in the demand in the demand in the demand in the revistation.
I was talking about the subject and all this was almost all about his life enemy of the contemporary artist's contemporary artists, what they started to control and gestight and gestures and gestablished into creative creative creative controlling the creative of the creative expensive.
With the walking around, and the story of the story as a day as a day in a day of a way to Los Angeles and then everything has changed.
As a short time of a short fragile in a short fragile in a short and apply of a piece of the time and magitor, as it was going to be in the inition, and a lodinner and a lot, but it doesn't just like to her, but he doesn't look at it.
It doesn't have any main math, no reporter -- no report.
I was all that the old old that old old old and I would have grown and the song and the song for the bank, and the song for the banker for the time.
They're not enough enough to revealing a reus."
And instead of the show, they just stopped.
He stopped the whole process and did something with everything and everything you can do.
He raised the skin and said, "You don't see that they're at volano?"
"You know, you might have to write a channel?
If you really want to be able to have to be in a little more applied at you.
If you don't have any of the one of these things.
Go and you get Leonard Cohen."
The trust of creative processing the creative process.
It's not the opera is continued to be the same as much as it is always happening.
But the process of goodbye, and it was around to the moment in the moment he took the mouse, the genius, and it because it was in the way he was going to go back and only the way to the way to the way to come back and forth to where he was coming back to the inside of the orgizzed and China.
It could be this unique collaboration and the bizarre under a conversation under a conversation and the external external external and the external external that wasn't too too as Tomanie that was not too much like Tomanie that was not too much as Time and the whole bizarre and the bizarre, and the bizarre to the shape, and the whole bunch of the same as the Time of the same person,
And after I heard the story of the story I started to change a little way that I was doing a data.
This approach me when I was at the middle of the novel "Manca, Roages, Iubest, and I have a kind of a kind of disappearance that we all go to something that we all work and when I was working on something that doesn't seem to be a disaster to be a disaster to be the most propospose.
Not just that, but the most proposing this book ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever before.
I had to think about it should just abandoned the project.
And I remember my opening up to the open space, and I asked the opening hospital.
I got my view on the manuscrippled and I got the comments of the cameras a colgod of the camera.
I said to vote with voice -- and I know that if this book is not extraordinary to be extraordinary is not just going to be really extraordinarily not just the her, right?
Because you can see that one of the battle all what I want to her, and more than I want to see not anymore.
So if you want to be better from it, you have to do the machine and you have to do the same thing.
Okay. And if you don't do that, you know, you know, you all that, you know, you all of it.
You go to the continue to write because this is my message.
And I want to consign today, I did I have to do my third sight here.
Because the Conclusion -- the Conclusions in North African people in North Africa, people have not to add the battery and music, and music, and music, and music, and the music, and the music, and the music, and the music,
And they were always wondering, because dancers were teaching were teaching and they were remarkable, right?
But sometimes it was going to happen, and one of the fact that it really happens to be in the community.
I am convinced you you know what I mean is to know about what I would you see in a particular moment, a particular moment --
It's like the time it stops and the dancers is by a kind of porting with a kind of thing that doesn't do anything different, in the other 1,000 series -- all of the other 1,000 series -- everything elinition.
It doesn't seem to be in the whole thing that is in the whole thing.
It's light in the inside and light is the bottom of the bottom of the founders.
And in the time, when it was going to be known to the names were called
They were the hands and they were the roads and they were "Alllah, Alllah, yer, God, God, God, God, Game, Gamone."
It's God.
A interesting among announced -- when the mountains have been invite the Spanish in Spanish and the pronounced of the Middle was turned to the Walk, "Allah," "Allah," "Allah," "Allah,"
and they hear the time in the fight of the fight and dancing dancers.
In Spanish when a interpret something impossible and mothers got a "Allaws, and mother, the mother, Allaws, and old, Allawyers --
It's not an intelligence -- a God farmer.
It's great, because we need this.
But the point of view comes up the second day when the dancers is that the dancers is a big by, and it's a little bit of the Divinvince.
It's a dirty that enhance is and that they could not be able to be able to not enrying the time of the hill.
Would it be to the name of Domn's name, when he was asked to do the rest of his rest of his life saying,
It's weird.
It's one of the most painful of the most painful of the creative creature.
But maybe it doesn't really be a big if you don't have a lot of people who are not much great part, like the most extraordinary sons of your own life,
Maybe if you think about it was improud of a catch of a few times of your life in your life of your life in the next few days, when you moments were on the next to the moments have been sick.
If we think about it, it all started changing.
I started thinking and so I would think and I have thought about the last months of the last months of the book that will be published by this book, and a curious and crisis of my succeeding and crossed my party succeeding and crisis.
And what I did is to do when you get the clear -- you don't be a the-the-the-like it.
It won't be the spelling. You just want to do the part,
If you are dancing anything, then they dance.
If the genius and excential is repair to make it a decision to get the extraordinary, even for a great time for a mom, and even for a mom, "h!"
And if no, it doesn't anyway.
And all of the "Oh!" for you.
I think we should be teaching them to pretend them.
"You just want to you, because you just have a loap for the human and the head of the enemy.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ohen: Ohen:
We talked about some of these projects, about the human genome, and what could be able to represent, and what they could be able to discover new genes.
Now we start from a new point of views, we digitize biology, and now we try to start to start to start in a new code from this code of biology, modeling and synthesizing biology, modeling and synthesizes and synthesizes of life.
We tried to do the time to ask us to ask questions.
"What is life?" It's something I think that many biologists have tried to understand at different levels.
We tried different approaches, simple approaching life at the basic components.
We already are about about 20 years.
When I was sequenced the human genome, this is that we went from the analogical world in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world.
Now we're trying to ask for question, can we regenerate our own efforts of life, in this digital universe, in this digital universe, in this digital universe?
This is the map of a little organism of genitalium, which has the most genitalium, which is the smallest genomes that can replica the lab in the lab.
We tried to see if we could come up with a genome,
We were able to get to the order, a hundred genes in the judge of a 500 that are there.
But when we look at the metabolic metabolic map in compared to us.
I think this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can get the first at a moment, is a little bit likely to produce a little cell.
So we decided that the only way it is to really synthesosomes to synthesosome, so we can get the summer components to reach some of the most fundamental components of questions.
And so I started on the road, "Can the synomosom?"
Can you have the chemistry of the synthesizing of these molecules that we never did before,
And if you can actide a cross of a cross-it?
A crosose, by the way, is just a piece of chemical material.
So, our speed life life has grown to a little rhythm exponentially.
Our ability to write code code is moved by pretty slowly slowly so.
The last time he got to get to a exponential curves
I started this on a little bit more about 15 years.
I went through a few etheless, and in fact, with a bio-ethic examination before the first experiments of the experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesization is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that are doing little DNA, long enough of 30 to 50 lets a 30 to 50 lets a degenerative process that you build a long piece of the more, so what you build a little little little little little bit of the car.
So we had to create a new method to put these little little little little bits together, and the right all the error.
This was our first tentative information, I start from digital information from the general of Phi Physicism of Phi X 174.
It's a little virus that kills the bacteria that kill.
We did the chicken design design, we went through the correctly, and we got a molecule of DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA
The interesting thing that I came up when I took this piece of chemical material, and we put it in bacteria and I put it in bacteria and they started to read this genetic code, and they started to read this facilities and produce the virus and produce the virus.
The viral partics were then released from cells and they were returned and they were killing the E.
I was talking with the oil industry and they said that they understand very clear this model.
They have laughed more than you are.
And so we think this is a situation where the software can build their own own biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the whole cross-gain.
This is over 58,000 letters of genetic code,
So we would say to put the layers in the size of the size of the virus could to the size of the size of the houses of a list of the houses of a life cell.
And the design is critical, and if you start with digital information, that information has to be very like.
When I was sequenced the first time this genomin 1995, the standard was a error of a error at 10,000 basic payments of base.
We found it, in the return to the requirement -- if we were used to be used to be used to be activated, this would never be activated.
Pirt design is designed by the letter of the enlightening 50 lets that have to be a 50 letter with all the other letters to build the other letters to build the little little little little little ball, so the joy of some of the joy of some of the jokes to be compatible to each other.
We are also using tools.
You can read that I read "waters" in the houses of this: we have a genetic code, you have a genetic code, and T.
Triving the letter of those letters, those letters about 20 recently recently acizes a literally literally acid.
So we can use the genetic code to write words --
I did was all all the way we were to hear the code of the code.
Some of them were disappointed that it's not poetry is poetry is not poetry
We designed those joined so that we can define was with enzyme.
They're also that they repair and they are them.
So we started doing the joy of the joy of five to seven to 7,000 lets them go to 7,000 lets them do with 24,000 lets and then put it in the stories, and then put it up to 72,000, and then putting up to 72,000 of these --
Every single one of the hill, we have the full of these joy little bits to sequences them to make a very robust process, and we try to see a very robust -- as you can see in a minute.
We are trying to get to the automatization of automatization.
So, this shows like a basketball looks like a basketbit.
When we get to the very large pieces of over 100,000 payments of basic walls in E.
They are all all the tools of modern molecular biology.
So we were going to get to other hanisms.
We knew that there is a mechanism called recombination of the biology that biology is using DNA, and they use DNA, and that they can be replicated.
This is a example.
There's a organism called Deinococcus of the Island, which can sustain millions of radiation.
As you can see in the room the cross of his husband is destroyed.
Two to 24 hours later, he was again. He was at the beginning of the way that was the beginning of the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be deeply all of the organisms of it.
They can live in lives.
I'm absolutely sure life that life can be in the extreation of the extreatment, to go back a new medium of a new mediums.
In fact, NASA showed that this is going to happen there.
Here's a micrograph is a molecule that we built using these procle -- actually using these procavatar -- actually using the design of the pigeon design, which we put in the market.
Droject them together automatically automatically
This is not a picture of a microscope, but just a micro-graph with electronic volume.
It's the big molecule that we can see it with a microscope with a microscope.
These are collected in a period of about six seconds.
That's a public that we had a little bit of time.
These are over 5,000 lets of the genetic code,
It's the largest molecule ever ever ever made people, with a definition.
It has a molecular molecular molecular ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar molecular in the 30-million.
If we printed it with a 10-dollar founding for 10 pages to acknowledge this genetic code,
So, how do we start a cross-cross-do? How do I have it in it?
And obviously with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria to work with bacteria
And it's also a little more easy when you get to the nuts, like no: you can just take the nuclear nuclear and put it together, and you can put it -- cloning -- cloning.
With the archa, the cross is integrated in the cell, but we showed it by curious that we can do a completely transplant a completely transplant cells, and we can make it a cell phone, and we can activate it.
We had a check of a microbial species,
These are the second as people and so much as people and the same.
We added some genes in to be able to select the cross for this cross-man.
I deeply to enzyme to the enzymes of proteins.
And it was pretty amazing when I put in the cells -- you'll appreciate our very sophisticated grafts -- and the crossed in cell.
In fact, we thought this is how far it can go and design the process of going to design something more and more and more and for.
This is a major mechanism mechanism.
We are all kinds of species that have been corporated by a second crossed or a second cross or a third of the park, or a third of the specific parts, thousands of new characteristics in a second.
So the people who think about evolution just as a single gene of changing the biology.
They're called enzymous restricted to restriction, which actually had been dealing with DNA.
The romosome, the gene that was in the cell.
The cross -- the cross that we put us --
It was exposed to the other crossed the other crossed as the gosphanosphanosphere, and this is just the new cromoss of the cromoss of the cromoss of the cromossed the new crossed of the crossed and it was expressed the other crossed and he was all the other crossed the other crossed as the new crossed as a materialphosphosphosphosph
It became blue in because of the gene that we put in the cross.
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristics of a species have lost in a completely new species, and it was a new basic species, and it was in the cell.
All the proteins were changing, the membranes were changing, when we do we do was changing the code code, it's exactly what we transfer the genetic code,
That can sounds like like a genomic alchemistry, but we can change things pretty dramatically change things pretty dramatic.
Now we have supported that not genesis -- but a half years and a half years and a half years and a half years and we supported that maybe we can actually be a new version of the Cambriane, in which he has a new specific version of master new specifically on the digital specific design of digital specifically on the digital species.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obviously pretty obviously neat all.
We're on the way to go from six and a half to six to a new billion people in 40 years.
To ask that context for me to the context for me, I was born in 1946.
There are three people on the planet for each of us in 1946, in 40 years, in 40 years, in 40 years, will be four.
We have a housing issue, providing potable and drill, fuel drugs, fuel fuel and a half billion and a half of the six and a half of the house.
It will be difficult to do it for us.
We use over five billion tons of the good books, more than 30 billion barriers of oil bars.
That's a hundred million barils a day.
When we try to think about the biological or any process that will replace to replace that, it will be a huge challenge.
And then of course, it's all that CO2 from this material, which is that we get to the atmosphere.
Now from our discoveries around the world, we have a data set of genes, we have a whole data in this way that I like to think about these projects, and I like to think about the components of the future.
The electronics is just a doubled, or this is a due to something -- and this is the diversity that came out of this.
We're limited here in the first time, biological reality, and our imagination.
We have the techniques, because of these things -- we call it a sample generating genders of genymic.
We have the ability to build a big robot that make a million cross a day.
When you think about to process these 20 million genes of genes different genes of gene gene to produce occupy occurred to produce the opportunity, or products of new vaccines, we can change the movie biology than the last 20 years, we can change more biology than the last 20 years, we can do more biology than the last 20 years of all the science.
And this is just a standard.
We can select for viable viability production or chemical or fuel fuel production, production production, facilities, production production.
This is a design capture of an online design that we are working on and we could go and work on these species in the computer.
You know, we don't know how it will show you.
We know exactly how they do their genetic code,
Now we're focusing on fuel fuel to fourth generation.
You saw recently in the mid-piano is just a big experiment is just a big experiment.
We have fuel fuel in the next generation that will seem very soon as it turns out that are soap and fuel fuel as much more valuable to more valuable to more valuable or different buttons of the poverty buttons of the dollar dollar cy.
But the only way we think biology can have a major impact without a major impact without the food costs and their limited costs their limited and the limited of the same matter if we start with CO2 as a maternal cells, and we think we will have the first fuel to design fuel to design the fourth generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the same cost of the way that we have to design and our own fuel and our own fuel is that they have the same way to have
And also, in the solar and CO2 is a method -- but in our discovery of our world around the world we have all kinds of ways of other ways of the world we have all kinds of ways of the world we have all sorts of the world and CO2 is a way of the O2 is a way of the O2 is a way -- but in the O2 is a way -- but in the discoveries of our world.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It goes into the deep deep in the ocean, and a half a deep deep deep, and a half of the deep.
CO2 in metan use of CO2 in metan energy that surrounding surgery.
We are trying to see if we can take CO2 captured, which can be transported in the country, and convert that CO2 back in fuel in comfortable, and then it leads to the bodies to drive this thing.
So in a short period of time, we think we could have what is the basic question of "What is life the life?"
We have -- you know -- we have the whole model of replacing the entire industry industry.
Yes, if you don't do that at TED, where another part.
Take a major source of energy source.
But we also work now to use these same same sources to invention companies in order to invention in the sound.
You saw this year with the birth with a year ago, and a dollar in minus when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think the situation can be changing by building vaccines combined vaccines that before.
And this is how it could they start to show the future change the evolution, accelerating the evolution of evolution, accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria with synthetic back, and finally finally --
We're at human.
Our own is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive pretty much long, so I could do this. Thank you very much much very much for being doing this. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you first to show you very quickly, is a new technology, a new technology that I had to Microsoft as a part of a side of a little bit of a year. This is a year. This is a year.
It's a average that can interact is local or a big amount of visual data from a big amount of visual data from a big amount of visual data from a big amount of visual data that can be a big environment that can interact with a big environment that can interact with a big environment that can interacting with a big amount of visual species.
We now look at a lot of the whole new pictures and magnified by the next place, and they are just about it in the continue to this anyway, rearrived in this one, rearrive anyway.
It's not the matter how much information we look at how big the big columns or how big they are the images.
Most are doing with a new new new new new new came, but this is a very few -- for example, it's a Congress, the Congress, the lawyer of the 300 megap.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that should limited the performance of a monitor is the number of your monitoring monitoring on your monitoring technology.
This is a little book, an example of a non-imaginative example.
It's about "Cathle" -- Charles Dickens.
To show you is that it's about text, and not imagine, and not imagine, we can do this is a re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-to-the-day text.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read a book in electronic form.
I wouldn't recommend it.
This is a real case of "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian of "Gardian
Each image is the beginning of a century.
This is really gives you a joy experience of a plate version of reading a park of a newspaper or a revivil of a newspaper.
We did something little and something little cold with this number of "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian
We created a false reclaims to a very large resolve -- much larger than any uncomfortable -- and we have a common claims of a content.
If you want to see the properties of this machine -- you can see here.
Or other models, or even techniques.
And this really clearly by the way, the limitations of a monitor.
We hope that this is to be raising pops, and other people like this -- that are not necessarily,
And of course, the mapping is one of the applications for a kind of thing.
I'm not going to say a lot of time on this, but just to tell you that we have contributed to this field.
These are all the roads in the United States of the United States of NASA.
Let's go to a different thing.
This is actually active on the Internet; you can see it.
This is a project called Photosn, which is a different technology.
and Rick Szeliski at Cerror Microsoft.
So this is active on the Internet.
You can see that when we create this kind of perspective, when we can navigate through images in many ways, we can have this kind of experience.
But the space arrived, the space of these images really really really matters.
The other visual aliens have recorded these images have recorded these images together, so that to code where these pictures -- all of the Grassments -- all of the Grasses of Canadians -- they were shown -- they were shown to see these elements or shooting of a projections of a projections of a space of space.
I'm not sure if I was going to show you other media.
There are some some of the other that have a lot of space.
I would like to go directly to one of the original Noah -- this does a little bit of a Photosnal Photosnthe, which I worked in the vast thing I think it's the pigs of this technology, the technology of this technology, the Posynth. It's not just the unknown projections that I put on the website.
We had to have to be worry about lawyer.
This is a reconstruction of Cated, Damamams in Dams in Flickr. Does Namb Denklickr. Ford, and you find something like a little little little little little little little little little little little little little little bit of these contains are found that the patterns is a picture that would be found that the corerespond to this pattern --
These are photos of Flickr, and all of them were related spaces in this way.
We can just have to navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I would be working on at Microsoft is very eating to Microsoft it is a very prime here.
I don't have to notice that I noticed the whole range of cameras in the TV cell phones at SLRs SLRs LORs in this environment.
If they can also find these strange strange ways.
There are so many mammmmales of fear,
Where it is a series of photographs.
This is a poster with Nothing that was recorded correct.
You can get you to a physical medium to a physical media.
The idea is that they can do some of the social environment. This means to collect data from all the world -- from a collective memory, from a whole life -- and to interconnected to each other these pictures have been interconnected to the whole pictures of the shows, all those pictures that are more than the sufficide.
You have a model of what the entire Earth is the entire Earth.
Think about that as a long as the code Stephen Lawler "Earth."
And this is growing in complexity as the world as the world as a lot of benefits as they use it to use it.
The reason is the pictures of metaphors that someone else has entered it.
If someone would eat the ethicha and say who I am going to know, my photograph with Catatatatattorney with all of these data and I could use it as a point of place, and I could use it as a point of plan, to realize that space, that space, the combination of this space, and I could make a kind of social experience.
And of course, a computation product and all of these are the huge amount of virtual models of each other parts of the Earth, collecting not just from the Earth, collection and in the village of the village and images of collective and images of collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood correctly, what will allow your software to a moment in the next few years, is like a few years old, is that all the pictures of someone on a glob to be interrelate?
BAAM: Yeah. What does is to truly is to truly.
It creates hyper-connected -- if you want,
And it does that based on the content of the picture.
And this becomes reading when you think about the signal information that they have those pictures that have these pictures that have these pictures of the picture.
As you do a lot of images on the Internet, you know, you look at some words on the Internet, and the text on the Internet gives a lot of information about what is the picture.
Now what would be if that connection to all the pictures of all the pictures of all the picture?
And then the amount of signal interconnection and disease that is a huge amount of disease.
CA: Bise, is really incredible. Felics.
BABA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of intense journey and one of the nographics of the night is the opportunity of likes that didn't look at the old bodies of the old bodies that don't have the last helling hells in the wind of the boundaries of the boundaries of the planet.
You don't know that the Jaguary Jaguary wish. We still want to be beyond the old Law, or the old myths of the enlighting of the Himalabudible the revelation of Dharbor of Dharbor of Dharbor of the anthropology, and this is not a sense that the world in a sense that there is no matter -- but it's a model --
The consequence of a particular set of decisions that our ancestors that our ancestors were in their ancestors in the next few generations in the next day.
And of course, we all share the same imperative adaptive ad.
We all are born. We all bring children to the world.
We're going to go through initial ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual rituals.
We need to do the unemployment separation of morning is not supposed to be surprised that we all have to be surprised to all of us have to have art.
But what is interesting is the unique of songs of songs in every culture.
It is that the Penander, or from the Penphin Boro, or the wild Voodoo in Haiti, or the war in the northern Kisastern Kisastern Kisut in the northern of Churander, or a mountains in the middle of Sahai.
And so that this is the guy that I traveling with desperately or even a long steps of the Qomolian of the Qomolian Evey of the world of the world.
All of these people learn that there are other ways that there are other ways to think about it, other ways to think about other ways to think about the Earth.
And this is what if you think about it, it can be suffering for hope.
Now the miridges of the world together, form a spiral of spiral life and culture, which is the planet and cultural health and it's as important for the health of the planet, and it's the biological network as a biosphorus.
And you could think about this network as being a whole network as being a ethose, and you could define the suffer of all dreams, intuitive intuitions of the minds of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness,
Etnosphere of human beings of humanity.
It's the symbol, and everything we can be like a surprising specific specifically surprising specifically a crash of iscodits.
And the way the biosphere was the seeroes, and the ethose, and maybe a much larger scale.
For example, no matter what it would not be able to suggest that half of all the species or more of all the species was or more of all the species of expanded because it doesn't really is not true, and yet, and yet, and yet, and yet, and yet, the stage of biological diversity -- the most optimistic biological in the field of cultural cultural cultural in the field of cultural cultural diversity.
And the biggest indicator of this is the limited disappearance.
When you were born you, the people in this room, there were 6,000 languages were talking about 6,000 language.
Now a language is not just a voice or a layer or a set of frequencies.
One language is a spot of the human spirit of human spirit.
It's the vehicle that the souls of the soul of particles are going to get in the world.
Every language is a old old old old mind, a basic based on receiving ecosystem to be a spiritual of spiritual possibilities.
And from those 6,000 languages, how we stand here in Monterey, a half of them are not cooked in the next few children.
There are no longer taught babies in fact if it doesn't change something, that are already dead.
What can the only be the only one of the lines of the lines of the needle that to talk to you about the language that you don't have the way to presence the wisdom of the ancestors or ancient the kids or annipes?
And yet, that sounds like a little bit of a little bit of the Earth is a somewhere in the Earth for every two weeks ago, because every two weeks and he takes a little old old old old old old and leads to his morning of a old language.
And I know that some of you will say, "Well, would be better.
Wouldn't be a better place if I all talk about one language? And I said, "Grozav, that language is to be Cantoneese. Or that is Canesonese.
Or to be Kogi."
And then you will discover how it would not be able to be able to talk to your own language.
So, what I want to do with you is a kind of journey through the ethnic journey by ethnic journey to try and give you a sense of what it is going to be losing you to reach yourself to the fact that I want to do with you.
Now there are many of us that when they say "when I say "why" to be different ways to be doing different ways of girls.
Let's take example of this child in the tribal in the tribal of the northern Amazon the anaconedes, who believed that -- they came up to the river the right-hand shuttle, in the rooms of the ripps.
This is a popor that by near the blue of the blue of the blue of the skyscrapes is equivalent of the cockroaches that people depend on the forests that people depend on the board that people depend on the board that is a pop-like popped in the blood flows of the blue of the blue color is the blue of the coffee of the coasterror is because the leader
I have a curious language, and I have a clear that called lingvic exogames that you have to travel with someone who talks about one language.
And all of these are remained in the past, though, though, though, and it's a little bit of the houses that are talking about six or seven languages because they never hear a language.
They just listening to to speak at the street language.
And, one of the most fascinating tribes that I lived with the Waorn Waororn in the northeast Equadoror, a popor in the north of 1958.
In 1957, five missionaries have tried to contacts and they did a critical mistakes.
They were thrown from the air photos of them with them and what he wanted to be a friend of the junungest, looking at the bottom of these people in their life -- something big.

So you see these amazing demonstrations of these Voodoo stories, the wisdom of translation that you can eat the right in perfectly remarkable demonstration pretty remarkable proof the minds that the body has to be catalyed in the body that is catalyzed in the state of extreme directly into extreme step.

They can be ordered by just other composes with other composes that the MAO.
Now fascinating is that fascinating is that the cars in that any of the MAAO are inhibiters are necessary to be the kind of reptiles, so you ask you to a 80,000 species of the 80,000 species of the 80,000 species of the disorders of the morphological plans that the whole whole whole whole version of the whole world is more than the summit that the whole thing is the whole thing that the whole thing is the whole thing that the whole thing that the whole thing is the whole thing that the whole thing.

And finally, it turns out that everything is replacing to a choice.
We want to live in a monocroms of monotonies or we want to accept a different policy world of diversity?
Margaret Mead, the great anthroist before he told her before he told her before he was that the biggest is that the biggest generated and the world is that the whole world doesn't just see the whole world of human imagination on the world doesn't just see the whole range of the imagination of the picture, but we will see in the next day -- but we will see other possibilities.
And it's the humility that our species exists, there are about 600,000 years ago.
The Neolital revolution -- that has been reminded us us us the cold, where we gave the chicken was replaced by the price of the presension, we created a surprise, we have created a little 10,000 years ago.
And the modern industrial as we know as a 300 years ago.
Now this superficial history, I suggested that we had all the answers that we would have all the challenges that we will confront in the next millennia.
When this multi-tuned culture of the world are asked about the meaning of human human significant to 10,000 voices of voices in different voices of the voice of the world is different

He had junk the dog and improvised a main a main a main the dog and improvised a dog and improvised a dog and improvised a samphired in the excreated wise, and it has gone in the excredition, and he had to receive the same.
And we talk about it more of nothing. And this is a lot of ways, it's a symbol of the Inlooking for the Inlooking and all the poppier of the world around the world.
In the appropriate 1999, the cananabas it back to the whole thing of a big zone of the California and Texasass and Texasass together.

It's an independent territory territory all of the mineral resources.
An amazing example of how a national state can look at the national and find reparations for his people.
And finally, at the end of this, I think it's obviously at least that we traveled in these places that we have traveling in these spaces are not in the same way.
They are the payments of people.
They are the large large large large human imaginations that come from the wind ares of time. And for all of us in the dreams of the children, like the dreams of the kids' dream of hographic of hographic images of hopefully
What we tried to do in the end of National Geographic is not going to do something that ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever do something
We think polices -- we think that polices polices are not convinced that the story is not convinced the story of the world that the world can change the world, and so we are the most well.
We have 35 million visits the web every month.
156 to our nations transmit our own television.
Our states are reading from millions of people.
And what we do is a series of traveling journey in our audience in our audience in our audience that they can't be in our own own own mind-blowing of what they were seeing and hopefully ace, and hopefully somehow they would accept that would accept the world in a way to be in a way that we can find a way that we can find a way to live in a whole world in a whole world.
where the wisdom of all the poverty can contribute to our collective prosperity.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some of the things that I hope that they will reach other things that you would have to do and I heard about other things that you would have to do and I was doing some of the connections that you would have a rates.
I want to start with what I call "doctrin."
Docker-?
The whole of all of the Western society of industry.
And this is a little soon as it sounds like this: if we are interested in the good state of the citizens, the quarters, the quarter of the individual level.
The reason for this is so freedom is so freedom is enough, valuable to be a very healthy to be human.
And because if people are free and every one of us can accept and do things that are going to make good things that we have to decide in our place.
The maximum is the freedom is the mass of choices.
The more people have choices more people have choices more freedom of freedom of freedom of the more freedom of the bodies have a board tricky.
Then, I think, that it's so good at the system that we would not get to anybody in the case of a house to put it on the dozen in the end.
And it's deeply to our lives in our lives.
I'll give you some examples of what did is doing for us for the progress in the last time.
This is a supermarket. It's not a very large market.
I just want to tell you about two words for saving the savings for saving it.
175 sets for saving in my supermarket, that if we don't socket and the 10 different kinds of watts and the 10 kinds of waters and 12-hour of whereas you can buy their own own lights that you can buy their own own in a very small number of people in a very small number of the 175 that no matter in the same way in the store that no matter how much the store is the store not the satisfaces.
So it's the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronic components to make a sterect, you know, a stereo -- CD -- CD -- mobile kitchhio -- moves the moon the mobile phones.
And in this electronic store of electronics are a stereo.
We can configuring out of a different systems in the components of the components that are in the office of a single store.
You have to recognize that this means a lot of options.
In other fields -- in the world of communication.
There was a little ever, when I was a kid, where you could get any kind of a vast service as much as it was offered as long as it was offered by Ma Bell.
You can take the phone.
By the way, one of the consequences of this actually never get the phone was never both.
And those days are a lot of apuse.
Now we have a little diversity of this is almost immediately immediately in the world of mobile phones in the world of mobile phones of us are a lot of us in the world of us.
These are the mobile mobiles of the future.
My previous is the one -- MP3 player, with MP3 player, they have a little boy in the husband and the same.
And if you saw it wasn't going to be seen in the store, you can stay in the stories, because in the cure of it.
And the result is that it makes people to get into the store, and put this question.
And you know what the answer to the question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to buy a phone that you don't know it too much.
And in other life-life areas that are much more important than bugs that are being buying the number of options of options.
The health system -- in the United States is not the case you go to the doctor and you tell you what to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor and say, well, we have a variant's varianta B.
It has these rise advantage and these risks.
BBe has these risks and these risks. What do you want to do?
And you say, "Doctors, what to do?" And the doctor says, "He has these advantags and these risks and the risks and the risks and the risks and the risks and the risks and the risks of this.
What do you want to do?
And you say, "But if you were in my place, you know, you could you do what you do, the doctor says, "But I'm not at the place you saying, "Momin." And the result of what it does a park thing is a thing.
But what is actually a transition of responsibility and decide whether it's a lot of decision that knows something -- in this case, the doctor -- anyone who don't know anything and it's almost not in the best and it's not the best form of the decisions -- in this patient.
There's a huge level of advertising in the reette with reette to the people like me, and as you think a little bit of a lot, which if you don't know it.
Why do we advertivists whether we can't we buy it?
The answer is that the people who are doing that is expect to call the doctors in the morning in the morning and ask them to change our networks.
Something that our identity has become a problem now has become a role of choice, and this transition of show.
And that we don't change the identity is not the possibility of it.
And we can reinvest to us all of the cruelton.
And this means that every day when you go to the people are going to be able to decide what you want to do.
With the whole thing for the marriage and family has been a eaten that was actually the people who had to go to the way that the pipeline that you have to get kids as you get kids as you start to have children as much faster.
The only option was with dinner, not when you do it after that.
But in our days, everything is very close to the remote of it.
I mean by some of the incredible students and give them 20 percent less than I did 20 percent less I do.
And this is not because it would be less than it would be less of a little map.
Do you think they're concerned with all kinds of questions "should be truly to be doing to do with this?
I should be able to get to the kidney? We should have children, or a car? We all of these are questions that consumption.
And they will respond to these questions, whether that means not that if they don't do all of the ones that give them and not a good note to the curves of the curves of the curves of them.
And this is what you have to do. These are important questions that you have to respond to the point.
I work -- we are been, as the Sublinine and Carl and Carl and Carl with every minimal every minute in every minimal in every day in every day -- less on the Watch in any less than Hotel, less than Hotell Randph.
And by the way, there's a area in a core of a corner, which I haven't revealing the wireless of the widow.
I don't tell you about it because I want to use it.
So this means that this incredible freedom of choice that we have to choose to work with work, is that we need to take a decision, and again, and wow, and if you should be able to work and if you should do it.
We can go to see how our little football and we have the mobile and a mobile buzzzzle in the other and the laptops, and laptops, and laptops,
And even if all of the mind, in every mind, where the guy is that the guy is moving a fire of fire football of us to answer this water?
Do you have to answer this email of the email of this letter?" And even if the answer is that the question is that the question is that the experience of your song of your song will be very different from how you would be very different from how you would have been not been very different from what it would be without them.
So anywhere in the world, and these big things and things that are doing and things that are a lifestyle of options.
And the world I was living at this.
So we had to say that we had some choices to do it, but it wasn't a different thing.
And the world where we live now looks like this.
And the question is, is that good or or wrong?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what it is good at this, so I will talk about what I am going to talk about what is wrong.
All of these elections have two negatives in the people.
One of the effects of paradox, it's product, it's product, rather than release than release than release.
And so many options that can choose to choose to choose to choose to opposite for something that is that
You offer a very significant examples of about the investment of the private investment plans in private investment plans.
A college of my own investment has had access to the blood from Valley to Varhuge companies that has almost a million engagement company that has almost a million hits and about 2,000 sees.
And what he found is that for every 10 funds that they offer their employees to the employees of participate with two percent.
You have 50 mutually more, they were written with 10 percent less you put in a little bit of a little bit of the fire. Why?
Because for 50 mutually mutually the naive of the naid to choose to choose what they call it a little bit of choice that they can go out and eat the dows.
And then on the poor and then the hour and then the hour and the hour and the hour and the fact that this is that the load, and of course, it never come in.
You know, you don't just mean that they don't just mean that they will consume the food for dog dog because they don't have enough money to put money on the way to put a decision is so hard money to make a decision-making decision-making decisions of money from the compension is so hard to make the compenation of the compenses that would offer the employment.
And I was looking at the bottom of the legs to 5,000 dollars a year from the employees of the employees of the employees of compenses.
So the creature is a consequences when you have too much options.
And I think that does that make the world show like this.
You want to take the best of the choice if it's for all the ethernity, right?
You don't want to choose to choose or even the one of the wrong or even wrong.
So this is a second is that the second is that if we were able to keep the station of the brings and make a choice to be less elected to the result of choice than we were going to be less satisfy to the election of choice.
And there are some reasons for this.
One of them is that we had a lot of snoses for saving if you buy one of the one and it's not -- and it's not -- and you know, who is perfect?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be a different choice. And what happens is that alternatives you imagine, and what you can imagine regret of choice that you can imagine that you can imagine that you can imagine that you get out of the satisfaction that you get to the election of the election that you get a good decision that if this was a good decision that you have been a good decision that you have been a good decision.
The more options of option, the more easy to regret to regret something that is disappointment you have a little option that you have alese.
Second, what economists call for opportunity for opportunity.
Dan Gilber has shown in this morning in this morning talking about how we can see things that depends on what we compared to the things that we compared to what we compared to them.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative alternative to take in the way to imagine the features you think about the characteristics of alternative alternative attackers that rejection you can get less satisfied to less satisfied with the alternative that you have a little bit of satisfying of alternative attack.
Here's an example. I ask for the people who are not New Yorkes'
But here's how should we die to rational
We have this box in Hamptons.
A very expensive.
You know, they have a wonderful day day day. They have all the way to do.
What could they want to want to save it is thinking about dract.
All of my neighborhood in Manhattan are lead.
I could just park in the front of the office." And I spend two weeks of the idea that the idea that the rates of the point that wonderful park to have a place of parking parking parke.
The opportunity of the village of the satisfaction that we have to have a choice is actually the exceptional.
And the more options of them are doing in the same characteristics of these options are going to be perceived as we will be perceived as a lot of opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon tells a lot of things.
We should be living in the mom, and probably we should be doing things at the slow.
But one of the things that say is that anybody choose is that you don't do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things that are going to do what you do you do what you do you do what you do you do is less attractive to the active.
Third spending the expectation.
And that was when I wanted to replace to replace my blue.
They are about all the time.
And there was a lot of eating that they were one and you buy them and you buy them and they were stuck and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you had to get them and if you have, and if you had to stay better, and they were starting to safe.
So I went to replace my kids after I had to replace for the old and I said, "Look, I want to say, "Look, I want a wall of the judgment of my good." And the windows, and the windows, and the windows,
Do you want to have nine guns or with farm or your fall?
Do you want to be gonna be able to do that?
You want to avoid them, you want to rights, you don't want to get it.
He said, "My face after I said, "I want to return to be the guy who were not the same guy who were not a idea that I had a idea that I had spent a hour of the walls and I spent a orange of the walls -- the truth -- the truth of the risteps that they had.
I have been working on. All of these options have been able to choose to choose to make a little bit better.
But I was feeling worse.
Why? I wrote a book in which I tried to explain this.
The reason I felt worse is that I felt that we had all these options are available to how my expectations about how my walls have grown to be a good wall of the good people have grown up.
We had very low-expectancy expectation. We didn't have any ways,
Now when they're 100 times, my mom and one of them must be perfect.
And what we got was good, but not perfect.
So we compared what we were expected with what I expected and the result is that I was delayed in compared to what I was hopefully in the comparison.
The options of options in people who can't do something else.
And as it will take this into a little little little satisfaction even if they get good results.
No one in the marketing world doesn't know that.
Because if you didn't know what I didn't have an idea about what I talk about.
The truth is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was wrong is that when everything was wrong was really harder is that they could actually experience the people to expertise to expertise to experience.
Today, in the world where we live -- we live -- we live industrialized and industrialized and we have that we expect the best thing you can say is that things that you can say that things will be so good things that you can say is that things will be so much of the same as you can be so much of the same way.
You never have surprised because your expectations of your expectancy and my requires to be in the sky.
The happiness -- for that you all came up with -- the secret -- the secret to happiness is to wait for the reduse.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- that I actually have a wonderful wide -- and it's really a wonderful goodbye.
I couldn't find something better than that. I didn't have any one.
But let's expect to wait doesn't necessarily a thing that is so bad.
And finally a consequence of a bubble of a wall you can't buy a good time you can buy a single one is that when you can't buy a single one one one one one is that you don't know why that that is clear -- the answer is clear of the answer.
And the world is coming out. How could you do the do?
When they're hundreds of different style of different styles and somehow you dig a little bit of a geek and ask you why, why, why, why, do you ask what?
It's just as a clear that the answer to the question is:
You could have to choose to choose to choose to choose to make a better choice.
A hundred different kinds of things that you don't have any choice to choose not have any scale.
So when people do decisions, even if the results are good in the choices are doing good for them, they are doing these are good things.
The deerate of the operation in the world of the last generation.
I think a big contribution -- not the only important -- but important to this erupon this erupon the erupper depression, is that people are disappointed in because the standards are too high to raise their standards are too high to raise --
And when you have to explain these experiences believe they are saving.
So the general result is that the more good, and I feel better.
So let me remind you remind it.
This is the doctrines, which is that we all think about it, and it's really really really true.
Without the discussion that you have to have a few choices more than the choice is better than this is a lot of choices are better than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a vice that they have a little better than the one of the choice is to have a few choices to have a few choices to have a few choices of choices is to have a little choice than noses, but here
There's a magical. I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty sure that we went out of that point in the way that the choice is to improve our lives.
Now the idea -- almost almost finally we have been finally -- the idea that I think about it.
What it allows all these elections in the society is the good material.
There's a lot of places in the world and we heard of some of them is not a few of them is not a lot of options.
The problem is that they have too little to do it.
So the thing about talk about is a strange problem. It's a weird problem of Western societies.
And what is frustrating is this: Steve Levitself has talked about how these chachair of how these chachair and hard to installed not help.
What I tell you is that these options are in and complicated not just help.
They actually have painting.
They are really doing to feel worse.
If something that allows us to do in our society to make all the elections that we do all the way that people are transferred in which people have too little options that people are not only improved the lives of the amors.
That's what economists call the Pareto.
The income to the income to be better for all -- not just poor people -- because of the way that this excess excess of choices that excess of choices.
You know, they have the conclusion that you read this cartooner and being a sophisticated person, and you say, "Ay! What do you know about the peak of the sticks?
You know that nothing that it is possible in this active account, a migrate of the world -- so I read it in the world -- so I read it and I read it and I read it and I read it and I read it and I have no way to do it.
But the more I thought I was going to think about it as I got to think about it.
Because the truth is that if you switch for everything you can be possible, you don't have freedom of the real time.
If you selling the active that everything is possible, the scale is the sea level.
You think about the mention and the village and today.
Anyone needs you to have a range of acvarious active active active acvarious of the active active active active to have a various of the active active active active active active acvariation.
This is almost certainly too limited -- probably even for a cave, to certainly suffered for us.
But the absence of a metaphor is a remarkable of unhappy and proud for new.
Thank you very much.
