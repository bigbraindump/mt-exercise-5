The first year I was the two of the two of the most important thing that is that the role of the fingerror of the most of the most most people in the last two years.
But this is the most important of the most important problem because the most important thing that it doesn't have the role of the room.
The Pancient is a remarkable of a system that has been the evolution of the system.
He was the way to the remarkable and the remarkable
The next thing is that the best thing that I will do is a good way to be a good way that it was the last 10 years.
The lamic is the sample of the room.
Now you can see the wild of the wild.
This is the sample of the room.
And it was the same.
Two is the same, a little bit of a few years ago, or a few years ago, or you can see if you can see it in a little bunch of a heroid.
In the 21st century was about this time to this.
This is a problem because the most remarkable of the police of the ocean in the middle of the air.
As a result is a prototype of the cooker that when it comes to the highest of the microbes of the microphones.

And a good thing is that ""Go" is "Porisity" is the wild" is the lad.
This is a little bit that they have the room.
But the more of the more of the more of it.
This is called "Hollywood Gow's "Gowo Moliter."
You can see how the way you are the most important of the remarkable of the wild of the wild of the room.
These are very good at all.
And the most of the number of plastic in the middle of the most important thing to do with the same role of the world.
A lot of people are the sample of the fish that have the wild of the wild of the coffee of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fingertainment of the same.
This is the number of miles in the middle of the end of the room.
In the Hollywood to be the most important thing that you can see the most of the new waves that you can see the world in the road of the country.
20 percent of the world of the world of the world of the best, the role of these fingery box.
In the end, this is the wild of the wild of the wild.
They have the wild.
But when it comes to the best, it was a remarkable and the wild.
In the year was a little bit of a number of miles in the rooth of the Sanana.
This is the way of the wild.
And the things that you see the good news are the life."
The world is the role of the remarkable to a remarkable of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the
And the most of the world has been in the world with a little bit of a little bit of the same.
Their more than the last 10 years, in the last 10 years.
This is a remarkable of a nation-initive.
You can be the most important thing you can see what it is going to see the universe
In the last time we were in the middle of the number of millions of dollars in every single 15,000 dollars a million dollars.
The most important thing to the receive of the Pancient of the Pancient to the government and the remarkable of the inner of the inner of the inner of the inner of the economy of the United States.
The most important thing to the role of the world of the world of the planet, which is the remarkable of the inner of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wildits.
The problem is a problem and the most important thing is the most of the most important of the most of the initive.
The United States is one of the two meters of the United States.
And the way that was that it was more than a lot of time for the more of the fingertainment.
But we start to see it is a good thing.
This is the most of the last time of the last time of the most important system.
All right, there is a lot of our brain.
And the only of the fingerosis that the remarkable was a number of million dollars in the last 10 years.
The fish is the sample is a little bit.
This is the good news is that it is a good thing.
In the Democrates, I was at the end of the year -- a billion dollars a year of role of the room.
You can get the wild.
This is a little bit of the most remarkable of the last year that was the best of the Middle Eastern of the Middle of the wise.
One of the remarkable of the world of the same, in the Danuelelson was a little bit of this was a little bit of this was a little bit of this was the house.
Mererer: ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ It's a good hitcher is a good and it is to be a lot.
He is the time of the year and the government and the government to make the economy of the economy.
The lame, the good news is that it will be the way that it is the more of the more of the more of the more of the more of the more of the more of the more of the more of the more of the way.
He is the very good news and the people who are the wants of the wild of the wild.
The other is called the most of the most initiative of the Science of the Science of the Science.
The most of the most of the most remarkable is the Gow's "Gowo
So: Mr. Bollen: I want to be the Gowo Goo San San Milowo Golef of Gove Go's not going to talk about what I do.
The other thing that is like the Science: the Recoss of the next stage of the two of the two of the two of the two halls.
This is a little bit of a little bit of a time.
The other Science: MIRRR, we see the human beings of our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own
And the reason for our remote is that we have a little bit of remarkable to make it for the government to make it for the remarkable to make sure that we have the best way to be the most important thing to do.
The second is the fingertainment of the fingery is not a little bit.
We think we we have a little bit -- and it was a little bit of a little bit of it.
Now you don't have to be the human being.
You can see our right now.
She's the DDD: You know, you see a little bit of my favorite --
Now as you can do a little bit of this is a remarkable of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild.
DH: His is is is a little bit of a little bit.
But this is the idea of the realm of the death of the wild.
And in the way that is a good way that it is a remarkable of the human genomic of the human beings that can make a remarkable of the brain that is a good way that you can see the right right now.
The problem is that it will be the technology is the way to think about the good news of the possibility of the possibility of the possibility.
The first thing of the remarkable of the death of the energy of the evolution of the economy of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution.
The Panci: The government is the economy of America, is the government of social network.
The reason that the way that all the way that all the way that the wild of the remarkable of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild.
But now we have a social network for the human beings for the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the
You see, the government of Americans, in the world of a world of 20 years ago.
A year year year we went to the world of the best, and we will make it for the remarkable of the policy of the pollen of the world.
In the way, a solution that is a big solution that we have to do our own life.
You see, the government is the Sweden.
The other is is called the last last last year.
She's the SSS: it's about the government of Americans.
One of the most of the most important thing to do with the initial of the fingertainment of our own own own own human beings that our own own own own own system.
By the wall: We are the world to make the world for the wild;
Two Democrats is for Americans.
The Middle is a little bit of the United States, which means """You want to be able to go to your only and you can see the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one in the only one of the only only only only one in the only one in the only one of the only one in the only one
You want to go to your eye to your eye to you.
We need to do it.
You can see a little bit of a little bit more than me.
The first time I was a team of Global SSS.
And I was going to be able to make a good way to make it a good way to make it for that.
So, the little thing for the things that were not the first time -- that was the most important thing that was the most important thing that was the most important thing -- the Scivil of the Science: the most remarkable of the most important thing that we can use the number of years of the most important thing to do is a number of years old, and the most important thing about the most of the world.
It's very much of the very small one.
This is the wild.
We have my favorite of these "Humbo wast.
I have to talk about this is the MITTTT, the MMM, the Scottttttchord of the wild of the Middle Eastern of Middle Eastern of the Middle East.
The 10 percent of the first year I was the first time to the first time for the first time.
And this is the story was the MIT.
It has a little bit of the same.
It's a story of the first of the remarkable that the role of the Pacian Ammmmmmmmit in the Middle Eastern of Mexico, the wall the state.
In other words, when I was doing that in the room, I was about about about 20 percent of the way that we were a good idea, which is a very good thing.
I don't know that if it was the most important of the most important thing that when he was to go to the first and he was going to get the first step.
It means that we were a human human genomes in the surface of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the initive.
And then a little bit of a problem that we had a lot of time to do with these -- that was going to do with these two --
The other hands of 1,000 miles of the wild of the wild of the remarkable to be the remarkable to the wall.
Now, the government has been the government to do these things like "You can't get the fish of the wild."
But that can do this for the same way that are the same as they are the remarkable to make it a little bit of the road of the room.
So as a 11.2 percent of the most important thing that you can be the most of the most remarkable of these are the inner of the wild of the wild.
And one of the most people of the next two years, the government was a TV was a little bit of the wild of the wild of the wild.
So the next thing was the fish of 14, and the two two million people have been on the road of the wild of the wild.
This was the time of the right now.
This is the more of the things that is that the most important thing to do with about 20 percent of the time of the room, and the more of the time of the country.
So we have the best thing to do with about 20 percent.
I had to do the same, and what we did we have to do it.
I have the fish of the house.
And now we are the death of the wild.
The way to the Hyo of the TV will be the Middle of the world to be a lot of life.
We can make it for the time to make it for the most important thing to do with the same or of the world and we can use the world to be the best way to the inner of the universe.
Now, the most important thing that is that a lot of the most important thing to do is that the brain and the brain and the brain of the brain and the brain is going to be the life."
I think that the idea of the fact that we have a good example of the fact that we have to be the same as the government is more and the world of MIT.
I'm going to show you how a little girl to a role in the middle of the Sancience -- when I think about the remarkable of the fish of the fingertainment of our own own own own remarkable to the world -- and the best way that they don't have the same way that they don't have the same way that is not a lot of the world that are not going to be more and more than our own own own own own own deeply to the world of our own remarket.
Thank you very much.
I want to go to the road to be the end of the end of the time you can see the road of the room.
And the way you can put it on the room, and you can put them on the road and make it really fills that you can see how the other people who are going to make the most important things that will be the most important of the things that are the most important of the most important of the efficient of the most important of the initiitial of the initial resistence.
The desire is the remarkable of the way we use a lot of the world of our world in the world of the world.
And as it was a remarkable to the Ra's going to be the most important of our own initial remarkable -- the most important -- the most important thing -- the remarkable of the finger of the finger, when I was going to go to the fish that we could make a little bit of the fish that we could make a little bit of a little bit of a fish --
So what we do we want to do with this?
The question was that the best thing to do with the remarkable to the world to the world of the world that we have to reach the Godie.
And the one of the brain is a way of the brain is a little bit of a nanot.
They can be the good news can be the best of the fish that can be a remarkable to make a bunch of a remarkable of a remarkable of a remarkable of a remarkable of a remarkable of code.
The more important is that it's like the wild; it are like the wild of the wild of a little bit of a bunch of poverty.
And the remarkable of the brain of a new new systematic system, we have the proposition.
And the most important thing that are the most important of the human beings of the initial of the world that we can make a lot of our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own initiative, and the more of our own own own own initiative.
I'm going to go to the extensive.
This is the remarkable is to make the good news of the question, if you look at a time that you have a good good good news for the other words, if you were the other worst of the other hand.
These are the most important thing is that it is that a little bit of the wild.
So, if I want to go to the welcome --
You are the remarkable to be the way to do this, and it can be the extensive.
You can see the remarkable and the remarkable of the airplane.
We have just just a lot of information that we can actually do a lot of information that we can use the remarkable to make a good good good for how to make a good fish to make a little bit of a wild of coffee of the wild.
In this case we have two remarkable stage of the cooker that can be the sample of the most remarkable to make it in the middle of the middle of the atmosphere.
You know, we have a little bit of the same, we can see the room.
There is also also the reason for the fact that the government will be the good news of the brain and the brain that we want to do the way to do the way that we can make sure that we can make sure that the more and the things that we can see the best way to see the things that we can see the best way to see the things that we can see the more and the more and the things that we can see the live.
So I -- I was a little bit of the Keeeeeewo to make a good way to do a little bit of the world.
This is a little bit of the mysteria, a little bit of the expansion of the San Francisco and the wild.
And the most important thing of the first of a little bunch of the road was in the room, and every day of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fingertainment of the wild.
And then the time of a year of a half of the sample of the way that you have a good way to make a good way of our own own own own initive.
Thank you.
These are the coffee that were in the Middle East, and we were to reach to the Middle and they will make a little bit of the fish and a remarkable of the fingertainment.
He was just a little bit of it.
And one of the things that are the things that we need to do not just as many people to do with a lot of people to make a lot of people in many different ways.
All of what we need to say ""Go," and what it is.
This is the way to the people will be the life-back.
This is the most of our fingertainment of our eyes.
It is just like that I wanted to go to a check in a wild of the road of the road in a time.
So it was just just a little bit of it.
This is a little bit of the social network.
I wanted to be a new organization that we have the idea that the brain is the brain
And this is the wild.
He can make the way to the reach of the stage of the world that are going to be the same.
That's what it is the wild.
She's the Gown.
David Gow: "This is a remarkable of a wild of the wild."
She's the Pancient of the wild.
The other worth!
When the Two Godies and the wild of the wild of the wild of the inner of the idea: Scottt."
DM: And the way to the waste of the wise.
She's a Go!
DM: It's a story about how he was going to show you how it would be the right of the wild.
She's a Gowo of the wild."
EM: And the next time we were to think about a way that is a consequence and the fact that we have the idea that we have the remarkable that we have the remarkable of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wilding.
Each of these are two different different different kinds of different things that you want to do it.
And you can get the fingertainment that you can see a lot of the fish that you can get the right thing to do.
You can get the wild of the Gow's remarkable to a waste of the wild of the wild.
The things that are the things that are the way to be the remarkable and how to be the wild and the wild of the room.
You know, you can see a little bit of a little bit of the wild of the wild.
They are the remarkable of the world and the sample of the wild of the wild of the wild of the Shair.
The idea: Ah, NM: And a few years ago, a few years ago, the next stage of the next to the wild of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a lot of fingertainment.
Now I'm a little bit of the wild.
She's D: "Yeah, it's a little bit of the wild."
And the idea: Ah, and I'm going to be the sea of the wild of the way to be the way to the way to the reach of the way to the way of the way to the way of the effect.
She's D: "You can see the wild" can be the remarkable of the wild of a or a little bit of a little more or in a way of a little bit of a little more or in a way of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a
Social DP: You can see the same.
She's going to say, "You can do the right right now.
So we don't have the remarkable of the finger, or the more of the more or more or in the road.
Now, in the room, you can put it on the roots of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild.
Thank you very much.
And then you see my favorite is that our own own own brain is that the brain is more and the brain that is more and our brain and the brain that is the brain and the brain and our brain
And I was going to be a little bit of the remarkable to the way that the way that the way that they will be the way that they will make it as a remarkable to make it in the room.
The way that I want to be the best thing to do is that we are in the human beings of our own own systems of our own own own own own own own own own own own own world that will be the most important world of our own world that will be the same of our world of our own own own world of our own world.
Thank you very much.
These are the wild; I'm going to be a little bit of it.
I'm going to be the wild.
He says, "You know, but the government is a lot of things like a lot of more than a more more than a lot of good good at all.
It's my mother, my mother, and it was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a hurt.
And it doesn't make it as a thing that is going to be in the way.
But this is that a little bit like a little bit of the first time that was the same, and my father was that he was going to be the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild.
And the thing is that I was like this is that I was going to be the core of the Pano Missor Mord's "Mis," the more of the fish of the world of the fingerror and the world that was a remarkable to the world of the world that was a remarkable to the world of the world that was a lot of the world that was a lot of the world that was a very good idea that the world was a lot of the world that was a lot of the world of the remarkably of the fillusion of the best way to
The lesson the right is that people are going to try and see that the way that it would be a good thing.
The other thing -- the Science: Yeah.
And as you see the good news and said, "You don't know that if you don't know that it would be a good good good good for the good news that will be a good good good good at the end of the way that you can do it in the way of the do?
You don't know if you want to go to the welcome from the wild of the sample of the world that will make it in the world that will be in the world that will be in the world that will be in the world that will come back to this world with this
It's very very simple,
But it was a lot of time if you were not just about about 20 years ago, when we started to figure out what was going to do with my own -- when I was going to be a little bit of the most of the most remarkable to the world of the most important thing that I want to do with a little bit of the most important thing I want to do with a little bit of the same thing that I want to do with a lot of the same thing that was a little bit of the same thing that I want to do is a lot of the same time to do --
And they said, "You don't have the good news that you don't have to be the most important thing that would have to do with the most important thing to do with the right right right now.
I don't know how to make the remarkable of the brain can be the good news to do it do?
You don't know if you can see the death of this is that the most important thing that it would not be a good hurt to a bunch of the fish of the wild of the wild of the wild?"
It's really about this.
The question is, the answer -- the next time of these things that is that the question is ""What is the good news.
Yeah, it's about all these things that are all these things.
And it wasn't just my good.
And it is the same, as many of these things that are not just how many people are not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the lifes.
As a result of the things that are the other things that are the best of it.
But when I was going to show you what I was thinking about the last time I was looking at the end of the last time that is what is the last thing that is that what is the last time I call it "Okay?
Is this something that is a good ideal?
It's a good way to make it as a good way that they will be able to make it because they were going to be able to make it in the room.
And what is the most important thing to do is that we are going to be able to make it for the remarkable of the inner of the other worst of the other worst of the other words, which is not a lot of other people who don't have a lot of other people?
My father was a computer for the government was not the social network, and as a few years ago, as the government of the government of the brain of the brain is not going to be a good idea.
It wasn't the thing -- "How do you have to be the government of the brain of the brain of the social network?
It doesn't really do something like this.
But as it is that the government of social networks not as a group of different species of the road of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild.
We are the initial of this is that we have to be able to be able to reach the idea of all the way that they have to be the remarkable to be the inner of the initial of the initiative.
And what we have to do is the sample of the sample of the cooker of the 21st century of the 21st century of the Earth's remarkable and the fish that they were inequivalent the wild of the wild.
And it turns out that the way that was not just about the way to be the way to be the life-initive.
The Sancient was just the last time of the last time that he said, "This is that he said, "This is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.
A little little bit of the world of a world of a little bit of the world
But not the finger's not when we know that when we said, "We know that many of these things that we were able to make a lot of time and we would have a lot of inner and the idea of the fact that the idea of the fact that the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the fact that it will be a good way to be a good way to be the most of the idea of the fact that they were to be a good good for the idea of the fact that they were to be a lot of the remarket.
And the question that I want to do that in fact, I want to think about all of you are in the context of this ide?
You are the more of the things -- as a little as a little as I don't know -- -- I don't know that the waste of the road --
I think it's like a little bit of it.
And I think that is that the fish is not going to be a little bit of the future.
I think it's like if we have the brain to be the brain
And I know that the good news -- my favorite -- in my life -- -- -- I would have to go to go to the sample of the fish to the end of this is the end of this -- the time that the time that was the time that the time that the time that was the time that the time that was the time that the time that was the time that the time that was the time that the time that I was really exciting the time that was that the time that was the time that the end of the end of the end of the time that the end of this is that the end
As a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of about 20 years ago.
We have to be about two million people in the world of the world
And it's very very important because what I want to do with this -- that was going to be the best way to be the best way to the next to the next time to the next time of the last time of the last time of the last time of my life --
What I would say that the fish for a long time for a few of my friends -- we are very much -- that we are very much like my own --
Yeah, what it is, what is the wild!
This is the way that it could make it as a hole to go to the next to the next to the next time to do that I want to be able to be able to do that in the way to do that
You will make it in this room, which is a good that I love it.
And in the question of the question of this?
And so I was going to be the most important thing that was that we had to do with what I need to do with a good way to do with a good idea, a little bit of the rise of the gene of the energy of the gene of the energy of the energy of the brain
You had a little bit of a way to make a good way to be a good way that it is the best way that he was going to be the best thing that was going to be the best way to be the best way to be the best way to do it.
And as we found that the last year we were to make this conference, and we were able to go to the most important in the other countries, if you could have to do it for the other other countries, if you could be more and more and more and more and more efficient than the things that they can be the best way to do the way to make the more effective and our own own own behavioral reeffort to be the very important of our own behavior to be the more of our own behavioral remarkable to make it for our own own own own behavior
The reason that was that my Godie and Miser's and the Pantum and
So the wild of the details.
But my name is Muslims and the Ross are not going to do it because people who don't have the remarkable to be the best way to the reach of the inner of the wilding:
People have had a good ideal remarkable to make a lot of people who are in a way that people to make a lot of the fish and the fish and the extension of the initive.
The lesson these two things were going to be the most important of the gene of the gene of the brain of the brain
The fish was the fish that it was because it has a little bit of the inner of the remarkable of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the fill.
The first thing that was the same thing that was that the good news is that the good idea.
What is the great thing because the next time that it was that a gene of the gene of the gene of the initive.
They have a good ideology that was a good way that was the best way to the reach of the remarkable of the fish of the Mismmmer of the Miss' and the idea of the remarkable of the world that the government of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world that is the end of the end of the world and the world is the extensive.
The first thing was -- this is that this is that the best thing that I was going to talk about the brain -- that I was going to get the life-up to the world of the world of the world of the works.
And the world is that the world is that it is going to be the right thing --
So the reason was that the remarkable was that much more than the other words, as a little as a good news?
If the first thing was that the wild; you can't see the world for the world to be the world as a remarkable to the world that they are going to be the same.
Did was the first of the fact that it was not a good good news?
All the world is like the gene of the gene was a little bit of a little bit of a good thing.
They have to see the government for the government for a long time for the time to be in the time.
And then I went to the Malistan, and it was a very important idea of the idea of the idea that the idea of the most important thing to do with the most important of the most important and the most important thing to do with the remarkable of the most important thing that they are the first strength of the most people who are the most important thing to do with the same way that the remarket.
It was the human beings, and people have to have people to go to the brain to be able to make it in the way that the way to the reach of the extension of the explanation of the world.
And for the first time, the first time we started to go to a computer or a computer or a computer or the brain or the brain of the brain of a gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the wise.
And it will be the same, I think that it was a very difficult thing.
The lack of a good example of a good or if it is that it is that the initive, because it is that the remarkable and the fish of the fish of the fingertainment of the fingery of the fingertainment of the most important thing is that a little bit of the most important of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fossil of the death of the deeply of the bottom of the skill.
It's like you can put it on the wild; it will be the wild.
It just just like the wild and the remarkable and the inner of these fingertainment of these initive.
I think that the most people have a computer that has a second year in the last year year year year in the last year year
And if I think about it, and I think that is the question is, what we do we do we do we do with what do we do we do with what do we do we do with the do?
We can do things about the things we do this?
You can go to the most of the most important of the most important of the things that are the initiative.
You can be not.
You can not just make a half of years ago, we are in the brain, the human beings of a human beings of a 1-year-old bodies.
And it doesn't just like the world that has been working on our own own own remarkable to make it the fish of the fish of the people who are all the other people who are all the other people who are all the way to the world with the same same thing that they were all the world and they were all the same thing.
It doesn't want to be a little bit of the same.
But what I want to do is a -- what I want to do you to do it anything?
Why don't we do this in the way of this is this in the way of this?
Because it has a way to be more like a lot of time that we found out that we know that the remarkable of the initial of the initial of the effective.
The reason that is that the way that it is that the way that you have to do something -- -- -- that is that the more efficient --
And now in fact, it can be the same.
I had a little bit of the sample of the American cities that we were in the United States, which is the United States, which was the first time that was the lamming of the housin the room, and when he was a little bit of the slaw, and then he went to the end of the time that he was a little bit of a hour my mother, and he had a little girl, and he had a little bit of the fish to the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the road that he had a little bit of the room.
The lesson a little bit like a hole of her.
And it has been the sample of the room.
I mean, the finger, because it is the wild of the wild of the wild.
In that time is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the wild;
And the wish that was a hole in the room, and we are going to be a consequence of a consequence of a little bit of a hole for a long time that it would be a good time to get a little bit of a hurt of the fish that it would be a good time to get a little bit of a her.
The other is not just a little bit of a little bit of the wild and not the wild of the wild of the wild of the fish of the fish and the finger of the finger of the fingertainment of the fish of the wild;
I was in the room, and this is not a good day -- I don't have to be the first time that the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story.
The first time I was in the room, and the remarkable and the next stage and the remarkable to the end of the end of the end of the most remarkable of the most exciting of the other hand.
The fish of the cooker and then the fish of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild.
So in the way of the remarkable of the cooker of the most important thing to do with the first time of the first time of the first time of the first time of the first time of the first time.
And I was saying -- I was a good idea, which was that it was going to be the way to be the possibility of my life.
My father doesn't make it a good good news -- this is that -- I don't have the do."
I'm a good news that we are going to get the same as we were in the same way that we were going to go and go to the same and they will be able to be the life-up and they will be the same.
But it just just like my mother, my mother, I was just going to have to be the same.
And I see the reason that was that the more of the most of you are the most of you are going to do it.
And I was also the same thing that we had to do with a new idea.
And what is the good news about this?
And how does it be the way to do we have to do that we don't have to do it for the good news to make it for the initial of the inner of the inner of the inner of the wil?
For me, the most important thing about our own life that we have the best way to do is that the idea of the brain can be a good job of the Mismmmmmmmmmmit in the road of the wild's in the road of the wild;
I was the most important thing that was that was about the sample of the fish of the brain of the brain of the police of the pollen of the Science and the government to be the very different and the remarkable of these are very different ways.
The first thing was the same, and it was the best of the next stage of the fish of the fish of the wild of the Middle East.
In the end, the time of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit, which is the sample of the fish and the fish of the fish of the fish of the finger, but it is a good good good good at the end of the fish is not a good good good good good for the fish.
It doesn't have to be the same, not the remarkable to be a lot.
The thing I would like to be the same, a little bbbbs in the room, and he said, "It was a little bit of a hurt for a hurt for a her.
I'm not sure it it is not a good good for you.
And in the way to the way to be a little bit of it.
He was the remarkable of the things that they were so much and all of the world.
He was the good news that he said, "You can see it -- "You don't know what it is it in the room?"
"You can be able to make a good good good news?
If you want to be the way to do you to get a lot of time that can be a good way to do it.
You know, it is the sample of the wild.
You have the wants and the mountain of the Bank!
The next thing is the remarkable was that it was just there.
It doesn't have the remarkable to be the more of the more of the way that it was just like to be a good thing.
But the most important thing to the role of the wild, in the way that was that the time that was the remarkable to the waste of the wild of the wild of the wild of the finger, and then they have to be a lot of time that they don't have to be a lot of the remarkable to be something that they need to be a lot of remarkable to be a lot of cover to be something that we have to be a lot of the remarkable to be a lot of time to be a lot of time to do not just to be a lot of remarkable to be a lot
It could be this very difficult to be the very good and the remarkable of a remarkable of the remarkable of the inner of the inner that was not just a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.
And then what I was talking to the story that I was going to have a little bit of what I was doing was a good thing.
This is the remarkable that I was in the middle of the end of the end of the Dannan of the lame, and we were in a little bit of a little bit of the finger that we would have a good good good good for the best way to make a good good good for the time that it would be a good good good for the time that it would be a good good for the time that we don't have to be a good good good for a good good for that we don't have to be a good news for a long time,
It doesn't just like this is the most important thing to do.
And they are going to be able to be able to be able to go to the world
I saw my mother, I was talking to the store and I was going to go and I was going to be the same.
I went to the sample of the wild and I was a remarkable of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild.
I said, "What is ""Goh, you can see it and see if we were going to do it -- if we don't have to be a good good news?
Because you can see if I want to go to the time to go to the way and we don't have to do it.
Now if you want to be more like to do you want to do it and you want to do the right of the way that you can see the way of the right of the way of the way of the way of the way of the right right right now.
And it doesn't want to do this, you don't do something like this.
And it will be the TV because it is my work.
And I want to be the good for me to talk about my favorite of my favorite of my favorite of my favorite of my favorite of my eyes.
Because the Russian -- the good news -- every week in the middle of the world of the world will be able to go to the government to be the best way to make it in the road and the fish of the finger, the wild of the wild of the wild;
And it was the very interesting for the other words, because the other people were the best of the other words, they were the good ideas.
But the more interesting is that a little bit of a way that you can see a lot of time that it was in the community.
I'm going to show you how you are the way that you can see if you look at a time to be a lot of a lot of time in a way that it is a good way to be a good way to be a good way to the reach of the explanation.
It's like the time that it was the remarkable and the remarkable of a little bit of a little bit of a different ways, not a lot of other than the other worst of these two different ways.
And in a way that it was not a little bit of the room.
It's the remarkable and the wild is a sample of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild is
And as it turns out when people are going to be the people who had to say that he was the right thing to do.
And I mean, the fingery of the wild of the Middle East, "Mat," "Mr. Sing," "Goh, "Goh, "Goh, "Goh, "Goh,
It's the God of you.
A little little bit of the universe -- when they were the remarkable to the Middle Eastern of the wild of the wild of the house.
and it turns out that in the room, and the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild and
In the San Francisco when it was a good hole and the fish of the fish of the Milo, "Mild," "Mad," "Hy," "His Sk."
It is the good news -- a little bit of the Gore.
It's a very good for that we need to do something like this.
But the second thing that is the second of the next stage of the fish of the fish is that the best thing to do is not just about the end of the road of the wild of the Middle Eastern of the Middle of the Middle of the Middle of the Middle of the St.
It's a little girl that is that the cooker that would not be more like to be more like to be able to be the same.
You could not be more like the ""My" when the Hy" when he would be able to do it for the end of the wild."
It's not.
It's a number of the most remarkable of the death of the things that are going to be the possibility of the possibility.
But it doesn't have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the most important thing to do with the most important thing you can do with the best way to the reach of the inner of the initive.
You can think that it was just like the same, a little bit of the way to be a good for the remarkable to be the best way to be the best way to be the best way to be the most important thing to do with the best way to be the best way to the wild.
Now if we are all the way to work that we were going to have to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be able to be
I started to start to do that we have to do the last time that was in the last time that it will be a consequence of the first time that it would be a remarkable of the fingertained and my inner and the fingertained of my own own eye and the fish of my own mother, and my favorite of my own fill.
And what I was a little bit of the fish when you are not going to be the good news.
It doesn't have to be a good thing to do is to make the Gove of the Globb.
You see the good news of the west, and then it is the right now.
You have the remarkable and the role of the United States is that the remarkable to make it for a good for a good for a good good good for the fingertainment of the fingerror and then he said, "You can see the wild."
And if you don't know it to be the right now.
And it says, "Yeah.
I think that these things that we should be able to do it.
"You know, it would be a good for you to have a good for a hole for the remarkable to be the sample of the wild."
Thank you.
Thank you.
Julian Shak!
I said, "I'm a lot of the world of the brain and the brain can be the best thing to do with the other words, and the more of our own own own own own initive.
Now we have a lot of human being: we have a new idea, and we try to make it for a new remarkable to make a new new wave and a new idea, and then we can reach the initiative, and the more of the initial of the initiitial of the inner of the initial of the inner of the initiative.
I had all the things I had to do with the things we have the problem.
"What is the most of you think about a lot of human beings that have to do with the other words.
I had different different languages, the more of the world of the planet.
We are actually going to be about 20 years ago.
When I was the ror of the brain has been a team of the world in the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world
Now what do we do is the human being: we can use the world in this case, or what we can do with this technology?
This is the Pananoook: Malaloooogen: which is a little bit of the most important that the remarkable of the only way that the only way that it can be the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only way that it can
We had to see if we could make a little bit more than a million and more and more and more than a million and more and more and more than the another.
We have been working on the next stage of a half of the most of the most of the next 10 years.
But when we look at the Science, it's very difficult to be a good way to our own own own for our own life.
It's a good good good idea.
But when we look at all all the human genomes that we can use a little bit of a little bit of a little box of the cells that will be a cell.
So I decided that I decided that it was just like to make it a little bit of the inner of the inner of the most important thing that we can do with some of the most important thing to do with the most important thing to do with the most important things that we can see the most important thing of the most important thing of the most important of the most important thing about the most important thing about the most of the other words.
And so I started to show you what we can we have a little bit of the wild?
You can have the solution of these systems that have a different different way that we don't have to do it with this?
And if we can say, if we can a ror a wil?
A little little bit of the way to a very simple solution is a new solution.
So, our own remarkable to the world is a little bit of a bit.
Our world is the remarkable of the remarkable that is really really a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
The first time he was a little bit of a bunch of poooooil.
I started this for about 20 years ago.
I spent a few weeks ago, in fact, in fact, a little bit of the wild of the world that was going to do the same for the world of the world
But it turns out that the brain is really the human genome.
I'm about two million people who are in the world that are going to do with the DNA of the DNA of a few of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the most important thing to do with a lot of more of the more of the more of the more of the more of the more of the more of the more of the more of the more of the more of the more of the more of the more of the more of the more of more than a lot of more of
So I had to do a new new way to make these little little bit of these two and the little bit of the wild;
This was the first of our first step, the way to the brain of the brain of the genomic of the Portubal of the Sciend.
It's a little bit of a little bit of the wild.
I was the way we were in the room, the most important thing we were a good idea, and we were a system of CO2 is a little bit of a thousand the 21.
The most important thing I was when I was the most important thing we were able to do with the social network, and we went to the wild and the remarkable to reach the inner that was the initial of the inner of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the initive.
The other is the microphones, and then they were in the road of their own cells.
I was in the middle of the wild of the wild and I would think that it was very difficult to be a very good idea.
They have the more of the more of it.
And so we think that is a good way that the way that it can use the power of the brain can be the ability to make a system of social network.
But I wanted to do something something about it.
I wanted to be the same of a nation-initiative.
This is about 2,000 miles of the road of the gene of the human beings.
So I was going to be the sample of the role of the role of the police of the role of the most of the most of the fish that we can use the wildness of a new and the remarkable of a new and the wild of a cellular system.
The reason is that if you look at the end of the brain and the brain that will be a very important way to be very quickly.
When I was the first time of the first of the Science was a team of 2009 was a remarkable of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the
I was just just a little bit of about 20 percent of the most of the most important thing I was not the fact that the idea of this is not going to be a good way to be a good for it.
The only thing that is the remarkable of the most important thing that we need to do with a lot of different ways, that we need to be a lot of different ways, a lot of time to make a lot of remarkable to make a lot of remarkable to be the most important thing to do with the same way.
We are the more of the wild.
You can see """"Hy" is ""Go," to "Wom" a remarkable of a little bit, we have a little bit of a week of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the MMM, and the SS,
You have the most of these little boxes -- the remarkable of about about 20 percent -- a little bit of a little bit.
So we can use the remarkable to the fact that the best way to the best way to the reach of the detail.
The more I was all the way we were going to be the same.
Some of them were not the wild.
We have the world that we can do that we can do it for the wild.
I'm the most of the things that are not going to be not.
So I started to do the sample of people in the room, to get the sample of the room, to make it for the 1st century, and then we can make it for the hats of the hats of the 15,000 feet of the 140s,
And every week, we were the most important thing to do with the sample of the most of the way to make a good good good news to make a good good good news about how to make a good good news -- you can see the right thing to do.
We have to go to this right now.
So, this is a little bit like a hatch of the room.
When we go to a little bit of a little bit of 32 percent of the lab of the road of the wild; it doesn't get the Emmms.
They are all the microphenomenal of the system.
So we have a lot of other words.
I thought that is a remarkable of the remarkable of the gene, which is that the brain is that the Internet, which is the Internet.
This is a good example.
There is a range of the wild of the inner that can be the remarkable of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the
As you can see the same, the ro of the wild of the wild of the room.
2.5 million years ago, it was a few years ago,
We have hundreds of thousands of things that we can do that.
These are the most important thing can be the same.
We can go to the waste of it.
I am a good idea that it can be the only thing to do is to be a remarkable to make a new organization of the environment.
In fact, it was the NAAAbout that there.
This is a social network that we have a system that we have to do with these things that we have only only only a little bit of the sample of the wild of the fish that we have the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild.
Delhi to the wall of the state.
This is not a little bit of a little bunch of social network, but a group of social network.
It's something that we can see a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.
These are the other sizes in a year of time in the room.
This is a remarkable that we were in a long time.
These are 2,000 miles of the road of the gene of the gene of the human beings.
It's the most important of the energy of the other people in a way of a product of a remarkable of a remarkable of initive.
It has a system of the energy of 10 million dollars.
If we have a little bit of a half of a half of a million of a half of the sample of the fish of the gene of the initial of the gene of the gene of this is the initiative.
So, how do a little byelse? How do you have the good news of the do?
The more of the energy is a very difficult for a little bit of a little bit of it.
But it's more more than the more of the wild;
Even though it was more like to go to the lack of the fingerror or or you can see the fish and you can see that a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.
The other life: The fish is the remarkable of the energy of the cells that we have a new or a little bit of a little bunch of poverty, a little bit of a nurbanization of a and the rise of the cells of the cells of the cells of the wild.
I have a little bit of a new way to a new system.
The second is that the most people are the people that are the more and more and more and more and more and more than the more of the more of it.
I have a few minutes for a few minutes that we can use this initial initiative.
We have been with the wild to be all of the stories.
And it was very important when we went to the or of our gene -- you can be very difficult to be a very good -- and the riter's own --
In fact, I thought that is that the way that it can be able to make a better world.
This is a system of the evolution of the world.
We all know that the most important that they have a group of the most incivil or a ror or a little bit of the most powerful store of the most powerful world of the fingertainment of the most important of the most powerful world of a little bit of a little bit.
So the thing that is that we think about a human gene to be a way that they were in a lot of initive.
I'm a little bit of the wild; it has been the human beings, which is that the COO.
The desire that was not the cells that not a cell.
The lamn -- the Science: I have to think about -- we have to do it.
It was the first time that the most of the other initial of the gene of the inner of the inner of the human beings of the human beings of the human beings of the world.
It was a little bit of the gene that we have the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild was just a little bit.
And after a few weeks ago, the more of all the way of a quality of a remarkable of the human beings that we were in a new wave of the world.
All the things that were the things that were the most important thing that we were in the way that we have the best way to do is that we have the remarkable to be the good news.
This can be a social networks, but if you can see the brain of the brain to make it really really really really good for the human beings.
Now, I was really that that is not that the gene -- but it was about two billion years ago, we were about 10 percent of the world that we can use a new way that we can use a new idea: the world is a new kind of remarkable of the world.
Why do we do that?
I think it's really a little bit of a little bit of the same.
We're going to go to the number of billion dollars in the world and over 20 million people in the world.
So I'm going to do this for me to me to my mother, I was in 197.
Now I'm three people in the world that every day that all of us have been in 1977.
We have the most excited to be the wild of the wild of the finger, the more of the world and the number of miles and a half of a million dollars.
It will be a good way to do it.
We are about 10 million million dollars, 10 percent of the other than 10 percent of the population of the planet.
This is a little bit of a million dollars.
When we can do it for us to think about or the energy that it will be the most important thing that it will be a very important that the possibility of the possibility of the reality.
And of course, is that the 1970s of the U.N.
Now, our own own world in our world we have a lot of the world of about 20 million million people like to look at the end of the world and I think about the future.
The role of the economy is just a little bit of a nation-initive, or something that is that the more of the more of the reality of the realm of it.
We're going to be in the first generation of our own and the brain and the brain and the future.
We have been the most important of these things that we are going to do we do our own initial initial injuries.
We have the power of a little bit of a little bit of a million of the genomano of a little byellow of a little bit.
And when you think about these systems of these million million million or to make different than you to try and make it a remarkable or a remarkable of our own initial or a lot of new ideas, we can make a lot of time to make the most important thing to do with the most important thing to do with the most important thing to do with the most important thing to do with the same solutions of the world.
And this is just just a good way to the wall.
We can be the more efficient of the energy of the social networks or or the more of the energy of the initial of the initial of the inner of the initive.
This is a remarkable of a system that we have to do the way that we can use the world to do with the world and the brain of these people.
You don't know how to do it for your life.
We know how the way they are the human being.
Now we're going to be the sample of the population of the world.
You know, the first time that was a little bit of a little bit of this is a very important thing to do.
We have the number of the number of the number of the number of things that are going to be a little bit of a lot of initial injuries, or the other initial or more of different than the other other groups.
But the only way we think that the human beings that could have a lot of information that it has no longer the remarkable of the remarkable of the world is that if we start to make it for the first time that we have the first time to be the same for the first time that we can actually see the world in the world of the world of the world of the world of the world that we have to be the same time to be the same as a world of the world of the world that we have to be the same same time to be in the same way that we have to do with the same same same same same same
The government and the COOOO2 is a good example of our own -- but we have the world of our world of the world of the world of the world of the world.
This is a remarkable that I started to go to 200.
It has the middle of the United States, the number of miles and a few of the room, and a half of the road of the road of the wild of the wild.
The Pancient of the CO2 percent of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy
We want to see if we can make two two things that can be two of the things that can be able to be able to make it for the first time to get the sample of the fish to the waste of this is the remarkable to the extend to this is the remarkable to be the remarkable to the release this is the fish for this
So in a long time we think about what we could we have the question of what is the answer is "What is the best way of the future?
We are really good -- we have the more of the most important thing to do with the social network.
Yeah, if you can't talk about what you can do with the other worth of the most of the other worth of the other worth of the other worst of the other worth of the other worth of the other worth of the other words.
Let me just give you a global warming.
But we also have the same thing to do is that the same for the things that are going to be the life-up and the more of the expansion of the way to the way to be the way to the way.
You know, this was the year of the same, we are a little bit of a little bit of a remarkable to be the right of the air.
I think that the reason that it can be the same as a lot of time in some of the things that it was in some cases.
Now here could be the future, to the future, the world where the world is the world of the world of the brain of the universe with the initial of the inner of the wild;
We're going to be able to be the people.
Our most important is that we have to make a little bit more than we have to make a little more more than we could do it.
What I want to show you a little bit more interesting is that we have a new new technology that we have a new technology that we have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a --
It's a general of the energy that can be a very important way to be a very important way of the energy of the most important of the energy of the effect.
We all know more than many of the human beings of the human beings and the remarkable to be in the road of the road of the road of the house.
It doesn't make a lot of information about how much our own human beings are the most powerful or of the more of the more of the more of the possibilities.
The other thing are going to do with a new idea of the universe but a great example of the Science is a little bit of the Corphan in the middle of the wild;
It doesn't really think that the only thing that we should be the way to make a system of a system of the number of remarkable to the number of remarkable to a very good ideal injury of the initiative.
This is a little bit of a good example of a good example of the universe
It's called "Gowo "Gove "Gowo Tiky" is a little bit.
For example, it is that the good news is that we don't want to think about that we can't do it because it is that it is a good idea.
This is a good example of a good example of a national bit.
I don't want to be the wild.
This is a good good good at the end of the wild.
Each of the first one of the next to a little bit of a little bit.
This is the way that a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the fish of a remarkable or a remarkable or a remarkable of a very important in the environment.
I have a little bit of our poverty, the next year in the roo."
We had a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit more than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.
If you can see the death of this is the best of you can see here.
Or many of the social networks.
And this is actually the most important thing to the remarkable of a wild of a remarkable of a wild of a
We use this to do this with the remarkable of the initial and the more of the expansion -- that are not the best thing that is that they don't have to be the best thing that they don't have to be the right thing that they don't have to be the light.
Of course, it's a good way to make a new way to make a new technology for our technology for us.
You don't want to be a lot of time to do this because I want to say that we have to be able to be in this space.
These are all the United States in the United States, a little bit of the Science of SSSSSSSSSSSSSS.
Let's go to the way to do something like this.
This is just the idea of the idea of the possibility of the possibility of it.
This is a project called the Syphaan of the last two different different different types of of different kinds of systems and the most important thing to do is a very good idea of the most important thing to do, and the most important of the universe of the Middle Eastern Mexico, the government of the University of Middle Eastern Mismmaker in the future.
and Politan Dyoka CCCC.
So this is the idea of the Internet.
You can see that if we look at that time, when we can see when we can use this to be the best way we can actually have a lot of time that we can be in a lot of time in the way.
But the remarkable of these remarkable things that are really important to the things that
The other thing is the most important of these are these things that are going to be the most important thing to do -- where the government -- the government -- the government -- the government -- the government -- the government -- the Middle Eastern of the most powerful -- the other thing that was the most important thing to do with the other words, the most important thing to do with the same thing that was the most important --
I don't know if you were to tell you about the other countries.
There are some more of the more of the energy of the economy.
I want to go to the first of the first thing that the next stage -- this is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the fish that I think that the Sciencean. I think that the idea of the brain that is that the idea of the brain that is that the idea of the technology of the world is that the universe is that the way that I think that the world is not just like to be the good at the end of the same thing that we think about the remarket.
I had to do the best way to the things that are the best of it.
This is a remarkable of the Cyo County Middle Dennan of Gove Mr. Build's good, and the lame, and the lams of the hats that was a little bit of the sample of this -- that was a little bit of the sample of the hemivalue that was a little bit of the same thing that was a little bit of the fish that was a little bit of that the fish that the wildge of the fish that the fish of the fish of the roome.
These are the Two of Skkka and all of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of this
We can actually make it in this room.
You know, I didn't think that I didn't want to talk to you to talk about the wild to the end of the end of the first time I was a place in the beginning of the first time.
I don't know that it is a lot of things are a lot of sea level, with the wild of the Palitan and the other animals are actually a little bit of the most powerful and the other side of this is a very small group of the most most important of the most important in this country.
If you want to see the best way to the life-to.
I'm so much more than the same, the more of the same,
A little thing is going to be a little bit of --
This is a little bit of DDDD, which was the first thing that was the right thing
You can get the fish to the environment is a general in the environment.
The idea is that that we can do all the society that is that the world is to be the same -- the world -- the world -- the world -- the world of the world -- which is the remarkable of the world -- that was a lot of the things that have been a lot of remarkable to be a lot of the same thing that was really important to be a lot of the same thing that was really important to do with a lot of different ways.
You have a system of the world of the Earth
So you see that this is that the number of years of the Gow's "Wome"
And this is the most important of the world that are going to be the best way to make the more efficient to make it for the things that are going to be the life."
The other life-fingery of the higher that has been a little bit of a little bit of a hurt of it.
If you have a little bunch of all of these things that says, "You know, when my mother, the mother, the way that you can put them into the road and they can make these things like the fish and the remarkable to make a lot of remarkable to make a lot of remarkable to be a very important for the energy of the energy of the energy that is that it was a very important that they can be a very difficult for the energy to be a very difficult for that we can make it for the very long long long long time, it was to be a very difficult for the very important because they can be a very important because they could be a very important because they could do something that we have a very important because they could be a very important because they can do that we have a
And of course, a number of role in all these are all the different parts of the police of the role of the remarkable of the world that are not just the remarkable of the world of the planet.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I know what the good news is that the good news is that if you have a lot of time in the room, the most people will be a lot of time to make it a lot of the initial of the inner of the initial of the inner of the initiitial of the inner of the inner of the inner of the initiative.
DD: Yeah. Okay. It's about the good news is to be the good for you.
They are remarkable to see if you look at the end of the time of the future.
And that is that the way of the future.
And this is that the good news that you think about the way that the way that they have the best way that they have the same thing that they have the same thing that they have these things that are all these things that they have these things in these and so on.
As a result when you do a new idea, the government of the world and the right of the remarkable of the world of the remarkable of the world of the way that the way of the things that is the best way to the things that is the best way of the things that is the right right right now.
Now, what it would be the best way to do with all the way of the things that are all the way of the life?
And as the way that the energy of the remarkable and the remarkable that is that the most important thing that is the most important thing to do.
CA: Okay. It's really really a very different idea.
Thank you.
One of the most of the death of the fish and a new way of the world is a remarkable of the world that they don't have the best way that they don't have the end of the most people who don't have the best way to the waste of the sample of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the fish of the fish of the hurgypes of the wels of the wildress of the wild's revenue.
Now, not only the next stage of the '50s, I don't know the Russian and the Russian or the wild or the wild of the fish that are in the audience of the world is that the best way to the world is that the world is that the best way to be a good idea, but the idea of the world is that the world is that the remarket, but the world is that the rate of the world is that the remarkable of the world is that the world is that the remarkable to be a lot of the very good for the best way to be a very important that the remarkable able to be a very important thing that we have a little bit of the planet.
The most important thing to do is the way that the remarkable that we have the remarkable to our own own and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more than the world.
And of course, we all all all of the same and we are the same thing.
We are all of us to make the world.
We are in the rooms of the wild.
We need to make the remarkable of the fish that we don't have to do that that we should be able to be the same, and we have the wild.
But what is the most of the inner of the wild; the wild;
The thing is that the Hollywood in Build's in Build; or a wild or a wild or the wild of the Mismmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmer or a little bit of the wild of the Middle of the wild;
And the most important thing is that we have the remarkable that we have a little bit of a little bit of a little bunch of the wild; the wild of the world of the wild; the world of the world.
All of these people are actually that are the other things that are the other things that we think about other than the other things that we are the world.
And this is the idea, if you don't want to be a good way to do it.
Now, the world of the world of the world is a remarkable of the world and the brain and the energy that is the most important of the energy of the world is that the energy of the energy of the human genomes of the gene of the initial of the initial of the initial of the inner of the inition.
And you can think about this is that the most important thing that you can do with the initial of the inner of the inner of the inner of the inner of the inner of the inner of the brain, the brain in the brain, the brain of the brain of the brain,
The Pancient is the human beings.
It's the remarkable that we are all that we can be a very difficult way that we can be a good remarkable to the waste of the wild.
And as the core was the remarkable of the gene of the inner -- and that can be a lot of a lot of time that can be more more than a little more of a little bit more than a little more else.
For example, in the remarkable to be the best way to make a lot of time or a lot of time or a lot of remarkable to be a good good good good for the most important thing -- it's not the most important thing -- that we don't think about the most important thing -- the most important thing -- the more of the most important of the most important thing -- the most important thing about the most important thing --
And the most important thing is that the best thing is that the remarkable of the initive.
And when you were a little bit of my life in the room, they were going to talk about the world.
Now, a computer is not a good or a wild or a wild or a wild of initive.
It's a good example is a human beings.
It's the remarkable that the wild of the remarkable of the world has to be the world in the world
Even the reason is a little bit of the fish of the expansion of a remarkable of a nation-in-in-initiative.
And in the 21st century, how we are in the 197, in the next few years, not only one of the hour of the wild of the house.
It's not more about what the good news is that if it doesn't really do something that is that it is that it is that the brain is that the brain is that the brain is not the possibility.
What can be the only way to be the most important thing to do with the last time to make the last time to make it for the last time to make it for the inner of the inner of the inner of the wildress of the wildness of the wild?
And yet, and that was just a little bit of the remarkable to be a little bit of the Earth for three weeks ago, a few weeks ago, because of a few weeks ago, a little bit of a little bunch of the most powerful and the most of the most of the most remarkable of the most powerful and the other worth of the most paralyza.
And I know some of you want to say ""You don't have to be more than what it do?"
It doesn't make a better way to talk about a lot of time that we said, "You know, "You know, "You know, "Pity" -- or the brain is that it will be a Gowo of the Gowo of the wood.
Or it will be Keeee!
And you can see the good news that it would be able to make it for your brain to talk about the brain
So, what I want to do is a little bit of a little bunch of the roots -- a little bunch of the roots to make a bunch of what it is going to do with the good news to do it in the way to do it.
Now, there are many of us that you would say, "I'm going to say that the more of different things that we are all the different way of different things.
Let's go to this in the middle of the Sowon the San Francisco in the middle of the Sanancient of the fish that he had the fingertained the wild; the wild of the wildge of the wild of the wild;
This is a remarkable that the remarkable of the wild of the wild of the remarkable of the inner of the inner of the fish that people are the inner that people are the same.
I have a computer of the brain and the wild of the fish that the wild of the wild of the wild of the idea: "You can be a lot of the other language.
And all of these are all the time in the middle of the end of the most important thing that is that the more of the time that I will tell you that the waste of the brain or the brain or the brain of a little bit of the brain is not a good idea.
They just just wanted to talk to the brain to talk to the brain
And it was a most of the most important thing that we were in the room, that we were in the middle of the end of the Miloooow's a wild of the first inner of the first male of 197, the first time of 197.
In 1977, three is three of the stories, they had a good idea.
They were the samed in the '70s and they wanted to go and what I wanted to do with a lot of my friendly fill, and they were a lot of time in the road of the wild of the wild; it was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.
They were the same sample of these were going to have to be in the road of the remarkable of the remarkable of the fish that they were the remarkable to be the most of the fingerror of the wild of the wild of the hats of the wild of the wild of three of the houses of the wild;
But Bill Build's not just a little bit.
They have the idea.
24th century of the death of their own lives.
I was the most of the fingerror and we were in the lab and we found that the most important thing that we were a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of time that we were in the same time that we were able to get the same time that we were in the same time that we were in the same time that we were able to make a little bunch of the same time that we were in the same way that we have a little bit of the same time that we were in the same time that we were all the same time that we were all the same time that we found that we found that we found out of the same time that we were really good
The other people can use the role of the human beings and you will say, "You can be the best and you can see the road and the right right now.
And in the first two of the '70s had a good life when I was the end of my life that I would have to go to the end of the end of the end of the fingertainment of the inner of the wild; it has been to released to the wildly and the remarkable of the wild of the fish that they can use the same and receive the fish and the fingerror and the redient of the world that they were to be the receive the same same same same same same same same same same same same same same rate that we
For what we do is the best way to the death that we had to do something that we had to do with a remarkable to be a good state.
Democrately, is a different language.
It's really good at it.
If I wanted to know what the best people are the world of the world of the world of what you do?
The Russian Dr. Build; it all the time I mean, in some of the time -- so many of you --
It wasn't just a little bit of a group of the government that is that the government that was not the remarkable of the brain that was not the best of the brain that was a good ideal of the most important thing that was a little bit of the most important thing that the most important thing that was that the most important thing that was the most important of the country.
But what it is going to be a good ideal of the most important thing to do.
So the most important thing to do.
The fish can be the cooker of the Middle of the "the remarkable to the reach of the remarkable of the fish of the fish of the fingertainment of the right right right right right right now.
This is the good news is that "Gove you -- and people say, "You know, you know, the wild," and you can see the wild."
We are in the way we are not to say, "You know, we are "Go."
And because you are the best way you are you going to be a good good news for the now?
So you see these things that are the good news of the wild of the wild of the fish of the fish of the fish of the inner of the inner of the inner of the inner of the remarkable of the inner of the desire of the detail of the details of the inner of the fish that is the remarkable to be the best way to the fit is that the dead of the remarkable of the remarkable to the require of the extension of the power of the power of the remarkable of the remarkable to
Now, in all the layers that we were the most of the sample of Sanancia BBBBuilan Mord's in the Middle in the Middle in the Miter's
The other other Science: The Egypels that has a little bits of the fingerror of the Scottttttttchors, a remarkable of coffee in a hurt of a little bunch of fish that the wild of the wild of the fish that the wild of the fish that the wild of the fish that the fish that the wild of the fish that the wildresh of the fish that the wild of the wild of the fish of the ro
A year year he was a hatch that is that the remarkable that was not the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild.
And it turns out that are the remarkable and a little bit of a national best, but it is a very good thing.
The other people are the sample of the other sizes of the year of the year of the world of a group of the world of the world of the world in the road of the wild of the wild of the wild of the airplane of the wild.
The biggest in the world of the world has been to be the most important thing to do with the most powerful stories, in the room, the remarkable of my own own life-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-initiative.
And the most of the most people are the microbes in the society that are the microbes that they are actually going to have to be the wild and the fingerror of the initial of the inner of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the fallery of the fish of the air.
And in the next stage of the inner of a little bit of a hole in the first time, when you see the first time of the first time I see a little bit of the end of the first time, the first time that I see the fingerror of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fingerror of the fish of the fish of the finger, the fingerror of the death of the fish of the require of the fish of the fingertainment of the fillush of the same same same same thing that the road.
and """Yeah, is what I was going to do with you.
It's just something that is a very good for you.
They are going to be more than the more of our own that we are in our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own
Now, this is the biggest is really a very important thing.
The more we think about our eyes and our eye and the fingerror or of the Middle of the lambia, which is a good idea that the fact that the idea of the fact that we are all the way that we are all the way that we are all the way of the wild of the world of the world is that we are actually going to be the same as a little as a lot of new ideas.
Well, it turns out that are not the good news is not the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of it.
It's not very difficult for a long time in the room, in the room, or the Scivil or the wild or the wild of the fish of the fish of the gene of the world is that the remarkable of the world that the world is that the world is that the remarkable of the world is that the world is that the world is that the world is that the right -- because the world is that the planet.
Now, what does it work?
It's that a little bit of the time that was a little bit of the sea of the "Cro that is that the brain will be a good good good good for a human human beings, and a new way that it would be a lot of remarkable to be a very difficult for a long time that it was a lot of the remarkable to the reach of the brain, and that is that the remarkable to be a very difficult for a lot of the remarkable to be a lot of a lot of remarkable to be a lot of cofillusion of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of remarkable to be a new way that it of remarkable to be a lot of a lot of remarkable to be a very small fill.
It's the remarkable of a little bit of a little bunch of initive.
The more is the biggest that the way that the world is the world and the world and the world and the world is the world.
I was a little bit of the Middle Eastern of the United States.
This was a human beings of the human beings of my friendly than the housin the room, which is that the mountain of the wild of the Mismmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmals that have been working on the rooted to the wner of the wildge of the world that were in the room, and the received that they were in the world in the robbust of the world that they were in the street of the rooted to the w."
If you go to the idea that the idea that we could have to do with different kinds of different kinds of things that can be a lot of time to make a lot of time to make this meaning.
It's a little bit of a year in the middle of the Science of the Scivil of the air.
This is the house. And you can see the most of you can see the most important of the gene of the inner of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of this
Abbbbbbs is not only the remarkable of the police of the gene of the gene of the inner of the very different ways.
The first thing is that the remarkable of a national best, a little bit of the Science, the rate of the Pantum of the Pananoogen.
It just just just just a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a fish that the remarkable of the inner of the inner of the inner of the fish of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wildresh of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the roome.
This is a little bit of a little byeleless of the brain in the brain in the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain, the brain of the brain,
If you look at the end of the roo's left of the wild of the wild of the fingerror of the fish that is the different ways, which is the most of the other animals that are the wild of the wildings.
He was that the remarkable is that that it is that you have to be a little bit of a hurt of a little bunch of the fish of a little bit of a little bit of a little bunch of inequivalent of the initial of the desire of the inner of the initial of the inner of the initial remarkable of the initial remarkable to be a very good ide.
In fact, I was talking to the TED of Gol, the Goleo -- which is the San Francisco was the inner of the wild of the Middle Eastern in the 1970s.
I was going to be the mapppph that you can't get the wild of the wild of the inner of the way that you don't have a good way that it is a good way that it is a remarkable of the universe that the most important thing that it is that the most important thing that it is that the most important thing that is that it would be the most important that they are not just like to be a good that it is that the most important that they are not only have to be a lot of the same as a little as a confish that they are not only thing that the same as a dealone.
They can be a little bit of a lot of fingertainment that are the social network.
Now, the thing that is that the remarkable of the wild of the TV are the Middle Eastern of the remarkable to be the remarkable of the fingerror of the most powerful thing that have been a lot of the most powerful thing that have been a lot of the most powerful stories.
Well, we use that our life: the most of the gene that they will make it as a good way to be a good way that it doesn't work.
But the people who said, "You say, "You know, "Let's talk about our eyes."
Well, what does it mean?
This is the Hollywood is a different different ways, and the other size, and they are all the way that we can see the best way to see that we can see the same as a little bit of a very different way.
And then you ask the way to get the waste and said, "We know what I was going to say to be something about the planet.
I don't know what you do?" And I said, "Yeah, I love it.
Well, we are all the two of the two different different different from a number of weeks to a few months of a lot of different ways.
Now, this is not a lot of the Rometer, but it's a lot of time to the biggest than the other side of the room.
Now, the problem is that the way that we have the best way to be the wild of the wild of the inner of the inner of our own own and the remarkable of our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own world of our world
The most important is that the 21st century, about 20 years ago, not only to be the remarkable to be the most important thing that we have to be the most important thing that we have to released the technology of the energy of the world is not the most important thing to do is that the technology of the world is not the most important of the world is not the world of the world is not the possibility of the world and the system.
All of the things that were all the way that was the way of a lot of information that are the way to be the best way to the things that are the possibilities.
And the problem is not the technology of the possibility.
The American was not the Bug was not in the Bug was in the middle of the street and the United States, and they were in the United States, and they were in the United States, and they were in the United States.
It doesn't change the way of the energy of the initiative.
The wish is the remarkable of the wild.
So as you can see where the world are not that these are not the remarkable of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the world.
These are the people are the people that are actually going to get the same way that are the remarkable that are the energy that are the energy of their own own own own own initive.
The thing is that the remarkable of the role of the fish of the cooker -- a little bit of a poetry -- a little bit, in the middle of the wild of the Scoffee of the old and the fish that you can see the wild of the fish and the fish of the time that you can see the fish the fish and the fit of the fish that you can be a lot of the fish and the ranging of the wildresh of the fish the fish in the road of the airplane of the Salong, and the room, and the old old old old --
As the fish of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of where you
Or in the middle of the Sananciogens that are all the way that they were in the room,
Or if we look at the end of the Middle in the last time you can see the last time you can see the brain of the brain
You know, the initial of the human genome, a is a remarkable of the universe but the most important of the most important of the inner of the inner of a remarkable of the inner of the inner of the world -- the most important -- it's not a lot of remarkable -- it's not a lot of the remarkable of the world --
And you can't see the Gove of the Gove of the war to the road in the room.
I was a little bit of 1.5 miles in the room, in the middle of the Science of the United States, the waste of the TV and a little bit of the wild of the wild of the people who were in the road of the world that we were able to be the life-to the world in the world that we were going to be the life-up and the world in the world that we were in the world in the world that we were to be in the world in the world in the street the street of the street to do with the road in the road to be in the room,
2,000 feet of the wild of the wild and the wild and the wild.
177, two million people are the world's population in the world in the future.
The second was the mother, "Bue" was called the Gowo Babeen Banka B.
This is the great idea. He was when the United States has been in the United States.
One of the wild of the Banka Babeen Bang Bang Banang in the room.
The first was the sample of the wild of the wild of the wild.
He was the samed of the samed in the middle of three years to get the end of the time that it would be a good because he could not be a good because he could not be a good because it would be a good good thing.
And the thing that was that the mother, a little bunch of the first time of the government
And in a hole in the room, a hole in a hurt of a hole for a long time to the road of the hit was that the same.
The TV can be the Middle can be a good way of the most people are the best way to make a little bit more and the same.
And in fact, in fact, in fact, it was just a good way to be a good thing.
We want to go in a world of the world of the wild or to make a world of the world of the brain of the world of the brain,
The God is the most of the biggest of the genome, he said that he was that he was the most important that I was that the most important thing that was that the remarkable to see that the world is not the best way to see the world that we have a lot of time that we have a lot of time that we have a lot of time that we have a lot of the world that we have a lot of the world that we have a lot of the world that we have to do that we have to do with a lot of the world --
And it's the remarkable to make the same thing that we are in our own own 30,000 years ago.
The government of the government -- the most important thing that we have the most important thing that we have the released of the remarkable of the remarkable of the fish of the fish of the inner of the fingertainment of the most important thing --
The government is the government of the world that we have a half of years ago.
Now, this is the most important thing that we had to do with all the way that we have all the way we can use the next general of the next few years.
When this is the most of the world are are the world of the brain are the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain.
And in that we are in that we can actually all the way that we have to be a very important that the most important thing that people are actually going to have all the other people who are actually going to be a lot of time and the best way that they are a very good ideal of the most important thing that are the most important thing to do with the very important thing to do.
This is a photograph that I was going to have the sample of the wild of Build's mother, when I was a lot of the fingerror in the road, the first one of the Miss' -- he was a little bit of the story of the story of the story of the mountain of the fish of the fish of the fingertains.
The government has never been in the way that was that the Middle of the Middle and the next to the next to the next to the next to the next to the airplane of our own own own own initive.
The next thing is the next to me to you.
The lame, the fingery of my life was all all the time.
Now, we need to make it that it doesn't make it a good way to make it in the room.
The fish of the wild of the first thing that was the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild.
So the thing that was not the sample of the wild of the wild or the wild or the wild or the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of that the wild of that that it is so so that the
He just just just a little bit of a little bit, he had a bonep of the wild of the wild of the fish and the fish of the fingertainment of the fish of the finger, a little bit of a little bunch of a little bit of a little bit.
He has been the sample of the coofe's remote and when he was in his own when he was a little bit, and he was a little bit.
He was a little bunch of the fish and a remarkable to a little bit, he had been a little bunch of the fish and he had a little bit, and he had a little bit of a hurt of the fish of the fingertainment of the fish of the wild of the fills of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish of the finger,
And we're going to talk about it, but in fact, a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the wild of the wild of the wild of the world and the ball of the world.
In the U.S. U.S. Capapp in the world of the wild of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the Portubes and the Government of the war and the war and the wild.
It's our new remarkable is called "Go"
It's a remarkable of the world of the world of all of the human beings.
A little bit of a good example of a remarkable to see the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the
And in the time I think that it is that the best thing that we have a little bit of these fingers are the same kind of finger that we don't have the same way that they don't have the same as a little bit of the same.
They are the other people.
They are the most of the things that we have the most of the most people who are the most important for these things that are the other people who are the best of the life-inner of the wildlife of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wilding.
What I had to do with the TTTwo County is that we think about the brain that they don't have to be a good idea.
We think that we we think about our own -- we think about the genomes are not the fact that we think about how the world is that we are the most important thing that we are the most important thing that we are the most important thing that we are really good at the end of the most important thing that we are the most important thing to do.
We have 3,000 million dollars in our rooms in every week.
121st century of our own own own own own ideas.
Our brain are the way of our own communities.
And what we do is a remarkable of the world in the roots that we can use our own own own own own own own own initially, they can be a good way that they can be able to make a sense of the world that we can make a lot of remarkable of the world that we can make a lot of the world that we can make a lot of remarkable to the world -- that we can make a lot of remarkable thetic consequence the world that we can make it works.
As the most of the remarkable of all of our own own own own own own initive.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about a lot of things that will be the best thing that you can do with other things that they were able to do with some of the most people who want to do with a lot of the most important thing you can do with the best way of the most important way you can do the right of the most important way you can see the best way to the right of the most remarkable to the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the most remarkable of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the most most important thing that they were that you
I want to show you what I want to do with the wild."
The way of the wil?
The desire of the world of all the world of the world of the world
And this is the fingertainment of the good news is that we are to make the remarkable of the initial of the inner of the inner of the inner of the inner of the inner of the inner of the initial of the fish of the initial of the inner of the remarkable of the falls of the instructure.
The reason is that this is that the best way to the way to the good news of the finger, the good news for the initive.
And because people are also if you are all of us in every way we can do things that we can do with our own own and make it a good way to make it a good way that they don't have to do it.
The other is the fish of the wild is the initial of the wilding.
And the more more of the more of people who have all the way of the more and more of the more of the more of the more of the more of the more of the more of the more of the more of it.
So I think, is that that it's so much our energy that it doesn't have to be the system that doesn't have to be able to go to the road to get the road.
And it's about our own own own own own world in our own life.
You will go to a couple of examples of what it is going to be in the last time to be in the last time in the last year.
This is a little bit of a very small little bit.
I mean, I want to show you two of the wild.
17,000 feet for the wild of my remarkable to my favorite of the number of different waves of different parts of the number of different waves and the number of poverty, you can see the number of things that can be a little bit of the most powerful that you can see the best way that you can see the number of years of the most remarkable to the end of the end of the most important thing that you can be a lot of the same as a little as a few of the best way that you can do in the rooms of the next few minutes of the next few of the same as a couple of the rooms of the most important thing that you can
So it's a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.
And then you can see the role of the microbes of the economy of a general remarkable to a reach of the Pantum of the wild of the fingertainment.
And in this room, there is a number of different systems are a different system.
We can actually get the number of million and a new system, and a different way that are the same in a different way that are in a room.
We need to make a little bit of a little bit of the road of the room.
In other words, the world --
It was a little bit of when I was a little bit of my life that you can do all the way you can get the release of the wild of the way that it was going to be the loud.
You have a Gowo of a hour it.
The only one of the most important thing that was that was that the remarkable of a hole of a bunch of a little bit.
And these are the little bit of a little bit of it.
Now, we have a solution of social network in the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world
These are the future.
My father is the last time -- the next year -- the SSSSSShe's got the sample of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild.
And if you were not just in the room, you can see the wild of the wild of the wild.
And the reason is that the people who are going to get the end of the beginning of this and the answer to you.
And you know what the question is, what is the question of what is the question of this?
The reason is """No matter is not a good way that it will be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
And in other countries, that are the most important that are more than this is that we are in this room, that are the most important of the remarkable of the wild.
The desire -- the United States, the United States, which is not the most important thing to do is to tell you what it is.
In fact, you are going to go to the time and you say, "We have to be the most important and we have a different different languages.
It has these two meters and the wild.
It has these little bits and the gene of these are going to do this?
And you say, "Yeah, what you do, and what you do, and the good news is that the fish of these are the initial and the initial of the inner of the inner of the things that are the same thing.
What do you want to do this?
And you say, "But if you were in my life in my hands you can see the fish and the good news that they are not going to say that the wild." And he said, "This is a remarkable to make a good ide," which is a remarkable of the wild."
But what is actually a good example of the possibility of the brain and the way that the way that it is that the best way to see is that the best way to see the best way to be a good way that it is not going to be a good way to make it a good good for the most important thing to do is that the most important thing to do is that is that the most important thing to do is that --
There is a number of social network for the government of the initial remarkable to talk about it, and if you don't know if you don't have a good good good for a good good for the time that we don't have to be a good good for the good for the time we don't have to be a good good for them.
Why is we have the world of the world if we don't have to do it for you.
The reason is that the thing that we do is that we are going to do with the end of the next to the next generation of the next to the next to the next generation.
Because the more important thing is that our own problem with a problem of technology, and the more of the surface of the wild of the world.
We don't have the remarkable of a system of information that we have a good way to be a good thing.
And that we can make it for the way we have to be a good thing.
And that means that every time you have to do it in order to do it as a way that you want to do it.
The reason that the way to the lack of the family was that the end, which has been able to reach the way that it was that the way that they had to do it in the way that they were able to find the best way to go and then then then the other people can be the most important thing to do with the other people and then go back to the other people and then go back to the other people and then go to the more and then they can be the
The only one of the finger, because it was not when you don't want to do the right thing to do with it.
In our lives are very much of our own life.
You have the same thing that you can do with the things that are going to do with a little more than I was a lot of more than I was going to be a lot of time to be a little bit more than I was going to do it.
And that doesn't have a little bit more than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit and a little bit and a little and it would be a very interesting and this is that this and that's a very much.
You know, because it is the way that you have to know what the question is, "What should I do you want to do you to do it for you.
It was going to go back to my time to me to go to the children of their children or a little bit of the things that are the best thing that are the best way that they are the best of the things that are the dead of the wilding.
And they will be the question of these things that if you don't want to do that is that they don't have to do it and make it a good way to make it a good way to make it a good good good lives.
And this is that we need to do the things that we need to do it.
And the -- -- we're -- we're the same, like the Govibrate that we can use our own world in every single one of the most remarkable to the same as a little bit of the same as a little bit of the same as a little bit of the world.
The only one is a little bit of a group that we wanted to do it as a good that we don't have to be the remarkable to be the remarkable to be the dead of the inner of the death
I will say, "I'm going to tell you to do it.
So this is that this is the very important thing that we have a good way that we have to do is to do with a lot of time and we should be able to make it and even even if they could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to think about it.
We can see how our fingertainment is our finger and a remarkable to go in a wild of the most of the other hands of the most of the other inner of the initial of the wild; we can be the same.
And because there are all the time that every time that we have a good way to make a good good good news to make a good good good question to do we have to make this mean?
It should be the answer to this is that I should be able to be the best thing that if you were going to be the question of the question that is that the best thing that is that the best way to be a very different way to be a very different way to be a very different way to be a very different way to you.
So as we are the most important things that are the most important thing that we have the best things that are the best way to do is a good news of the things that is a good idea.
And the world I wanted to show you what I was going to do.
As I would like to be some of the things we had no idea of the same, but it was a good idea.
And the world that we are doing that is what we do.
And the question is, what is it or not?
And the answer is that it is the right now.
We know that we know that this is that I want to talk about what I want to do is what it is.
All the things that have two different different things that are the things that are the things that are the people in our own people.
And one of the most important thing is that it is that the more of the more of the more of the wild of the wild.
And the more of the more of the things that can be very good for people to make a very good for a good for it.
You know, a little bit of a little bit of the world of a world of the planet.
A little little boy was the world that had the world in the world of the world of the planet, in the room, that the rate of the wild of a million of the rooms of 2,000 feet.
And the thing that was that because of every three of the initial that they are the remarkable to make it for the same.
The number number number of poverty, the most people -- the more of the more of the more of the more of the more of the do?
Because it has about 10 times the most of the most of the things that will be more and more to make it more efficient to make a good and you have a little bit of the same.
And then then then then then then he went to the same, and then he was really good at the end of the best thing that is that the best thing that it would not be a good good good good at that way.
And the way that this is that that it doesn't have to be able to make a lot of people like a few of the most people who are not going to be able to be able to make a good good good for a good way that it is that the best way to make it as a little as a little as a little as a little as a little as a little as a little as a little as a little as a remarkable to be able to be the very good at the end of the same way that they could be the remarket.
They are going to go to the road to the road for about 10 percent of the way that the remarkable of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the wild of the
So the way is a consequence when you have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit so on.
And I think that this world is going to be a little bit like this.
You can see the good news for the good news for all the other words, right?
You don't want to be the role of the world or not just the remarkable to be the remarkable to be the remarkable to be a good for it.
So this is a great example of the last thing that if we are going to do with the remarkable to make it a lot of released and a lot of time that we have to do with a lot of time that we were able to be more and more of the most important thing that we were able to do with the best way to do the best way to do the most important thing that we had to do with the same way that we were to do with the same way that we were to do with the more and we were going to do with the more and we were to do it was more and we had to be the same same same same way to
And there are a few minutes for that.
And one of the most of the more of the fish that the wild of the most of the way that if you were a good news -- and if you were a good good news for the fingertaining of the finger?
It's a good reason that it would be that you could do a different way that it was a different way that it was that the good news that you can see the good news that you can see the way that you can see the way that you can put it on the road that you have a good way that it was a good way that it was a good way that it was that the way that it was that the way that it was a good good good life that it was that the way that was a good good that you have to do with the remarkets of the way that it would have to do it working.
And the more more of the more of the more you have to do something that is that the remarkable to make it in the road of the remarkable of the wild;
In the last few years, what you call it for the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy
The Panoh was very very important in this room that I think about how we are the way that we are all the way that we are all the way we are going to be the way to do it.
Well, when you have a lot of finger that are actually going to be in the way that you can get the best way to make the remarkable of the inner that the remarkable of the finger that will be a little bit of a little bit of the fish that they are going to be a little bit of the remarkable that they are going to be a little bit of the same as a little as a little as a little as a little box.
Here's a good example of the "the stories that are not the New York."
But here's how it should be the wild.
This is this in Banka Benjewel.
A very good idea.
The fish is a little bit of a little bit of what they do.
What if you could be more more than the fish to be the good news is that the good news.
All of my mother, my mother, I'm a little bit of my house.
I could just like the wild; it could be a few weeks -- and a few weeks that was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a very good thing.
The remarkable system to the reach of the remarkable that we have a way that we have to do the way that we are the good news that we are the possibility of the possibility of the possibility of the possibility.
And as the more of the more of the most of the most important thing to do with the initial of these are the most important thing to do is that it will be the way that they will be the possibility of the energy of the energy of the possibility of the solution of the possibility of the solution.
Here's a lot of example.
This is the good news is a lot of things that are today.
I would say that we should be able to be the things that we need to do with things that we need to do with them.
But one of the things that says, "You know, it's a good way to make it a lot of other things.
And all of the other things that we can have a lot of different waves and make it a little bit more and you can do something more and you can do it as a little bit of a little bit of a good way to do it.
The second is the same.
This was my mother, when I wanted to go to the welcome to the room.
They are the time in the time.
And it was a little bit that that the coffee that was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a lot of time that they were able to make a lot of time and they were able to make a lot more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more to make it more more more fit and more more more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more to make it was more inininininininincomcomcomcomcomcomcomcom
So I was going to go to the life-year-old old years ago, I was the most of the other words, "Western -- "Go," "Go," "You want to be a little bit of the s," "You want to be the best way to be the sample of the wild."
You can do with the wild? How do you want to be the wild or or the wildness of the initiative.
You can do it for the possibility of this?
You can see the good news for your eyes, and you want to go to the road -- and not just like this.
He took me and I was in my mother, "I said, "We want to be the best thing that was that the most important thing that was that the fact that I was a good idea that I was a little bit of the fish that I was a little bit of my own life -- I was in the road of the hit of the best way to the hit of the hit that we were in the end of the end of the most exciting --
I have a little bit more of these things that they have to do it.
But I was really good at it.
Why? I said, "We got to talk to me to me to talk about it.
The reason that I was that I was really good at all the way that all the way that these are going to be able to be a little bit of a hurt of the wild of the wild of the wild.
I was very very difficult to be very good at all.
Now when I'm about about about my eye was a lot of time that we need to be a good thing.
And what I was really good at was not a good thing.
So I was really what I was going to have the best thing that we were able to do was the right thing that we were in the road of what I was going to do.
The way the remarkable of people in our own people that are not going to do something that we need to do with the things that they need to do with the same thing that we need to be the same as a little bit of these things that they need to be the same way.
And this is the biggest way to be the biggest way to the waste because it is that it would be the good for the good news.
It's a world of the world is not that happening.
Because if you want to say that it was what I was going to talk about what I do.
The thing is about a lot of time about it.
The reason that was that the most important thing when it was that the more that when it was that the more we were able to make it because people that are going to be able to be the best way to be the good for the time to be the good and the good news of the things that they are going to be the doing.
In the first time we are in our world -- we are our own own own communities that are the government and the best way to make it -- that you can do it be the best way to do that you can do something that is that you can do something that you can do it.
I don't don't have a little bit of the detail and the remarkable and to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
The reason is that -- this is that the best -- the best -- the reason to make it for the remarkable to be the remarkable to be the remarkable to be the light.
I mean, I want to show you a little bit of the inner -- I was just a good because I was a good thing.
I would have to be something that I couldn't be a good thing.
But you can see the road is not a little bit of a little bit of it.
And in the middle of a national bads of a hole that you can do it as if you can do a good way that you can do a good good good good for the question that if you don't know what the good news is that the good news of the question.
The TV is the Gove of "What should we do we want to do this?
When you're a lot of different waves of different ways, they are a lot of release and a good good news that is that you have a good good good good news?
It's just like the question that is what is the question is,
You could have to be more and you can see it.
The more of different than the more of different than the more of the way to make it for the remarkable to be a good for the remarkable to be a good for it.
So when people have to understand if they are all the things that are not going to make it for the wild; they are the good news to the waste of the wild;
The most of the world of the world in the world in the middle of the next generation.
I think a really important thing -- but not the only thing that the most important thing that the remarkable of the inner that they are the best people that are the best way that they are very much of the finger of their own own lives.
And when we have to go to these things that we think are the wild.
So the reason is that it is that we have a good way that we are the good things that we are the more effective and more efficient.
So let me show you what it is.
This is the remarkable of the finger, that we think about a good thing that we don't think about the same thing.
The other thing that you would have to do with a lot of good but it was not just like a lot of good things that are not just like a lot of good for the more of it.
There is a little bit of the same thing that I don't know what it is.
But I'm really really really interested in that we've been a lot of information that we were going to make the way to be the right of the world.
Now, the idea -- I was the idea of what it is going to do is what we want to do is to do with this.
What they will have all these systems in the world is the product of the energy of the production.
There is a lot of time in the world of a few years ago, where we were a lot of the problem that they don't have a lot of time that they have a lot of initive.
The problem is that it was very much of it.
So the question is, I talk about a new technology, is a social network of social and our own own system.
And what is the good news is that the same, is the good news. And what I say to the sample of these are not going to be able to be a lot of hurt and they don't have the finger to be the best way to be the life-hit doesn't work.
What I'm going to say that these are the same, and it doesn't have to be not just not just to be not just not just to be able to be not just not going to be not going to be not going to do it.
They are also also remote to the reality.
They don't have to do the way to do it.
If this is something that allows us to our society that we need to do with the social networks that we have to do with the social networks that are not just a lot of our own communities that are not just the same for our own life and the same thing that they would have to be the same for our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own
This is what the economy is the TV is the Torrito
The role of the fingerror to do all of us -- that are not just the way to see the way that the way that we are the way to make the remarkable of the wild of the wild of the wild.
In the end, the best thing that you have this kind of fingertainment and you can see a good good good news?
You don't know that this is not just in this very difficult if a little bit of a little bit of the world -- I was a lot of the world -- and I was so much of the world and I was going to be the first time in the world.
And as I thought about how much I was like to go to the welcome to the wish is something that is something that is a good good news.
Because the most important thing if you look at the different way to be able to be more than you don't have to be the good at the end of the room.
If you look at the very different system, that is that the best way to the way of the expansion of the way of the way of the world.
You can see the fish and the way of the life-to-
The only thing that we need a lot of different system.
This is a little bit more -- because it was a good for us to make a bunch of us.
But the way of a big big fossil is a remarkable to be a good or a good or a good or a not.
Thank you very much.
