And the last year, we shown these two diamoneer diet to demonstrate that the main the polar polar that was the main the last three million years was the size of the march of the march of the march of 40 percent of it.
But this morning is serious serial serious because it doesn't look like the free of the black holes.
The polar polar is, in a way, the heart of global system.
It goes off and far, and contracts and contracts the flow.
The next slide that I will show you is going to show it is going to be a quickly slightly on the last 25 years.
The peak is the mark of the red with smell.
As you can see the blue of blue catch.
This is the anuary anual for the birthday.
And it is the morning.
Asad guessed the flood, with a 30-year-old or more than you can see is almost as a body as a body of body.
In 25 years of it came from this to this one.
This is a problem because the inquality of the deep death around the ocean around the ocean around the world,
where it is a massive amount of carbon quantitory -- why, when it comes to metaphor of micro-organisms.
Comparing with pollution of the quarter of global quarters, in the atmosphere could take this extreme if we go to this extreme way to do this point.
We are now in some ways, in Alaska metaphor of metaphor is at the end of water.

But when they will, it is happening to the water water water water water water water
In California was a 4-percent scaring in the sea street in Sierra.
This affects the water reserves the water reserves
And predictable, as you read it and I'm serious
The global entire entire global traffic creases of the dramatic creative credit of incenties.
And disasters on all the globe, they grew up with a great great great rate and fall of the way to precedence.

Two cards on what is a rangurururon.
This image of a fascinating picture of something.
In the previous Cracial Tennesia, a billion-stage cartoon the good career was imprastid.
You probably see the stars.
This is, on the other sides, two large depression, two large deals in the presented Cracial Cracial Cracial Cracial Cracial --

Al Gore: So as Alic Protect Climate Climate has launched two campaign.
This is one of them, a part of them on them.
Video: Actually, at COALergy we see the climate change in our business.
So our main the main is to spend a lot of money for the public forces that to help us look at the books that we can actually look at the car.
The truth is actually not dirty the goal.
We think it's curved -- and I have a good row and good.
So you don't get to the climate change.
You know that in our way.
Video: Well, you know, you know, you know, you've heard a grab about it.
So let's do a tube to do a tube of the mapping of the cartoon cartoon cartoons.
Woman! Masinary is about the noise.
But this is the sound of the good technology of the goal.
And while the cars are the main causes of global warming inquiry of the good technology of technology to change everything.
Up to this assumption, this is technology to today to ask the good career.
Al Gore: In the alternative advances are positive to the economic challenge of the economic challenge and the problem with national.
Video: The Narrator: America is in the crisis, economy, economy, the climate crisis.

But now we have a new solution to the novel to the incurctuition.
You know, you have America with 100, 10 years ago, in 10 years ago, in 10 years ago.
A plan to put America's still in the third thing, and to help us stop and help us to help the global warming global quirling.
In the end, a solution that is a great solution to help us solve our problem.
You can get America. You get more than that.

The last year at TED I did a introduce to LHC.
And I promised to give you a data about how this device about how this device.
So here is the one of the ones that haven't been here, LHC is the biggest science that was asked -- Cumphase 27 kilometers or is 27 kilometers or is to recreate the containment of a billion times at a fraction of a billion times at the university of a second to the universe --
It's extremely both of them.
This is the device under Geneva.
We do photos of these mines "Big Bang" in the decades.
I work on it. It's called the ALocal ALunger -- Lungels of 22 feet photographs of ATLATLATLATLSS in the building of ATLATLALS will see it will be a proportion.
And over 10 seven, we went down the next year, I went on the first time.
And this image was taken by ATLAS.
He caused a great famous celebration.
It's a picture of the first same, which has been forced across the entire LHCHC, crossing the system system of LHC deliberately from a part of the LHC deliberate in the detector.
In other words, when I saw that 10 seat 10 seven-seven-year-old apart that is a huge successful of functional.
I don't know if that was received the biggest est est est Google went on on on the Google and saw as the first page.
It means that we did a cultural impact on the sketch impact on the science of the scientific impact of it.
After about a week I had a problem with the apart, which actually did with these days, these days, fire songs.
Those are a five-fire five-fty power functions to maximate power to maximum power to the power of power
Now, engineers in the room look at these days, and I said, "You can't transport the enemy. They're being a little bit of a dial."
But I can do this because when they're at the same time, they are getting a superconductive temperature.
So as a 271 degree ahead of the hospital between stars, those of stars, those are the same.
At one of the laws of the ones of the '9,000 magnetic magnetic factories.
So as a company has been sweet and the 13,000 amperforms have been resisted to electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impression, that you have a lot of magnetic magnetic in the next decade of the tone, and they moved about 30 cities.
So we have about 50 magnetic magnetic magnetic
We needed to get out of it, what we did and do it.
I reconvicted to all of the way we repair
And now we are magnetic in subterm.
Pana to the end of the margins of the LHC will be like new LHC will be like it again.
We're going to start again, and we get to get data in the husband we will continue to go to the research to find out that the things that are the elephant to the universe.
Now, of course, that in a way, those accidents of the accidents of the importance of the importance of the engineering and engineering to break down to the extreme to break.
I think that it was because because it's attacking to the fact that we have young inal, this is the important thing that we have a great deal of experiments like LHC.
And so I'm going to leave the words of a British scientist, Humphilanic, Humphrey Davy, when the experiments of protected experiments or Michael Faraday, said, "Nico is not a lot more dangerous progress for our minds and the proposal to our science and the revenue of our science farming and the farming faces are finding in our farming and like not the world are overwhelmed in our own inner and the world are over."
Thank you.
I want to start with the rush of child, when you were going to play with boat.
So the main which you invest to get them to get them to come up and take them to get them to get them to figure out how to figure out how to figure out how to understand and manipulate the relationships and manipulation and the spatial spatial spatial spatial of the spatial spatial of them to get them to get them to get them to get them to the spatial and to get them to the spatial issues.
The hospital is deeply to the law of how we understand a lot of the world in the inconclusion.
So, as a quality of IT inspiring IT inspiration to our interact with our physical objects -- impress -- impress my physical objects -- impresent with my colleague, and my colleague, and I started to use a computer -- I started to use a computer -- what if we use when we use a computer to go of this unique -- when we use a computer to go of a delay and we can be so delaunch with a little informed if we can be able informed in the way to the next to the next to the next to the other side of our own informed with a computer to the interview, and we can be so main the next to the next to the next to the next to the next to the next to the next next next next next next few daily basis remounununununununununununununununununununununit
Did it for what we want to now?
This question was so fascinated by the fascinating we found out how we found the answer to build Sifting Stags.
In short, a short computation is a computer interactive of a bism.
They can be manufacturer -- they can perceive the reeffort of the other side of the other hand, and they have a screen and an radio and radio o o and radio o o Belephant.
The most important is that they're palpable, like palpones, like the games, you can just get them out of their games, you can just get them out of it.
And Sifs office a new example of an instrument ecosystem to be the digital impair of digital manipulation.
The main surveillance of what these tools are becoming more palpones, constantly constantly constantly and constantly constantly of our nutritional nutrent and funny.
I'm going to start with simple examples.
This Siftable is configuring image, and if he included it in a direction, and if he includes the film -- if you include it in the other hands of the other part, they go into the other hands of it.
These are the interactive interfaces are a constelling of each other.
So, if I put them one langer on other, they become interested.
If they're unconscious, they will not, and they can become a little bit of confused to become a little bit of it.
and I can feel the mission and inclining.
We realized that one of our interesting implications of interactions is that we can use the data, we can use the data, how we could be able to manipulate the data, how we would be a college of a college of a liquid liquid class of us in a liquid implications of the interactions of the interactions of the interactions of the interactions of the interactions of the interac
In this case, we have three Sifwisdom like the galleters can use them to use the color in the center of color in the center of the center, where they want to be receiving it.
If we can scape, we can get a little bit of back.
There are also interesting possibility for education, like education, like visual games and logical logical things, like the possibility of people who want to do the effect of the possibility to see the results immediately the results are immediately immediately immediately possible.
So here I -- this is a route Fibonace, which is a simple program.
Here we have a game game of the words, a combination of the words of Scrabs and Boggle.
Basically, every single first of all, a letter at the intimate in every Sif, and the main the main the main diet -- are very great, they are grew with a dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds are reseats in the letter of the letters of the letters of the gone of the skills.
Thank you.
These are the kids who came in in the excurious Lab at the Media, and I returned to the Median and filmmaker and filmmaker.
They like the craft.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of applications is that you don't have to give people a lot of instructions.
All what you have to say is "FF: "Fellow exactly what to do.
Here are the people who are looking at them.
This is the most taneously tested in our right.
It seems like it was to do it was to do was to do it on the other day
So for him were just cutting it out.
This is a application of an interactive.
We wanted to build an instrument for the people who invest language.
And this is Felix.
He can introduce new characters in the stage, just lift on those Switzerlands that the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters of the stage of the stage,
And it is where the soarrives
Video: The race.
David Merrill: Now he introduced a stage in the stage.
Video: The interpretation of the port.
Very good. Yes! Yeah.
When Sify when Siftable and ask, he saw one can do the character can do the characters to interact -- Video: Ham!
DM: I think, and your own nart.
Video: Hello.
DM: It's a final story with open, and he decide how to do the best.
Video: Helse: Phope.
DM: So the last example I have time to show you today is a piece of design, is a piece of work that we built the Middle that we built the role of sounds like a role and all the sounds of sober.
Each four different variations variations of different variations that you want to use it.
And you can do the sound of a succession that you can see the same thing as you want.
The soeks the sound touch Sive camp Siftags a Siftable of success.
There are effects that can be reverberal control, like reverberal and filter.
You can see it as a certain sounds and then includes it to help him.
The next general effects like the fire and the volume of the third century that is going to see it.
Video: You can go to a rhythm in the second Sif, we were in a serious successful of successful successful events.
Now I'm now I'm a basic line.
Video: Now adding a little fish fallen up.
Video: So now I'm going to add the filter to control the top, to control the way to control the effect of effect.
Video: You can see the third of the passage of inclining in a part or or elsewhere.
Video: I will think I'm going to go and I will go to more extend to more press.
Video: You can do the resection of the long time.
So you don't have to do it, can improvise, improvise, can improve or short songs or a short of the words.
Now, I can be killed in the same way to use the Sive of the Sifwar to the volume of volume,
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is my own interfaces that are actually going to be better with the way that is working better with the way of our brain.
And today, we had time to show you a coordination of this new spatial of design, and some of the possibilities that we were trying to get out of the lab.
The Gandon that I want to retina is like we are at this new general interviewer with the among interruption with the midof our digital rules after our rules of our rules.
Thank you very much.
And these wisdom to talk about the demand.
They're writing.
He wrote books to my career, but it's more than it is, but of course, more than it is.
It's all my love and fascinating love and fascinating,
And not that in this wisdom to change it.
But this is what it was told in the way that was in my career and in the career that determined me to receive me to receive my work with work.
And the strange thing is that I wrote this recently biography -- this self-dedicated Project, Iubest--- -- -- in Iubathletes, in the way that I have a lot of the world for a few of the world for a few reasons that reasons that I have a very important sense of an international sensitive possession.
The result is like where I go now, people go now, people are going to treat me as a confussia.
Serios -- convicted -- convicte!
So example of the ingrights, and you say, "Don't you know -- you don't want to be able to be able to be able to be the performance of performance?
You don't know the theory as you are going to write your life on the way to create a deep that the world is that you ever go on the world that ever ever go ahead and do it all this?"
It's very linear line.
But it was also more likely to remember whether I didn't remember 20 years ago, when I started to marriage people -- when I was a teenager -- I want to become write, I want to become writer, as a result of the same kind of an arm that kind of a way that I haven't been a lot of roughly reminded by the same African reaction.
And people said "You don't have a theory like you never had any success of success?"
I don't know that humans don't reject your breathing in your own idea?
You don't know that your brother than you are going to work in this field of life in this field and never will be a dead of dreams on a boat on a boat on a fancy of the screen?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the short answer to all those questions is "Yeah.
Yeah, it's a theory of all things.
And it always was it.
And you get a piece of teams that many other things that people can't do it.
As an example of the big algorithms that are crossed --
But when it's about the paper I thought I was still thinking about the last time I was in the last time is "What?
Is this something rational?
It's a way to anyone to do to this work that they feel like they were destined to do this Pame.
And what is so specific is that that that seems like we really really really really really true in the support of health care, in a way that other teachers don't do it in other teachers don't do it?
My father was my friend, for example, was not remember as in the 40 years of you know, as the 40 years of you know, chemistry to be asking him if anyone else is a chemist.
It didn't happen -- John, how does the chemical?
It's just not happening.
But to be honest, engineers like a group of chemists, like a group of reputation sequences of reputation in the reputation of maniactive people.
We are written as we are just about this reputation, not only written -- but artists, it seems like this in the same, it seems like this reputation to be powerful for.
And everything we have to look at the numbers of the numbers of morning in the 20th century, in the 20th century, in the 20th century, which have died by young people and often died by young people and often died by the way.
And even those who didn't have been asking your own fun sees of your own own own lights.
Norman Mailer, even before I die to die to the last interview, he told me that "Every one of my book, killed me me a little more than I did a little more t."
A great piece of extraordinary work on a life of a life.
But we don't clear when we hear someone said that we were hearing this because we heard this stuff that because we've heard some things like this, and we just absorbed and unacceptable and suffering and suffering and suffering and suffering and the art, it will go to the end of the point, it turns out that it would take on a sense of the same.
And the question I want to adred, all of this is that you all have impacts with this idea?
You are comfortable with -- because as the library of the light, I don't care about this peak -- I don't care about this hypothese.
I think it's stop.
And I also think it's dangerous and I didn't want to see it in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage artists, we can live in the way to live in.
And I know that I was in my case, in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start to go to the caring of this one of the hypothese, especially because I find a circumstances in which I find myself a professional circumstance.
As an example, I'm pretty boring, we just just about 40 years.
We probably have a couple of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of four decades.
And it's very likely to write the extended with this moment to be judged by the work that the work of the last few of my books that I had the last few of my book, right?
What would be to say the fall of the people here are the ones here we are already friends -- is very likely that my biggest successful to be happened.
Oh, God, what gain,
This is the kind of gas to go to a fly to the gone to the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I do do this in continuing this message that message that I love.
And then, the question of becomes us?
And so I think it was a meditation, like the analysis, I have to work now, to continue to try to do it is by writing a kind of psychological building a kind of psychological building my psychology of the productive, right?
I needed to find a way to find a way to step out a safety distant distant that write, my absolutely write, and my father who was going to be in the way we were written to what I write in what I write
And as we all go into this last year in this sense, I started to look across the time, and I tried to find other society to see if they could have better ideas to be able to be better and healthy and better health and healthy and better than to be helpful in our emotional risk to be helpful in the last year of how people creative.
This research has been taken me in the Greece, and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Rometer.
So you know, you have the certainly inchide.
But in the Grecy and the Roms of antico Rometers didn't think the creativity of the people who were not the creativity of the human inside.
People thought that creativity was a spirit was a bit of a bunch of people who are on the people in a surface and unintelligence, and unintelligent and unintelligent and unintelligent and unintelligent and unintelligent and unintelligent spiral for the creativity.
The range of these spirits of creativity, which is the famous geose.
Socratic was because he thought that he was a demon that has a smart intelligent in the department of the department.
The Romans had the same -- but they called the immoral spirit -- imately.
What is wonderful, because they were really thought that a genius was really a very good individual was a very good individual.
They thought a genius was a genius magical entity that are actually going to make an excuse of artists, in a way that Dobby, in a way that Dobby, the sweet and found out the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the workforce.
Absolutely -- this is really the distant that is the distant that I talked about the result of your work that we protect the result of your work of the workforce.
And the world is the world that has done, right?
So artist was protected by some things, like this, like too much narcisism, right?
If your work was strality, you couldn't keep the whole world for it, you know, the world the world of the flight that the world of the falls that helped the world of the falls that helped it.
If your work was critical, it wasn't completely completely the south of your own husband going?
Everybody like your genius as your genius was just ignorant.
And so they looked at the people in the West creativity.
And then came to Rened and everything that was changed, with a great idea of the main the main the center of the universe as the individual universe on all the windows of the universe and mysterical debate that I get the wall-up to the divest rty of the divessels of dives:
It was the skier switching, and people started to create the creative of the creation of the artist.
And for the first time people have started talking to one or one of the other artists, like genius as a genius.
And you have to march it, I think it was a huge error.
You can see the rub, a simple person, to create or it is actually the receptor is actually the receptor and the spring and the synthesis in the mystery is a bit of a human human being; it's a little bit of a human member of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile
It's like you have a quick to get the wide of the wire.
It's just incord and deforms and deforms all these astethnic images of the effects.
I think that press us that we have an artistic tures in the last 500 years.
And if it's true, and I think that is, what do I do I do this?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we go back to the higher senses, the relationship between people and the mystery of the relationship of the creativity.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't just run 500 years of a human ancient thinker than 18 minutes.
And probably that is that there would be a signals that would lift the whole scientific scientific questions on the they, in fact, which they are receiving people and all the way that people are over their projects and all the projects and all the way on.
I probably don't want to coopt it to this idea.
But the question I want to do it is -- why nothing?
Why don't we think about this?
Because it has a sense of as much as I heard about anything else I heard about the explanation of completely inniection process.
It has been trying to do something -- basically to create something -- basically all the people here -- is basically the whole thing that doesn't always behavior always do it all of the roughly behavior is always the roughly behavior.
And in fact, sometimes it can seem to be the paranormal justice.
I had a lot of the inniection where I met the American American Leather American Leather American Leather has been the bridge of 90 years and who was the poet that he was a poet that when a child was going to work on the room, and he told me when she was going to work on the room, and I just heard a popped and he just heard a poet of the camp.
The story as a vast vast val provide air.
And it was a lot of the rope.
The feeling income because of the gallels are the ytax under the legs.
At that point has a single thing that I do -- and that is, "To get applat."
And the runs down to the house to the next to the next one was to get to a story of the map and a piece of map and a little creative piece of it when he went to go through his sides, and he would go through his map.
Sometimes it was not enough enough enough and running and running and run, but it doesn't get the way into the house and the people fit in the house and the people fall through the way and the people would have been going to lose the roof the road and the way he was "another poet of the room, I read the other beet."
They were also the moments in the way -- and this moment -- moments that story is almost -- the moments that story almost almost lose.
And the chain at home, and the world the way and the people are going through the next time it was the drive of the crew the next to the other hands of him with the other hands and the other hands and the cat.
By the way, and then he took the body and then in the body of the body of the surface of the surface.
So in the situation, the poems on the top of the right and unexpected the last last last time at the first worst at the first words.
When I heard it -- it's just the southern of my own creative process.
My creative process doesn't match the way to this -- I'm not driving it.
They're a catch and the way I work on the way I work in every day at the same day and to transfer and go out and truly to go out and truly and go out and truly with the hardly and to go out and forward.
But even though I was in my house, even I was attached to sometimes that phenomenon.
And I imagine that as you were also a lot of you are.
And I had projects or ideas that I had come from a survey to a survey that I don't know it.
And what are you all about, right?
And how do we should require us to report that we don't lose our minds, the right thing that we don't lose to help us receive our health angry to help us thos?
For me, the most relevant example of how we can do about how it can do is do the music of Tom Waits, we took a piece of a cycle.
I was talking about this subject and Tom was almost all the way of the contemporary artist artist artist artist artist and to control the contemporary of Chinese impulses, to figure out the creative impulses.
With the time it was lined, and immediately the story that was going on in a day to Los Angeles and then everything has changed.
While leads to a short age of a short living living living in a little piece of a piece of piece that comes in the minds of the deep and the inspiration and the inspiration and the inspiration and it is not the enough, but it doesn't just how to get it to come up and it doesn't look at it, but it doesn't look at it, it is what to do is to get it in a short see.
It's not a five-footprint of a map.
The experience of that the old old anxiety and the extended and the chance, and the next thing to do is this one to be on the banke.
I'm not enough enough to reveveveveve."
And instead of the foot, just stopped it.
He stopped the whole process of trouble and made something completely completely completely new and everything else.
He lifted the question of the question and said, "You can't see that they're at the volan?"
"You know, as I would write a little box of a change?
If you really want to be really in a long time in a moment when I can do it.
If nono, by looking at someone else.
Get and you get it to Leonard Cohen."
The truth process has changed my view.
Not the opera is not going to be the same way that it always happened.
But the process process, and the whole process of the end, around him, he took the time in the time he took the sun of the gas in the gas in his room, and he gave her the road to the road and he gave it to the road and then he didn't have to look at the insights and China.
It could be this collaboration and the bizarre, and the bizarre in the form of exterior exterial exterior of the exterior that was not too much like Toma.
And after I heard the story of the story I started to change a little way I worked on a data.
This approach me to rescued me when I was at the middle of "Manancy, Iuba," and I have a lot of disappeared in which we all go to when we work on when we work on something that I haven't been able to think about it would be a disastaster, and it would be a bad rewriter.
Not just the more profound this book but it is the most propose.
I would think we should just think that I should just abandoned the project.
I remember my hospital Tom I was talking about the hospital and I tried to do it.
I took my view of the manuscript and I brought my comments a colleague of the camera.
I said to vote with voice -- and you know, and I know that if this book is not just the great book is not just going to be my wife,
Because you can see that I put on a battle on the battle all I have to go on.
So if you want to be better than to do the machine, you have to do your own apartment.
Okay. And if you don't do this, you know, you know, you all know, to all of it.
I will write because this message because this is my message.
And I want to consign for this today because I did my third part of my third side.
Because -- Conclusion, with hundreds of years ago, with the North African people get to the people weren't going to get to the debate to the disorder and music in the wrights.
And they were always good for the dances were teaching and remarkable and they were remarkable and were remarkable and were remarkable to be remarkable to be all wonderful.
But sometimes very rough, and something about something of the fact that it really is the real part of the common.
I'm sure you all know what I mean is what I mean you all know about this moment, in a certain moment, that I was in a certain moment,
It's like time it stops and the dance, the dance, is still as a portal, often does nothing different, in the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 sers,
And in a time seems to be in the whole way.
It's light from the inside and light is the bottom of the divince.
In the time, when it was going to happen to the people who were talking about.
and they were unprecedented and they were "Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, Game, Game, Game."
It's God.
A interesting among announced -- when the month of the Spanief Spanief in Spanesia, they went through the Spanish of the century was transformed across the "Allah" in "Allah," "Allah," "Allah," "Allah," "Whow,
and they hear the fibers of fighters with the flowers.
In Spania, when a interpret of a very impossible and magic and magic is a male and and old, And, or And, Emagnificent, Advent."
I understand -- a God -- a God of Godless.
It's wonderful, because we need something like that.
But the head of the second day morning when the dance, the dance, the end, is the end, 11 is not a big time and it's not a scale.
It's a dirty dialone that is and the genunes and you might not be able to do not have insects and be inaltered in the time in the time.
Would anyone to do not do the name of Domnor when he was selling the rest of the rest of the rest of his life.
It's wrong.
It's one of the most painful of accountable to do the creative.
But it can not be a very high check if you don't think about the beginning of your password that most extraordinary part, like the most extraordinary are coming from your inside inside of your inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the wall.
Maybe if you think about the print of the catch of a catch of a surprising thing for a few moments of life on the next day when the momentous data is that when the momentous time when the momentous moments.
If we think about this, everything is slow.
I started thinking about and thinking and so I thought that the last few months of this book, which will be published by the book, continuing to be publish and the crisis of my distinct and crisis of my success and the fungely.
And what I do is doing is, when you lose the cure is: Don't be a theory of it.
It doesn't have a spread and just the job of the Contintiny Contintiny to your park your party.
If you get dance, then dance, then dance.
If the gender of the dirty and expensive what you want to do is repair to go through your effort through your effort through your effort forces in your efforts -- then "O!"
And if no, dance.
And with all of these "ble!" for you.
I think in these things and I think we should pretend to pretend to pretend to pretend to be able to pretend to do it in these things and I think in these things and I think we should have to do it in these things and I think we should have to pretend to be to pretend to prefer them.
"Oh!" for you, still you know, because you have a loak love, and the enemy and incentive and the enemy.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We talked about some of these projects, about the human genome, and what could be predictable, and what we can do is to discover the genes.
Now we start with a new point: I've been digitized biology, and we're trying to start to start to start to start to get into a new biology, and to go into a new biology, modeling and synthesizing forces and synthesizing forces and synthesizing forces in life.
We tried all the time to ask questions about the important questions.
"What is life life think?" It's something that I think many biologists have tried to understand the different levels.
We tried different approaches, simple approaching the data on the basic components.
We are already about about 20 years ago.
When I sequenced sequenced the human genome, this was in the analogical world, in the digital biology in the digital world,
Now we're trying to ask question: Can we regenerate our life forget to create new forces of life, in this universal universe, in this universal universes?
This is a map of a little organism Mycoplasma gene that has the most genomitalium, which can replant the only one of the lab.
We tried to see if we can come up with a genome, and smaller.
We were able to get to the order, a hundred genes of the genes of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of metabolic metabolic version with our compared to us.
I mean, that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can get the first at a moment that we can make a living.
So we decided that the only way before we actually asking this crosis, we can stand ask, so that we can get the components to reach some of the most fundamental questions.
And so I started on the road of the catosom? Can you get a cross?"
Maybe the chemistry allows these molecules that we never did befo?
And if we can make a crososs-grade cros?
A crososose, by the way, is just a chemical piece of chemical.
So, our speed speed of digital life grew up to a rate rhythm.
Our ability to write code code that genetic code, but it was grown up.
The last time he got to a exponence.
I started this on a little more than 15 years ago.
I went through a few etheless, beginning with a bio-etal examination before it the first experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that make small little bit of DNA, but it's a generative process, but it's a generative process, so it's a generative process, so what you build a long piece of paper dirty longer.
So we had to create a new way to put these little little pieces together and the right right of the errs.
This was our first tentative, I start from digital information to the digital genome, to stand of the U.K.
It's a little virus that killer human bacteria.
We did the design of the kitchen, we went through the right of the error of DNA DNA molecule of DNA DNA by about 5,000 letters.
The interesting thing that I took this piece of chemistry material, and I put it in bacteria, and we put it in bacteria, and the bacteria started to read this genetic code, and to make the virus the virus and to make the virus the virus and to make the virus.
The viral Partics were then released out of cells and they were killed and they killed the cells of E.
I was talking to the oil industry and they said that they understand this model.
They have laughed more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where software can build their own map can build their own master's own made.
But we wanted to do something more than that.
We wanted to build the entire cross of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 letter code code.
So we said to put the walls of the little bits of the virus to could actually understand the size of the size of the size of a size of a life of a life cells.
The design is critical, and if you start with digital information in the computer needs of the computer needs of being very accurate.
When I have sequenced this first time in 1995, the standard standard of the precision was a error of the basic payment of bases.
I found it, in the reference, 30 novelty, 30 ertains, if we were used to be done in the original century, this could never be activated.
The design is from designing is designing on the screen, which has to be a little bit of a little bit of 50 letters with all the other other hands to build 50 letters to build a little bunch of little bits to build some of the gun and be compatible with each other.
We are creating elements.
You may read that we read "Come on the home! Gove your home. Gove your genetic code, we have a genetic code, and T.
Triving those letters, those letters about 20 letting about 20 amine-ring acids -- a single letter of a very amine.
So we can use the genetic to write words, sentence, the sentence,
Inifia, everything we did was to have the code.
Some of them were unremoved to the poetry.
We designed those pieces so that we can define the enzyme.
They're enzymes that they repair them.
So we started to do the gloads with five to the gloads of five letters, and it matters to do it by 24,000 lets the same, and then put it into the other 2.00s.
Every time we flew these pieces of these pieces of the abundant to sequence them to do the fire, and trying to create a very red process.
We are trying to get to that point of automative.
So this shows like a basketetetetetch of baskets.
When we get to the very large pigs of 100,000 paths of the basic paths in E.
It is all the tools of modern molecular molecules.
So we went to other hanism.
We knew that there is a mechanism called recombination of human biology that biology that biology is using DNA, and that's unique.
This is an example.
There's a organism called Deincoccucutting in the race of millions.
As you can see in the cross of the cross is is destroyed.
It was 24 hours to go back to 24 hours of it is in the slow.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be often often often often often all of it.
They can live in living.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the extreatment of extree, to move a new environmental environments.
In fact, NASA showed that this is dark there.
Here is a micrographic molecules that we've built using these procleaning process, in fact, using the advanced design with the design of the pipes that we put the pipes that we put the pipeline.
Drodia dia together of automatically --
This is not a picture of a microscope with electronics, but only one of the micro-grapher --
It's so a big molecule that we can see a optical microscope of optic.
These are college images over a five-second period of about six seconds.
This is a public that we had a little bit of a little time.
These are over 580,000 letters code code.
It's the biggest molecule did once we have a definite structure.
It's got a molecular molecular by over 300 million.
If we print it with 10 and without a space of 10 without a space to pretend to be able to do this genetic code.
So how do we start a crosos? How do you get it?
Evivil with a virus is pretty easy to do.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
And it's also easier to the euplot, like you can just get to get the nuclear and put the nucleus and put it together -- and that's something that you all heard --
With the chain, the cross of the box is integrated in the cells, but I showed you can do a same, but we can do a completely transplant to the cells, and we can activate it.
We had a chance of a microbial species from microbial species.
These are the second way that people and the same.
We added a few genes in the full of genes to see this crosis.
I deeply to enzymes to kill.
And it was pretty amazing when we put it in the cell -- you'll be appreciated our very sophisticated -- and cross the chosome, and the cross of the cells.
In fact, we thought this is how far it can go out and try to design the process of something more than that.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are all the kinds of species that have been embarrassed a second crosis, or a third of the third party, from another party, from the other hands of us as a second.
So those who think about evolution just as a single gene of change, and at some point in biology.
They're called enzyme, called restriction, which is actually unknown DNA.
The phosphilosopher, not a lot of it.
The gone -- the crososs we put it --
It was exposed to be exposed the other cross of the cross of the material as the as the as the as the as the as the as the as the as the as the as the as the as the as the trosis of the cross of the cross of the cross of the other crossed and recognized.
It became blue because of genes that we put in the crosis.
And after a short period of time, all the characteristics of a species of a species of the species of a new basic species, on the software that we put in the software that we put in the cell.
All proteins have been change, the membranes were changed, when we put the genetic code, is exactly what we transfer code in the way we've transfer.
This can sound like alone genome, but we can move the DNA to change the software software software to change things pretty pretty pretty dramatic stuff.
Now, I supposed to say this is not genesis, but it has been built on three billion years and half years and we suspect that we can be on a new version to create a new version of a new version of a new version of magic traveling on the digital project.
Why do this?
I think it's pretty obvious obvious about it.
We're on the way to go from six and a half billion people over 40 years.
To put this in context for me in context for me in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each of us there in 1946, in 40 years, in 40 years, will be four years old.
We have a fewer problems with potonight, providing water drinking water and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half of the food.
It will be difficult to do for it.
We use over five billion tons of books, more than 30 billion bars of oil.
This is a hundred million barrier day.
When we try to think about propose or anything that the process to replace that will be a huge challenge to be a huge challenge of challenge.
And then of course, is all that CO2 at this material, which is going to get into the atmosphere.
Now, our discoveries around the world, we have a basic data of genes, and I like to think about these components as the components of the projects.
The survey of the electronics has only a double six-component of components, and here's the diversity that came out of this.
We are limited here, first of all, a biological reality, and our imagination.
We now have the techniques, because of these quickly sweet methodological methodology.
We have the ability to build a large robot that to do a million cross a couple of miles a day.
When you think about this 20 million genes of different genes of different genes, or try to optimize the occupy procleaning process, vaccines of new vaccines of new vaccines of new vaccines than the last 20 years, to do more biology than the last 20 years, to do more biology than the last 20 years,
And that's just standard.
We can select for viviable vibrate chemistry or fuels or fuels, production of vaccines, the city.
This is a screen of an screen design that we work in order to wait to be able to work and work on these species in the computer species in the computer species in the computer species in the computer
You know, we don't know how it will show you.
We know exactly what they look like their genetic code.
We now focusing on the fuel on the flower to the four-generation.
You see recently in the ethanken-up experiment is just a unable experiment
We have commitment computations of the next two and the third of the third way they are going to get the flight of combat larger level of computations like occurring or different buttons of the buttons of buttons or different buttons of the flower of the generation of the generation of the next two and the third of the third generation of the third fit that will be a curring of the same flower of the same flower of commitment that are going to be over,
But the only way we think biology can have a major impact more without any important impact more than their food costs and the fly and the flow of the available and the only way it is if we start with the cells to design the cells to design and we are able to design the fourth of the generation of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the generation of the four-month of the four-month of producing impact on the bottom of the cost of the four-month.
Lowar and CO2 is a method -- but in the discoveries around the world, we have all the kinds of other methods.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It goes into the deep of the ocean and about two kilometers and half the deeper of the farmer of the fierbing.
CO2 in metan ithan using molecular hydrogen molecular to energy.
We are trying to see if we can take CO2 captured, which can be transported in the country, and convert that CO2 back to the fuel up to the buster in the fuel.
So in a short period of time, I think we could die that we could die the basic question "What is life is life life that is life life there?"
We know -- we know -- we have the objective path of the chemical.
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where another park in another part.
So let me become a major source of energy.
But we also work to use these same same sources to invest to invention goes, immediately vaccines immediately.
You saw this year with the blood and a year ago, and a dollar in mind when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think the situation can be changing vaccinated by building vaccines that before.
Here's how it could go to the future of change, the future of change, accelerating the evolution of the evolution of the bacteria and the syntheose, and finally, euo.
We're almost to improve people.
Our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive pretty much longer. Thank you very much much longer. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you move, very quickly, is a fundamental things, a new technology, a new technology that we've brought it to Microsoft as part of a little bit of about about a year. This is Sealo.
It's a environment that can interact with a local distant amount of visual data visual data.
We're now looking at a lot of digital pictures and showing you the digital pictures and marriage in the continuous ones, showing it in the way we want.
It's not the way to do is the inition, how big the data, how big images are the imagery.
Most of them are taken with a regular camera camera -- for example, is a very common digital scanning from the Bible Congress,
It's not important because the only thing that should limb the performance of a system of the monitoring system is the number of pixels to your monitoring architecture. It's also a very flexible.
This is a little bit of a non-imaginative.
It's about "Ca" -- Hickens. Every colored -- Every colored is a capital.
To demonstrate that is about text, and not imagine, we can do something like this, to look at this real representation of a text; it's not a picture of a text; it's not a picture here.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read a book in form of electronic book.
I wouldn't recommend.
This is a case more real. It's a "Gardiance."
Every picture is the beginning of a second.
This is really gives you a piece of joke a plant experiences of reading version or a revil of a newspaper-dimensional environment.
We did something little little little little bit of this number of "Gardious number of "Gardious number of "Gardious number of us in the Gardious and we did something little little little little dogs of the little little little little dogs of the little little little little little little little bit of the world of the number of the world of the number of the number of "Gardiandious number of the number of in "Gardiandiandianulanulous number of the number of the number of in "Gardiances of the
We created a false reclaim to a very large resolution -- much larger than any other claming -- and we got a common containment.
If you want to see the properties of this car, you can see here.
Or other models, or even technical specifically specifically --
And this really cleaning from some ideas, the truth of a monitor.
We hope that this is to be a flow of the bridge and otherwise of the kind of the kind of thing -- which are not necessary.
Of course, the mapping is one of the applications for a technology of the kind of like this.
I'm not going to say a lot of time on this, but just to tell you that we have contributed to this field.
These are all the road in the United States of the south of NASA.
Let's go to a little bit else.
This is actually active on the Internet; you can see it.
This is a project called Photosynth, which is a different technology. Some of them is Sealoon and the other side of the visual perception of visual perception of the visual perception of the visual University of Washinged the University of Washinged Severz State Severz Steve Severz Steve Seesttton, the fill.
and Rick Szeliski at Cerki Microsoft. A beautiful colleague.
This is active active on the Internet.
You can see that when we create this kind of perspective, when we can navigate through imaging images in many ways,
But the space spread of these images of these images matter.
Agains visual images have recorded these images together, so that to recover the real space where these pictures -- all of the Grasses, all the Grasses of the Grasses, these elementary tools here -- they were able to see these elementary tools and showing or showing or shooting these elements.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There are some more spaces;
I would like to go to the original standing of Noah -- this makes a part of a prototype of Photosynth that I worked in the vest -- to show you what I think is the piged pioneered this technology, it's just a vision-foot-the-the-the-the-bons.
We had to have a concern about the law of the law of ways.
This is a reconstruction of Cateway Catedralk, Dames in images of the images of the Yet Nowook, and you find something like a couple of these pictures in the tricky of these patterns in the room, and every single one of these conportions are a picture that was found that the code of this pattern.
These are are a picture of Flickr, and all of the space in this motion.
We can just die in this motion.
You know, I never thought I would have to work at Microsoft is very eating to have a part of a first and I have a first first of all,
I don't see that I'm noticed a lot of the camera, all the games from the cell phones, just a cell phone to SLs in this environment.
If I can find that strange any strange of these strange strange.
There are many maps of fear, seven, six,
One is going to be a series of photography.
This is a poster poster Damer who was recorded right.
You can get to a poster environment to a physicist environment.
The idea is that I can do certain things with social environment. This means to collect all the world -- from the world -- from a collective memory of what the Earth looks like the Earth's Earth -- and interconnected them all those pictures were interconnected to the whole thing that is more emerging than the country is more than the country is more positive than the country.
You have a model of what comes out of the entire Earth.
Think about this as a little code of Stephen Lawler Hello.
And this creates in complexity as the world as the world of benefits as benefits of benefits as users.
The pictures are the ethical metaphor that otherwise.
If someone would eater all these sfine, and he says who I are, then my picture of the Nowl Dame, you would improve all of these data, and I could use it as a sweet of this space to get it to get it into that space, to realize that space.
And of course, a product product, but all of these are huge and the virtual patterns of the Earth, collective neighbors of the Earth, collective and images not only from the ground and images of the collective family and images of a collective member of a collective member of the collective memory but a collective memory of the collective and the whole thing to do is a collective memory and
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood the software will allow your software to be in your own own inmates, is like a couple of years old, is like all the pictures of someone on a glob to be interrelation?
BAA: Yeah. What does is really to look like is to look at it.
It creates hyper-connectivity, if you will, between images.
And it does that interview of the images.
And this becomes a quote when you think about the signal of the signals that have these images.
As you do a picture of the Internet, you know, you look at some of the right day, and the text on the Internet gives a lot of information that representation of information about what represents on the pose.
Now, what would be if that positive is the connection to all your picture?
And the amount of signal interconnection and wealth of this is huge, where is a class class class of the country.
CA: Blaise, it's incredible. Felics.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense plants and a traveling piece of research research and ethankly is the failure to live among the old ones who don't look the old in the wind of the seller bees, and they still feel the last flow of the plants of the planet.
You know that Jaguary, Jaguary, and I still have the Laccount of the elderly lose old old ages, or that in Himalaia or that in Himalaia continues to say Dharalay, and that is really the revelation of Dhard, and this idea is not just a sense of the world that we live in a sense of reality, but this is just a sense of reality.
The consequence of a certain set of choices that our ancestors that were the string of our ancestors in the next generations in the next generations in the next generations in the next few generations in the next generations of a certain set of generations of a certain set of decision-making decisions in the way that the straight of decisions that the bonds of the decisions that they were going to make them in the ancestors of the enough, and it was a lot of generations of the enough, with many generations that the stry,
And of course, we all share the same adaptive adaptive adaptive --
We are all born. We all bring kids on the world.
We are three initions of inition.
We need to do the separation of the morning, so we should not surprising that we should all have the songs, and we all have arrived.
But what interesting is the unique is unique of songs, the race of every culture.
Whether is the Penan Penan Easter forest in Borneo, or Voodoo in Haiti, or the West war or the Kaut in the northern of Kenya Sake of Kaut Jahai.
By the way, this is the guy that I traveling with the desperately a month, or even a long stage of those on the pants, Everest, the Tomangk, the TV walls of the world.
All these people are learning that there are other ways to be other ways to think about other ways to think of other ways to think of the Earth.
And this idea, if you think about it, it can't be like to kill you in the hope.
Now, the miright-culture colors of the world of spiral life that the planet and cultural life that cover the planet and is as important to the biological health care as the remaining biological health care, known as the biological network.
And you could think about this network as being a diet of life like the ethnose, and you could define, and you could define, intuitive to all the dreams, intuitive intuitial human consciousness from the human consciousness of the conscience.
Etnosphere is the great human maps.
It's the symbols of what we can be like a surprising specific specific specific species.
And as the biosphere was seen, and the ethnose, and maybe a lot more higher.
For example, no matter how much we don't really near to suggest that half or more of all the species of the expanded -- because it is not true because it just is not true, and yet this is not true, and yet this scenario in the field of biological diversity -- the abestone of the most optimistic cultural wavelength of what we know the stage of the cultural diversity.
And the biggest indicator of this is the limb disappearance disappearing.
When you were born you, those in this room, there were 6,000 languages talk on the planet.
Now, a language is not only one vocabulary of free rules.
A language is a spread of human spirit of human spirit to human spirit
It's the vehicles of the soul of the soul of particles are going to get into the material.
Every language, is a old old mind, a lot of mind, a deforestation of the spiritual possibility.
And from those 6,000 languages, how we are now here in Monterey, half of them are not the more they failed in the next ones.
They're not learning to babies are not learning to change something, that if not change something -- that they're already right language.
What can be the only only one to be the last line, to be the last one in your own own language, you don't have the way to talk to you not the way the wisdom of the demand the endangered wisdom or the dirty of the children?
And yet, that soards really is the unknown as a little somewhere on Earth, about about every two weeks ago, because every two weeks ago, a elephant and it takes in the last few days, a whole lot of the elements of a languages.
And I know some of you will say, "Well, would be better better better than you know,
It wouldn't be a better place if I all talk about a single language? And I said, "Grozave, language, that language, or to be Cantone."
Or to Kogi."
And then you'll discover how it would be able to be not to talk to your own language.
So, what I want to do today with you is a sort of ethnose, a short journey to try to give you a sense of trying to give you a sense of what it is losing to be losing to be losing you all.
Now, there are many of us that they seem to look like when I say "whose different ways to be the different ways to be the different ways to be a different way of us to be a lot of us to be a lot of us that are a lot of us that are going to look at the way that when I say "when I say "whose different ways to be looking for the different waves of us to be looking for the different ways to be to be to be to be to be in different ways to be to be doing different ways to be in to be a different waiting for the different wake to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be

Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some things about a book that I hope that they hope will be able to do with other things that you already heard and I would try to do that and do some connections in the case you have some connections in the case you have a ratelted.
I want to start with what I call "Dutch with you with it.
Doctrofy why?
The Docchef-the-west of Western society.
And this doctor doctor sounds like this: if we are interested in to maximize the sea levels of citizens, the quarter of the citizen deeply level.
The reason is that freedom is so freedom is enough, value, valuable to be humanitarian to be human.
And because if people are free then people are free and individual things that will maximize our good and make our good job and no one need to decide in our place.
The maximum freedom is the maximum of choices.
The more choice, the more choice, the more people have freedom of freedom, and the more freedom of freedom of the more freedom of the more freedom of the more freedom of choices.
So I think, is so good at the surface that it wouldn't go through the system that would never get to put it through the set.
And it's deeply in our lives.
I'll give you a couple of examples of what did for us to do for the progress in the last time.
This is a supermarket. No supermarket.
I mean, I just want to say two words about it.
175 sits for the supermarket, this guy, if we don't go on and the 10 different types of measures and the 175 different types of the whistles that can be a two-hole of whose whose you can buy the own sample in a very large number of selling in a very large numbers of the 175 that g’t stock the stage of the stage of the stage of the stroke of of of of of of of of the selling and the stock and the stage of the stage of the steageager stage of the stage of the stock and
So it's so fallen to the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronic components to confy your component to confy a system of a tophone, the transformed, transform the filmmaker.
And in this pyramid store components are a lot of star.
We can confident of six million and half million and half the components of the components that are in the office of a single store store store store in the store of the stereotype.
You need to recognize that this means a lot of options.
In other ways, the world -- in the world of communication.
There was a kid, when I was a kid, where you could get any kind of a phone service like so many of the way that was offered by MBell.
The next one. You don't buy it. You don't buy it.
By the way, one of the consequence of this was actually the phone was never the straight of it.
And those days are a lot of apuse.
Now, we have a almost neling diversity of telephones, especially in the world of mobile.
These are the mobile phones.
My favorite is at the middle -- with MP3 player, with MP3 player, apart from the sea and the one of the southern war to make a fear of the war was a shock.
And if you were not seen in the stores you can see in the store store and see it because in the curious one.
And the result is that the result in the stores and put this question.
And you know what the answer is the answer to the question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to buy a phone-phone-phone-phones.
And in other domain of life that are much more important than bugs of opposite as a number of options.
The health care -- in the United States is not the case you go to the doctor and this is telling you what to do.
Instead, you know, you're going to take you to say, we have a various various various of B.
He has these advantages and these risks.
BBe these advantages and these risks. What do you want to do.
And you say, "Doctors, what to do you do?" And the doctor said, "Your advantage and the risks and the risks of these risks and the risks and the risks of these risks and the risks of these things.
What do you want to do you do?
And you tell you "But if you do you do it, you know, you know, you know, the doctor says, "But the head is not in your place in your place is -- I told them "authority." And the result of what it does like a part.
But what is actually is a transition of responsibility and chooning decisions from someone who knows something -- in this case -- in the case of the doctor -- somebody who don't know anything and it's almost certainly not in the best form of the best form of choice.
There's a huge level of public health care, for the reetal drugs that are reetal to people like me, and as if you think a lot, because if we don't think a lot, because we can't buy them.
Why do we add the new audience if we don't buy them if we don't buy them.
The answer is that the people who do this wave as we are to call our doctors in the next morning in the morning and ask them to change our networks.
Something that our identity has become a choice, and this transition problem of choice, and this transition of the role of showing this.
that we don't change a identity but we have the possibility to have the possibility to it.
And we can reinvest our reinventor we have a check.
And that means that every day when you're going to be able to decide what kind of person want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be to be that every day you want to be in every day when you go to the whole day when you go to be in every day when you go to the way you are going to be to be to make you be to be to be to deciphere:
With all the respect for the truth and family had a passed one that in the press that the people had to go closer as it was that you have to get as soon as far as it becomes like rereturn.
The only opposite was with dinner, not when you do it after it.
In our days, everything is very much at the bottom.
I give them incredibly intelligent students and give them to 20 percent less than I did not have to do it.
And that doesn't have a little bit less define less because it was less than the map.
What do because they're concerned with all kinds of questions "should be able to do I need to do it? Would I have to do it?
Do I should have me till later? You should have a kid, or a card or a cartoon?" All of this is consuming.
And they will answer these questions, whether whether it means that to not do all the fibers that means to do all the things that I give them to my curve.
And that's what we need to do. These are important questions that you need to answer it.
The things that -- we're blessing and Carl and Carl and Carl and Carl to work in every single mind, every single mind, every single single place on every single place on every single place on the planet -- less from Hotel.
By the way, there's a region in a core of the color, that I haven't been going to work on the wireless of the wireless-to-of-the-the-the-profound regions.
I don't tell you about it because I want to use it.
So this incredible means that this incredible freedom to choose to choose to do with a decision, is that we need to take a decision, and welfare and even though if we should be working with.
We can go to see how our football and to have the moonly and we have the mobile buzzzzon the other hands and laptop of the other laptop and the laptop and the laptop.
And even though they're closed in every single mind, where the door you look at how the door you are moving a football of us to answer this water?
Do you have to answer this email? You should write the memory of this letter?" And even though the answer is that the sense of the game is that the experience of your football will be a different from what was going to be a different from how it would be a difference.
So where we watch our small and small things that are and the things that are the stars of life, life is a little bit of eight things is a little bit of eight things.
And the world I was living about it.
To say that, I had some choices to do that, but it doesn't all was a little bit of eight things that was a little bit of option.
And the world we live now looks like this.
And the question is, right?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what I know about this, so I will talk about what I am going to talk about what is wrong.
All these choices have two types of choices of two negative effects on people.
One of the effective effect, it's produxy paralyze, it's more like release.
And so many options that can choose to choose to choose to choose for something difficult to opposite something difficult for something like something like something like that.
I give you an important example of a very significant study about the investing of privacy in the private planes of private pensants
A cold of my college had access to Valaryzed by the Valoe, so mutually translated and almost 2,000 sees and almost 2,000 sees.
And what learned is that for every 10 philosophers who offer the hip of the employees of the participation of two percent.
50 foundations of mutually -- they were written 10 percent less you get to get less than if you give you any ones.
Because 50 foundations of mutually the naive, is a lot of hard to choose what you do to choose and do so that you can do so far.
And then on the poimmorting, and then on the wall, and on the wall, all the time on the wall, all the time that this was never ever ever ever welcome.
You understand that this doesn't just mean that the people will consumer food for a few people will be able to eat because they don't have enough money to put a lot of money to put a decision to put a decision in the compensation of a lot of money from the compensation that would give you compensation to hide the compensation of the compensation of the compensation of the compensation of the compensation of the people are going to get to get to the compensants to put the offer in the death of a couple of the forests of
We were looking at the legs at the bottom of 5,000 dollars a year from the hidden part of the compensants that would pay happy.
So the credit is a consequence when you have too many options.
And I think that makes the world like this.
You really want to take the best decision if it's for all the etheless, right?
You don't want to choose your investment in the wrong or no one of the wrong or not even wrong.
So this is a second effect. The second is that if we managed to keep the station of the way we can do a choice until we have a choice to do with the result of choices than we were a few choices that we were a little choice that we choose choosing choice.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that we had a lot of snoses for a lot of selling if you buy one and it's not just -- and you know, it's not just -- and you know, why, whose light?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better choice. And what happens is better that alternatives you can imagine that the alternative that you have in the choice that you have done it in the regreen regret and these regret regret decisions that you get a good decision.
The more opposite of options, the more opposite to regret something that is unlike the option that you have a choice that you have otherwise.
Second, what economists call the opportunity of opportunity.
Dan Gilber demonstrated very clear in this morning in the morning we are seeing things that we compared to what we compare to what compare to what compare to what we compose it.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative alternative to have in the sense of the way to imagine the characteristics of the alternative alternative characteristics that makes you less satisfy the alternative that you have a little satisfy that you have a little satisfy that you have a lot of satisfine alternatives that you have a lot of alternatives that you have a little bit of an alternative to imagine the way you get to imagine the way you have a little bit of imaginative.
Here's an example. I ask the people who are not New Yorkers.
But here's how should we did.
We have this box in Hamptons.
A very expensive properties.
You can get a superbit. They have something beautiful. They have everything to do.
What could we want to want to do it more and more than the drink, it is audacious to think about.
All of my neighborhood in Manhattan is coming in.
I could look at the office in front of the office." And what was the idea that the sea snaps to have a channel of the day to have a place to have a place to have a place to have a place that wonderful.
The food stage in the satisfaction that we have on the choice that we have a choice right right now.
And the more options are made in the way to look at the same way that characteristics are going to be perceiving for us as an opportunity to be perceived for an opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon tells a lot of things.
He says we should live the clipper, and probably we should do things slow.
But one of the things that tells is that anybody says is that anybody choose to do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things that are going to do what you do you do what you're doing is going to do you do what you do is going to do is what you do you do is doing what you do you do what you do is doing is a lot of things can have a lot of other things can have a lot of the other things can have a lot of other things that you do what you do you do you do you do you do what you do you do you do what you do you do you do what you do you do what you do what you do you do you do what you do you do what you do you do what you do what you do you do you do you do
The third route of ways, the expectance.
This is what I wanted to replace to replace my blankly.
I think about blame all the time.
And there was a way that the beekept and you buy them and you buy them and you buy them as a drink of the drink and they were incredibly unable and if you have, and if you have, and he was starting to stand her saving better.
So I went out to my flight after I had a good years of good enough, and I said, "Look, I want a black." And I want a wall of the jeal." And the window." And the sea and the windowelcome to be sick,
Do you want to get the farmer? Do you want to prefer or or your finger?
Do you want to be the gone to the road
You want to eventually eventually, you want to go to the blah -- not the end.
He painted me and he said, "I want to revenue, I said, "I want to be the same kind of the same kind of the same kind of had been spent a city that I spent a city and I spent a city in the wall of the wall of the wall of the wall the wall of the walls I had.
I have a lot of the options have done it possible to choose better.
But I was feeling worse.
Why do we wrote a book that I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt worse, I felt worse, it's that we had all these options that I should be a good wave of how good they should be grown up to the good wall have grown up.
I had very flow ways. We didn't have any expectation of the way they were in a single same.
Now when they're 100 times, my mother, my mother, one of them have to be perfect.
And what we got was good, but not perfect.
So I compared what I did was I expected with what I expected and the result of what I did was compared to what I did is to hope what I hope
The options of choice in the lives of the people can't do something else, than to make the expectations that people have to be those options.
And the right will take a little bit of satisfaction to even though they get a good result of good results.
Nobody in the marketing world,
Because if you know it, I can't have an idea about what I talk about.
The truth is more about it.
The reason that everything was better than when everything was worse was worse was worse than the people to experimenter was really possible that people to expertise was really possible to be paid surprise for the people to be paid as well.
Today in the world, in the world we live -- we live -- we look at the perfect and we look at the perfect thing that we expect the right thing that you can say things that things are going to be so good at how good things are going to be so good at the same time.
You never have paid surprised because my expectations and my expectancy to the sky.
The secret happiness -- because you all came up with -- the secret of happiness is to have waiting.
I mean, I just want to say -- just a short moment -- that I actually have a wonderful wide and it's really really really wonderful good.
I couldn't find something better than I could find anything. I didn't stand have one.
But let's look at the house not necessarily not necessary.
And finally, a consequence of a wall of you who don't want to buy a blue dog that you can't buy a single one one one one one one one one one one way that is where that is a clear and ask you what is a clear and the answer is clear to the answer.
The world is the wood. How could you do it?
When they're hundreds of different stars of different blue and available to one that you are disappoints you and ask yourself why, why, why are you going to come from?
It's as clear that answer, the answer to the question.
You could have better choose better.
A hundred different ways of blue waves to choose no way to choose any way to eat.
So when people do decide to make decisions that if the results are made good enough, they feel like the results of them, they are really good at all.
The press of the erupon the last generalization of the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not the only important -- but important to this erupper erupon the dest of the desert that people are experienced in which are disappointed because standards are too lifted in their debate.
And when you have to explain these experiences believe they are the wild.
So the general result is that we go better and feel more objective and we feel more so.
So let me remind you to remind you.
This is a doctrina, that all the way we all think is really true and it's really true.
Without the talk, you know, to have a few choices of choices that many choices are better than a few choices are better than a few choices than a few people.
There's a magical number. I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty sure that we went up a lot of that point in the way that choices are the way of life expectance.
Now, the idea -- almost we've been finished -- the idea that I think is this.
What allows these choices these choices in industrialized society is the good thing is the grandmother.
There are a lot of places in the world, and we heard some of them where they have not too many of them are not too much options.
The problem is they have too little bit.
So the thing about talking about is a strange problem of Western society and rich modern and rich societies.
And what is frustrating and suffering, is Steve Levitt talk, what is about these chair chair and hard to install the way to install of the way to install of the way we were enough.
What I tell you is that these options, expensive, expensive, expensive.
They actually are a payment of pain.
They are really doing to feel more worse.
If something that allows us to do in our society to do all the choices that we do all have transferred in the society that people have too little options that people would have too little lived but our lives would be improved, but our lives would be improvement but our lives are amorders.
This is what economists call the Pareto.
The Redwelcome to do better and be the better people -- not just poor -- because of the way that exist extended us to the choices of choices.
In conclusions. You know, you think about this cartooner and being a sophisticated person you're going to say, "Wo! What do you know is the fish of the fish going?
You know nothing that nothing is possible in this account." I, a poor on the world -- so I read it it it and I read it it it and I read it it it and I read it it it in the time.
But the more I thought about it much more than I came to think that the fish knows something like that.
Because the real thing is, if I hope it all sorts of the way it doesn't have freedom. You don't have freedom of the resident.
If you hope that everything that is possible, the way that everything is possible, the sea level.
You are crew and scaling and score at all.
Anybody needs a variety.
This is almost certainly too limited -- probably even for a fish for us.
But the absence of a metaphor is a network for unhappy and pregnancy and pregnancy and pregnancy --
Thank you very much.
