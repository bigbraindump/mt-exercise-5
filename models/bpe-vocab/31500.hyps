And the year we were thrown these two diays to demonstrate that the polar polar that was the polar in the last three million years has been a small size of the last three to the size of 48 percent of the size of the magnitude, it was a little bit of 40 percent of the time.
But this morning, this particular particular particular particular particular problem because it doesn't look at the black issue.
The polar of the polar is, in a way, the heart of the climate of the climate of the climate of the climate of the climate.
It goes over, and they are expanding and the fear and the fear and the fear of the fear and it was expanding the fear and it was expanding and it's expanding and the fear and the fear and the fear and the contract.
The next slide that I'm going to show you will show up the last 25 years.
Gheat at is the bottom of the smell.
As you can see the blue of blue inds of blue ink.
This is the border of the year for the near of the near of the net.
And it goes to the rain.
Asa-called the Speak was a five-year or more you can see that it's almost like the birds of a body.
In 25 years of doing this, at this point.
This is a problem because the inner of the skin around the oceans around the ocean.
where it's been a massive amount of carbon astonished that when it comes to meter, it's transformed in the micro-organisms.
Compared with the pollution of the global warming of the global warming could go to if we go to if we go to this extreme way of the extreme way of doing this extreme direction.
We are actually in some lacks in the Alaska metan effective of the same.
The Katey Walter Walter Walter was on the Alaska little tereter with another team at a small lag in the past,
Oau! Ah, oka! One is OK if we are -- it's a question if we are going to be here.
And a reason is that this enormous word "so" is the Grenland.
This is a role that they all over the year of the year.
But the volumes are much more like that.
This is the Kangerussum in the Sweden, the Pleruss.
If you want to know how the other creative level of the fun of the fish of the falls that is where it gets to get into the big place.
These debate are growing very quickly.
And at the other end of the plant, Antarctica of the largest map of the planet.
The last people of the scientists reported as the continent are reported as the continent is negative and the Eastern Antarctica of insult in the high-efficient ism.
This is the equal nest in the big level of the size of Grog.
In Himalaya, the main the same same way that the big flows of the new formats, which was in the end.
40 percent of the population of the world get half of the water water water water water in these topirs.
In the year, this guilar is the source of this one.
The reason they grow.
But when it goes to be done with the table water water water water water water and with the table water water and it was going to be done by it.
In California was a 40 percent of the fear of the fear in Sierra.
This is the affected the water reserves of water.
And predictable, as you can read it, they're serious.
And in the whole world has led to a dramatic creative creative creative creature.
And the disasters of the world have been grew up with an extraordinary rate and the summer and the summer.
And four times more of the last 30 years of the 75 years of the 75 years of the case.
This is a completely unsustainable model of it.
If you look in context you can see what happens.
In the last five years, we add this 70 million tons of carbon dioxide every 24 hours of the ocean.
Up to the point of view of the Pacific Pacific area of America, and every part of the Indian where the subcontinent of Indian where it's radical radical oxygen in the ocean.
The largest because the only one of the global warming global warming of the deep sea of the represent of the fossil fuel stars.
The Petran is a problem and the best of the best and the best of it.
The United States is one of the two great emitties of China.
And the proposition was to build a lot of factories for good car.
But we start to see a whole change of it.
Here are the people who have been assumed in the last few years with a propositive alternative.
However, there was a policy of our policy.
And the carbon industrial and the oil and the oil was spilling of a billion dollars in the last year of the endark.
And the good thing to do is an hour.
This image of a remember one thing to do about it.
In the price of Cracial Tennesian alone billion gallons of the cartoon was imprast.
You probably see the stirons.
This is, the whole thing in your hand, the second big deals in America has been done in America in the preparing of Crace.
One of the reclamations of the cartoons, about the Cracial O, it was this.
Video: ♫ ♫ Frosy, the man man with the skin and the girl, and I see.
He is abundant abundance, here in America, and it helps the economics.
Frosty, the man with the car, it becomes the worst of the things that way.
It's access to adorable and the workers of the bird of the birth.
Al Gore: This is the most of the cartoon Virginia --
The Minner on the largest map of Massey of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankennel: I want to be clear -- the Folose, Nana, and they don't have what I talk about.
Al Gore: So the same as Aligain, the Climate has launched the second campaign.
This is one of them, a part of one of them.
Video: Actually, at COALergy new climate change as a very serious threat of our business.
That's why our main the principle is to spend a lot of money for the public forces that we could help us show us about the good forward to help us and we have the real thing.
The idea is, in fact, the good cars is not didar.
We think it's clear -- and I think about -- and I guess and good.
So you won't even learn for the climate change for the climate change
You can see that in our way.
Video: The best of the coal, you know a degree of it.
So let's do a hair of this poor of this cockroach.
I mean, yeah, the Masinaria is about the noise noise yet.
But this is the sound of the technology of the good book.
And while the good cars are one of the main the global causes of global incable technology of the technology of the technology of the good carelevators you can change everything.
Up to the point of view, this is the technology of the good career.
Al Gore: In the end of alternative supplied to the economics of the economics and the problem with nation-and-problem.
Video: Narrator: The Narrators, economists, economical, economy; the crisis.
The mention that they law all the dependence on all of the carbon of the carbon disorder: the good news but the oil.
But now we have a new solution to the notion of the novel to the incurcle to the incurious solution.
You can also get America with electricity 100-percent -- in 10 years ago in 10 years ago.
A plan to put America in the way, and then it has to be able to help us to stop and help us to the global warming.
In the end, a solution that is a solution that we could help us solve our problems.
You can also be America. You know, you more than that.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: It's about the re-energizing of Americans.
One of the fastest ways of encounter to the old combuster advertising our planet disorder: The Viit's plant, the Viitan Barbbe: The Viitan is here -- a new returns.
Barbered nr.2: We invested to create jobs.
Narrator: Re-energizing America. It's time for action.
Al Gore: Exista rate old old old African who says, "Yeah, you want to go fast, you get up right there!"
If you want to get back to you to get back and forth, you go away.
We need to get it back, fast.
Thank you very much.
The year at TED I did a TED introducing to LHC.
And I promised it and give you a data data about how this is it works.
So I guess for the people who have not been here in the LHC is not the largest scientific experiment -- the largest scientific experiment -- the Stree or is to recreate the conditions of a fraction of a billion of a fraction of a billion of a fraction of a billion of the creation -- the faction of the universe -- the panel -- the panel of the world panels of the universe -- the panish to the universe -- the panish
It's extremely about both sides.
This is the device under the Geneva.
We do the photos of these minds "Big Bangs" in the decades.
I work on this one. It's called the ATLASS -- Lunning 44 meters of 22 meters of a 22 meters of a picture of the ATLALS here is the proportion of the ATLALS in construction.
On the age 10 seven, I went on the first steps on the first time.
And this picture was the ATLALAS.
It caused a huge celebrity in the room.
It's a picture of the first one of the particle that has been able to put over the LHC, crossing the LHC, crossing system is in the LHC deliberately and particle and particles, and it's a particles.
In other words, when I was in other words, I knew that 10 seven, I knew that the device is a successful success.
I don't know if that has the largest poor, or that, when someone went to Google and see it was the first page of the first page of the page of the end of the same way.
It means that I did a cultural impact on the scientist of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of it.
And then then then I had a problem with the device, which actually had to do with these days, that actually had to do with these days.
Those are some of the flower of the motor of the power of the maximum of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the transportation of a 13,000 ft.
Now, engineers in the engineers look at these days, "You can't transport the flaw." They are bee."
But I can do that because when they're at the temperatures become what is called the superconductor.
So as a 271 degree of this, because of the hospital between those steps can transport these flower can transport these box.
At one of the laws of the laws of the laws of the LHC, was a factory of factory factory factory in the League.
So that the company has been sweating, and the 13 thousand ample of the resistance of electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressired that you have been in 20 tons of tone, and they moved over 20 tone, and they move.
So I determine about 50 magnetic math.
We had to get out of it, which we would be done.
We reconcusion, we repair it.
And now we take magnetic and then in the subterm.
The fear at the end of the Mars of the LHC will be like new LHC will be like new onstage.
We will start on the again, and we are going to get up in the unitin, and we're going to keep the research and continue to find out that are the elements of the universe.
Now, of course, that in a sense, those accident accident about the important thing about the important news and engineering and engineering to break. It's going to break it.
I think that it was so hard to be so hard to have the fact that we have young people like LHC.
So I will go to the words of a scientist scientist, Humphrey Davelphins -- when the app experiments of the protection of the protection of the protection of the protection of the human minds of human minds for human minds to presence our human minds to presence our human rights and the science of our science and the scientific rights are finished, and as the human rights are not finding to our light."
Thank you.
I want to start with the rate of your child, when you would play with you.
And as you invite to get them to get them and get them and keep them and get them and get them to get them to be able to also solve and sold and resolve the emotional problems.
The truth of the spot of how we understand a lot of the world in the end.
So, in the way of the food, the IT inspired by this utility of our physical objects -- impression of our physical objects, and my collaborator of my account, my my color of Jeevan Kalan Kalanthy -- I would be when we use a computer, where we can use a computer, where we would be so much more digital and more and more and more and more and more informed and more informed to be so much more and we could be able to connect to the magnesson and put it in the digital and we could be both of this un-to-edge, and we can also apping and we can be both and we can be able to be able to be so that we can actually go to connect to connect to the digital objective and more digital and remood to each other and not be both and more and remood to the digital and more and more
So we want to do it for it?
And the question of this was so fascinating as much as we would go to the Swe'd be able to build Siss Stable to build Sisses.
In short, a very short, Siftweet the size of a biscket.
They can be manufacturing -- they can perceive the food, they can perceive the environment, and they have a screen and a radio screen and an radio of wires.
The most important thing is that they're palpable, like the game, you can just like the missing.
And Sif, the cameras an ecosystem of an ecosystem to be informed by the digital manipulating information.
And on the top of these tools become palpable, more constitutes of their mission of otherwise and constants, and the contives of our nual nuactive and we can start exploring and destructive new stills.
I'll start with a simple example.
This Sifting is configuring out the video, and if you were to reach the film -- the camera is -- if you include it in the other part, they get back back back and forth.
These are the interactive interactive are constantly the other side of the otherwise
So, if I put them one langer and they become interested.
If they are unconscious, they will be able to get this and this is a little conusion.
They can also feel the mission and inclining.
We realized that one of us that we can use the interaction of interactions is like we can use the data, how we could use the data would be a color like we would be a liquid liquid in a liquid liquid of a liquid of the very interesting thing to do about one of the very interesting involves of the interactions of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interac
In this case, we have three Sif, we have three Sif, and they can use them to be using to be a color in the center in the center where they are going to among the center where they are going to among the way.
If we were too much, we can get too much, we can get back.
There are also interesting possibilities for education, like the language of education, mathematics and logical, mathematical and logical things that we want to want to try to figure out how quickly we can see the results immediately the results immediately immediately the results immediate results.
So here I -- this is a Fibonacy, which is a simple program that I do with a simple program of equation.
Here we have a game game of the words of the words of Scrabs and Boggle.
So in fact, every single one of the first one of the Sif, and the main every Sif, and the main the words, are great, they are great, they are grew with a dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds come out of the letters of the letters and you have a new set of letters and new possibility of incertainly encountered.
Thank you.
This is the kids who came to the Media Laborator of Media, and I returned to try and remote them and filmmaker and filmmaker and filmmaking.
They like to love it.
And one of the interesting aspects of this application of this application of people are not to give them a lot of people to them.
All you have to say is "F: "Four word," and they know exactly what to do.
Here are other people who are asking them out.
This is the most tank, this is the most tank, in the right.
It turns out that everything else wanted to do was to be a Sif-one Sif-one Sif-one of the other.
So for him was just a customers.
This is an interactivity of an interactive animation.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who invest language.
And this is Felix.
He can introduce new persons in the scene, just raise the sample of those Switches that they find the character.
And that is where the wife.
Video: The race.
David Merrill: Now he has introduced a stage in the scene.
Video: The interface, the Tractor of the interrupt.
Very of course, yeah.
Misssets and and assigned it to one the langa can make their personal persons -- Video: Ham!
DM: I mean, it takes your own narrative.
WW: Huna!
DM: It's a very end, and he decided, and he decided.
Video: Sboard, peak!
DM: The last example I have time to show you today is a device and interpreted the music of the live and interpreted the Swee camels, and all the role of the sound like the role and all the band all the band all of the by.
Each of these are four different variations of these different variations you you want to use it.
And you can add the sound of a succession that you can get the same thing you can do.
You get the sound goes off, the sound of a Sweet Sweet a Stagger of success.
There are effects you can control the lives, like the reverberal and the video.
You can see a certain sounds of a certain sounds and then includes it to help it.
They are following the general effects like the volume and the volume of the sample of the K.
They will be able to start with a rit: We will be a south, and we would put it into a serious and we would put it into a serious one.
Now I now put a basic line.
Video: DM: Now I add the fish.
Video: DM: And I'm going to add the movie to control the whole lights.
Video: DM: I can tell you the whole sequence of inclining or announced in a part or another.
Video: You know, I'm going to go out for more and more expressive for more expression.
Video: DM: I can do it in the long time it was in the long time.
So I don't have to do the plan, you can improvise, improvise, you can improvise, or a sample of the walk.
Now, in the end, I can be able to be able to make sure the Sif, using the Sweb of the volume,
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is the creation of new interfacts that are better to our brains and our brains and our body.
And today, we had time to show you a coordinate coordinate this new spatial of design, and some of the possibilities that I try to get out of the lab that we were trying to get out of the lab that we had to get out of the lab to show them from the lab of you would have a coordinate coordinated, and we had the coordinated of this new space.
The Gand's going to retiny is like we're at a free with this new general instrument with the immediate of the interaction of the mechanical interactions that will bring in our new rules of the rules of our rules.
Thank you very much.
And these episode to talk about you all of you are all going to be all of you.
They are writing out.
He written is my teacher, but it's more about it.
It's all my mother, my load loads and fascinating a vibrate life.
And I don't have to do it before.
But that was saying, something like something like this, and in the career and in my career and in my career who determined me to the worker.
And the strange thing is like this chart, this is the biography of "Mananca, the Roaging called the Manancal categoric -- which is a lot of my character, and it became this important thing in the world for a little bit of a reason, and it became this important sense, and it becomes this important sense, and it became this international seller and become this international set.
The result is that the way that they go now, people are going to be a confused to be a confused to be a confused to be conded.
Serio: Serio, confused to be natroad!
With the ingrijorships and you say, "You don't know -- you don't have any of you may not be able to be able to degrade this?
You don't know that you're going to keep your life and your life fresh the time to create a book that would ever be able to do it?
It's very linked to the very link of true.
But it was also more than I didn't remember if I didn't know about 20 years ago, when I was a teenage -- I want to become a teenage -- I want to become writing -- I want to become writing, I had a kind of range of the same African response of the same African response of the same size of the same African response of the same African response of the same fear.
And people would say, "Not you?"
I don't mean that humility to break the task is going to kill you?
You don't know that you're going to work in this field, and nothing will be able to do this field, and nothing will be able to see here and you want to be able to see the end of the flags of the screen?"
Something like that.
The answer -- the short -- the answer to all those questions is "Yeah."
Yes, you get the theme is the theme of all of those things.
And it always always finished me.
And you get out of the things that people who are not going to be able to intuitive they can't inture.
As an example of the big algorithms that are crossing.
But when it's about the work that I was always the last thing I was like, "Why is it "What?
Is it something rational?
It's the logic to anybody to be able to do it that they were destroying it was destroying to do this Pamp.
And what is it attitude to the specific initiatives that seems to us in the support of healthcare about their health care in which other teachers don't do it?
My father was my father was an engineer and I don't remember as you in the 40 years of you have a chemical engineering and it's not a chemical engineering to be a chemical engineer to be a chemical.
It wasn't happened -- John, how does the stand in the chemical?
It's just not not happening.
But to be honest, engineers as a group of chemicals that have not too many of the sequences of the reputation to be alone of the depression.
We write this ins; we have this reputation, and not only writing -- but the artists, it turns out that they seem to be powerful to be powerful to be very powerful to be very powerful to be very powerful to be very powerful to be very powerful to be powerful to be very powerful to be very powerful to be very straightforward and not only is it just like this reputation,
And everything we do is to look at the numbers of the number of dead dead -- in the 20th century, in the 20th of magnitude of the magnitude and often have been in young people and often often often often often and often often often often have their own own own own own man.
And even those who didn't have to be done, and they really have been destructive to be really destroyed.
Norman Mailer, even before I was in the last interview, he said, "Even as a little bit more of my cartoon."
A great great great news about your work of a life of a life.
But they don't have any cloud when we hear anybody because I heard this because I heard of things like this, and somehow much and we have been absorbed and somewhere in collective and suffer and suffer and suffering and the suit of creativity, and it will always get into a sense of the suffer and it will always get into a sense of happen.
And the question I want to add this is all this today is you all of you here -- are you all the idea?
You can comfortable with it -- because as it sees -- I don't care about this Asn't I track of this Asnch with this kind of ipotton.
I think it's an hour.
And I also think it's dangerous and I didn't want to see it in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage to make our artists,
And I know about my case, in my case, in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to try to get this of the neighborhood of this hair of a circumstance.
As for example, I'm pretty angry, I just just just about 40 years.
We probably have probably four of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of work.
And it's very likely to write this moment with this moment to be judged by the way that the work that came back after after my work, and then it was right after my career, right?
What it would be saying, because of the people here are the ones of the people here are already friends, and the largest successful of my job.
Oh, God, what God, which gand!
This is the kind of the gas to go to the near to the near the end of the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I want to do this message that message that message that I love.
And then, the question of the question of this?
And so I was sick and a lot of meditation, like the mania was that I need to try to make a kind of psychological construction, it's a kind of a psychological construction, right?
I had to do it in a way to defend a distant to the safe, and my father who write, and my father and my father who would be able to be in what it is now in what I write about what I write about what I write out.
And as we all looked in this one year in this sense, we started to look at the time, and I tried to find other society to see if they could have better ideas and better and healthy and healthy and healthy and healthy and healthy risk of how to be held emotional risk of emotional risk to the risk of emotional risk of ending.
And the research has led me to Greece, and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Romans.
So the big one, you can get the skull,
But in the Grection and Romes and Roming Romes are not that the creative of the human being being being in the human being, right?
People thought that creativity was a spirit was a spirit of the people who are helping people from people from a source and unintelligence, and unintelligent and unintelligent and unintelligent and uns.
The rules were called these spirits of creative creativityal of "the term of "the term of "Aed."
Socratic was because he thought that he had a demon which is a department that the wise of the wisdom of department.
The Romans had the same peak, but they called the immerside, the immersible account.
What is wonderful is, because they have no romantic genius was a very special individual genius.
They create a genius was a kind of magical entity was a kind of income and in a kind of income and a kind of like Dobbbby, and in the snassets and insession, the south and unable to artist's work and and and and the results of the workplace that come and the results of the workplace that we were going to respect to the workforce the workforce of the workforce of the worker and the workforce of the worker and the results of the
About the street -- this is really the distant that is the distant that I was talking about -- that the psychological construction that are to protect you from the workfor.
And all the world so that he has functionally gotten it?
So the artist was protected by some of the things that are so much narrative, right?
If your work was straltru, you couldn't keep the whole world for her, you know, the world the same way that you had this genius that has helped it.
If your work was critical, it wasn't completely completely sell of your work, it isn't it?
Everybody like your gender as your gender was a bit of ignorant.
And so they looked at people in the West creativity.
And then came to Renasting and everything else has changed, the idea of the main order to put the person in the center of the individual universe and mystery to all the mystery of the universe and mystery to the whole mystery for creatures that are receiving from the divination.
It was the human same, and people started to create the creative of creative as creativity, and they all of the individual individuals.
And for the first time people have started talking to one or other people have to be the other between artistic and a genius.
And you have to married, I think it was a huge error of a huge error of the error of the error to remain and you have to marine a lot of it.
If you can see, a simple person, a simple person, and it is actually the receptor is actually the receptor and the synthetic and the mystery and the mystery is a little bit too many of those are a little bit too many of the emotion of the fragile psychological force, the time of the fragile psychological force.
It's like you would ask you to get the wire to get the wife.
They just have an incovoice and they fit and generates all these astonishes that are all these astonishes.
I think that the pressure of this man man man man has been taken by the last 500 years.
And if it's true, and I think that is, the question is, what do we do?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we can go back to the higher sensitive sensitive to the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative relationships.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't just run 500 years of thinking 500 years of the rational thinking about 18 minutes.
And probably as it turns out that there would be absolutely noticed about the novel questions that would be the very very unless we go and they actually get people and all the way and all the way and all the way and all the way to the projects over the projects over the projects over the projects over the projects of the projects that would be able to do it.
You may not be a coopt to all this idea.
But the question I want to ask is -- why don't I mean -- why not?
Why don't we think about this?
Because it has a lot of that I have a lot of people that I know about an explanation of the very exciting of creative process.
It has been trying to create something -- basically to create something -- basically all of the people here -- you know, it's not always a range of behavior.
And in fact, sometimes you can actually seem to be the passed of the right right now.
I had a talk that I had a great time I met the American Ruth Stone, who was now in the American Ruth who has been on the poet and that was the poet that he told me when he told me that when my kid was going to work on the country of Virginia was going to work on the camp, and it just appear to be a poet and I just hear it up and he just hearing a poet and he just heard a poet and he just heard of the camps.
The story as a vast vast of the sample snows.
And it was a lot of the road over the camps.
The feeling of income because you are the galleries under the legs.
And that moment has a single thing that is, and that is, "get a single thing to do, "get the applat."
And the running as a staircase to the stage of the stage of the stage of the map and a little bit of a card and a lot of it is going to go through it and then when it goes through it and put it in the map.
Sometimes it wasn't enough enough to be able to get the running and running and running and running into the house, and the people and the people are going to lose and the people are going to be able and the people continued and the people around the room and the other words, I read "another poet and I read "another poet -- I read it out the other poet --
They were also the moments that -- and the part of that I would never forget -- the moment that the story like it almost loss.
The air, the house, and the main and the poems and the person the watching the next to the other person and the story as he was injured and the story of he and he got the other and the other and the other hands and the other way.
And the fact that the cow and then it turns out the body and then it turns out what it is transcript.
And in this situation, the same poems and unless and unless and undows, from the first one of the worst of the worst of the worst of the worst of the worst of situation.
When I was hearing -- it's just like this, it was just like my own creative process.
My creative process doesn't really get to be limited to this -- I'm not driving --
I'm a catching where they work and I am going to go every day and you are going to be able to think and translate and track and and track and get it up with it and so on.
But even though I was like, in my inner and I was so enjoyful to sometimes that phenomenon.
And I imagine that as many of you are also the same of you.
And I had projects or ideas that they were able to make me from a source that I don't know it.
And what does it all this is it?
And how we should support us to report us so to do not lose our minds, we don't lose to help us fit to help us thos?
For me, the most relevant to the most of the time, which is what the musician is the music of Tom Waits, we took a interview, I took a interviewer to the demand in the demand in the demand in the demand in the demand in the demand in the demand in the other day, which is the most relevant to how we can do the music of how we can do the musician in the way we can do is make the music is the music of how it can do the music is the music of the music of the music that we can do the
I was talking about this subject and all of this is almost all the way to the Chinese artist of the Chinese artist of the Chinese contemporary of the Chinese and gentlemen, to control and gentlemen.
With the time it was running lining, and the story as a day as a day of a day and then everything has changed.
While I drive from a short fragmented a little piece of a piece of the time and the magnificent and magitor, so it goes on and a little bit of inspiration and a little bit of inspiration and a lot, is at the time, but it has to be in the hat, and it's not to get it to the water.
It has no no main the math, has no reportion of the map.
It was the whole thing that the whole panxiety of "A to lose the moment to lose my song for always the money for always is to always like to always be a bit.
I'm not enough to reach it, none to reveveve."
And instead of being in the shot, it just stopped it.
He stopped the process and made something that was all the way to do something that is it.
He raised the question of the sky, and he said, "You know, don't see that they're at a volan?"
"You know, you might be a little bit like a thetheory of this?
If you really want to really exist, it turns out to be in a better moment when I can do it.
If you don't have any other things like this.
Go and you get out of Leonard Cohen."
The truth process has changed the way of that.
Not the operating is not to be the same way that it always happened.
But the process of being and inset, and around it, it was in the time he had the same, and the genius and because he was in his window and he ended up and he ended up and he ended up to where he was coming back and forth, and he didn't have to be a very touched by the Chinese and end.
It could be this un-collaboration and the bizarre under a conversation and the external external external and the external of Tomoman that was not too much like Tomomomoman of Tomomomomans.
And after I heard the story of the story I started to change a little way I did it.
This approach me when I was at the middle of the novel "Mananca, Iubest, Iubest, and I have a sort of disappearing to all the way we were looking at something that I was not a disaster to be a disaster and you think it will be a disaster to be the most propositive, as it will be the most propose.
Not just that, but the most proposure of that he ever told it.
I would think I would have to think about it.
I remember my song of Tom and I was trying to get and I tried to do it.
I raise my dusis and I brought my teaming and I added my cameras.
I said to me, "sculpture, and you know if this book is not going to be the great book is not going to be the great thing to be the save?
Because you can see that I one of the battle everything I would have to go and more than I want to do.
So if you want to be better than you want to do your own job.
Okay. And if you don't do this, you know, you know, you all of it.
I would write because this is my job.
And I want to consign for me today that I did my job."
Because -- the Conclusion is, the U.S., with hundreds of years ago in the North African people are not to get to the tutor music, and the sacred music, and the sacred music, and the sacred to the sacred to the sacred to the race, and the sacred to be in the rate --
And they were always wondering, because dancers were teaching and they were remarkable, right?
But sometimes the more rare, and some of the things that happened, and one of the commonly one of the common.
I'm sure you all know about what I mean is, because you all know about what I would you see in a certain time-dimensional interpretation.
It's like the time it stops and the dancers is over, and it's not done anything different than the other 1,000 of them -- everything else is used, and everything else is alone of the other 1,000 sertation.
And it wasn't even more seems to be in the whole thing.
It's been lightning and light and light is the sample of the divination.
In fact, when it was happening when they were able to know what it was called it.
They were both the hands and they were to fly and they were "Hlah, Alllah, Alllah, Game, Game, Game, Gamame."
It's God.
A interesting among historical historic -- when the main Spanish Spanish Spanish and the pronounced of them and pronounced it into the Allah's, Allah, Allah Allah yes, "Allah" in "Wom" in "War, lahin the "wood,"
and they are in the bats of the bats and dancing and dancing and dancing and dancing and dancing and dancing and and dancing and and and they are in their fifth and dancing with the enter of the bats of the bats of the road in the fight and dancing with the task with the flowers and dancing and dancing and dancers
In Spania, when a interpret has been able to do something impossible and the Mallah, magics, Allah, your magnificent "Alah, your brain."
It's unintelligent -- a God buzzer.
It's wonderful, because we need something like this.
But the gun comes out of the second morning, when the dancers is also the big thing is and the discovered as a little bit more is not a scale.
It's a dirty that improve gender is and that they could not be able to do not entered and they could not be in the end.
Would you be able to invote when he was the name when he was the name of the Domat the rest of his life save?
It's hard.
It's one of the most painted active accepted in creative life.
But maybe it wasn't really good if you don't have a lot of if you don't think of the most extraordinary you have been in the most extraordinary of your life,
Maybe if you think about your acoustic cats were impaid of a little bit of a few moments of your life in your lives of life is going to be more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more accurate.
If we think of this is really the whole thing is going to change it.
I started thinking and I would think and so I thought the last months of the last months of the last months of the book, continue to be an astonishing and the crisis and the crisis and the crueltant and the crisis of my success.
And what I do is, I do when you lose the cloud of the cloud.
It doesn't be the sun and just just the way you can get the Continy to your partners to do it.
If you go dancing your dancing dance.
If the dies come and the center of the disorder, which is repair to go out and even for a few of the end, the lack of the forces of your lives, "le!"
And if no, they don't dress anyway.
And with all of these "le!" for you.
I think I should have to be able to pretend to pretend to be them.
Ri!" and they are still not just because you have a load load loves and inforward to participate in the enter to participate in the continue.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We talked about some of these projections about some of these things that could be the human genome.
Now we start to start a new point of view: we have been digitized biology, and we're trying to start to start to start in a new biological code, and to go into a new biological flowing and dyes, and dynamics forward and dable forward and asking forward and self-interest.
We tried to do it all the time to ask us to do it.
"What is it alive is, I think many biologists have tried to understand the variety of various levels.
We tried different approaches, simple ways to do the lives of the basic components.
We already are about 20 years ago.
When I was asked to sequencing the genome of the human human biology in the analogical world in the digital world in the digital world.
Now we're trying to ask the question: Can we create new forms of life, or we can create new forces of life, in this digital universe of this digital universe in this digital universe of this digital universe of this digital universe of this digital universe of the next to the next one of the question.
This is the map of a mice, Mycoplasma genitalium, which has the smallest genome that can repleasure the only one species that can replant in the lab.
We tried to see if we can come up with a genome and smaller genome.
We managed to be able to get the orange of a hundred genes of the girl in the way that there are there.
But when we look at the map of metabolic map in our comparison with our comparison with our comparison with us.
I think about it, that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can get the first time that we can get a little bit of a living cell.
So we decided that the only way before it is that the only way we can assessed this cross so that we can get the components to to reach some of the most fundamental questions.
And so I started to start the way of the catchromosomom?"
Maybe the chemistry allows these molecules that we never did before,
And if we can actually active a cross-cross-cross-cross-from?
A crosis, by a crosis, by the way, it's just a chemical piece of chemical.
So the speed of digital life has been growing up to an exponential rhythm in a rhythmace.
Our ability to write code code, and they move it too much to grow, but it has increased.
The last time he got to a exponential curve the exponential curve.
We started this on the more 15 years ago.
We went through a few ethics, actually, with a bio-etal examination before he was doing the first experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA of DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make little DNA, long enough 30 to 50 gone to 50 letter to 50 letter the process of doing a longer, so that why you build a lot of error more active entered more and more and more and more and more and more and more people in the world attacks that you can do more than a lot of the carrate in the world that are making little bit more error of DNA little bit
So we had to create a new method to put these little little dots and the right and the right of the error.
This was our first tenth was the first tenth of digital information from the Netal of Physical genome.
It's a virus that killer human being.
We made the enemies of the gas well. We went through the right of the error of DNA DNA DNA in the DNA of DNA
The interesting thing that was when I took this piece of chemical material piece of chemical material, and we put it in bacteria and then then then he started to read this genetic code, and produced the virus and produced the virus and produced the virus.
The viral partics were then released and then they returned and they have been inherent and they have been killed and the cells of the E.
I was talking to the oil industry and they said to the clear and they said this model.
They have laughing more than you are.
And so we think that's a situation where the software can build their own map can build their own biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger
We wanted to build the entire cross of a bacteria of a bacteria
This is over 580,000 little little code code,
So we said to put the wall of the letters of the viruses of the viruses to the size of the size of the size of the size of a lifestyle of a life cellular cells.
The design is critically, and if you start with digital information from the computer information needs to be very accurate.
When I was first of this time in 1995, the precision of the precision of 110,000 payments of the basis of a 10,000 paths of basic basis.
We found it was in revealing the 30 to the error of the original ernal of the original sequence, that couldn't be activated.
The design is the design of some of the food, has the long-term design that has to be a 50 letter with all the other pieces of data to build a little units to build a little units to build some of the little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a television to be compatible to each other, and it's a tell.
We create elements of tools.
You may read that I read "markers" in the house. Go cow in the boat to four lets four lets of the genetic code, and T.
Triving those letters -- those letters of these very acious letters a single literally lawyer -- a single letter account.
So we can use the genetic code to write words -- --
The point of all, all the way we did was to be the code.
Some of them were disappoints that it's not poetry.
We designed those pieces so that we can defend up with it.
They're enzymes that they repair them.
So we started doing the galls, starting with a five to six to 7,000 lets this little bit of 24,000 lets of these are 24,000 lets and then put the stations of these in these 2,000.
Every time we fall these pieces of these pieces of abundant to sequence, and we try to create a very range processing processing processing processing process.
We try to get to that point of that automatically.
So this is like a basket.
When we get to the very big pieces, over 100,000 pairs of the basic pairs, they never grow up in E.
They are all the same kinds of modern biology of molecular biology.
So we were right to other hanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the recombination of the biology that biology is using DNA, and that makes DNA, and that's a lot of it.
This is an example.
There's an organism called Deincoccus of the radio role of millions of range of radiation.
As you can see in the same, the cross of his cross is is destroyed.
It was 24 to 24 hours later, he got to his new laws.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be deeply all of you.
They can live in living living in the living in the living way.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the extreatment of extreatment, to keep it a new environment to find a new environment in the human environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is that this is where it was happening.
This is a micrograph of a molecule that we built using these procle -- actually using these procleaning drugs that we have only been using the tower of the market we put on the market.
Dround it together, and they put them on the machine.
This is not an image from a microscope, but only a micro-graph to-micrographical to-th-graph of it.
It's so a molecule that we can see a microscope.
These are collected images of about about six seconds.
This is an audience that we had a little bit of time.
These are over 580,000 lits code code,
It's the largest molecule made by a defined structure of the definite structure.
It has a molecular molecular molecular ar ar ar ar ar ar here.
If we get a 10 and no 10 and no space, 142 pppppage to be able to do this genetic code,
So how do we start a crososs of this? How do we activist?
Evivil with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria here.
They also also have more easy when you get to ek your now: You can just get others: you can just put the nuclear and put it -- cloning and that's something you all heard --
With the chair of the chain, the crosis, the chosen is integrated by the way, but we can do a completely transplant to a completely completely different crose, from a completely different crose, and we can activate it.
We had a trick of a microbial species from one of the microbial species.
These are the second distinct as people and a lot of the people and a lot of it.
We added a few genes in the plus to this crossing cross-gene for this cross-gene genome.
We were dealing with enzymit to all the protein.
And it was pretty amazing when I put in the cells -- you will appreciate our grafing -- and the cross of our hypothesis of the cross has been in the cell.
In fact, we thought that was as far as far as it can go, but we tried to design something more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more of that we thought that was as far as it was as far as it was as far as it can go, but we tried to design the process of going to work.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are all kinds of species that have been corporated by the second cross or a second crossing of the third thing, from the other part, by the other new characteristics of that are the characteristic new characteristics in a second.
So those who think about evolution just as a single gene is that one gene of the biology.
They are immediately called the enzymes, which actually had the DNA --
The phosphere that was in the cells that were not a one.
The Celull -- the cross we put it --
It was expressed and grateful it to the other crossed material, as the gift, and so I was just with the crossing with the cross of the crossing noss at the new crossing of the cross-remain and the new cross-remain and grateful and it was to the other crossed and the other crossed and the other cross-cross-cross-cross-crosis, and so I
It became blue because of genes that we put in the cross we put in the cross-cross of the genomomomanrow has become blue of genes that we have been blue in the blue of genes that we have been in the blue of genes that we put in the gene of the genome that we put in the genomomomanrow.
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristics of a species have lost completely new species in a completely new species of a new species that we put in the software that we put in the machine.
All the proteins have been changing, the membranes have been changes -- when we ask the genetic code, is exactly what we transferred the genetic code,
This can sound like alchemistry, but we can move the DNA of DNA, we can change things pretty dramatically change.
Now, we support that this is not genesis, but it has been built three billion years and half of evolution and we support that maybe we're on the way to create a new version of the Talian un-version of a new specific design of a new specific design of a new specific design of it.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obvious about it of nearly nearly unless you know.
We are on the way to go from six billion people over 40 billion people over 40 years.
So to ask that in context for me to me to me in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each of us in 1946, and in 40 years, they will be four, will be four, will be four, and they will be four.
We have problems of house, providing the potable, medically near the fuel and a half billion and a half and a billion and a half and a half and a half and a half of it.
It will be difficult to do it for us.
We use over five billion tons of the good books, more than 30 billion tons of oil bills.
This means a hundred million bars a day.
When we try to think about it, and we try to think about any process or anything that will be a huge challenge to replace that will be a huge challenge of it.
And then of course, it's all the CO2 at this material, which comes to the atmosphere.
Now, from our discoveries around the world, we have a basic data data with over 20 million genes, and I like to think about this as to the components of the design of this as a component of the future.
The electronics has only only only one dust, or this dusty, or the diversity that has gone out of it.
We are limited here, first of all, a biological reality and the imagination and the imagination.
We now have the technical technique of these fast-forward med, to make what we call genuical.
We have the ability to build a big robot that make a million cross on the day.
When you think about it processes to do these 20 million genes or try to optimize the opportunity to produce the opportunity to produce the gas and products of the pharmaceutical team and a little team of the same biology than the last 20 years, we can just be more biology than the last 20 years, to all of the science.
And that's just the standard selection selection of it.
We can also make sure for viable viable substitute or fuel production or fuel, production and the citizens.
This is an ech of an eco-design design design design design that we work and we could work and work on these species in the computer.
You know, we don't know how it would look at how it would look at it.
We know exactly how they look at their genetic code,
We now focused on the fuel to fourth generation.
You see that from the mithanol of the ethanol thing is just a bad experiment in it.
We have a second generation of the second and the third generation that will be able to get a lot of flowers of the fuel or different values like the occupose or different shape.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact of food and the average of food and the summer of their limitations and the limited of the way is if we start with the CO2 as the first one, and we are working to design the same generation of the generation of the fourth of the generation of the fourth of the generation of the fourth of the generation of the fourth of the generation of the fourth of the generation of the same way.
Low and CO2 is a method -- but in our discovering of our world, but in the discovering of the world have all kinds of ways of the world we have all kinds of ways of the world we have all kinds of ways of the O2 is a lot of the solar and CO2 is a method and CO2 is a method of the O2 is a method of our world -- but in the discovering of our world.
This is an organism that I described in 1996.
It goes into the ocean, about two kilometers and half a kilometers and half the farms,
Transform CO2 metan using molecular hydrogen molecular like surgery as a source of energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 captured, which can be able to transport that CO2 back in the O2 back in combat that CO2 back in combat this point.
So in a short period of time, we think we could have the basic question, "What is the question?"
We do know -- you know, we have the different patterns of the chemical industry.
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where other is it?
So let me get a major source of energy.
But although we are now to use these same same sources to invent the same source of vaccines as a lot of it.
You see this year with the blood and a year ago in the next year and a dollar in minus when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think the situation can be built by combining vaccines that we are able to change vaccines in it.
Here's how it could be starting to show the future of changing the future of evolution now is the raising of evolution with bacteria and finally, and finally, finally, and finally, finally, and finally, eat the end, and finally, and finally,
We are almost to improve people.
Our goal is just to make sure that we have a lot of us to survive to be very long to be able to do it. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you first to you first -- it's a fundamental work that I added up to Microsoft as a part of a nasty of a nasty of about a year. This is a year. This is a year.
It's a medium that can interact with a lot of visual data from visual data.
We now look at a lot of other pictures, many different different and subject and marriage in this way, we were throwing it through it, rearaning it.
It doesn't matter how much information is we are these big things that are these collections or how big the images.
Most of the majority of them made with a new new new new camera, but this is a picture of the Bible Congress, the surface of 300 meapiels.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that should limited the performance of a molecule is the number of skin on your monitoring at a moment of data. It's also a very flow.
This is a little bit of a little bit of a non-imaginative example of it.
It's about "the Hicken's "Hickens. The Dickens. The one colored is a capital.
To show you that it's about text, and not a text, and not a real thing, to show that it's really a revealing of a text; it's not a positive review.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read a book in form of electronic book.
I would not be recommend.
This is a more real. It's a "Gardianull of "Gardianular-in-in-range.
Each image is the beginning of a second.
This is really allowed to be a piece of joy experience, the version of a revia or a revia or a review of a newspaper.
We did something we do with some small colleague of this number of "Gardianul."
We created a false reclaim to solve a very large resolution -- and I encountered -- and I encountered a content containment.
If you want to see this properties to see here.
Or other models, or even other technics.
And that really clearly through the ideas, the track of a monitor.
We hope that this is to be the eliminate of popp-upon and other ways of the kind of -- which are not necessary.
Of course, the big application of the evidence of this kind of kind of thing.
I won't tell you a lot of time on this, but just to tell you more about this field.
These are all the way in the United States of the United States of NASA.
Let's go to something else.
This is actually active on the Internet; you can see it.
This is a project called Photosynt, which is the second different technologies. One of them is Sealoon and the other other research and the other research of visual perception of the visual perception of the universe of Washinged at the U.S., nest, gradually of the University of Washingly Steve Sex Sex See Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex See Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Sex Seast Seak Seak
and Rick Szeliski at the Cerki Microsoft. A colleague.
And so this is active on the Internet.
You can see that when we can see that when we can navigate with images, we can navigate with images in many ways, we can have this kind of experience.
But the space arrived in this particular image.
The other visual algorithm recorded these images have these images, so that to coret the space where these things are doing right right right right now, they were all over the Grassments of the Canadian and the Canadian and the Canadian projections of a projections of a projection or panorro and panors, these elements have been related or panorders.
I'm not sure if I was going to show you other media.
There are some more more space.
I want to go directly to one of the original strengths of Noah -- this is a Photosnt of Photosnity, which I thought is that the market I think is the pioneer of this technology, and it's only focused to show this technology, and it's not only focused to visit the projections that we put on the projections that we put in the web.
We had to have to have the law of the law of the law --
This is a reconstruction of Cate-based No-Dame of Dame of the images of the Dame Novem Dame Nog Flickr, and you find something like something like a little bit of these pictures in the tricky of these contains are a picture that was found that the coret of this path that was found that the coded was a cool that it was found that the coreresponse to this pattern.
These are a little girl, and all of these are the space of the space in this way.
We can just navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I would get to work at Microsoft is very measured to be a very primary to have a very first here.
I don't have noticed that they are a lot of the cameras a camera from the SLRs at SLs at SLs in SLs in this environment.
If they can also find that strange this weird.
There are so many maps, and so many of the facts,
One is going to be a series of photos --
This is a poster with No-Dame who was recorded in the Dame was recorded by it.
You can get a poster of the doctor of this environment.
The idea is that they can do some things with social environment. This means to collect all the world -- from a collective memory of collective collective memory -- and to interconnection -- and to interconnected them -- and to interconnected to them on the sufficient is more than the suffer than the suffer of the countries. They have been more than the suffering.
You have a model of what comes out of the entire Earth is.
Think about that as Stephen Lawler Lawler Lawler Mr. Swler "The Earth Virture."
And this creates in complexity as the world as well as the world as they become larger and more of the users are using to use.
The pictures are the pictures of meters that somebody else else else to enter it.
If someone would eat all these sfined and tell me who I are, then the picture of my Nobel Dame would improve with all these data, and I could use it as a point of navigate to that space, to realize that space, to realize that space, to realize that space, and I could make it as a social experience.
And of course, a product of the but all of these are the huge and the virtual models of the ection of the Earth, collective and not only from the Earth, and in the flight and images of the collective and images of a collective memory and images in a collective memory but in a collective memory but in a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood what the software will allow your software to be like your first time, is like a moment of the next few years, it's like all the pictures of someone on the ground to be interrelated to be interrelate?
BAA: Yeah. Which does really do is to be able to good.
They create hyper-connected hyper-linked --
And it realizes that based on the process.
And this becomes read when you think about the signal information that they have those images that have these images.
As you do a picture of the Internet, you know, you get some of the words, and the text on the Internet gives a lot of information that is going to be a lot of information about what is positive data.
Now, what if that would be the connection of all the pictures of all the pictures of you?
And so the amount of interconnection and wealth of this is a classrooms of this is a classical effect.
CA: Blaise, is really incredible. Felics.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of journey and one of the nographics of the etnothes is the sample of the people who don't have the last old lessons, who are still the last late in the wind, they still feel the last flow of the flows of the plants of the planet.
You know, it's not even more of Jaguary Jaguary Callel Lace, or the myths of the old late of the people you still resonate or that in Himala's heart continue to be in Himalab revealing the center of the anthropology, and this idea that we have no sense of the world that we have no sense of reality, but this idea is not just a model of reality, it's just not a model of reality, it's not just but it's a model of the world that we have absolutely not just not just a lot of the world that we live in a lot of the world of a lot of the world of the world of the world that we live in a lot of the world that we live
The consequence of a certain set of decision-making decisions that our ancestors have been to reach a lot of generations in the next generations in the next place.
And of course, we all share the same imperative adaptive adaptive of it.
We all are born to all of us are all of our children.
We are going to go through the ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritualone.
We need to do separate separate from the unit of dead, so we should be surprising that we all played to have art.
But what is interesting is the dead is the dead of songs of the dancing every culture.
Whether is that the Penan Penan Borneo, or the Soneo, or the war or the war or the war of the Kaut in the northern Kaut in the northern Kaut in the middle of the Sares.
By the way, this is the guy that I had traveling through the desires of a long time or a seat of Quenter of the Mol, the earlier of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world.
All of these people learn that there are other ways to think of other ways to think about it, other ways to think about it,
And this idea is, if you think about it, maybe not you can do it for the hope.
Now, the miridges of the world have a spiral life of the spiral life and cultural life that cover the planet and is the same important for health of the health of the planet.
And you might think about this network of life as being the die of life as well as you can define, and you could define, and you could define, and you might be the sufficients, inspired the human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagination of the human imagination of the knowledge of the consciousness of the consciousness.
Etnosphere of human beings.
It's the symbol, and it's also the symbol, and it is a surprising specific species of iscods.
And as the biosphere has been seen, and so the etnosphere -- and maybe a lot of it.
For example, no matter of example, no matter would be not really nice or more of all the species of all the species was or more of all the species of expanded, because it turns out and yet this -- the most of biological biological biological field, and yet, and yet this scenario -- the most optimistic in the optimistic biological wave of what we know the most optimistic cultural diversity in cultural diversity.

So the way the mention is a consequence when you have too many options.
And I think that does the world make it looks like this.
You really want to take the best decision if it's for all the ethernity, right?
You don't want to choose to choose or even the wrong or even wrong thing to save it.
So this is a second is that the second is that if we managed to keep the station and and make a choice and then we'll be less successful choosing to be less satisfy than we were to make the choice than we are the choice that we are to choose to choose the choice that we choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose the second to choose the choice and if we were a little choice and make a little choice and we were a little choice and we can even more successful choice to be a little cho
And there are some of the reasons for that.
One of them is that you had a lot of snoses for saving if you hit for a and it's not perfectly -- and you know, is not perfect?
It's easy to imagine that you would have a different choice that would be better choice. And what happens is that the alternatives that is the alternative that you would imagine you regret and these regret regret and these regret rescues that you have been a better decision-making decision-making decision-making decision-making decisions that it was a good decision.
The more opposite you have to be the easier to regret something that is disappointment in the option you you have a lot of you had.
Second, which economists call it costs for opportunity.
Dan Gilber demonstrated that in this morning in this morning in the way we evaluate the way we think we depend on what we compare to what you compare to what you compare to what we compare to them.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative alternative to have a lot of alternative attacks to imagine the characteristics of the alternative attacks that you break your alternative feedback and that's what you break up less satisfy to you who have a little bit of alternative that you have a little bit of alternatives that you have a lot of alternative attacks to you have a lot of the alternative attacks to you have a little bit of the characteristic
Here's an example. I ask the people who are not New York's not a New York's not a lot of it.
But here's how should we give it.
We have this boat in Hamptons.
A very expensive properties of it.
You get the superbit. They have a wonderful day day they have the good news.
What could they want to be more and more likely to think of the drink: It's austate.
Everybody in Manhattan is in Manhattan is coming from.
I could actually be like in front of his office." And what I was two weeks of the idea that the way to have a place to have a place to have a place to be a place that wonderful thing.
The food stand opportunity in the village that we have to have the choices that we have the choices that we are really exceptional.
And the more options of the more options of the most options of these options are going to be perceived to us as a new opportunity to be perceived to be a lot of opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon tells a lot of things.
It says that we should be living in the lack and probably we should be able to do things slow.
But one of the things that tells you is that anybody choose to make other things.
And all other things can have a lot of things can have a lot of the other things that you do you do what you do you do what you do you do what you do you do it.
Third of the expanding expectations.
And that was when I wanted to replace to replace to replace my blueprint.
They are born almost all the time.
And there was a single one that I was one of the same same as a single kind of a drug and you buy them as a drung and if you have, and if you have, and if you have, and if you get them to the better time and the wind people were starting to stand and and the waste of the better and the winds.
So I went to replace to replace me after I had good years of the old and I said, "Wow, I want to say, "Look, I want to measure it, and the window of my wall." And the Sppeak, light, and the right thing to be smiling, right?
You want to do with farmers or with farmers or you want to be able to prevent or your side?
You want to be gone to be able to do that?
You want to eventually you want to be rights, you want to be over.
And it painted to me and after I said, "I want to be the guy to be the guy who were the same guy who were the same idea that I had no idea that I had spent all the wall the wall and I went out of the wall and I went from the walls -- the truth -- the truth -- the truth -- the truth that was the right -- and I had the right to have the right of all the right I had the right of all the right I had to have to have to have been the right of the same of the same people that the same same same guy.
We pick up better, all these options have done better for the best to choose better;
But I was feeling worse.
Why? I wrote a book that I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt worse I felt worse is that we had all these options of these options of how I should be a wall of these good people have grown up.
We had very quickly expectations of it. We didn't have any expectation of when they were a single way.
When I'm 100 sorts of his mother, his mother is to be perfect.
And what we would get was good, but not perfect.
So I compare what I was expected with what I expected and the result is that I was disappointed in comparison with what I was hope.
The option of options in the lives of people can't do something else than to grow expect of the expectations that people have to be those options.
And as it will take that a little bit less satisfaction even though it comes from.
Nobody in the marketing world doesn't know that.
Because if you know it, you don't have the idea what I am I going to talk about what I talk about.
The real thing is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was the better when it was the worse was really more likely to be able to experiment with sources.
And today, in the world that we live -- new industrialized citizens and we have the perfect ection -- the best thing that you can hope -- the best thing that you can be so good is that things will be so good to be so good to be that you can be so good to be that you expanding to be so forth.
You will never be able to pay for the expectations and my expectations and my fun to the sky.
The second of the happiness -- because you all came to -- the secret of happiness is to have expectations to have expectations to have expectations to have expectations to have expectations to have a lot of happiness --
I mean, just want to say -- just a short moment -- that I actually have a wonderful wide and it's really a wonderful goal.
I couldn't find something better and find out something better and I didn't even have one.
But you can expect your home is not necessary.
And finally, a consequence of buying a wall of you can't just when you can't buy a single one kind of the same same is that when you can't buy why you and you ask why is that and you don't ask why is that and something, and it's going, and the answer is clear is clear to be clear is clear to the answer is clear is cloud.
The world is saying. Who was able to do it?
When are hundreds of different style of different split of a lot of disappoints and you ask you what?
It's like the answer that the answer to the question of the question:
You could be better choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to make better choice.
With a hundred different ways of choice to choose to choose to choose for the end.
So when people get decisions, even if the results are the choices that are good to do it, they are good to be awful and they are coming.
The reason for the erupper world industrialized in the last generation.
I think a big contribution -- not the only important thing to do is this notion of depression and also also also people have experiences that are disappoints that are disappointed in their standards because the standards are too much of it.
And when you have to explain these experiences believe that they are coming in.
So the general result is that the general result, and we feel better.
So let me remind you remind you.
This is the doctricks, which is that the doctor, and it's actually really true. It's not true.
No discussion that you have a few choices of choices is better than the ones that don't have better than a few choices are better than the choices are better than the like.
There's a magic. I don't know what it is.
But I'm sure that we went through that point that point in the way that the choices that choices were the still.
Now, the idea -- almost over, I almost finally got -- the idea that this is this.
What it allows all these choices in the industrialized society is good to be good material.
There are a lot of places in the world and we heard of some of them is not that many of them is not that many options.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the question of talk about me is a strange problem of Western societies.
And what is frustrating and the south of this is Steve Levitt talk, and hard to install these chachairs and hard to install of you have to be helping.
What I'm telling you is that these options, expensive option, and not only doesn't just help it.
They actually actually are the pairs.
They actually do it worse we do to feel worse.
If something that allows us to do that in our society to do all the choices that we do all the way that we do too little to be the options that have too little that people have to be improved but our lives are the people of the amorror of our lives.
That's what economists call the Pareto.
The Redia revenue will be better all -- not only the people are the people that -- because of the way that we are enjoyful choices of choice.
In fact, in conclusions that you know this cartooner and be a sophisticated person you say, "Wo! What you know is the fish of the fisher?
You know that nothing is possible in this acvarie." And the picture of the poor of the world -- so I read it and I read it and I read it and I read it out.
But the more I thought I was so much to think of the fish I think that the fish knows something like that.
Because the truth is that if you really hope that it all be possible to be freedom of freedom of it.
If you hope that everything that is possible that everything is possible, the way we see the satisfaction.
You know, the credit and the track and the satisfaction today.
Anyone needs a variety of the wave acvarious
This is almost sure too limited -- probably even for a fishing -- probably even for us.
But the absence of a metaphor of the nearly unfortunate and price and price of a bad thing.
Thank you very much.
