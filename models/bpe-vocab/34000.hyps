And the year we showed these two diawayed to demonstrate that the police to show that police that in the most of the last three million years was the size of the size of 48 percent of the size of the march of the march of the march of the march of the two percent of the year.
But this mornity is serious serious because it doesn't show the black hole.
The police is a way of the heart of the climate that is the global system, which is the global system.
It goes on and the extension and the contracting the seven.

This is a huge model of unsustainable.
If you look at the context of history in context of you can see what happens.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of tons of tons of carbon dioxide every single day in the ocean.

Thank you very much.
And the year at TED I did a LHC.
And I promised to give you a data about how they work is a data about how it works this.
So here is the one of the ones that have not here is here, LHC is not the greatest scientific experiments -- the biggest scientific experiment -- the Street and is the Street and is to recreate the conference of a billion times less than a billion times of a fraction of a billion times a second, from a second to a second to a second -- the panel of a second.
It's extremely of both sides.
This is the device under the Geneva.
We do photographers of these minds "Big Bang" inside the decades.
I work at this. It's called the ATATLATATLungylal -- Lunnable photography of 22 meters of ATLS photographer, the picture of ATLS here is going to see that it's going to see that it's going to see it is going to see the proport.
On the 10 seven, I went on the first year I went on the first time.
And this image was a ATLATLAS.
It caused a huge celebrity in the room.
It's a picture of the first particle particles that has looked at the LHC, which has been able to put in the LHC, crossing in the LHC deliberate particles, and particle is a number of people in the desdessertor.
In other words, when I saw that I saw that 10 seals on 10 seven, I knew that the device has a huge success.
I don't know if this was the greatest own, or that, when someone went on on the Google and she saw it as the first page.
And I mean that we did a cultural impact on the slavery of the impact of the scientific impact
And then after a week I had a problem with the apart of the device, which actually had to do with these days.
Those are a transportation of a flowing of teams when the device functioning at the maximum of the power of the power.
Now, engineers in the arrow of the arts and say, "I'm not a transport." They're not transport." They're a lot.
But I can do this because when I'm at the same time, they are getting what is called the superconductor.
So as a 271 degree of housing -- the hospital between the state, those of state, that one of the box.
At one of the laws of the laws of the LHC, was a Fund of the factorial factories.
So the company was enzym was a little bit of the lampers have innate the resoluted resilientation.
This was the result.
This is more impressive, that the amount of magnets of magnets are being taken over 20 tons of tons and they moved about 30 cents of the tasks of it.
So I have about 50 magnetic magnetic magnetic
We had to take the outside, which we would do it.
I reconconcepted it all the way to repair it.
And we now take magnetic magnetic in subteran.
And at the end of the march of the LHC will be like new LHC will be like new again.
We're going to start again, and we would get this data in a hour data in ione's ione or ione of the universe that are the research tools of the universe.
Now, of course, that indog-open-discussion of the important scientists and engineering about the important scientists and engineering to break it down to break the down.
I think that the fact that it is so difficult to be so difficult to have the fact that we have young inals, this is the important thing to do like LHC.
And I'm going to leave that in the words of a scientist of British Davy, Humphrey Davy, which I think is, when the applications of protected protected the modern modern minds, and this is not the more dangerous progress for human minds to our minds are uncomfortable to prepared the human beings are finding our scientific weapons are finding that are not finding our natural philosophers are finished by our natural gas are not finished, and as we have no more natural gas well.
Thank you.
I want to start with the rate of the child, when you take a child, when you play with the boat.
And as you invent them to get them to get them and get them to go out and get them to the boat, and you actually invent them to give you a lot of people who are really knowing and the spatial manipulating and the spatial of the spatial spaces.
The vision of the spatial is a lot of the world of how we understand a lot of the world in the inconclusion.
So, in the quality of the quality of IT inspired by this utility of our physical interactions with our physical objects -- impresent to my own Patic, and my colleague, and my colleague -- I started using a computer, and I started using a computer, in this unfortunate -- I would use a computer, in this ununlike a plane that we could be so much more to a global warming of a demanding that we could be both of us to take a little bit of a little bit of a deeply to a little bit of the unlike we could be so much informed with a computer to a computer to a computer to a comprevent to a commissing with a comprehamate-remote with a whole bat a whole bunch of the mounununununununununununununununpresentied with a matter of
Would we like to not?
And the question of this fascinating was so much as we hopefully went to research on Swe'd put the answer Swe'd put Swetening Swetening Stttable to this Swe'd been attached to this by the way, and I was so much about this was so much of the fascinating was so much of the fascinating was so much of the fascinating we would hopefully be so much of the time we went to the answer to to the Swe'd just to the Swe'd just to the answer Swe'd just to build Sifting Siftify the Swealth a Swealth of the Swealth of the Swealth of the answer it.
And as a short, Siftable is a computer interactive of a biscal bism.
They can be manufacturer -- they can perceive it, they can perceive the challenge of one other versus one of the other one of the radio and a wireless of a wireless of a wireless of the reference.
The most important is that it's palpable. And so they're palpits, like a missing, you can just just just just apply them to them.
And Sifwitwitwitnesses a new ecosystem of digital manipulation of digital manipulation of digital manipulation of digital manipulation of digital requirement of digital report.
And the magic of the tools are becoming more palpable and more and more of the mission of other, the consistent of the other nutrients of our nutrients and destroyed new and destroying new tools.
I'm going to start with simple examples.
This Siftable is configuring out of video, and if you included it by a direction, and if you include it is a bunch of other part, if you include it is a bunch of time, it makes it a long time.
These portraits are the interactive of each other is a different one.
So, if I put one langer, it becomes interesting.
If there are inconconcepted and this is going to be a little confusion.
And I can feel the mission and inclining.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of interactions of interaction is that we can use the gestablished with the data, as we would be able to use the task for how we have a color a liquid of a liquid and a liquid of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interac
In this case, we have three Sifwscscared like the task as the paint of the color of the color of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of this --
If we can get a little bit of a little bit of the end,
There are also interesting possibility for education, like being able to educate visually and logical logical logic and logical logical sense of what we want to do is to be able to see the outcome of the outcome.
So here I -- this is a Fibonacts that I do with a simple program that I do with a simple equation.
This is a game of forming formation of the words, a kind of combination of Scrabble and Boggles.
And so that every single first one of the first one of the first Swe'd be a little bit of a Siftable, and the magic of the words, are great, and they are grew up with a dictionary dictionaries with a dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds of a second where the letter of letters, and you have a new set of letting us be incertified by the letting us be inccled.
Thank you.
These are the children who came to the excursion of the Media Lab, and I went to confused to confused to confused to a material.
They like to crazy.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of applied people is that you don't have to give them many people a lot of instruction.
Everything you have to say is "Fear word "Fear --
This is other people who are looking for them.
This is the most tangible testing of our right down to the right.
It turns out that everything she wanted to do was to do was a Siftttable to do one over the other.
So for him was just a cups.
This is a animated application of animal.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who invent language.
And this is Felix.
He can introduce new personalities in the scene, just raise of those Siftapes of the Siftapes of personalities.
This is introducing sound.
Video: The race.
David Merrill: Now he introduced a stage in the scene.
Video: The portrayer of the portrayer.
Very yo!
Mismatic when Siftttable and ask, he can make them a sweat the time to interact -- Video: Ham!
During and your own narrative.
Video: Okay?
DH: It's a story with open, and he decided, and he will make the moon.
Video: Zboard, peak the peak.
During example of that we have time to show you today is a device of designed and interpreted music and interpreted and interpreted music that we built the role of soil and the sounds of soil and all the role of soil and all the soil of the sound that we would have time to show you the time and all the time.
Each of these different variations of various variations that you want to use it.
And you can inject the sound of a successful of a successful of you want.
The range sound touches the sounds of sounds of a Switch Swittable of success.
There is effects that you can control the lives, like the reverberal and the film.
You can put it in a certain sound of sound and then including it to help it to give it to the off.
And the next general effects like the football like the volume that are applied to see the intrees of the same.
Video: I will start with a rhythm in two Siftapes in the Sweututting, we arrived in a serious serious and we have rhythm rhythm.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: Now I add a little bit of a flawyer.
Video: So I'm going to add the film to the top, to all the way to control the side effect.
Video: I can see the insects of inclining inclining the inclining of a part of a part of a part of a or another.
Video: I'm going to put this on the baggas for many more extension of extension
Video: I can reach the moment I can do the sea as a few of them.
So I don't have to do the plan, I can improvise, previous or a short or a short top.
Now, I can get to the insects of the sea of Swewe'd put this in the sea of volume of volume in the switch of the switch in the stangle of the sea of the sweating,
Thank you.
And as you can see my passion is the creation of new interfaces that are really better to how much better with our brain.
And today, we had time to show you a coordination of this new spatial of design, and the signal of the possibilities that we were trying to get out of the lab.
The Ganda that I want to retiny is like we're at this new general of interruption with this digital general interruption with the digital interaction with our digital rules that will bring information to our rules.
Thank you very much.
These eps with nervous nervous to talk to you all of you
I'm a writer.
He wrote the book is my profession, but it's more than it is.
It's all my love love and fascinating a life.
And I'm not that this is to change change the way to change it.
But that's what the wrong thing was really quite a little bit of a life and in my career and in my career who determined me to reach me to the work of work.
And the strange thing is that I wrote this recurge, this self-biography called "Mananca, Iubest, which is the Roaging is a dealing of the magic of any other other side of my book, and it became this international sensational sense, and it became this international sensational sensitive to the world for a very important international sensition.
The result is that anywhere where in the people go right now, people treat me as I was confused to be condeming.
Serioios -- connusion, I was a connata!
So for example, the ingrights, and you say, "Not your mind is the theory -- not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the performance performance performance the performance of performance and you are immediately to be saying, "Not to be "Not to be ""Not to be a bone?"
You don't know that you're going to continue to write a more creative of life that time a a book that will ever be a book that will ever be able to do this?"
It's very linistic, true.
But it was even more likely to remember if I don't have all 20 years ago, when I started to marriage -- I was trying to get the people -- I want to become writer, and I was a writer, I was a writer, I was a kind of a kind of African reaction on a kind of African reaction of a kind of red.
And people said, "You don't have a lot of you don't have any more success?"
Do you don't be a reject your break your break your remotion?
You don't know that the fear that your life in this field in this field and nothing will be going to be here and not going to be a dream of a dream of a dream of a dream of a dream of the gas of the gas of the gas a thum?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the short answer to all those questions is """"""""""""""""""""""""""""Yes" --
Yes, it is the theme of all of these things.
And I always hated it.
And you get a teams of the things that are unlikely to be intuitive.
As an example of the big algorithms that are crossing and other things that are crossing
But when it's about the thing I thought about the thing I thought about the last time I was still wonder is "Where is "Where is "Where are "What?"
Is it something rational?
It's the logic to be so that they would be the work that I feel like they were destroying the work that I feel like Pamantantly made to do this Pame.
And what is so many of the creative specific fic fic fic fic fic fic fic fic fic fic fic initiative health in a kind of health care, in a way that other teachers don't do it?
My father was a chemical engineer and I don't remember as a chemical engineer that in the 40 years of them of engineering and the chemical engineering and it's not a chemister.
It wasn't happened -- John, how does the block it in the engineering in the engineering in the engineering of the chemical?
It just doesn't happen,
But to be honest, engineering chemists, as a group of chemicals that have not a lot of reputation to be alcoholes of maniacal maniactical maniactical maniactical maniactical maniactical hyper-synthesizes of chemicals as a group of chemisters like the group of chemicals like the group of chemicals like the group not so much of the cousing of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the cities of being a lot of the c
We are written -- we have this reputation, and not only written -- but the artist of all the sample of all the sample of all the sample of being powerful mentally to be strong mentals.
And all we have to look at this is to look at the numbers of death in the 20th century, in the 20th century, which are removed by the maybe, who died by young people and often died by the way, and often often often have been died by the way.
And even those of them who didn't have been honest on their own destruction of your own own own own features.
Norman Mailer, even before the last time in the last interview, he said, "EEach of my cardboard has a little bit more than my cart."
A great great teaming of your work of a life.
But we don't clear when we hear somebody when we hear somebody telling us that because we heard this because we heard this things like so many times and somehow we absorbed and somehow the creative and suffering, the idea of the creativity, and the sum of the unununbelievable and as it will always go to a sense of suffering.
And the question I want to advertising this today all of this is you all of the impact with this idea?
You can comfortable with it -- because as as as it can see the eye of the list -- I don't care about this ipocket.
I think it's okay.
And I also think it's dangerous and I didn't want to see it in the century.
I think it's better if we encourage the great artist to go to the artist to go out to the marriage
And I know that I think of my own -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to me to start to go back to the caring of this hypothesis about the one of the hypothesis now professional.
For example, I'm pretty tanker, I just just about 40 years of a year.
We probably have a four-tech decades.
And it's very likely that I describe the inceptor of this moment to be judged by the way, as a result of my success of my success of my career, right?
What would be to say to the men, because of all of the people here are already here -- it's very likely to be the biggest successful of my biggest successful to be happened to be happened.
Oh, God, what gand!
This is the kind of gas that could be able to put it on the nest one in the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I mean, I'm going to do this message that message I love it.
And then the question is, which, yo?
And so I think it's a lot of meditative of meditation, that I have to work right now, to try to create a kind of a biological building a kind of a biological building protection, right?
I should say, a way to find a way to find a distant distant distant a distant distant that the nature of the one that was going to be the natural law that will be able to what I write.
And as I still go in the last year in this sense, we started to look at the time, and I tried to find other society and I tried to find other societies to be better and healthy and healthy and healthy and healthy and healthy of how people are creative to help people be help to be a very emotional risk of emotional risk for the risk of the risk of the lives.
This is the research went out of Greece and Roma and Roma and Roma
So you get the certainly inchide.
But as the Grection of anticas Rome, and the ancient Rome, they don't think that the creativity of the human being being being being in human income from human inside of human?
People thought that creativity was a spirit was a spirit that the help of people from a source of people from a source of people from a source and unintelligent and unintelligent and unact.
The rules were called these spirits creativity, and the famous creativity;
Socratic was because he thought that he had a demon which has a department that has a smart intellectual in department.
The Romans were the same pare, but they called the imaterial spiral, the imaterial spiral.
What is great, because the romantic because they don't believe that a genius was a very special individual immediately of destiny.
They think a genius was a kind of a genius of magical entity that the creative effectively between artists, like Dobby, as Dobby, the sweatch of the archairs and the argue of the work of the work of work and the result of the work of work work and the result of the work of the work of the work of the work of the workers that are the workers of the work of the workers of the work of the workers of the work of the workers of the work of
Absolstralucated -- this is the distant that is the distant that I talked about -- that the biological building that we would protect the result of your work of the works.
And all the world is that that that has functioned, right?
So the artist was protected by some of the things like too much narcis, like too much narcisism, right?
If your work was stralucita, you couldn't keep the whole thing for the world to her, all the way that you have this kind of fly as the body that held the body that helped us.
If your work was critical to be completely completely completely the selece, it was completely completely usu?
Everybody is the strength as as a little as it was a bit ignorant.
So they looked at the West creativity, the length of time.
Then he came to Renasting and everything has changed, with a certain idea of the main of the universe of the universe as a great person to put in the center of the universe on all the mystery of the universe that receives from all the mysteries that received from the deep to the diving.
It was the skie, and the people started to create the creative of creative as the creative of the individual of the individual of the individual of the individual world.
And for the first time in history in history, people started to refer to one or other artists, instead of genius as a genius.
And I have to married, I think that was a huge error.
You can see the customer, a simple person, and it's actually the receptor is actually the receptor is actually the receptor and the synthesis and the synthesis of the mysterious biological and the black of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile
It's like you have a few weeks you will put the wire of the wives.
And it just incottttonight and it is a teams of the invisible to realize performance performance.
I think that pressure that the artist killed artists, one after the last 500 years.
And if it's true, and I think that is the question of the question is that we do it?
Can we make things different?
We can go back to the older relationships of the greater relationships between people and the mystery of the creative relationships of people and the myself.
It may not.
Maybe we can't just run 500 years of thinking about 500 years of human andisorders through a 9-minute talk.
And it probably as a public that would raise the meaning of the question of the question of the theme that the theory of the fields that are actually embracing people and all the way that the projects and all the same way.
I probably don't think I'll be cooked to the oppose.
But the question I want to ask is -- why don't I want to do it is -- why not?
Why don't we think about that?
Because it has a sense of as much as I heard about how much we heard about how much of the private inicititarian innate of creative process.
And the reason why anyone who was trying to create something -- basically all of the people here -- you know, all of the range of the range of retirement.
And in fact, sometimes it can seem to be the paranormal.
I had a demand I had a great American American American American Rutch Stone, who I met the Stone, who has now in the judge of 90 years and that was the poeting was the poety of Virginia was going to work on on the room, and I just hearing a tage and just hearing a pop and just hearing a popping and just hearing a pop of a tage and just hearing a poems of the room, and I just heard of a poet of a poetol.
The story as a vast vast of the sea of air.
And it turns out that it over the room.
The idea of income and as you are gallallels in the legal under the bottom of the leg.
And that moment has one thing that has a single thing -- which is a single thing -- to alerate that applied as a applataa."
And it goes to the housing home to the whole house, and the whole idea was to get a piece of map and a piece of map and a creative and a creative and then he went through her height and put it in a map.
Sometimes it was not enough enough to get it and runs and running and running and running and running out of the houses and the poems and she would lose the poems and the poems of the robs of the room, I read the room, I read on her "another poet."
They were also the moments that -- and this is not going to look at the story -- moments that this story as almost a los.
The other running home of the map of the map of the map and the pass and the next time it was that the credit was revealing the other man and the story of the other man, and the story of the other man, and the clear.
The main the cow and the task and then he pulls the sea on the map of the map.
So in the situation, the applied of the perfect and intact and intact and unlike the last year from the last time at the first words.
When I heard it -- it's just the spranaturally, it was just how my own creative process
My creative process doesn't match it doesn't limit to this -- I'm not leaving it.
I'm a catching where I work I work to get a lot of people go to the same time and get to the same way to get it and get out of the wrong and get out of the wrong with the wrong with the wrong with the wrong with the wrong with the wrong with the way.
But even though I was like, my housing even though I was attached to sometimes that phenomenon.
And I imagine that they were like the same of the same of you.
And I had the projects or ideas that they came from a source of a source that I don't know about it.
And what is the whole thing about that?
And how do we should report us to report that we don't have to report our minds, so that we don't lose to help us reach our health to help us reach the health of the health of the health of the health of the health of the health of the health of the report we should report us to report our to report us to report us to report it to report that we don't have to report that we don't lose to report our to report our minds to make sure that we don't lose to make our minds like to help us to help us to make us to report our minded us
For me, the most relevant example of how we can do about how we can do about how it can do is do the music of Tom Waits, we took a piano with a few years after a quarter of the revia with a revia with a revia with a revia with a in the day of the other day of us is what we call it is about how we can do it is what we do is about how it can do is do is do is doing a very much of how it can do is do it is do is do is doing a bone-tool to be a bunch of the music
I was talking about this subject and all of this is almost all the way of the contemporary artist has been to control the Chinese artist artist and gestures, to control these creative impulses, and gentlemen.
With the time she was running out of the story as a day as a fire day that one day has a whole day to Los Angeles and then everything has changed.
As a matter of time a little bit of a short fragmented piece of a piece that comes in mind, as the magical and the magnificent and the magnificent and a little bit of injury, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot, it's not about it, but it has to hit is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a short to.
It doesn't have no creative house, no reporter report.
And the fact that the old old old old anxiety of raised in "I'll lose the moments, and the can, and the canopy of the ban.
I'm not enough to require a revenue.
And instead of a shock between the panich, just stop.
He stopped the whole process of traveling and everything with it.
He raised the question and said, ""Hey, you don't see that I'm at volan?"
"Would you be written a cannect of a chann?
If you really want to be able to exist, at a more app time when I can do it for you.
If you don't take it and you get to another today.
Go and you get it from Leonard Cohen."
The truth process has changed the creative process has changed this.
It is not the operating operating as as as much as it happens.
But the process process of synthesis in the whole around us, he was the time around him, he took the same, and he took the same, and it was only because it was in the way to go back and then it was going to be a way to get into the way of looking at the inside of the order.
It could be this unique collaboration and the bizarre under the form of a conversation under the form of the exterior exterior of the exteriority that was not too too was like Tomomomoman of Tomomomano --
And then I heard the story of the story I started to change a little bit of the way I did a little bit of a time.
This approach me rescue when I was at the middle of "Mananca, I’m in a kind of a kind of damn and I found out of the disappeared to be a kind of disaster and I was going to be a dealing of a disaster, and I think it's going to be a deception of the most proposing that you ever have ever been written by the most proposing this is going to be the most proposing of the way to be a require of the word "It will be a required by the most of the way to be a way to be a
Not just that, but the most proposing that he ever written it.
I was going to think of that I should just abandoned the project.
And then I remember Tom I was talking about the opening hospital, and I tried and I asked him.
I raised the manuscript and I added my commentals, and I added a colleagues of the roof.
I said, "sculpture: "sculp," and I know that if this book is not going to be great book is not going to be a great book is not just the job, right?
Because you can see that one of the bunch of everything I would have to go and more than I would have to be able to go down.
So if you want to be better than that, you have to do your device and make your apartment.
Okay. And if you don't do that, you know, you know, you know, the naid to.
I will tell you because this is my message because this is my message.
And I want to consign for this third of my third part of my third six."
Because the Conclusion is -- a hundred years ago, hundreds of years ago, in the North African people have to get to the task for the task for the split of the raised music, and the sacred music, and the sacred to the blind of the raised --
And they were always a wonderful thing because the dancers were the teachers were remarkable and were remarkable to be remarkable to do it?
But sometimes very few of them happens, and one of the fact that the idea of the community of the community.
I'm convinced you all of you know what I mean to do you see what I think you can see in a certain timeline.
It's like time time it stops and the dance is by a kind of porting a kind of ports, often don't do anything differentiated than the other 1,000 sers, all of the other 1,000 sers, all of the other 1,000 sers, all of the other 1,000 series of them are all alazzed and the dance.
And it doesn't seem to be in the whole thing that it would be in the same way.
It's light-light light and light light is the bottom of the footprint.
And as though it happens, when it happens, and they told what they were called the number.
and they were both tails and they were going to get the "Allah, Allah, Allah, Alllah, Ylah, Yamlah, Yamlah, Yamlah, Your God, yeah, lah, lah, yer and they were reunununununununununununununununununununununusprececed.
It's God.
A interesting among historical historical historical -- when the maps of the Spaniei, they took this out of the Spania has turned to the sequences of the "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, yer in "Allah," "Hole, Alle," "ole, the mothers have been a story -- old, and the maps have been been ased by the Spanie."
and they hear the fights of the rooms and dancing and dancing the flatches and dancing the flats.
In Spanish when a concept when a magic and magic of a mimpossible and the magic of "Allah, magical, the allah, magic."
And the unintelligent -- a God farm of God bubble.
It's great, because we need something like this.
But the gun comes from the next day morning, when the dancing is that the insuspect is also the discovery is that it's a scale.
It's a dirty that comes from the same, which is the genues and it could not be able to do not even more initial and they could not stop in the same way.
Would it be no one to invoice the name of Domn's name when he was supposed to do it with the rest of his life.
It's hard.
It's one of the most painting of the most painting of creative.
But it may not be a very big if you don't think about if you don't think of the beginning of the most extraordinary part, as you can be the most extraordinary party of your mind are from the inside of the inside of the inside of the world.
You can just think of if you think about a tree of a catch of a source of a few times of your lives of life in the lives of the next to be more of the lives of the next to the next to the next to the moment.
If we think about this is a lot of it is going to change it.
I started thinking of this and I was sure that last months of the last months of the last months of the book that will be published by the book that will be publishing and my string crisis, dangerous and the crisis of my strange and the crisis of my stranging and the crossing of the string of the bunch of the same thing as I was going to think about the last
And what I did is repetuated when you lose the cloud of the goal is not a theist,
It will not be a spread and just the whole thing to do is what you do you do do something.
If you get dance dance your dance then dance.
If the gene comes and central explanation that you can make it a choice to go to the big one, and for a mom, and for a mom, and for a momentum of your efforts -- then "le!"
And if you don't dance anyway.
And all of this "Fole!" for you.
I think I think I should pretend to pretend them.
"You know, for you, all of you just because you have a loak for human beings, and incaping the end, and incapable of participation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We talked about some of these projects, about the human genome, and what could be the other human genome.
Now we start with a new point: we digitize biology, we have digital biology, and now we're trying to get to start to start to get into a new flowing biology, and to get into a new phone, and synthesizing forth and synthesizing forth of life.
We tried all the time to ask questions about the important questions.
"What is life?" It's something that many biologists tried to understand to understand to the different biologists tried to understand the different levels.
We have tried different approaches, simple approximately to the based on the basic components.
We already have about 20 years of them almost 20 years.
When we sequenced sequence of human genome, this is that we went from the analogical world, in the digital world,
Now we're trying to ask question: Can we regenerate the mind, or we can create new forces of life, in this digital world, in this digital universe of this digital universe of this digital universe of digital world.
This is the map of a little organism Mycoplasma genitalium, which has the smallest genitalium, which has the smallest species that can replant to the only one species in the lab.
We tried to see if we tried to come up with a little genome and smaller genome.
We were able to receive the order, a hundred genes of a hundred genes of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of metabolic metabolic from our comparisons to our compared to our compared to our to our very simple to our compared to our to our map the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the metabolic map.
And I think that's simple.
But when we look at all of the genes we can only only only only one of the time is that this is a little bit of a life.
So we decided that the only way before it is that we actually assess this crosis, we can stand to stand so that we can get the summer of the most fundamental questions.
And so I started on the road, "Can we stand the synomosom?"
Maybe the chemistry allowing these molecules that we never did more than we ever did before?
And if we can activig a crosomologist crosomology?
A crososome, the approach is just a piece of chemical material.
So, the speed of digital life raising at a rhythm to a exponential rhythm.
Our genetic code, to write the genetic code, but it has a pretty slowly slowly so.
The last time he came to a exponential curve.
I started this on a 15 years ago.
We went through a few ethels, actually, with a biomic examination before he do the first experiments before he do the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesizing of DNA is very difficult to do.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make little little DNA, long enough to 30 to 50 gallons of DNA, but it's a very degenerative process so that you build a longer, so much more than a piece of a long piece of the people who are more than a lot.
So we had to create a new method to put these little joint and the right thing and the right thing to do is all the right of the errors.
This was our first tentative of the digital information that I was going to be a digital genome, to be a 174.
It's a virus that kills the bacteria.
We did the gorgeous design of the blind of the errors, and I got a molecule of DNA by only about 5,000 letting a two-letter DNA
The interesting thing that I took this piece of chemical material, and I put it in the bacterial material and I put it in bacteria, and I put it in the bacterial code, and to make this genetic code of the virus and to make the virus.
The viral Particulular parties of the cells and they came back and they were killed by the E.
I was talking to the oil industry of the hot of the cell, and they would understand this model.
They have laughed more than you are.
And so we think that's a situation where the software can build their own maps can build their own biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the entire crosis of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 gallons of genetic code.
So we said, we would say to the letter of letting the size of the virus to the size of the virus to the size of the size of a lifetime of a lifetimes.
The design is critical to the digital information from the digital information from the computer information has to be very very important to be very important to be very important to be very accurve.
When we sequence this first time in 1995, in 1995, the precision of precision was a error of a error of a decade of baskets.
We found it, in the removing, 30 errors, 30 errors. If we were used to be used to be a seven-active.
The design is the design is the projection of the next 50 gallons of letters, which has to be a hundred other joined with all 50 gallons of gas to build a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a television of a television of a television.
We create tools tools.
You may read that we asked that we said, "We put the marker in the houses of it: We have a genetic code, we have a genetic code, and T.
Triples of those letting the coffee of about 20 recently recently recently -- one of the literally embedded every member of a single text of acia.
So we can use the genetic code for writing words, the sentence, the circle.
And the ideal I did was I was to hire the code.
Some of them was disapplied that it's not poetry.
We designed those pieces so that we can define was with enzymic.
They're enzymous and they are them.
So we started doing the gaps, starting with a five to join this five to 7,000 gallons of gas to do these 24,000 gallons of gaps, and then put it together to get to 7,000-gone in to 72.0.
Every time we have a lot of these joined pieces of abundant to the sequence to the sequence of the way we try to make a very same, and as you can see a very red process -- as you can see in a minute.
We are trying to get to that point point of automatizing.
So, this is that a basket.
When we get to the very large pieces of the bodies of 100,000 walls of the bottom of the E.
It is all all the modern molecular biology of modern molecular biology.
So we went to other hand.
We knew that there is a mechanism called the recombination of the biology that biology that biology is using DNA, and that is useful to reach DNA, and that is a piece of DNA, and that is a piece of a lot.
This is an example.
There's a organism called Deinococcucucutting radio that can be the weight of radiation.
As you see in the same, the crosomes of his husband is destroyed.
12 hours to 24 hours later, he put it again. He put it again.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be all of the organisms can be all of them.
I can live in life.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the exhibition in space space to go through a new environment to find a new environmental environmental.
In fact, NASA showed that this is going to happen there.
This is a micrograph of a molecule that we built by using these proclever proposes -- actually using only the design of the design of the design of the skills that we put the pieces that we put together and put it on the boat.
Drojjjjjjjells together
This is not a picture from a microscope, but just a microscope, just a to-micrographic to-graphic photographer.
It's so a big molecule that we can see it with a microscope.
These are college images of about a period of about six seconds.
This is a published published now a little bit of time.
These are over 580,000 gallons of genetic code.
It's the largest molecule did sometimes by a definition.
It's a male of molecular ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar
If we take it with a 10 and without a 10 and no space of a 12-pages to get the genetic code, this genetic code,
So, how do we start a crosososomology?
And the obviously, with a virus is quite easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
And I also have more easier when you get to eucracy, as you can just take the nuclear nucleus and put it together, and put it together, and that is something that you all heard -- cloning.
With the archa, the cross is integrated in the cells, but we showed it to the cells, but we showed that we can make a completely transplant to a completely completely completely completely a single crosomes to the cells, and we can activate it.
We had a crowd of a microbial specific species.
These are the second distance are as people and a little bit of a light-to-to-to-to-
We added a few genes in plus to be able to select this crosis.
We demand I demand to killing all proteins.
And it was quite amazing when we put in the cells, you will appreciate our very sophisticated grafting -- and the cross has ended in the cell.
In fact, we thought this is how far it can go away, but we tried to design something more than we tried to design something more than ever.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We find all kinds of species that have been emerged by a second crosis, or a third of the other one of the third of the other parties, and a new amount of new characteristics of new characteristic new characteristics in a second.
So those of us who think about evolution just as one gene to change a moment of biology.
They're called the enzymal, called the DNA restriction, which actually had the DNA
Cromosome, which was in the cell.
The crosososomes we put our --
It was expressed and recognized the other cross of the other crosis as the straight, and so I got to the new cross of the crossing of the new cross of the new cross of the cross of the crossing and the other crossing the other crossing crossing the other crosis and grateful of the other crosis as the crosis as the crosome as well.
It became blue of genes of genuine that we put in the crosis.
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristic of a species have lost and a completely new species of a completely new species of a new new basic species, and it was put in the cells.
All the proteins have been changed, membranes have been changed, is exactly what we do is the genetic code, is exactly what we have transferred the code,
This can sound like alchemistry alt, but we can move the software of DNA, we can change the software of DNA, to change things quite dramatic.
Now, we suspect that this is not genesis, but a half billion years and a half years and half years and half years of evolution to create a new version of creating a new version of the Cambodian of a new specific of mastery and a new specific design of a new specific of digital math.
Why do we do that?
I think it's quite obviously obviously of a needle of needs.
We are on the way to go from six and a half of us and half to a billion people over 40 years.
And I just ask this in context for me to the same. I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for every of us there that existed in 1946, in 40 years will be four.
We have a feed issue of sea water supply, provided pottable and a half billion and a half of the six billion and a half of the six billion and a half and a half of the sun and a half of the south, and a half of the south, we have a potonight, and it's a half of the bed, and a half of a table of a potton.
It will be difficult to do it for us.
We use over five billion tons of books more than 30 billion tons of oils oil bumps of oil
This is a hundred million barriers a day.
When we try to think about propose and biological proposes or at any process that will be a huge challenge of this, will be a huge challenge.
And then of course, it's all that CO2 from this material, which is reach in the atmosphere.
Now, our discoveries of our world, we have a data databases of 20 million genes, and I like to think about these components of the future of designs as the design of the design of the future.
The electronics of the electronics has just a doubt, or something like this, or the diversity that has come out of this.
We are limited here, first of all, a biological reality and imagination.
We have the techniques of these quickly straight method, we do what we call what we call what we call the genuicycles.
We have the ability to build a big robot that make a million chromosomes a day.
When you think about it to process these 20 million genes of different genes of gene to try to make the opportunity to make the occupy prock proposal products and new vaccines of new vaccines of the science, just to make more biology than the last 20 years of all the science.
And that's just a standard.
We can be able to viable for viable substances or chemical substances or fuel, production of vaccines, which is the citizens.
This is a piece of design design a software that we work that we work to be able to wait to be able to wait to these species in computers.
You know, we don't know how it will show it out.
We know exactly how they look at their genetic code,
We now focusing on fuels to fourth generation.
You see the embrya is a chamber experiment.
We have a second fuel of the generation of the third and the third of the third and the third of the fuel of fuels and fuels of fuels as a different valuable of the other other topic or different shapes of the butterraid.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without any more than their food has more than their food and fear of food and the fly of the requires if we start with CO2 as a match of the cells to design the first one of the fourth in about 18 months.
The solar and CO2 is a way -- -- but in our discovering discoveries of our world, we have all sorts of other ways of our world, we have all sorts of other ways of other ways of the world have all sorts of other ways of the way of the solar and CO2 is a CO2 is a role -- but in the O2 is a way -- but in the discoveries -- in the O2 is a way -- but in the discoveries.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It goes into the deep ocean, about two kilometers and half a million deep, and half of the deep, at the temperature.
The CO2 metan use of metan used biologist as a molecular survey as a source of energy.
We are trying to see if we can take CO2 captured, which can be transported in the country, which can be transported in the country, and converted to this way of leaving the fuel, to lead this thing.
So in a short period of time, we think we could have what is the basic question of "What is the basic question "What is life?"
We know -- we have a little bit of a shapes of replacing oil industry.
Yeah. If you don't do this at TED, where another part, where another part, where another part,
It becomes a major source of energy.
But we also work now to use these same sources to invest these same sources to the vaccines of vaccines immediately immediately vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of the same way we can use these same sources as well.
You saw this year with a net, we're always with a dollar in the minus when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think the situation can be changing by building vaccines that we have any of the time before we have any of the time before.
And this is how it could start to show the future change the future of changing the evolution of evolution that we can see the evolution of synthetic bacteria, and finally, the thikario.
We're almost to improve people.
Our own is just to make sure that we have a chance that we have a lot of removed to survive. Thank you very much.
And what I want to show you the next one, it's a fundamental thing is a fundamental technology, a new technology that I brought to Microsoft as a part of a big, this is a year ago, this is Sealo.
It's a average that can interact is local distant to the distant amount of visual data from a big data.
We now want to man, many other parts of the digital pictures and marriage of digital and marriage in the continue to be able to do it by any of the way we want.
It doesn't matter how much information we watch how big information is that how big is these colors are the images of the big images.
Most are made with a new new new new new digital camera, but this is a scanning scanning from the Bible Congress, the Bible Congress,
It's not important because the only thing that we should limit the performance of a system of a system of the monitoring of your monitoring monitoring to a very flexible architecture.
This is a book insects of a non-imaginative example of a non-imaginative example of it.
It's about "Ca" "Charles Dickens. Each is a coloist is a colored is a capital.
To show you that it's about text, and not a imagine, and not imagine, and we can do something that is a real represent the real represent a real represent the real represent a positive represent a positive represent a positive representation of a textbook,
It may be an artificial way to read a book in electronic formed in electronic form.
I would not recommend.
This is a case of a real edge of "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian of "Gardianulous case of "Gardianula word.
Each image is the beginning of a sequence of a sequence of a sequence of a century.
This gives you a joy of a joy experiencing experiencing version of a revia or a revia or a revia a a a revia a multi-dimensional environment.
We did something and we did something little cold with this number of "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardianulanulanula's collection of this and we did something little little bit of the cold of this is a little little little bit of the cold of this number of little little little little cold of the number of "Gardianulanulanulanulanulanulous number of "Gardianulanulanulanulanulanulanul."
We created a false reclaim to a very large resolution -- much larger requires -- and we have a common required conclusion.
If you want to see the property of this cars, you can see here.
Or other other models, or even the techniques.
And this is what we really clearly through a monitor.
We hope that this is to sign the bee of the beach of these miles and other people like this -- which are not necessary.
And of course, the big application of the evidence of the technology of the kind of technology.
I'm not going to say a lot of time on this one, but just to tell you that we have to tell you that we have contributed to this field.
These are all the roads of the United States of the United States of NASA SA scale.
Let's go to a different thing right now
This is actually active on the Internet; you can see the verifire.
This is a project called Photosynth, which is embracing two different technology. Some of them is Sealoops and the other research of visual perception of the visual perception of the computer perception of the universe in Washington, the conquent of the University of Washington, the British Steve See, the U..
and Rick Szeliski at Cerzelisisism.
So this is active active on the Internet. Posphere of Slolot.
You can see that when we create this kind of perspective, when we can navigate through images of images we can have this kind of experience in many resolution.
But the space arrived, the space of these images matter.
The other other visual algorithms have recorded these images together so that to cover the real space where these images -- all the way to the Grases of the Grases of the Wrace and Canadians are -- there are some of the projections here of a projections of a projection of a creative of space.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There are some of the more that have much more space of space.
I would like to go right at one of the original standing of Noah -- this is a part of a Photosyn-decide to show you what I think is that the market I think is the pioneered of this technology, we just think it's not just a obvious bit of a resisting of the projection of this technology, just is obviously not just vising on the site.
We had to care about the law of the law of the law of the lawyer.
This is a reconstruction of Cathedral Dames in Dames of Flickr. Does Flickr. Does Flickr, and you find something like a Delop, and you find something that was found out of the truck is found a picture that was found that the cools are found that would be found that the cool of this model.
These are pictures of Flickr, and all of them were relational spaces in this way.
We can just navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I would go to work at Microsoft is very measured to Microsoft is very much a contains of a prime here.
I mean, you see that I'm a lot of the camera of the camera from the camera from the camera from the cell phones, all of the professional SLRs LRs in LRs in this environment.
If you can find out there strange of these strange strange.
There are so many mass of feeds, six-mous."
Where this is a series of photography -- ifixed --
This is a poster of Dames who was recorded by the right now.
You can get away from the poster to a physical environment of this environment.
The idea is that I can do certain things with social environment. This means to collect data from all the world -- from a collective memoral of what the Earth is the Earth -- and to interconnected to what the Earth is interconnected to the whole thing is emerging is more than the suffering of the country.
You have a model of what comes out of the entire Earth.
Think about this as a long as the first long as the first time of the Earth's "Virtualture."
And this is growing in complexity as the world as the world as the use of benefits as benefits as users are getting larger as users as used.
The proportions are eetically ethichet-meeting with a lot.
If someone eeeetheic all these sfines and say who I am saying who I am -- then my photography Dams improvement and I could use it as a sense of social experience, and I could use it as a kind of social experience.
And of course, a product product of this is the huge amount of sprawling of the green and the virtual patterns of the Earth, collective patterns of the Earth's revenues of the village of the village of collective and images of collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood correctly, what will allow your software to do is like a moment in the next few years, is that the shared positions of a list of somebody on the balls?
BA: Yeah. Which does really do is to be to the goal is to be able to look at it.
It creates hyper-connected to each other of the images.
And it does that based on the images of images.
And this becomes a quick when you think about the significant information that they have those images that have those images.
As you do a picture of images on the Internet, you hear a couple of words on the Internet, and you hear a lot of information on the pages of information about what represents are the positive information about what represents about the position.
Now, what would it be if that positive the picture of all the picture?
So the amount of signal interconnection and wealth of this is a huge amount of revenue of the country.
CA: Bish, it's really incredible. Felics. Felics.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense plants of the heat of the heat of the piece of the chicken research is the chance of living rooms that have no time in their old selling fish in the wind, they still feel the last of the balls of plants in the leaving roofs of plants to the planet.
You don't know that the Jaguary Jaguary Jaguary lady, or that the Lace, or that the myths of the older of the aging of the Himal-wish rescue red, or the reminds of Dhard, is to revealing the central revelation of anthropology, and this is not just a sense of reality, but this is not just a sense of reality, but it's just a sense of reality, it's not just a model of reality.
The consequence of a certain set of decisions that we have to make sure that our ancestors, and successful lot of generations in a lot of generations in a time.
And of course, we all share the same imperative adaptive adaptive.
We all are born of us all the children bring children on the world.
We go through the inition.

You understand that this is not just that that the people will consume the food for the door of the dots of food because they don't have enough money to put it in the death is that that means that the ability is so hard to make a decision-making compensation of the compensation of the compensation of the compensation of the compensation of the employment.
And I was looking at the bottom of the bottom of the employees from the employment, which would be a long phones, which would raise their own compensation of compensation of compensation of the compensation of the food.
So the credit is a consequence when you have too many options.
And I think that does that this is just like this.
You really want to take a good decision, if it's for all the ethernity, right?
You don't want to choose to choose to choose or even the wrong thing for saving the wrong for her safe to save the wrong thing
So this is a second effect. The second is that if we can do it to be able to keep a step, and we will be less to make a choice to be less satisfy the election of choices than we were to choose with the choices.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that we had a lot of soses for a lot of soses for a and it's not a perfect -- and it's not a perfect -- and you know, which is not -- and you know, is the bad for them?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that could be a different choice that it would be better to make your imagination that the alternative that is that the alternative of choice that you did the regret of the faction that you have to do the spring of the faction that you get the election of the election of the election of the faction that you have a good decision.
The more option of the option of the option of something that is really easy to regret something that you have ales-to-doing with the option that you have alesis the option that you have ales-of-the-the-the-the-the-of-the-the-the-the-of-the-the-the-the-of-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-day that is a lot of it is a lot of it is regret to regret to regret to regre
Secondly, what economists call the cost of opportunity for opportunity.
Dan Gilber demonstrated in this morning in this morning talking about how we evaluate the way we evaluate things that we can see what we think of the things that we can see how it is that you compare to what we think about how we can do it very clear to the way that we would have a very clear in this morning in the morning in this morning in the morning of how we evaluate the way we evaluate about how we evaluate the way that we evaluate about how we evaluate about how we evaluate the way that we evaluate the way
Well, when I'm a lot of alternative alternative to take away from the practice of the characteristics of the characteristic alternative attaches that break the and that makes you less satisfied with the alternative of the alternative that you have a little bit of satisfied alternative to the alternative of the alternative of you have a lot of satisfied alternative to have a little bit of the price of the practice of the
This is an example. I ask people who are not New York City.
But here's how we should give it a rational.
We have this is the boat in Hamptons.
It's a very expensive.
It turns out the superbit. They have a wonderful day for them.
What could you want to be more and less than the draction is thinking, "It's aughter "It's aud."
Everyone in my neighborhood in Manhattan is going.
I could just like in front of the office." And spend the next week of the idea that the idea that the sea of the idea that we had a place to have a place of parking place to have a place of parking place to have a place of parking place to be a place in front of the office." And I could just like a job." And I could be a slap of the office." And I spend two weeks of the slap of the slooping of the idea that we had a place to have a place to have a place to have a place to be a changel to be a place to do the whole bunch of the whole
The food strength of the satisfed of satisfaction that we have on the election is right if what we choose is exceptional.
And the more options of the more options of the presence of these options are going to be the great options of these options are perceiving as we perceived as we can be perceived for opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon tells a lot of things.
We should live live a sense of the lack of the lack and probably we should do things slow.
But one of the things that tells you is that anyone who tells you a choice to make other things.
And all other things can have a lot of things that are a lot of these remarkable facility and that will make less attractive what you do you do is less attractive.
Third of the wave extension of expectations.
And so this hit when I wanted to replace my blueprints.
Port bluggle.
And there was a single one that the beeked, and you buy them and you buy them and you buy them as a drack, and they were incredibly unable to get them and if you had to be a lot of time and slopes they started to stay better.
So I went to my blueprint after I had a good years of the old and I said, "Look, I want a wall of the black." And I said, "Look, you want to be a snap, and the windows, the right thing to be snap, right?
Do you want to be with far? Do you want to prepared or your flower?
Would you like to be a trouble doing?
You want to avoid it, you want to rights, you want to get out of the blaaah. And you don't want to do it.
And he painted my face and after I said, "I want to be the guy who was like, "I want to be the guy who were no idea that I had no idea that I spent a city that I spent a city of the walls of the walls of the walls -- with the other one of the things that I had the right -- the other one of the best I had.
We recently have done better for these options have done possibly make better choose.
But I was feeling worse.
Why? I wrote a book that I tried to explain this.
The reason I felt worse is that I feel like we had all these options of these options of my expectations of how I should be a payments have been raised to be raised with good champions.
I had very high expectations of the same expectation of the wave of when they were not a single same.
Now when I'm 100 neighborhood, my mom mother, one of them has to be perfect.
And what I got was good, but not perfect.
So I learned what I was that I had been waiting and the result is that I was deadly removed to what I was hoping with what I was hoping with what I was hoping with what I was hopelessed with what I was expected with what I expected with what I expected with what I expanding with what I expanding was expected with what I expected with what I expected to exp
The option of the options of the people who can't do something else than to make the expectations of the expectations of how people have to be those options.
And it will take this big satisfy satisfaction that even if they get a good thing to get a good result.
No one of the marketing world,
Because if you know, I don't know, I don't have the idea of what I'm talking about.
The truth is more like this.
The reason why it was all the better when it all was worse when everything was worse was worse that when everything was worse was really hardly possible to experiment.
Today in the world, in the world that we live -- new industrialized citizens and we have to get the perfect and we would expect to be the best thing that you can tell you that things will be so good at how much good they expect to be so good at all.
You never have a surprised because the expectation of your expectations and my own and my own require to the sky.
The secret of happiness -- because you all came up with -- the secret of happiness is to be expected expectancy.
I mean, just want to say -- just a short moment -- that I actually have a so-called a wonderful goal and it's really a wonderful goal.
I could find something better and I could find a little bit better.
But let's look at your house to your house a so bad thing that you have a bad thing to do.
And finally, a consequence of a wall, a wall of the blind thing that you don't know when you can buy a single one is that when you don't get a single one one is that when you don't think about why is that the answer is the clear is the cloud.
The world is a veget, how could you could they do?
When are hundreds of different stylen of different split of bluggling and somehow do you disappoints of why, do you know, why are you wonder why, do you know, is the going?
It's as a clear that the answer to the question of the question of the question of the question:
You could have to choose to choose better.
And with a hundred different waves of blue on the election of choices.
So when people take decisions, even if people take decisions are good to the choices are good to make sure that the outcome of them, they are good to come up with them, they are selling them.
The pressure of the operation in the industrialized world of the last generation.
I think a big contribution -- not the only important contribution to this is not the only erupon this erupper synuss, and also also also the people are disappointed to the synthesizing because the standards are too high high high high high levels are too high high high high high levels are too high to the only one --
And when I have to explain these experiences believe they are coming out of the bed.
So the general result is that we take it better, and we feel more worse than we feel worse.
So let me remind you remind you of it.
This is the doctor, that we all think that we all think of that we all think of the boss and it's not true.
No discussion that you have a few choices more choices than none of the ones that are better than the ones that are better than a few choices are better than a few choices than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of discussion than a few choices than a few choices of the choices of the choices of the choice is better than noses than n't, but here I don't have any more than
There's a number of magic. I don't know what it is.
But I'm quite sure that we went through that point where the point where the elections are the way of doing the lives.
Now, the idea -- I almost finally finally finally -- the idea that I think about this is this.
And what it allows all these elections in industrialized society is good at the material of the material.
There's a lot of places in the world, and I heard of a few of them where they have a few of them are not that much options.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the thing about talking about is a strange problem of Western societies and rich and rich and richer.
And what is frustrating and suffering is this: Steve Levitt talks about how these chair chair chair and hard to install the way to install of the way to do it.
And what I say is that these options are expensive, expensive, except not only help them.
They actually have a painting.
They actually make us feel worse.
If something that allows us to do that in our society to make all the elections that we make all the elections that we make a lot of choices that people have too puts that people have too little that the lives of the people of the amorgan of what the amora.
That's what the Pareto. That's the Pareto.
The demand the income will make us better be all of us -- not only the poor -- because of the way that the exist excess of choices.
And in conclusion. Did that you think of this cartoon and being a sophisticated person you say, "He! What do you know about the fish fish fish fish the fish of the beetles.
You know nothing that there's a possibility in this acvarious imagination of the world -- so I read it out of the world -- so I read it and I read it and I read it and I read it out of the world -- so I read it out.
And the more I thought I was thinking of it as I came to think of the knows something like this.
Because the truth is that if you hope everything to be possible, because everything to be possible, you don't have a freedom.
If you hope that everything that is possible, so that everything is possible, the sea level.
You think of the traveling and today are satisfaction.
And it takes a different acvarious acvarious of the active active active active account.
This is almost unbelievable -- probably even for a fish for a fish for us.
But the absence of metaphor is a reeth of unfortunately and unfortunately a consistent and consistent a hammer.
Thank you very much.
