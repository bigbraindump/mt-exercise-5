And the year, we showed these two diamonds to prove that polar polar polar polar polar polar that was the main the last three to the last three to the size of the 21st 48 percent of the marine of the marine percent of the time.
But this morning, the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn't look at the size of the guy.
The polar polar is in a way, the heart of the climate of the climate system.
It goes back and over and over the fear and the fear of the fear and the fear of the falls of the falls of wooden and it was extended to the fall of the wooden and the fact.
The next slide that I will show you a lot of being a quickly quickly going to be a little bit of the last 25 years.
The pemancy is the marine of the smell.
As you can see the blue of blue cats.
This is the anuary for the time of the snapping for the net.
And it is the summer.
Asa-called the Feeepermanenty, you can see that it's almost like the blood of the body.
In 25 years of it came from this to this one.
This is a problem because the quarter inquisite of the flow of the ocean around the ocean in the ocean of the ocean in the ocean of the ocean ocean.
where it is a massive amount of carbon carbon carbon carbon cause, when it comes to meters is translated in metan micro-organisms.
Compare with pollution of the pollution of the warming of global warming the amount of global atmosphere could take this point of the extreme way that we go on this point.
And by the lacks in some of the Alaska metan extensive disease is at the sprose.
The Katey Walter Walter Walter Sessa University in Alaska little lac at another lac of a little lack of the past.
Okay, okay. This is OK -- Go: She is if we are too.
And a reason is that an enormous words, the hot Grooms is the Groenland.
This is a race that they all over the year.
But the volumes are much more like this.
This is the Kangerussusuain the South Grow's Groenland.
If you want to know how the creation of the big spring of the spring of the spring of the same.
These debate very quickly.
And at the other capital of plant, Antarctica largest main the planet.
The last people who have reported as they report that the continent are the dark continent is negative and the Eastern Antarctics on the top of the island of the island of the island is over.
This is equal equipment over the big level, like the Grroom.
In Himalaya, the third of the third of the marime, on the top of the new formats, which was the spring of a few years were guarans.
40 percent of the population of the world's population of the water water in these water water in these topirs.
So And, this guarding is the source of the water water for this one.
And the fact that they raised them.
But when it goes to the water water water water water water water water water
In California was a 40-percent scarf in Sierra.
This is the reserves of water.
And predictable, as you can read it.
And the whole global global driving up a dramatic creative creative credit incentives of the incentives of the world.
And the disasted apart on the global rate has completely great rate with a price and the fall of the time.
four times more of the past 30 years of the 75 years of the 75 years of the 75 years of the 75 years of the time.
This is a completely unusual.
If you look at the context of you can see what happens.
In the last five years I added 70 million tons of carbon dioxide every 24 hours of 25 million tons every day every day.
And here is going to take with the Pacific area of the Pacific area from the Western Indian area where the subject of the Indian expensive stage of the oxygen in the ocean in the ocean of oxygen in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the United States.
The biggest because the only one of the global warming injudge of the reports, which is the represent of the fossil fuels.
Petrole is a problem and the best is the worst of the best books.
The United States is one of the two big emits, like China.
And the proposition was to build a lot of factory factors.
But we start a change all of the change.
Here's the people who have been assumed in the last few years with proproduced.
However, there is a battle policy.
And the carbon industry and oil industry has spent a far-and-dollar space of the last year --
And the good covering what is a rangoron.
This image of a mindful image of something.
The Cracial Cracial Latin Tenness, a billion yesterday charge was imprastid.
You probably see the stiron.
This is all the printing of the tarian in America had the second big deal.
One of the reclamations of the good cartoons, about the Cracial Cracial was this.
Video: ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫
He is abundant abundance, and help in America, and she helping the economy.
Frosty, with the book, it becomes a little bit more curated.
It's accessible and workers are spring to the soup out of the soup.
Al Gore: This is the majority of cartoon: the great cartoon Virginia
The Minner on the highest degree of Masssasssy of Massassy Coal.
Video: Don Blankenn: I want to be clars, Nanks Pelosi, Harry Reihad Reihabar didn't talk about what I'm talking about.
So Al Gore: So the Alic Protect for the Climits two campaign.
This is one of them, a part of one of them.
Video: Act COALergy we see the climate change in the climate change.
That's what we do is to spend a big amount of money for public forces for public forces that we can help us show us the real thing about the car.
The truth is not dirty cooking, the good books is didar.
We think it's curved -- and we are strange.
So it won't be able to get to the climate change.
You can get that we do.
Video: The Actor: The book has heard a series of it.
So let's make a tube to do a tube of the customer of the footprints of the cartoon the cartoons.
Huel! Masinaria is about noise noise of the noise of the noise of the noise of the noise yes.
But this is the sound of the technology of the good technology of the coverage of the goodbye.
And as the good books are one of the main the global causes of global remarkable technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the good books here.
Here's the next thing to do with this is the technology today is about the technology of the good book.
Al Gore: In the alternative alternative to the positive economic challenge with the challenge of the security and the problem with the problem of the security and the problem of the security of the economy.
Video: The Narrator: America, economies, economics security crisis.
The only thing that you get to all the dependent on all the carbon dependent on the carbon carbon carbon footprint of carbon carbon footprint --
But now we have a new solution to the notion of the notion of the incurious newspaper.
You can get America with 100 percent of the 100 percent -- in 10 years ago,
A plan to put America in the third of the pass and help us to get the end of global warming.
In the end, a solution that is a solution to help us solve our problems.
Remememember America.

Thank you very much so much.
And the year at TED I did a introduction to LHC.
And I promised it to come and give you a data about how it works.
So for me. And for the people who have no idea of the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment that was the biggest scientific experiment -- the 27 kilometers or is the Street Street Street or the pressures of a billion of a billion in a billion-second broken broadcast -- the panel of the universe -- the panel of the universe -- the panel of the universe -- the panel of the universe -- the panelder.
It's extremely fun.
This is the Genevelevata.
We make photographs these minds "Big Bangs" inside of the decades.
I work on this one. It's called the ATLS detector, Lungeled 44 meters of 22 metric photography of the ATLS images here to the ATLS image.
And over 10 seals we went on the top 10 seven, I started the first time.
And this image was the ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLASS.
It caused a celebration in the room
It's a picture of the first spring particles that quarter has been over the LC, cross of LHC, crossing with a part of the LHC deliberately with a detector.
In other words, when I saw that 10 seven-seven-fighting apart from functional, which is a huge success.
I don't know if that got the biggest honest above Google and this is what he did on the Google and the first page.
It means that we did a cultural impact on the law of the impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the scientific impact of the end,
And after a little bit of a sample of the apart of the apartment, which actually had to do with these days.
Those are transportation of the ampers when the apart of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of a couple of thousands of footprints of a 3,000 ampers of amperforming 13 thousand ampers of amperforms of the power of the mostly flowing out to the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the maximum of the maximum of the massion.
Now, engineers in the room looking at these days, and say, "You can't transport."
But they can do that when they're at the temperatures become called the superconductor.
So as a 271 degree -- there is more color of the hospital between the steps can transport these cutttttle.
At one of the laws of the laws of the LHC, was a factory of factory factory was a factory of factory in the L.C.
So that company has been sweet a little bit of amperforming of the Jewise.
This was the result.
This is more impressive, and that you have been spending over 20 tone, and they moved about 30 qualitance.
So I had a little bit about 50 magnetic magnetic
We had to take the outside, and what we do.
I reconcusion, I repair them.
And now we take magnetic and then we put it in subterm.
Pana at the end of his marine Mars the LHC is going to be like new again.
We're going to start again, and we get to get data in the unfortunate data or yet, and we will continue to find out that the research is the tools of the universe.
Now, of course, that in a way, that one way, those accidents about the important thing about the important news and engineering to the extreme and engineering to break it up.
I think it is that it is so hard to be so hard to have a little bit of inalso, this is the important thing to the L.C.
So I'm going to leave the words of a scientist of Britain's scientist, Humphrey Davy, I think that the earliest experiments of the protection of the protection of the protection of the protection of human minds to human minds and human minds are not for our minds of our scientists are not hopeless and the scientific progress are not finding our stage are unfinding to our stage and the world are not finding and the world are overwealthy, and as we are not finding as much more myself,
Thank you.
I want to start with the rush of childhood when you play with cubing.
And as you invite what you have learned to get them and raised them and get them to get them to the band-a-kill and solving the problems.
The hospitals is profoundly law is a lot of the world in the world in inconjection of the world in the world of the world in the world of the world is about the world of the hospital,
So as a quality of IT as an inspiration of this useful for our interactions with the interactions of the interaction with the account of my account, my color of the Pator, and my color of the Jeulewan -- we start to go -- if we use a computer, where we use a computer, where we use a computer to have a computer to treatment with a mouse of a mouth-bad, and if we can get to the treat the screen and put in the interview,
So what do we want to do we want to not?
And the question was so much of the fascinating as we hooked the research of Stagging Stagges.
In short, Siftable is a computer interactive computer is a size of a biscket.
They can be manufacturing, they can be manufacturing the footprint, and they can perceive the light and a radio screen and a radio of wireless and a radio wife.
The most important thing is that they're palsable, like the games of games, you can only get to the games you can just get it out of them.
And Swewitness offender new example of an ecosystem new tool.
And as the magic becomes more palsably above their mission, the consistent of their missions of our nutritious nutritions and fun and fun of interaction.
I'll start with simple.
This Siftable is confident to press image, and if you put it in a direction, and if you put it in the other.
These portraits are constantly the ones that are the other.
So if I put them one langle on the other.
If they are inconcepted to this, and they can become a confused to become a confusion.
They also can feel the mission and inclining.
We realized that one of our interactions of interactive interactive and we can use the gestablished the data, how we could use the data and the table of how we were a college of a lihidden in a lihidden collection.
So in the case we have three Switwitwitnesses like the gload ges and they can use them to the center, where they can use the center, where they will be the top of the center, where they want to be the same thing.
If we can get too much, we can get a little bit of back.
There are also interesting possibilities for education, like how they would be games and logical games and logical people that we want to want to try to figure out the things that are immediately to see the results immediately the results immediately and see the results immediately possible.
So here I -- this is a Fibonacy, which I do with a simple program that I do with a simple program.
Here's a game game game of the words of the words of the West and Bogging and Boggle.
So every one of the first stage of the first one of the Sweet every Stag, and the main the mother, they are green to the words, are grew with a dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds red, and you have a new set of letters, and you have a new set of letting new letters.
Thank you.
These are nested in the curves in the curves of the Media Laborator and removed to the Media material.
He lived to crazy.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of applied people are not to give them a lot of instructions.
All you have to say is "Fwords, and they know exactly what to do.
Here's another people who are trying to get people to get them.
This is the most tank testing our own properly in the right right in the right.
It seems like it was that he wanted to do was to make a Siftagged on the other.
So for him was just cups.
This is a kind of an animal animal animal animal animal animal animal animal
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who invest language.
And this is Felix.
He can introduce us to the stage in the scene, just raise that the Switwitzerlands that they find the person's person.
This is the sun-pluggles
Video: The race.
David Merrill: Now he introduced a tractor in the scene.
Video: The portrayet.
Very of it. Yes!
Missor when Siftags and assign them to the person's person's can make the personal account -- Video: Ham!
DM: It takes your own narrative.
Video: Okay,
DM: It's a open-up story story with how it will be a very smoke.
Video: Hibo, peak -- pitch!
DM: The last example I have time to show you today is a device and interpreted music and interpreted the music of the waste that we built the recently and all the sounds of sounds like the sounds that would be rhythmic and all the sounds that would be rhythmic and all of the sound that we have time to show it is a tool,
Each four different variations of these variations that you want to use it.
And you can inject the sound of a succession that you can see when you get the guy of the same thing.
The sound goes on the sounds of the sounds of the sounds of a successful of successful Switzerland.
There are effects that you can control control and reverberal and the filter and the filter and the filter of the film.
Aatther one certain sounds like a certain sounds and then includes it to help it to help it it.
And the next general effects like the canumbbbbbbyards that are the size of the Kaplug to the K.
Video: DM: And I can start with a riting ritself in the second Switwitzerland, I was an extensive, extensive, more and more and more and more and more of the bedroom.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: DM: Now adding a cutttttle.
Video: And now I'm going to add the filter to the movie the movie the light.
Video: DM: I can get intrenment of inclined in the clinic or another part of a part of a part of the one or another.
Video: DM: Now I'll put this on the band and more expression.
Video: DM: I can do it for the amount of time --
So I don't have to do the plan, you can improvise, presented or a smoking of the words.
Now, I can find out that humans are intreating using the Swewitch of the volume of the volume, inclined in the stangle.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is the creation of our interfaces that are better to the brain and the way that function is working on our brain.
And today, we had time to show a coordination of this space, and some of the design of this space, and some of the opportunity that we try to get out of the lab.
The Ganda who wanted to retinder is like we are at this new generation of the tools of interaction with the immediate tools that will bring information, which will bring information,
Thank you very much.
And these episods to talk to you all of you to all of you know.
They're writing.
He written her book, but it is, more than it is.
It's all my love love and fascinating a vibrate of a viet.
And I don't have that that that is ever going to change it.
But this is what it was like, a little bit of a life and in my career and on my career released me to my work with work.
And the thing is that I wrote a recent biography of this book, this is the "Manana, Iubest-Ragest, Iubesty," which is a particularly unlike my book, and he became this in the world for a few reasons, and became this important selling off, and became this kind of an international selling sense, and it became this conclusion.
The result is like the anywhere I'm going to have now tremendous amount of as being a condemand
Serioios -- confussion, condesized it.
Would you like ingrijorry, and you say, "You don't have your teams -- you don't have your performance as a little bit of passenger performance?
You don't know that you will continue to write your life on your life that it was going to make a book as a book as a book ever get on the world that ever get out of the world that ever you get here?"
It's very linking --
But it was also more like if I didn't remember it all 20 years ago, when I started to marriage people -- when I was a teenager -- I want to become writing -- I want to become written by the same African reaction of the same term on the same way that I had a kind of African reaction to the same way that I was not a way of the same African reaction of the same term.
And people said, "You don't have a little more than you have never had any success?"
I don't mean that humility will be killing the remote of re?
You don't know that the frame is that your life in this field of life in this field, and you will never have a dream of the flagh of the flaging of the flags of the flagh of the filled of the screen?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the answer -- the answer to all those questions is """""""Yeah."
Yeah, it's a theory of all that stuff.
And I always was it.
And you have a little bit of the things that people are born that people who are born them.
As a result of the big algorithms that are cross;
But when I think about the work that I always thought I was like, "Why I have this time for the last time is "Why?"
Is this a rational?
It's a logic to be that they were to be able to do that they were destroying the work that they were destroying the Pame.
And what is the specific specific initiatives that seems like us not really about our healthcare care in the support of mental illness, in a way that other teachers don't do it?
My father was my chemical engineering chemistry and I remember it as in the 40 years of the engineering of the engineering is a chemical to be asked if you don't ask any engineering can be a chemical engineer.
It didn't happen -- John, how how it goes with chemical?
It's just not happening.
But to be honestly, the chemists like chemists are not too much to be a lot of sequence to be alone of the quotprints of the manipulacative maniacative
We are writing this reputation, we have this reputation, but not only writing the kind of writing all the way that they have this reputation to be strong.
And we all have to do is to look at the numbers, just by the 20th century, in the 20th century, in the 20th century, and often have young people who died with young people and often died by young people and often died by young people and often died by the way.
And even that didn't have the own thing that had not really been sicking of their own talks.
Norman Mailer, even before I get my last interview, he said, "Each of my book, he said, "Each me a little bit more than my book."
A great great great news about your work of a life of a viet.
But I don't clear when we hear someone like this, because I heard that we heard that we heard these things like these things that we have absorbed and something, and I accepted the idea of the collective creativity and the unit is somehow inlaw, it will always inlaw, it will always income, and it leads to the end of the sufferable to the end of the happen.
And the question I want to add it all this is all of this is all of the impact of this idea?
You're comfortable with it -- as as as as it can see with the eye -- I don't care about this post of this poverty.
I think it's an odid.
And I also think it's dangerous and I didn't want to see it in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage to the great artist's to live in the way to live in.
And I know that I was like, my situation -- my situation -- it would start to start to get me to the charge of this one-to-one confidence of this Applain, especially the circumstance.
As a little bit tank, I just have a 40-year-old is about 40 years.
We probably have been able to get inhabited for the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of four decades.
And it's very likely that I will write with this moment to be judge by the way that the work of the work that came after my career after my career of my book, right?
What would say to the men's falls, because one of the one as a kind of a kind of successful -- it's very likely to be happened.
Oh, God, what God,
This is the kind of gas to look at a time to the gin to the world in the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I do do it in continue this message that message I love.
And then the question for that point?
And so I hope that a lot of meditative meditations, like I have to work now, to continue to write a kind of creative construction, it's going to be a kind of psychological construction, right?
I had a way to find a way to find a distant to the obvious one of me, and my father and my father and my father would write, and my father will be now injured to what he written to be able to do what I write to what he written to the what he written to the what he written a little bit of a very way to what he was writing a very distantly to the way to be a distant to the way to be a distant to the same.
And as we all went into this last year, we started to start this sense, and I tried to find other society to find other society if they could have better ideas about how to be helping people create more ideas about how to be helping people create in-in-in-risk innocent intuitial risk of artes.
This is what it took me in Greece and the Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and the Roma and the research.
So the next one, you know, the circle.
But as an antic antitself as the Romics of antitself is that the creativity of the human being being being being the inside of the human being?
People thought that creativity was a spirit was a spirit that people are helping people from people from a source and unintelligent and unknown, and unknown.
The range of these spirits of creative creativity.
It was faunt for that he thought it has a demand a department that the wisdom of the department.
The Romans were the same pill, but they called imateriality, according to the impairy.
What is great, because the romantic are not that a genius was a very special individual genius.
They thought the genius was a genius as the magical entity of the walls of the walls of the walls of artist's wildlife and iniasiasist and unknown, the surface of the work, and the result of the work, the workforce of the workforce of the workforce of the workforce of works,
Absolutely -- this is the distant that is the distant that I talked -- that the kind of psychological works.
And all the world as it works, right?
So the artist was protected by certain things like this, like this, like too much narcisism, right?
If you have the work was straltruists, you couldn't keep the world all the worth of the world as the stage of the falling of this falling genius.
If you think about the criticism was not completely come completely sell to you, that's not going to you.
Everybody as the stage of the gender is about ignorance.
And they looked at the West creativity.
Then came to the Renasting and everything that has changed, and the idea of a certain main the center of the universe as a man in the center of the universe and mysterious and mystery of the mystery of the mystererious creatures that are receivable to divable divinying.
It was the human sweet of a rational, and people started to create the creative vice of the individual creativity.
And for the first time people started to refer to each one of the people started to get a gender, instead of the gender, instead of the genius.
And you have to married, I think it was a huge error of a huge error.
And you can see a simple simple person, a simple person, or it is actually the receptor is actually the receptor and the spring and the mystery and the mystery is a little bit too much of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile
It's like you have a little bit like the sun-in-in-in-in-
It's just incottttty, and they are making all these astonishes of inimaginable performance on the performance.
I think that the pressure of the artist has a doubt of the last 500 years.
But if it's true, and I think that is, what do we do we do?
Can we do things different?
So we go back to the old sensory sensors of relationships.
Perhaps not.
Maybe we can't stery the 500 years of man's thinker about 18 minutes.
And perhaps they find out that there would be some of the question of the question of the questions of the tissue of the sample people present the flow people present the projects over the projects over the projects over the projects over the projects over the projects over the projects over the projects that are all over the projects that would be the world in the audience that would be grateful to the projects of the questions of the questions of the questions of the news over the course of the projects
I probably won't coopt it to the too.
But the question I want to ask is -- why don't I mean -- why not?
Why don't we think about this?
Because it has a lot of as much as we heard about anything about what we heard about the innesses of completely insane process.
And the reason that any time to create something -- basically to create something -- basically the one of the here -- you know, you don't always behavior always behavioral act.
And in fact, sometimes you can see the paranormal.
I had a talk that I had a talk that I met the American American Mount American American Learn Rutch Stone, which is now the poetry and live on the top of the country that when my child's country was going to work on the road, and I just told me when a child was going to work on the room, and I just hear a poet and I just hear a poet and he just heard a poet of poet --
The story was like a vast vast vast of the air.
And it was filled over the camps.
The feeling income income in because you get the fishing of the bottom of the legs.
And that moment he has one thing to do, and that is a single thing that you get applataaway."
And the running as the staircase to the marine the stage of the map was to a piece of map and a little credit and fast enough to get it through it and put it on the map.
Sometimes it was not enough enough and running and running and running and running and running in the house and the poor and the poems and the poems and the poems and the people welcome out of the room, and the southern of the room, I was another poet "A other poetry and a poet of the poet and the other poet
They were also the moments that -- and I will never forget -- moments where the story is almost losing the story of the loss.
And the Allider and the main the main and the world the pass and the creation of the creation of the credit and the story of the other's going to the other person and the other and the other person and the other hang of the other.
And the cover of the cover and the boy and then it on the map of the math.
So in the situation, the applied map on the map of the mother, but it is the last time of the first worst words.
When I heard it -- it's just like -- it's just how my own creative process.
My creative processes don't limited to this -- it's not drive!
I'm a catching where they work on every day to go every day to the same and you can travel and travel and travel and trouble with the wrong and I can see it and get out of it.
But even I was like, my inner of my inner and I was so much that I was able to sometimes that phenomenon.
And I imagine that as many of you have been and many of you are.
And I had projects or ideas that were able to make me from a source that I don't know that I don't know it.
And what you do you all this?
And how we should be reported to us to get that we don't lose to lose our mind, spring to help us reach our money, and rejection to reach our money,
For me, the most relevant examples of our day, which we can do is what the music is about how it can do is the music I took a piece of interview, we took a lot of years to be in the demand in the demand in the demand review.
I was talking about this and this is almost all the subject of his contemporary Chinese artist of the contemporary Chinue, what he started to control and gestablished and gestablished creative and gentlemen.
With the time it was linking and immediately the story of the story that the reduced the table of the moon the Los Angeles and then everything has changed.
As a little bit of a short fragment of a short fragment that comes in minds of the song that comes in the minds of the death of the death and inspired a little bit of indoor, but it doesn't look at it, it is at it, but it doesn't take it to the water.
It has no no hopelesson is no reporter of the reporter of the reporter of it.
The experience that all that the old old screen in the rainforest and the Middle of "I'll leave the bank's banker for the time.
They're not good enough to remain a us."
And instead of the panick, just stopped it.
He stopped the process and he stopped something that was all with a whole new thing.
It raised the catch and said, "You see they're not like they're at volan?"
"You know, I think that could write a cann’t like this?
If you really want to be able to be in a moment of time in a moment of one moment of you.
If you don't have any of the one another.
Duel and boxes and box Cohen."
The tricky process has changed my own way that has changed my own thing.
It doesn't work that was going to be dealing to be unexpected to be all of that happening.
But the process and the process of doing it, and he had the end, he had the time he took the soul, and only because the gain, and only because it was unknown to the road and he had to come back back and forth, and he didn't have to be able to be able to do something that is that inside and China.
It could be this collaboration and the bizarre and bizarre in the form of a conversation and the external external that was not too as Tomans.
And after I heard the story of the story of trying to change a little bit of the thing I was going to be a data.
This approach me when I was at the middle of the "Mananca, Roages, Iubest, Iubest, and I found out of the way we all find out when we were trying to be a disaster and I thought it would be a disaster to be a disastastasted disast, it will be the most propospositive to being a dissursurvey.
Not just that, but the most propositive that he ever written it.
I was able to think that I should just abandoned the project.
I remember my opening my open-up hospital, and I tried to get and I tried to get and I tried to me.
I raise my mind, and I put my comments on the commentary comments, and I have a colleagues.
I said to me, "writing with you, and you know, and I know that if this book is not going to be the great book is not just my wife will be my good?
Because you can see that one of my battle on the battle all I have to get the step.
So if you want to be better than to do you have to do your apart and you get your own part of your job.
Okay, if you don't do this, you know, you don't do it, you all of it.
I would write because this is my message for my message.
And I want to consuffer for my job.
Because -- the Conclusion is -- by hundreds of years ago, people get in the North African people get to the poor people who have had to get the sea and musicum and the musical music, and the sacred music, and the sacrifice that they were in the route to the end of the class --
And they were always wondering, because dance was a professor were remarkable and were remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be all wondering, right?
But sometimes it was going to happen, and one of the fact that it really looks at the real time.
I'm sure you all know about what I mean to do with what I mean, in a certain moment, in a certain moment.
It's like time it stops and the pass is through a kind of porting is not a kind of a little bit differently, in the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 sers, everything everything is alone of the other 1,000 sers.
And one time, it doesn't seem to be in the same way.
It's light in the bottom and light light is the aircraft of the footprint.
As a little bit when it happens, they were also saying what they were called
and they were the laws and they put the "Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, Game, God, Game, Game, Game, Gam-on-in-go-do."
It's God's God.
A interesting among interesting -- when the main the Spanish had the Spanish Spanish Spanish Spanish has been by them and pronouncies in the Holh, Allah, Allah, Allah yes, "Allah," "Allahol, y,"
and they hear about the battle and the prisoners and dancing and dancing the flow.
In Span, when a interpret has been impossible and magic and mothers and the Mallah, magical and the Two and the magnificent of the newspaper, you want to get the off."
And the unit -- a God -- a God of God --
It's wonderful because we need to do something like this.
But the second is the second day the morning when the end, the endance of the insuspect is the marvelous and it's not a scaling and it's not a scaling of the Diva.
It's a dirty that walking is and the gender that is the genders and they could not be able to get to the time
Would it any one to the name of Dome, when he was the name of the Domat when he was supposed to do with the rest of his life.
It's hard.
It's one of the most painful acceptions of creative fact.
But it could not be a sick, if you don't think of how you don't think of the beginning, as the most extraordinary of your customers.
Maybe if you think about the prints were improud of cats a source of the moments of life from your life to be more than you can be more of your life when the moments have been on to be more of the moments.
If we think that it is all the way to change.
I started thinking and I thought and I was sure and I was sure the last few months of what the book would be publish the curious and the spring of my inner and crisis my southern and crashing my success.
And what I do with you on when you lose the curves of the goal is not a team.
It doesn't be the sun and just the Contintiny Continual Contintiny to your party,
If you get dance, then you get dance.
If the divity come and central is repaid of what you want to get the extraordinary to get the extraordinary ary, even for a mom, and even for a momentum of the forces of the forces of the forces of the human forces.
And if you don't want to be anything.
And all of these "Ole!" for you.
I think we should have them pretend to pretend them.
"Oh!" for you, because you have a load loves a loaf and inforce and the end, and the end, and the end.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We talked about some of these projects, about the human genome, and what could be predicted to the discover new genes.
Now we start a new point from a new point of biology, and now we digitized biology, and now we try to start to start to start a new biology, and enjoy and enjoy and assessing force and assets of life.
We all tried to ask our big questions.
"What is you live?" It's something that I think many biologists have tried to understand to the different levels.
We tried different approaches, simplified life on the basic component of the basic components.
We already already have about 20 years ago.
When I sequence sequence of human genome, this is that we went from the analogical world in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world.
Now we try to ask the question: Can we create new force force -- or we can create new forces of digital digital digital digital digital digital digital for?
This is a little bit of a little organism Mycoplasma genitalia, which has the smallest genome that can replant the only one species in the law.
We tried to see if we can come up with a genome.
We were able to get the surface of a hundred genes from the size of the age of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the metabolic map of metabolic map with our compatible to our compared to our comparison us.
I think this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can get the first of the genes we can make a little bit of a living.
So we decided that the only way before it is that the crosis, we can actually have this cross to the sticky components to the top component to the most fundamental questions.
And so I started on the road, "Can we get a cross-grade?"
Maybe the chemistry allows these molecules that we never did before?
And if we can active a cross-cross-grade?
A crosis, by the way, is just a little bit of chemical.
So our digital divides the life has increased to a exponential ritation.
Our ability to write code code, and they move that pretty much slowly grown up.
The last time he got to a exponential curve exponential curve the exponentially.
I started this about 15 years ago.
I went through a few dozen of a few bio-et-by-sized exams.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficulty is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make small little bit of DNA, but it's a 30-little, but it's a generative process, so what you build a longer, so what you build a longer, so that what you build a little bit more and more spring with more than the people that are doing a lot of car.
So we had to create a new method to put these little little little together, and the right all of the error.
This was our first tentative of the digital information from digital information to the digital information of the Namber 174.
It's a virus that killer human bacteria that is the bacteria
We did the design of the skill, we went through the right of the error of the DNA DNA DNA DNA in the DNA
The interesting thing that I took this piece of chemical materials that we took this piece of chemical material, and the bacteria started to read this code, and the bacteria started to read this code of virus.
The viral Partics were then released from the cells and they were killed and they killed the E.
I was talking to the oil industry and they said that they understand and they say that they understand that this model.
They were laughed more than you are.
And so we think this is a situation where the software can build their own main a biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the entire cross-s-gray of a bacteria of bacteria
This is over 580,000 little.
So we said to put the walls of letters in the size of the virus to the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of a stocks of a cell.
The design is critical, and if you start with digital information from the computer information, that information has to be very active to be very active to be very active to be very accurate.
When I sequence this genome in 1995, the sprise genome was a precision of the neighborhood of the basic basic bases.
I found it was reaching to reach out of the error. If we were used to be activated.
The design is the design is the design of the footprint of the 50 letters have to be a little bit of 50 galls of 50 lets to build a little unit of the sub-initial units to build some of the table to be compatible.
We create unique elements of unique elements of differently.
You may read that I read "market-it" in the hometown. We have a genetic code, we have a genetic code, and T.
Tries of those letters, those codic kro-range of about 20 amino acids -- a single text of a acid.
So we can use the genetic code to write, sentence,
I did all of that we did was to hide the code.
Some of them were disapplied that it is poetry to be poetry
We designed those joined that we can have been with enzymous and was with them.
They're also enzymous and they are them.
So we started doing the joy of the joy of five to seven to 7,000 little, and then slow 24,000 little, and then put together in the room, and then put the stocks to the stage of these 2,000.
Every time we have these joined pieces of these joy pieces of them could sequence sequence to make them a very smoke, and we try to create a very roughly roads -- as you can see in a minute.
We try to get to that point of automative.
So this looks like a basket.
When we get to the very big pieces, over 100,000 paths of footprints in E.
It filled all of modern molecular biology.
So we were moving to other hanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called recombination of human recombination, that biology uses ADNA, and that biology is using DNA, and that is use.
This is an example.
There's a organism called Deincoccucutation that can be the radio of radiation.
As you see in the cross of the cross of his cross is destroyed.
Two to 24 hours later, he put it on his own one of the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be often often all of the organism.
They can live in a living.
I'm absolutely sure life that life can exists in the space space space to move it into a new environment to find a new environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is happening there.
Here's a molecule of a molecule that we built using these procle -- actually using these procleans with these procle design with the design of the design of the skin that we put together that we put in the piece of the market.
Drojjan automatically put together automatically automatically automatically automatically
This is not a microscope with electronics, but only a micro-micro-micro-graphic phenomenal footprint.
It's so a molecule that we can see with a microscope with a microscope of the optic.
These are colors over a time of about six seconds.
This is a public that we had a little bit of time ago.
These are over 58,000 lits of genetic code,
It's the largest molecule that ever ever done with a defined structure structure.
It has a massive molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecule.
If we put it with a 10 and no 10 and spaces, 142 pages to be able to think of this genetic code,
So how do we start a cross-gravity of this?
And obviously, with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria to work with bacteria
And also easier when you get to eucistic eating the nuclear and put the nuclear nuclear and put the nuclear -- cloning and that's something that you all heard -- cloning -- cloning.
With the chain, the cross is is integrated in the cells is integrated by the curious that we can do a completely a crosis, we can make a completely crosis, and we can activate it to the cell, and we can activate it.
We had a chance of a microbial species.
These are about as people and so much as people and a little bit like people and smoke.
We added a few genes in the plus to make it for this cross-gene for this cross-gene cross-grades.
We had a dealing with them to kill all proteins.
And it was pretty amazing when we put in the cells -- you will appreciate our very sophisticated -- and cross the cross of the cells end.
So I thought that was how far it can work, but we try to design the process something beyond the process.
This is a major mechanism mechanism.
We all kinds of species that have been corporated by a second cross-second crosis, or a third of the third of the treatment of that the species of the trees of the characteristic new characteristic new characteristics in a second.
So those who think about evolution just as a single gender channels of biology.
They're called restricted restricted by restriction, which was actually the DNA
The Number that was in the cells that was not a thing.
The cross--cross that we have --
It was expressed and recognized the other cross-graded material, as the material as the yesterday, and I just got with the cross--celled cross-s-cell.
It became blue because of genes that we put in cross-grade.
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristics of a species have lost and converted in a completely new species, and it was a new kind of software that we put in the cell.
All the proteins were changed, the membranes were changing -- when we focus on the genetic code, is exactly what we transferred them.
This can sound like alchemistry, but we can move the DNA of the DNA, to change things pretty dramatic things like dramatic stuff.
Now, I support that this is not genesome -- but it has three billion years and a half years and a half years and we suspect that we can get the way to create a new version of the Talia, where the Talike, which is a new specific design for digital digital masterpiece.
Why do we do this?
I think it's pretty obviously obviously obviously obviously of needs.
We're going to go from six and a half billion people over 40 billion people over 40 years.
So to put that in context for me to me my bad, I was born in 1946.
There are three people on the planet for every one of us there in 1946, in 1946, they will be four.
We have a bad things that are sadly, providing povertable water and a half billion and a half billion and a half and a billion and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half of the food.
It will be difficult to do it.
We use over five billion tons of books, more than 30 billion oil bars of barballs of oil bills
This is a hundred million barils a day.
When we try to think about biological procousness or at any process that will be a challenge to replace that will be a challenge of the challenge.
And then of course, that CO2 is all that CO2 from this material, which is getting to the atmosphere.
Now, the discovery of our discoveries around the world, we have a data data data with genes, and I like to think about these things like to think about these components of the design of the future.
The electronics has only a doubled, or something like this, or something that came out of the component that came out of this.
We're limited out here, first of biological reality, and the imagination and imagination.
We now have the techniques of these quickly sweet tasks, combinattractive genimically.
We have the ability to build a big robot that to make a million cross on the day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of these 20 million genes of genes that we can try to make the occupy procast, or products we can change the pharmaceutical team of new molecular than the last 20 years of all the science.
And this is just a standard selection.
We can select for viable production of chemical substance or fuels, production production of vaccines, production production of vaccines,
This is a head of the design of a software that we work that we work and work to work and work on these species in the computer.
We don't know how it will show that it will show you.
We know exactly how their genetic code is their genetic code as well.
Now we focus on the bottom of the fourth generation.
You see the mixture of ethanic is just a needle is just a needs.
We have a generation of the generation of the next generation that will be slow enough to be southern fuels as much valuable to the fuel or different shape.
But the only way we think biology can have a major impact on the food and the product of food and the fall of their limited and the limited of the same way that we start with CO2 as the maternal cells to design the next generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the fourth generation of the generation of the generation of the fourth generation of the generation of the fourth generation of the generation of the O2 months.
Low and CO2 is a method -- but in our discoveries of our world around the world has all the way of our world,
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It goes into the deep ocean in the ocean and about two kilometers and half the deeps of the farming temperature.
The CO2 metan use of metan use molecular molecular hydrogen surrounding hydrogen to the energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 capital -- which is able to transport the country, and converted that CO2 back in the fuel in the fuels in the fuel by the way, to drive this thing.
So in a short time we think we could have meant to meet the basic question "What is the question?"
And indeed, you know, we have -- we have the chemical models of replacing the entire oil industry.
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where another park.
So to become a major source of energy.
But we also work now to use these same source things to invest the surface of vaccines as a little as well.
You see this year with the bottom year, we are always a dollar in minus when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think the situation can be changing the combined vaccines of combined vaccines of any any dynamic vaccines.
Here's how it could start to look at the future of changing the future of evolution now the arboundary to the bacteria with bacteria and the bacteria and finally, infinally, and finally, infinally, and then enjoy.
We're almost to improve people.
Our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive pretty much long, so you can do this. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you first to you -- is a new work, a new paper that we had a new kind of a new catch of a nation of a net. This is a year. This is a year. This is a year.
It's a medium that can interact is local or a big amount of visual data with a big amount of visual data.
We now look at a lot of digital pictures of digital pictures and smoking up to almost perfectly perfectly by the way, we were throwing it by it.
It doesn't matter how much information we are looking at our college is these college college and how big the images.
Most are taken by a new camera with a common digital camera, but this is a scanning of the Bible Congress, the Bible Congress, the surface of the 300 gapixels.
It's not important because the only thing that should limit limits of an inch system is the number of your pixels on your monitoring on your monitoring architecture.
This is a book that is a little bit like a non-imaginative.
It's about "the "Cut of Charles Dickens.
To demonstrate that is about text, and not a imagine, and we can do this is really a re-re-re-re-re-revealed textboot; it's not a positive provide.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read a book in form of electronic book
I wouldn't have to recommend.
This is a real case of "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian of "Gardianulance.
Each image is the beginning of a second.
This is really a piece of joy a plant experience, the price of a review, or a review, which is inherently inherent a multi-dimensional environment.
We also did something little with this little colleague of this number of "Gardianul."
We created a false reclaim to a very large resolution -- much more than any unusual clear -- and we enable to get a containment.
If you want to see the properties of this car, you can see here.
Or other models, or even other techniques.
And this really cleaning from some ideas, the limits of the limits of a monitor.
We hope that this is to be able to get the pop-up and other people like this -- which is not necessary.
Of course, the mapping is one of the things that is one of the technology of the kind of technology.
I won't say much time on this for a lot of time to tell you more about this field.
These are all the road from the United States of the United States of NASA.
Let's go to something else.
This is actually active on the Web; you can see the Web.
This is a project called Steve Photosynt, which is two-different technologies. Where Sealoon and the other Aumbon the domain of visual perception of the visual perception of the Washington Snavin Washington Snavin Washington Snaven's Littton Washington at the U.W.
and Rick Szeliski at Cerki Microsoft. A beautiful colleague.
So this is active on the Web. Posaurs.
You can see that when we create these kinds of perspective, when we can navigate through images of images in many ways, we can have this kind of experience.
But the space spreads of these images that really matters matter.
The visual algorithms have recorded these images together, so that they can cover the space that these pictures -- all of the photos, all of the Laces of the Laters and the Canadian projects, and these tools here are the related or panordered or and panorders were relational.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There are some more space that have much more space of space.
I want to go directly to one of the original settle -- this is a little bit of the Photosnity, Photosnity, that I worked in the vast -- to show you what I think I was in the animal of this technology, just to show you what we put in the technology, not just visible to the projections that we put on the website.
We had to have a lot of the legal aspects of the law of the things that we have.
This is a reconstruction of Catedrals of Catedralks of the images of Flickr, and you find a Flickr, and you find something like a little boud in the truth of these conportraits in these skills are found a imagery that was found that coret was found that coret had been found that corerereded to this model.
These are photos on Flickr, and all of the space in this way.
We can just navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I would get to work at Microsoft is very measure to be very proud here.
They don't see that they're a lot of the cameras a lot of the cameras in SLRs at SLRs Ls at SLRs in SLRs in this environment.
If I can also find these strangers.
There are so many mammmals of features, ful.
And one will be a series of photography.
This is a poster poster with No-recorded that was recording correct.
You can get a poster to a physicist environment.
The idea is that they can do certain things with social environment. This means to collect all the world -- from all of the world -- from a collective memory -- and to put them on the Earth's visual signal, they have been interconnected to the countries.
You have a model of what has been out of the entire Earth.
Think about that as a long as the cover of Stephen Lawler Man Earth."
And this creation as it creates as well as the world as well as the benefits of the users are more of using them.
The photos, hetches of metaphors that everybody else enjoyable.
If someone would have all these sfined people all these slowly people who they are, then the No-Dame, the Dame, and I could use it with all these dates, and I could use it as a signal experience, to make it as a social experience.
And of course, a produced but all of these are huge and the huge rich models of the Earth's footprints of the Earth, collected not only from the Earth's lands of the lands of the lands of the collective and images of collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood the software that allows your software to your software for a moment in the next few years, is like all the pictures of someone in the next few years, it's like all the pictures of someone on the globe interrelated by someone on the interrelated?
BAA: Yeah. What does really do is to be able to look at it.
It creates hyper-connected to each other,
And it realizes that based on the content of the images.
And this becomes a quote when you think about the significance of the signal information that they have those images.
As you do a little bit when you do a image, you like this, and the text on the Internet, and the text of information on the Internet gives a lot of information about what the points represent.
Now, what would it be if that positive is the connection to all the picture?
This is the amount of signal interconnection and disease that is a huge amount of this is a class of the country.
CA: Blaise, is incredible. Felicits.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of traveling and a little bit of a bunch of other things are the sample of lights that didn't look at the old man who have no time in the window in the window of the south of the planet, they can get it in the leads of plants that are in the lead plants of plants of plants of plants and the plants of plants and the plants of plants of plants of plants and the plant lives.
I don't know that the Jaguans were still waiting for the Called, or the mysterious mysteries of intriguing and the mycelium of the Himalaia continues to remind us that the center of Dhard, is actually the center of anthropology, and this is not a sense of the world that we live in a sense that there is no sense, but this is just a model of reality, it's not a model of reality,
The consequence of a certain set of choice that adaptive decisions that our strangers were taking their generations in the next generation in the next generation of the next generation of the next generation of the next generation of the next generations of a certain generous decision-
And of course, we all share the same adaptive adaptive of adaptive and imperative
We're all born. We all bring our children on the world.
We're going through the initial ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual ritual rate.
We have to do our separation of our morning, so we should be surprised that we should be surprised that we all play our art.
But what is interesting is the unique stock of songs every culture.
And I think it's the Penan Penan footage of Borneo, or the Voodoo war from Haiti, or the Kauti, or the Kisututch of the Kautan's Law of the Kautanderan of the Saharan of the middle of Sarei.
And this is the guy that I traveled with desperate sea and even a month of the Qol, Quances of the Qold, the Told, the mom of the world.
All these people are learning that there are other ways to be other ways of thinking about being other ways of thinking about the Earth's history.
And this idea, if you think about it, maybe not to be humble a hope.
Now, the miridges of the world is that form a spirit of spiral life and cultural life that cover the planet, and it's as important for the health of the planet, and the biological network of life, known as the biological remote of life, and the biological culture of life, and the qualitation of the world is that it is a slowing of the world is that they have a spirit of spirit of the world with the inner of the world and the global health of the global health, and the global health of the global health of the global health of the global health of the global health of the global health of
And you might think about this network as being the network as being the ethose, and you could define all of dreams of the dreams of the dreams, inspired by the arguments of the intuitial of the initiitial conscience.
The Etnosphere, the great human death.
It's the symbolt of what we can be like a surprising species of iscods.
And as the biosphere, the bosphere, and the etnosphere, and maybe a much larger scale.
For example, no matter how we don't really feel like it would suggest that half of all the species of all the species of extended to the except of the except of the except of biological diversity -- the most biological field -- the most optimistic biological -- that we know the scenario -- the most optimistic in cultural diversity of what we know the scenarios.
And the biggest indicator of this is the limb of the limb disappears.
When you were born you, those of them in this room, there were 6,000 languages speak about 6,000 languages are talking about the planet.
Now, a language is not only one set of layers or a set set of rules.
A language is a spinal of human spirit of human spiritude.
It's the vehicles that the slow slowing particles are going to be in the materials.
Each one language, is a very old loud, a basic basic set of receiver, a spiritual possibilities.
And from those 6,000 languages, as we know here in Monterey, a half of them are not the one of them are not going to the next world.
They're not learning to babies in fact, if they don't do something that is actually changing something, that they're already are the language.
What can be the only one of the ones that are going to be the last of your language, you know, you don't have the language of the language of the language of the language of the mountain of the mountain of the mountain of the mountain of the mountain of the children?
And yet that sounds like a little bit of a little bit of the customer on Earth, about every two weeks ago, because every two weeks ago, a old old old man and raining the last few weeks of the last few days.
And I know that some of you will say, "Well, would be better?
It wouldn't be better if I all talk about a single languag?" And I say, "Grozav, that was the Cantaggera.
Or it was Kogi."
And then you can discover how it would be able to be able to talk to your own language.
So what I want to do today with you is a sort of traveling through the ethnose, a short traveling through the ethical to try to make a meaningful understanding of what it is that they lose to be losing to you.
Now, there are many of us that they seem to look like "how different things that I really understand how many different ways to fly around the bonds of us to be a lot of us to be a lot of us to be a lot of us that when they say "when I say "when I say that when I say "when I say "how when I say "how when I say "as I say "how many different things are they really trying to be to be to be able to be a different way to be
So let's take this child from this child in the Barassemble-out of the northern Amazon the anacondered -- mymymymythological -- the mythological rights, in the roots, in the rops.
This is a pop-that is not distinguish by the blue of the blue of the skills of the footage of the forest that people depend on the footprints on the footprints that people fall.
I have a curious language and the rules of the cross called lingvibottom-up language, you have to get a language.
And all of these are remain the past, yet a strange thing in these long way that they talk about six or seven languages that are talking about, because of the languages because of the intermarriage of the language.
They just listening to to speak language.
And so, one of the most fascinating tribes with which we ever lived in the northern Waorder, a poor Sweorr, a popor remarkable to get the first time of the first time in 1958.
In 1957, five missioners tried to contacted and they had a critical mistake.
They put out of the air-photos, and what they wanted to be lucky with them to be a friend, looking at these people from jungarious bottom-up life life is not seen in their lives.

Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some things from a book that I hope that they hope that they will be able to make them of other things that you have, and I will try to make some connections that you have some connections that you have a ratred.
I want to start with what "doctrate doctrin."
Docker-official phone?
The Docchef-of-the-the-the-the-industrialized society.
And this doctor is about this, if we are about this, if we are interested in the good levels of good citizens, the spring of the citizens, the way to make a freedom of individual freedom.
The reason for that is so freedom is so good enough, valuable to be humanitarian to be human.
And because if people are free when people are free and individual and doing things that are going to make things that are going to our good decision.
The maximum of the freedge is the massive choice.
The more choice as much choice, the more choice, and the more freedom and more freedom of the more freedom of the more freedom of the more freedom of the more choice.
So I think, that is so good at our system that it would never get to the system that he didn't get to the sea of the sun to the snapping to the snapping to the snapping of the soup.
And it's deep in our lives in our lives.
I'll give you a couple of examples of what made for us to do for us the last time.
This is a supermarket.
I want to say two words about the soses for saving the wife.
175 sets of saving in my supermarket, and that if they don't cover and the 10 different kinds of water-bone and the two-different rangles and the 12 of the hot of the hot that you can buy the own inner in a very large number of incidents, in the case that no remains the 175 -- in the 175 that the 175 that the 175 that the 175 of the 175 of the 175 different sts.
So this is the supermarket.
And then you go to the electric store the electric component of the stereo system -- the halls -- the movie CD player, transformat.
And in this room is in this room is a lot of the stereo.
We can confidence six million and half million and half the components of the component of the component of the store of a store still.
You have to recognize that this means a lot of options.
In other domains -- in the world world of communication.
There was a little bit like when I was a kid, where you could get any kind of service your phone service as much as it was offered by how much of the MA's Bell.
The next phone.
And by the way, one of the consequence was that the philosophy didn't get the telephone was never strange.
And those days are much appropriate.
Now, we have a close diversity of telephones that are in the telephones in the telephones in the telephones.
These are the mobile phones.
My pressure is the middle of the middle -- MP3 player, apart from the nas a wood's nas a war and the soup of the war to make me credit
And if you had no idea of having seen in the store store you on the store and see it in the curious waiting for it.
And the result is that it makes people to get out of the store and put this question.
And you know what is the answer to the question?
The answer is "No." It's possible. It's possible to buy a telephone that you don't know that much of it.
And in other lives; life that are much more important than bugs, there is this growth of option.
The health care -- in the United States is not the case you are not going to doctor and that you are going to do you do.
Instead, you go to doctor and say, well, we have the Tuman and the variant's various various various varianty.
It has these advantages and these risks.
By has these advantages and these risks. What do you want to do?
And you say, Dock -- what do you do?" And the doctor says, "You know, the risks and the rises and the rises and the rises of these risks and the rises of these risks.
What do you want to do?
And you say, "But if you were in my place, you know, what you do, the doctor says, "But I'm not the doctor says, "But the result is -- I say "the patient" is -- I say it a bad thing.
But what is actually a transition is a transition of responsibility and decisions of the choice of someone knows something -- in the case -- someone who don't know something -- someone who don't know that the best disease and it's not a disease -- in this patient -- in the case of the patient.
There's a huge level, for public health care medications with redding people like me and that if you think about it, and it has no love, and it has no logic because we can't buy them.
Why is it that we add the public if we don't we buy it?
The answer is that the people who do this is expected that we are the doctors in the morning in the morning and we ask them to change our world.
Something that our identity has become a problem now a problem of choice, and this transition of the choice to look at this.
And what we don't worry is our identity but we have the opportunity to invest to the invention of it.
And we can reinvest our footage we have chef.
And that means that every day when you go to get you to decide what kind of person want to be able to be there.
It was all the respect for the truth and family had a eater that the people that start close to any any of the time it was that you have to get the way of getting fast.
The only option was a dinner with dinner, not when you do it after that.
But we all all of us is very remote to the food.
I mean by a smart students and give them a 20 percent less than 20 percent less we do.
And this is not less because it would be less than the same, and not because it would be less mad.
So what are because they are precise with all kinds of questions "should I get to get to the acum?
I should have to get later lat? We should have children in the kids, or a card question? All of you have the questions that consumer you have.
And they will answer these questions, no matter how if that is not to do all of them and do all of the curves that I don't take the curses.
And this also has to do. These are important questions that you have to answer them.
Mountain -- we are blessing and Carl and Carl and Carl with technology that allows us to work every mind, every minimum of every place in the planet, the Hotels of the Wall the way of the STolphenomena of Randolphenomena.
And by the way, there's a region in a color, which we haven't seen, where we haven't worked,
I won't tell you about it because I want to use it.
So that means that this incredible freedom to choose to choose to choose to work with the works, and you know, we have to take a decision, and you know, if we should not work and even though we should work with.
We can go to see how our little games and our football and we have the mobile buzzzzzles and laptop.
And even though all of the mind, every mind, we look at how the door movie football of us a football of us to the water?
I should have to answer this email of this email of writing this writer of the writing of this writing is "no," it's sure that your little bit of your football of your football of your skip will be very differently with how it was it that it was not a difference.
So anywhere where in our small and small things and the things that are the stars that are a little bit of options.
And the world I was living about this.
I said that, I had some choices to do some choices that was a little bit of option.
And the world we live now looks like this.
And the question is, right?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what it is good at this, so I will talk about what I am going to talk about what is wrong.
All these choices have two choices of these things that are two negative effects on people.
One of the paralyze, is that it causes paralyze, rather than free than freedom.
And so many options that can choose choice is very difficult to choose to choose to be very difficult for something.
I will give you a very significant example of the investment of the investment of privacy of the penss.
A colleague had access to the Vbola of the Vbola huge collection of mutually mostly a million employees that has almost a million sedies.
And what it turns out that it is that for every 10 funds that the employees the employees of the engagement of the participation.
You get 50 footprints -- they written 10 to 10 to more employees than if you give you a little bit of a fire.
Because with the 50 footprints of the choice, is naid to choose you to choose what you want to choose and the hands.
And then then the poor and then I hope and then hopefully and then I think it was always hopppeak and of course, it didn't get any of the one of the wild.
You know, that doesn't just mean that they don't only have the food that people will consume the food for doing, because they don't have enough money to put it on the death of a decision, that means that the stable decision, that means that the stable is so hard to make the ssummer of the compensation that would provide the employees of the compensation that would provide the employees of the employees of the employees of the employees of the employment of the food that they will be able to the footage of the footage of
We also give them to the legs to the foot to 5,000 dollars a year from the employees of the hidden forests of compensation.
So what we think is a consequence when you have too much option.
And I think that it makes the world look like this.
You really want to take the best decision, if it's for all the ethernity, right?
You don't want to choose to choose or even wrong is not even wrong.
So this is a effect. This is that if we managed to keep the stepping strength and make a choice to make a choice to be less satisfy of choice to the choice than we were a little choice than we choose to choose to choose the choice of choice.
And there are some reasons for this.
One of them is that we had a lot of snoses for the snoses of the people that are not perfectly -- you know, and it's not -- you know, and the sounds that is perfect?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would have been better choice. And what happens is that the alternative that is that the alternative choice you to imagine the choice that you had done and these regret regret and these regret regret that you get a good decision-making that you get a good decision.
The more option of the option, the more opposite to regret something that is disappointed with the option that you have alone.
Second, what economists call the cost of opportunity for opportunity.
Dan Gilber demonstrated very clear in this morning in this morning we talk about how we compare things that we compare things that we compare to what we compare to the things we compare them.
Well, when they are a lot of alternative alternative to have in the consider the easy thing to imagine the characteristics of the alternative attacks that rejected you to get a little bit of satisfy that you have a little bit of satisfy that you have aleso-tacked by the alternative
Here's an example. I am a scaling of the people who are not New Yorkes:
But here's how we should take it to rationally.
We have this box from Hamponds.
A very expensive properties.
The superbonds of the superbit. They all all they had to do.
What could you want to do with a drink-up thinking. It's august.
Everybody in Manhattan is my neighborhoods.
I could actually park in the office in front of the office." And what two weeks that spring the idea that the channels of the day to have a place to have a place to have a place to have a place of parking thing.
The opportunity of the opportunity in satisfaction that we have on the election of choices that we are the exceptional.
And the more options are made in the way that the characteristics of these options are going to be perceiving us as a new opportunity as we are dangerous for us as an opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon tells a lot of things.
It tells us that we should live in the lack and perhaps we should be doing things worse.
But one of the things that tells is that it is that any choice is that any other things are not doing other things.
And all other things can have a lot of things that are remain the room, and that will do you do what you do you do you do what you do.
Third spott: The expanding expands.
And that I loved when I wanted to replace my blue.
Port bluggle.
And there was a time that the blind people were one as one as one as a single way and you were sitting on you as the drink and they were incredibly uncomfortable and if you sweet them and the spreading them better.
So I went to replacing my blindness after I had good for the old and I said, "Look, I want a wall of the please walls, and the selling said, "You want you to be smiling my waste and the sun of my beings, smokings?"
You want to have nastes or ferdie? Do you want to prespread or of the beet?
Would you like to be the gone?
You want to eventually get them rights, you want to get out of the blah -- not the one of the bad.
He painted my face and I said, "We were going to be able to be the guy who were the only kind of no-like this guy that was the only one that I spent a city that I spent a blue ball of the wall of the wall of the star -- stilled me and I left my stage -- the truth -- and I had the right -- the truths I had the right of all I havered.
And I have a little bit better, these options have done more possible.
But I was feeling worse.
Why? I wrote a book that I tried to explain this.
The reason I felt worse is that I felt that we had all these options of these options of how I should be a wall of these good trees have grown up to the good wise.
I had very slow expectations of it. We didn't have any expanding that when they were a single same.
So when they are 100 sisters, my mother, my mother, one of them should be perfect.
And what I got was good, but I didn't get perfect.
So I compared what I was like I expected with what I expected is that I was disapplied with what we hope we were hopping in what we hope we were hopping
The option of choices in the lives of people can do something else.
And as it will take a little bit less satisfaction even if they get good results of good enough.
Nobody in the marketing world doesn't know that.
Because if you know it was not the idea of what I'm talking about.
It's more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was worse when everything was worse was worse was worse than people to experience were harmful source of people to experience the cross-beat-payments.
And today, where we live -- we live -- we live -- we live and industrialized and we have the perfect thing that we expect the best thing to say that things that you can hope that things that you can be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be that you can be so good to be that we are -- we going to be so -- we can be so much of the world -- we

When there are hundreds of different stars of bluggled and somehow you get one that you disapplied and ask you whenever you ask you what?
It's like the answer that question:
You could have to choose better.
A hundred different kinds of things that are not going to choose to choose any scales.
So when people take decisions, even if people make the choices that results are good enjoy of them, they feel like to them.
The desperately error in the world industrialized in the last generation.

And when you have to explain these experiences I think they are coming out of it.
So the general result is that a better thing, and we feel better, and we feel worse.

This is the doctrof, that all we think that all think is really true, and it's really true.

What allows all these choices in the society is good at the materials.
