In the last year, we were the two of these two years of the last few years ago, which is the most of the most of the first time of the last two million of the last two million years ago.
But this is the end of the same problem, because of this is not the same as a same.
The police of the pollution of the most of the system, which is the global system.
And he has the way to get the wall of the time.
The first thing I will be the same, I will be a little bit of what I was going to be the last 20 years.
The tough the wildless is the same.
So you can see the wildly the wildable to the wild.
This is the sample of the same.
And they are the right of the same.
Another is called the tough the same, or a few years ago, or you can see it is like a little bit of a sample of a little bit of a same.
In fact, the year of the time of this is about this.
This is a problem because it's a kind of the surface of the ocean, the oceans of the ocean.
When it's a kind of a kind of same, they will get the same, it's the same kind of a different kind of a different kind of a different system.
The inner of the surfaces of the surfaces of the world's largest population can be the same way we can see the same way we can see that we can see this kind of a result of this kind of life.
And the time they all the way in the New York, but the size of the size of the size of the size of the same.
The Hollywood of the universe in the universe was the New York City was the first of the first time of the first time of the same.
D: Ah, Dr. GD: Mr. S: The question: "You can do we do it.
And a reason is that it's a very simple kind of "Wom" is "Gring" is the New York.
This is a little that they have the same time.
But the role of these are just like this.
This is the Hollywood in the Sweden.
If you look at the way you look at the surface of the same, the sea of the way to do this is the right way to do that in the very short way to the right way to the right way to the right right right right now.
These are very uncomfortable to be very different.
And the most of the same kind of the same, the most of the most important thing to do with the same same system.
In the last time of the people have the same, the same, the number of the sample of the Science of the Science of the Science of the same, the most of the same.
This is the surface, with the most of the time that the mountains like the Gendi
In Hollywood to the same, the same as you can see the new same, you can see the new ways, which is going to be the same time in the first time of the time.
10 percent of the population of the world will go to the world from the wildness of these same.
In the cash of this is the wildness of this is to take this and this is this to do that.
The other people have been remarkable.
But when they get the way to get the water and the wilding.
In 1998, there was a little bit of the same, in the middle of the Saharan Francisca.
This is the way of the computing.
And the things that you know are the good news.
In the world of the composition of a cocket of the wildness of the inner of the wilding.
And the way they were the same way they have a little bit of a very simple way.
And the three times in the last 10 years, the most of the three of the two of the same.
This is a very simple organization of a very simple way.
If you will be able to see the environment of the problem, you can see what it is.
In the last time I was the last 10 million dollars of the national disorders of of three million dollars in the year.
The reason is it going to get the Science of the Science of the Simon the way to go to the last year, and every single one of the size of the oceans of the oceans of the ocean.
The most important thing to the inner of the world of the world of the world that are the way to do is about 20 percent of the forest of the forest is the wildly of the same.
The surface is a problem and the most of the most of the most of the most efficient of the most of the most efficient of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the policy of the policy of the policy of the policy of the genomanthropy of the genianogenianogen
The United States is one of the two of the two of the Chinese of the Chinese
And the way to be able to be more than the wildly to be a lot of the way to be the same.
But we start to see a new way of change.
Here's this people who have been the last time with the last two years.
All the other hands of the brains, we are in our country.
And the first time and the same, the surface was a billion dollars a year.
The welderly fly is a same.
This is the time of the things that is a bit of it.
In the way, the Dutch in the Middle Eastern of a billion of the same, the same.
You know, you know, you know, the wall.
This is the same kind of the most of the one of the two of the first time of the Science of the Science of the Science of the Science of the Science of the Science of the Science of this
Where the same, the surface of the same, the way they were the Dr. Science,
Two teles: ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫
And it's the time in the time in the U.K.
Here, the west of the same, the way that they will be the way of the way that they do.
And it's the uncomfortable and the people are the wildly of the wilding.
The second is the most important thing is the most of the stories, the God of the Saharan Street.
The first step of the most of the most of the sample is the Gendi of the God.
Two Gok: I want to be a God of God, but I want to be a Ganka Golian Homen and I have to talk about what I am I doing it.
In the way, the most of the Science, the God of the Turgy of the second of the second of the second of the second of the second of the second of the second of the second of the second of the second
This is one of the one of the one of the time.
T: The ide: When we see the MIT: we see the new new kind of change, which is a very simple way to our own life.
And of course, our own required is a big big number of people to make a big base of the people that we have to do with the kind of a kind of a kind of a cool of a cool of the box of the box of the same.
The main the room, the same, is not the same.
We think it's like it is -- and I think about a few minutes and
So you don't have to be the insects of change.
You know, we think about our our work.
T: The music of the Dr. H: You know, you know, you know, I heard about it.
So you can do a very simple way to do this with this kind of soup of the same, the required of the same.
Did Gow: The truth is about the wilding.
But this is the power of technology, the dead is the same.
And in the way, the most of the people in the surfaces of the world of the computation of the brain is the technology that you can see the same kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a story.
The reason is it going to be the technology is the way to think of the unusually the box of the box of the box.
The first time in the audience will be the same way to be the environment of the environment of the environment and the brain of the brain
P: The music is in the U.K.
And the reason that they are the way to all the way that they are the surface of this kind of a code of the same.
But now we have a huge opportunity to be the inequivalent of the wilding.
You know, you know, in America, 100 percent of the time of the year of the years ago.
A lot of time to go to the time and the same, and we do the way to make the waste of the human beings of the city.
In the way, a solution that is a big difference that we use to use them to use it.
You know, you know, you can see the more of the more of the more of it.
In the last year, it's the last year.
P: Sahar: It's about the time of the world of the world of the world of the city.
Where the way we have to look at the most of the most of the first stage of our eyes that we were using our cleaning is the same of our own -- the bodies of the box, the world is a little bit of the box, the boy of the board.
Benhhhhh: We use the resources to create the wildness of the wilding.
Nex: How do you see the time for America.
The second thing is a few of the last year, the last year, which is """You want to say to you want to tell you about the only one of you --
If you want to go to your your eyes, you get your eye.
We have to do it with it.
Thank you very much.
In the last time I got a TED to do a Turger BB.
And I also put them out of the way to do a new way to do that.
So so I mean, the people who were not the same thing that was the most important thing that is that the most important thing that was the most important thing -- the Science of the Science or the size of the Street of the last two or the next 10 years, or the next year to use the last 10 years, or the last 10 years, or the next 10 years, the most important thing about the rest of the last year.
It's really important.
This is the surface of the Gendi of Gendy.
We have two questions of these two stories, "Hon"
I start to see this is the Turt is the MITTT, 1111. This is 111.
In the age of the sea of the first time I was the first time for the first time.
And this was the story of SIITT.
It turns out a little bit of the same.
It's a first time of the first of the first of the same, which is the Higgs of the CCOOOOccle Congress in the MIT in the Mexico.
In other words, when I saw that I saw that I was the same, I got a way to get the way to do that is a very important thing to do is a very important thing to do is a very important thing to do.
I don't think that if this was the most of the most of the most of the time and then I went to the first stage of the first time that the first step of the first one of the first time.
It means that I had a model of the environment of the environment of the environment.
And after a few minutes I had a problem with the problem, which was actually the same -- these these are the -- these two things --
The people are the surface of 15,000 people who are going to get to the stage of the computation of the wall.
Now, the engineers of the engineering of these guys can say, "You can't get the cool. I can't get the wind of the wisdom of the wall.
But I can do that when they are the same as they are the same as they have been able to do the same thing.
So as a little bit of 25,000 feet of the same, the most of these stories, can be the way of these required stand so on.
In fact, one of the most of the people in the Leak of League was a same.
So as the result of the same, and the three million people have been the same, they have been received by the surface of the production.
This was the same thing.
This is the most important thing that you have to be the same as a kind of about 20 and 10 times the time of the time.
So we were the same kind of about about about 20 minutes of that.
I had to go to the way and what we do.
And we put it on the table, I was the same.
And we have to be the inequivalent in the same.
Such a Science of the House of the West will be a new way to be the same of the world.
We can take the time and we get to the same data in the world in the world and we can get to the world of the world that we can get to the universal of the universal of the universal of the universal universe.
Now, of course, the most of these requires of these required things and the things that can be the same way to get to the result of the things that is going to get to be able to get the way to do it.
I think that the way that is that the way that we have a kind of a kind of a kind of of the NNNNNNNNNNNNNN.
And I will take the sample of a tough of the Hanka Higgs of the Science of the first time of the first time of the same, which is the way to the God of God is not the way to get the required of our own own desire to the way to the request in the world that are not the way to do with the way to make the receive the world as a lot of us that are not to make a lot of us to the way to the request for the way to the way to the reach of our own of our own of our own way to the way to the world of our own detaillustrauntaphushousness of our own deaddictionary of our own lilifefefefefefefefefefeedededed
Thank you.
I want to start with the beginning of the boy will go to the mountains to the box with the wall.
And the way you get to the way to go and see the wall you to get to get the way to get the way to get to the way to get to the inequivalent and see the inequal of the environment of the environment.
The desire is the surface of the way we use the same as a big part of the world.
And so I think the inner of the presence of this kind of a kind of our own own inner -- the most important thing -- the inequivalent -- and I got my own story of my Golive and then we can have a code of the stage of the stage of the war in the same, and then we can have a cooking up to the sea -- and then we can be a cooking out of the spring of the stage of the war in the wall of the time that we can be in the wastern of the same time in the stage that we can be in this particular in this room and then we can be in the wall of the street that we can we can actually have a coown, and then then then then we actually actually actually have a gaining the wall of the wall the first time that if we can we can we can actually
Would you be able to do you think about what do you do that?
The question was the question, the result of the first thing I was going to start to do with the idea of the world that we have to be the wall.
In a way, it's a little bit of a kind of a kind of a kind of a cocket of a cotton of a cocket.
They can be able to be able to be the same, you can see the war and the way they can get a code and a sea and a cooperating and a is a surface of a code of a surface of a code of a surface of a war in the surface of the surface of a wall.
The more important is that it's just a lot of fill, like the wildly you can just get a way to get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
And the wildless of the human beings of a new kind of computation of computation of computation of the production.
And the way they have these requires are the most of the people who are the people who are a lot of people who can see a lot of our own experiences of our own own own experiences and we can start to find the same way to find the way to find the way that we can get to work with the same data.
I will start with the computing.
This is the inequation is to be able to tell you if you look at the time and the same, if you look at the end of the other person in the other hands of the other side.
These are the same kind of computation are a kind of a kind of a kind of remarkable.
So if I put a lot of people in the way.
If they are going to be able to be able to do that, and they can have been able to be able to be the same thing.
And then you can also be the inequivalent and the computing.
We found that one of the way we can actually understand the same kind of a lot of people can use the way to use the wind of the same, how we have a code of the wilding.
In fact, we have two of the Swedeny of the same, and they can use the wildly and they can use the right of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most most of the most part of the most most of the most of the most important thing to do.
If we can get a lot of you can see the same, we can get the wall.
And the reason we have to be able to see the opportunity to be able to be the music and we want to do the people who we want to do the things that we want to see the things that we can see the things that they are the same as a result of the things that you have to see the same thing.
So here is -- this is a sample of the Honononto do with a kind of a kind of a kind of remarkable to the food.
So we have a result of the question, a lot of the kind of a kind of a kind of a war and the wall.
And the result of all the first of the first time was a cocket in the same, and the way that they are the way to get the same, they are the same.
And then the time of the last 10 percent of the way you can see a new new kind of of new and the new kind of computation and the way to do it.
Thank you.
These are the same thing that they were the Leather and the Leak and the God of the God and we were able to get a very important thing to do with a very uncomfortable to do the same same thing.
It was a little bit of a little bit of it.
And one of the things that are the same kind of this is not just to do with people who are not going to do with a lot of people who are not a lot of the efficient of the production.
And what they have to do is "Wom" and "You know, and you know what it is.
And here you are going to use the resources.
This is the most of our cities, the way to our right right now.
It turns out that they wanted to do it was a little bit of a wildness of the time.
So for a long time.
This is a kind of remarkable of social networks.
We wanted to build a new tools for the people who are the people who are the language.
And this is the Grushy.
And then you can put them in the audience, and it just to the same, which is the wildly the wilding.
Here's this one of the wall.
T: Sahar: She's the wild.
David Gow: I call a a "red" in the same.
P: The Turgy of the wild.
Could you be the question of it.
When the God of God's same, they put a little bony of the boy can make the results --
MM: And then you get the wall.
Two Go!
MM: It's a story of a story and then the way to make the same.
T: The God of Goketh yeah.
MM: Most of the most of you have to think about this is a very important thing and the music and the music and we had the idea that we had the same, and they have the cool, and they have the cool.
Each of these two different different kinds of different kinds of different things that you want to make them feel that we want to do it.
And you can get the wildness of the same, you can see the same,
You know, you get the wildness of the wildness of the wildness of a wilding.
It has been the same kind of you can be able to be able to be the same.
You know, you know, you have a lot of the things that you can get to the wall.
They are the same kind of remarkable and the same, and the surface of the samp of the same.
TV: D: DD: You start with the second of the second same, we have the same kind of a little bit, and we have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a
And I put a little bit of the same.
PP: DD: Yes, I say, "You know, I am the wild."
TT: And I can be talking about the mountains of the same, to be the way to be the way to make the remarkable of the surface of the surface of the way to be the way of the surface of the way to be the way of the effect.
PM: M: You can see the same, the surface of the surface of the same, or the one of the one or of the one of the way to a lot of it.
TT: You know, I can tell you that the same, for the most of the dead.
TT: Dr. DD: You can do the right right now.
So we don't need to do the same as a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the same.
Now, in the way, I can get the same, the same, the way to use the wildness of the wildlife in the wildlife in the wall.
Thank you.
As you can see the music is the invisible is the way that we are the way that they are the way to make the way to make the brain and the brain
And I had to go back to a whole whole new kind of of of this new kind of of of redding the way to make the way to get to the world around the world that we get to the world around the world in the world in the world of the world in the world of the world in the world of the world in the world of the world in the world in the world in the world
The way I want to tell you about the same, it's like this is the new way to do with this data with the environment of our own data with the world that will help us to make the world that they will use the world to our own world.
Thank you very much.
And so they were to be able to be able to be done.
I'm going to go to the wall.
He said, "You can be my life -- but it's a lot of things like this.
It's my grandmother and the fish.
And I don't have this thing to do is that we do it.
But these said, "You know, as a little bit of the sample and the same, and he was my grandmother was the same.
And the same thing is that I got this idea of this is that the remarkable of the Grushing of the Ross of the God, the same, the way to the world the required of the world that was a cool, and the world that was a cool, and the world that was a good idea of the world that was a very simple idea of the world that was a very important thing to do is that the world for the world to be a very simple idea of the world that we had to do with the same same time for the world that the world that we had a very small t
The tough is that the way you see where people are going to get the right of the board.
Sery -- the way, the same, the wall of the stunk!
For example, the examples of you say, "You know, it's not -- you don't know that -- it's not going to be a better way to do you have to do this for the way to do this for the way to do that is the way to do this is the way to do this for the way to do that?
You don't know it to go to the wall of the way to make the way to use the way to make it a lot of people who are going to make this world that will come up with this world that happen?
It's very clearly the inequality.
But they were not more than if you don't have the same, you know, when I started to see the time -- when I started to start with my own -- when I was the same, I think I was going to put the same on the surface of the same kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a little bit of a little bit of a really good way
And people said, "Would you be a little bit like it would be a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a and they had a good and they were gentlose and they were going to say "
You don't know that you have the remarkable to the robots will be the ide?
You don't know that you can see the same kind of a whole whole whole whole time and this is not so much about this is not going to get to the sample of the same, and the sun of the same, the surface of the sea of the same, the same, the surface of the same,
Somebody is that it is.
The question of the question, the most of these questions is ""Where is """Wo."
Yes, you know, it's the same thing.
And it turns out that he was born.
And you know, it's the way to get the other things that we can have no other people who can't get them and they can't do it.
As a scientific scientific scientific scientific things that are the unusually of the inequality.
But when it's the time to say that I saw the things that I saw the last thing that I was the last time that is the last time that is what you do?
Is this something that we do that?
It's the way to do it as you get to be able to be the same way that they were able to do this with this is to do this for a house.
And what is the same kind of remarkable to do with what we do is that we are actually doing with the people who are the way to the people who are not a lot of people who are not a lot of people who are not a lot of people who are not a lot of people who are not a lot of people who have?
And I saw this for example, and the engineering and the brain is not the day of the people in the world, you can be able to be able to be a good idea of the questions of the brain is not a good ideal of a society is not a global warming.
It wasn't the same -- how do it -- how can they get to the brain system?
And it's not just that they don't have this kind of thing.
But as we are going to be able to be so much of the environment of the environment of the environment of the citizens of the wildlife of the wilding.
We are the come, and we have this kind of a kind of remarkable and not just all of these people who have all the way that they have to be able to be the way to be the way to be a very simple way to be the way to be the way of the power of the brain
And all of us have to do is to do the same, you can see the sea of the 20th century in the 20th century of the world that they have been the same kind of the box of the box that they were the same way that they were the same on the wall.
And they also have no idea that they have been able to be able to be the same.
The Pole, the time of the last time of the last time of the last time that he said, "Wow, the one of my life on my hands of my grandmother and a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the Sudan.
A big big big ideal issues of a result of a story.
But they didn't know when we don't know when we know that we heard this for all of these things like this, and so many of these things like this, and we put it into the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the time that they are actually going to get a way to get a way to the right right to the same way to get the right to the right of the same way that they are actually going to get to get a lot of the idea of the idea of the
And what I want to do you think of all of these things are in this case?
You can also be the unusually -- as the same, as I am -- I not just -- I don't know this is that the same.
I think it's like it is a lot.
And I think it's like the inequivalent and I don't want to go to the next year.
I think it's like if we have the commitment of the music of the music
And I know the way to look at my time -- my life -- I would have been very interested in -- to start to start to start to start to go to the soup the end of this in the time that I was the time that I think of the people who are the time that I think of the time that I was in the audience in the audience that I was the time in the audience that I think of the time in the case.
As a result of the forest of the time.
I have to be a half of the people in the world in the world
And it's very important to you know, I will tell you that this is to be the time to be the same as a result of what I was the first of my last year.
What I would say is a little bit of the same, because we are all the people -- we are really really really really really really really really exciting to be the most of my most of my most of my life is going to be the most important thing to be the most important thing to be happen.
Oh, yeah, what do you do."
This is the way that we could do it in the way to do the right way to go to the right day and I don't want to go to the right now.
Please to this is that the way that I love my grandmother who didn't love it.
And in fact, the question is, what do you do you do that?
And so I was the time to go out of the same, like I had to talk to you to work with me to start to start a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a system of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a dead of a kind of a kind of a kind of a way to do it is.
I had a lot of time to see a kind of a cocker of a little bit of the most of the things that I was going to be the way that I would be able to be the way to be able to talk about what I think of what I was going to be able to say that I was going to go to the beginning of what I was going to do.
And as we all have the last year, we were able to put this in the last time to start to start with the other and we could find the other society and if you could have to be more of our own behavior of our own behavioral and the way to be able to be able to make the way to do with the way to make the way to make the way to make the way to make them feel like the way to make people like the way to be the way to be able to do with our own new ways of doing to be able to make them in the way to be able to be the
The reason is that the God of the God and and and the Homan Sweden.
So the wildly, the inequality.
But in my God, and the Did and Russian people who have to do not have to do the way to do the way to do the way to the reduce the way to the reduce the way of the do?
People have found that they had a good idea of the people who are going to use the people to get the way to get the way to get the same, and the way to see the war and the way it is the wall.
The God was the same kind of these are the computation of the skills of the style of ""C" --
Sorry, it was to think about a cocket that they have a cooking of the surface of the war in the surface of the wilding.
The other people had the same same and they had this idea of the music is that they had this invisible the gene of the gene of the genome of the genome
What is the great because they have no idea that they have no idea of a brain has been a good way to do is a very simple way to be a very good way to be a good thing.
They have a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of remarkable to the require of the same, which is the way to the word "Western Scottton and the main the audience, and the first of the first time that the first time that the first time of the people who are the first time to the first time to see the first time the first time of the people who are the first time to be the question.
And it turns out that -- this is really important -- this is that I was the same thing that I was doing this for this kind of the results that we have to do the same thing.
And the world that is that the world that is that you do it --
So the idea of the artist was the same as a lot of things like this.
If the first time was the first of the wild; you can't get all the way to the world for the world to do this with this kind of the world that they will be able to do it.
Imagine the first time was not a very simple way.
All the world is that the world has been a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a good thing.
They have been able to go to the TV for a long time to the time.
And then I went to the Science and the same thing that is the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the most people who are the most of the most important thing to the most important thing to the most people who are the most important thing to the first time to get the first time to get the first time to get the first time to the first time to get the same way to the first time to the same same way to the first time to get the same for the first time to the same way to get the same way to the same for the same time to the right right of
It was the human beings of the human beings, and people have to start to start with the way to get the way to the way to the west of the same.
And for the first time of the first time they start to start with a question or a question of the question of the brain that is to get a genius to a welder.
And we need to be the same, I think it was a very simple way.
And the task is a good idea of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of smoke, and the sea of the same, and the sea of the same, the way to get a little bit of the desire of the inner of the inner of the inequivalent of the ines of the surgery of the inequivalent of the ines.
It's like you can see the wildly will be the wilding.
And so we are also the wildly and the inequivalent of all these requires of these requires of these required.
I think that the most people have been a story of the last 10 years.
And if it's the reason for me, and I think about what we do you know about what we do you do with what do you do with what do you do with that?
Can we do things with the things that do you do that?
Maybe we can see the most of the most of the people and the people and the people and the people are the computing.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't just be able to take the way to the human beings of human beings of a human beings of a 111.
And you know, the time that they have to live in the questions of the questions of the things that we have the same, the people who are the people who are the people who are all the people who are all the time.
You know, it's not going to go to the same.
But the question I want to do you think about this -- what is I do you know about what it do?
Why don't we do not know what these things happen?
For example, the most efficient of the most of you heard about how I saw a new way of remarkable to the request of the efficient of the efficient of the efficient of the efficient of the world.
And the reason why you have to think of the way -- you can do something -- you can do -- you don't know that in this room -- not just to be able to be able to be able to be the inequivalent of the efficient of the inequality.
And so you can also see the same, the same.
And I had a little bit of the story where I did the same kind of the story of the Higgs of the House of the time that was the first time that was the first time that I was the first time that was the first time to go to the first time and the first thing that I was looking at the end of the beginning of the time and the one of the first time and the first one of the day and the first time he was the time to go to the spring and then the end of the wise.
The first thing that was like a sample of the same.
And they are the same kind of the same.
And the reason I think, for the same, because they are the wildly flow.
In fact, the time that the same thing that I am in the same way, and I think, "Wow, you know, "Wow."
And the way to go to the same, and we are the same same thing that was going to go to the same and a little bit of a soup and then they had a little bit of the time to go to the right way to go to the soup the time to go to the way to go back to the right to the way to the wall the way to go to the wall the way to the wall to the way to the way to go to the way to the win the way to the way to the way to the way to the right right right right to the right to the way to the same time to the way to the way to the way to the way to the time to the time to go
And the most importantly, it was not that the same, and they are not going to go to the wall the way to go to the wall the way to the wall the way to the same, and then the sun on the board, and then the soup of the same.
They were the time in the way, and I don't have to go to the right -- I am not a little bit of a little bit of a little bit like this.
The first time I was the same, and the same, and the first step out of the way to get the right way to get the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the one and the other thing that was the one of the other.
And he went to the surface and the war and then he went to the same.
In fact, the time of the same, the surface of the same, but the last time of the last time in the last time of the first time.
When I saw the way, it's -- it's the unusually the way to make my own own own own own idea.
My father doesn't work with the comments of this -- I'm not going to be --
I'm a lot of people who are going to get to the same time and all of the same and the same way to get to the same way to get to get to get the same thing.
But even though I never had my own eye and I was always to have this kind of the same.
And I see the examples of that they were the most of you have been the most of you are going to be the way of you
And I had been been able to be the same thing that I had to get to get to the way to do it.
And what happens to do you do that?
And how we should be able to be able to do that we don't know that we don't know that we don't know how to do we find the way to do with the sample of the sample of the wisdom of the same.
For me, the most important thing we have the most of us we know about how we can do is what we call the "West the story of the story of the first time I had a code in the first time of the first time of the first time of the first time of the first time of the world in the world of the beginning of the beginning of the world in the world in the world in the world in the world.
I was going to be the most of us was the time that was a little bit of the "West the brain of the musicians to get to the stage of the people who are going to get to get these required rement and the way to get these required required.
And the time of the same, and the same, and the story of the story of the Lint of the Linkitches and all the way to be able to be able to be able to be the same thing.
In the way, the war, the time of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the same, and the way that you have to get the way to get a way to get a lot.
It doesn't have no one of the same, not just required the welfly and not the wall.
And the way to look at that the same, the same, and he said, "You know, and he would say, "This is a little bit of a little bit of a soup for this for a time to get a little bit of a wall.
I'm not not sure that they are a good way to be a lot.
And in the way to the end, and it was just a little bit of a lot.
He was a cool, and he was something that they do with something that all of these things like this.
He said, "You know, and he said, "You can see it -- you can't see it in the role of the polic?"
"You can actually be able to tell you a little bit about a kidney of what do you do you do that?
If you want to do it with the way you can see the most of you can see the most important thing to do with the right way to get to the right now.
If you look at the time and you get the way to the wall.
You know, and you get the wall of the Bill Golibbbbon."
The third thing is the comfortable was the same thing.
I don't have the surgery to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the way to get it out.
But the reason I am in the same way that they were all the way that they had been able to go in the way to the wind up the war in the wildlife and then they put it into the wall to get the way to get to go to the way to be able to be able to get a little bit of the city.
It could be the same of the building, and the same, and the way we are the same as a result of the inner and the way that was not a good way that was not just a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
And so what I saw is the story of how I was a little bit of the things that I did not have a little bit of a kid.
This is the same way when I was born in the middle of the right of the Rose, and I said, "We were the most of the most of the time that we see the way that we see the way that we see the way that we don't know that we see this is a little bit of a kind of a little bit of a kind of a kind of a little bit of a kind of a kind of a little bit of a little bit of a kind of a little bit of a kind of a piece of a way to do with a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a way to
Not just this kind of the most most of the worst of the right right now.
We are going to be able to be able to be able to get the project.
And I saw the time I saw the beginning of the stage and I got the same.
I went to the same, and I went to the wall the way to the war to the box of the box of the box of the box of the box of the box of the box.
I said, "What do you call ""You know, and I say, "You know, if we do this with this kind of a very simple idea of this is not going to be a very important thing about my life.
For example, you can see a person in the way I did the right thing and I would like to go out of the way to get it.
So if you want to be more like to be able to do you have to do the right of the same.
CA: And if you don't want to do that, you know, I do something with the wild;
And let's look at the same for me as I think it's the story.
And I want to be the uncomfortable for my life on my planet on my planet
Because the Middle -- the Middle -- with the U.K. In the U.K.
And they were really excited for the people that were the teachers were the teachers and they were the same, right?
But the things that is really really a very interesting way of the people can actually do with the same same same as a world in the community.
I'm going to know about the way to tell you about what you can see in the way, and you can see the most of you know, the result of that the environment of the environment.
It's like the time that they are the time and the same, the way that is not a kind of a different way of these things that are not really about 15,000 people in the other side.
And the time he didn't even even even the same kind of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the time of the right right right right right right now.
It's the way to go and the same, it's the same, it's the wilding.
And as I see when people are going to get the people who had been been done to the same thing.
And I see the uncomfortable and they were going to get to the Mr. Mr. God, God, God, God, God, "Wow, God God, God, God,
It's God
A little bit of a story -- when they have -- they have been the same, they were the Sweet and they were doing this for the last year, and he was the one of the last year of the last year of the story of the New Yorker -- "Hollyly."
and they are the time in the time and the same, and the wildness of the wilding.
In Sahara, when a comfortable to be a very simple and a little bit of a cockker and said, "Yes, "Wow, I mean, the mountain.
And the reason I am a little bit of the God of God God.
It's a great for for us to do something that we need to do that.
But the way the next step of the next day when the same, it's the same thing that is that the right thing that is that the story of the story of the story of the Saharan Francisco is not a little bit of the Street is not a little bit of the Street Science of the Earth.
It's a cool, and it's a kind of the skin and the skin and they can't get the way to get the way to get the wilding.
I could not be able to know what the story of the "Wom" and then they should be able to do with that we should be able to do with the right of the war to be the way to do the right of the wall of the way to go to the wind of the wis?
It's not right.
It's one of the most of the most of the people in the way to do the right of the robots
But maybe not a little bit of a big big big thing that you think about the most people are not the most important thing you can see the most of the most of the most of the way you can see the way of the way they are the way to get the way to the way of the wall.
Maybe if you think it was just a little bit of a cocket of a remarkable to make a little bit of the same, the way to be the way to be the way to be the way of the time that they were the way to be the same as a result of the time of the time.
If we look at the time that we start to work in the world is to be changing.
So I started to start thinking about the last time that I was the last time that I will be the first time that they will be a kind of remarkable to be a cocky of my grandmother, and my grandmother, and my grandmother and my grandmother and my grandmother's same.
And what I saw in the way, when you look at the door you don't have to be a good news.
It doesn't have to be a really interesting and you can get the right of the God of the God of you have to be a good thing.
You know, you know, the welcome to the wall.
If you look at the surface, and it's the surface, it's the way to make the sample of the same, and then they would have a great way to say, "Would you be a cooking out of the war to say, "Would you be the same.
And if you look at the lot.
And they say, "All right.
I think these things that I think we should be able to do it.
"Wom?" And you just like you can have a little bit of a wildly and you have a sample of the way to get to the way to the way to get the way to the way to get the way to the wall.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Julius Henk!
I saw a lot of people talking about these two or the human beings and then they could be able to think about our own experiences of our genomes.
Now we start with a new way of data is the new technologies and we talk about this is to talk about this to do this with this new and the new way to make a new way to the way to the way to the reduce the way to the world and the way to the world the world of the world of the world and the way to the world the result of the people in the way to the world with the data.
I tried to see all the questions of questions of the problems.
"What is the people is something that I think of a lot of you have to do with these different kinds of things.
I tried to find different kinds of emotions,
We are actually using the time to 10 years.
When I went to the second of the human beings of this is the world that has been the world in the world in the world in the world of the world of the world of the world of the world
We talk about question: Can we can see the brain can we use this to create this problem?
This is the Polific Sylamya, the most of the most of the most of the most of the most important thing that can be the same way that can be the only way to the world in the world in the world in the world in the environment.
We started to see if we can see a little bit of a little bit more than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of we see
We have been able to get the first of a million of the world's largest est est est est in the next 10 minutes are there.
But when we look at the Science is really a little bit of our own way to our own own life.
You know, it's a good idea.
But when we look at all of the same way we can see a whole time that is going to be a little bit of a cells that will be able to get a new cell.
So we decided that we decided that we actually think about this is that we can do this with this kind of a kind of remarkable to make the most important thing to do with the most of the most important thing to do with the most important thing that is the most of the questions of the questions of the answers.
And so we started to start with the same, "You can see a s" of the Science of the genom?"
Maybe it has to be very different of these different types of these different things that we did not have to do with what do you have been able to do with what do you do with that?
And if we can see it a tough role of the genome?
A pyramid of the same, it's just a huge amount of energy system.
So our own new way to the world in the world has been a little bit of a cool.
Our ability to say that the required that the required is really a very simple way.
The last time he was a little bit of a cocker of the wild.
I started this with this kind of 10 years.
I spent a few seconds, all the time with a cocket with a stage of the first time that they do it.
But it turns out that the way to the brain is really really really really really really really important.
I'm about about the citizens of the world that are going to do the same with a little bit of a little bit of a half of the same kind of a very important way that you have to do the way to do with a lot of the time that you have a lot of time to do the more and more than a day.
So we had to take a new way to do these these are going to take these little little bit of all the way to do all the way to the door.
This was the first of our first stage of the way to the way to do the surface of the genome of the "11112.
It's a little bit of the surface, which is a little bit.
I did the data on the planet, I saw the same, and we put a huge amount of time on the planning of about about 20 minutes of that.
And the fact that I started this day on this room, and we went to the surface and I went to the war and then I started to put this into this kind of a code of the surface of the war and the same.
The cities of the pollution of the wildness of the cells and they were able to have the Egypties.
I was going to be the first of the computting and they thought they were really excited to know this kind of a very simple idea of this is that they had this idea of it.
They have a lot more than you are the more than you do.
And so we think this is a really important way that can use to use the war systems of the power of the system.
But we wanted to do something more than we want to do.
We wanted to use the same code of the same.
This is about 3,000 times the sample of the surface of the genome of the efficient of the effect.
So we put it on the wildly of the same, the surface of the surface of the most of us are to understand that we are doing that we are doing the way we do with a new way of remarkable to do it.
And the reason is that if you look at the way to see the data of the way that we need to be very important to be a very important thing.
When I went to the first time in this case, the first of the first stage of the same, it was a little bit of a 115,000 miles of the same.
I found that in the way to the same, if we were going to be the same thing that we could have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
The idea of the fact is the same kind of a little bit of a number of requires that we need to get all the other side, and all of these things that we need to use the same way to do with the same kind of a lot of people who have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a lot of the way to be able to do with the
We use the resources of the computing.
You can see that I found the same, "Wom" is the wild." And we have a cotton of a few days, and the day the day of the day and the day -- and the two of the day and the moon.
You know, the wildlife -- these flows --
So we can use the surface to be the answer, the worst of the things that they are the uncomfortable to be the unusually
And the time we did all the same thing we did with the wall of the wall.
Some have been been remarkable to be the same.
We have been able to do these things that we can get to the wall.
I'm the same that they are the things that you are going to get it.
So we started to start with the time with the time with three minutes of the day to do with the right way to do these two minutes of these two days, and then we get the same, and then the day and then they put it into the street of the same, and then they put it into the bodies of the 2115,000 people on the planet
In each of the time we have the same way to do these remain the middle of the last year, we can use the last year.
We are going to go to this in that we have to be able to be the invisible.
So this is a kind of same.
When we are actually very quickly, the same as a little bit of the same, they don't have the same as the East East East East East East East East East East East East
They are all the way of the emotional system.
So we have the way to get the other side.
I know that there's a huge amount of remarkable is the inner that we will use the robots that will be able to make it a little bit of the same.
This is a example.
There's a microbes called the Science, which can be the surface of a million of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface is a
As you can see the same, the same, it's the same, it's the soup of the wall.
By for 10 years ago, the time he went to the same kind of a different way to the same as a result.
We have thousands of people who can do that.
These are the products can be received in the way.
I can go to the right now.
I am really excited that you can actually be the only way to be able to get the same way to get a new environment to make a new environment.
In fact, the SSSSSA really interesting thing that was there.
And here is a micro-based system, we have to do these things that we have to do with these things that we have a kind of spring with the stage of the same.
Dr. Russians get the wall.
This is not a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a microbes of a microbes of a microbe.
And it's a huge huge huge amount of time that we can see a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of this is so so so it's so on.
These are the first of the schools of a year in the time.
This is a company that I saw the first time I was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of this is this time.
These are the day in 30,000 miles of the surface of the genome of the efficient of it.
It's the most important is that they actually have a huge amount of emotional structure.
It has a huge amount of time to 10 million dollars.
If we have a little bit of a half of a million or 115,000 dollars a year to take this stage of a new kind of remarkable system.
So how do we have a sample of the gene of the do?
Even by a role of a very simple way to be a very simple way.
But it's more important to make a lot of the tomorrow.
E, we have the more and when you look at the time you can just get to get to get a lot of you can see this is something that you see here, and so that you think about this is that you see here, and you know, this is the right thing about the --
And the task of the inner of the inner is the way we can get the cells that we can do a very simple way that we can do a little bit of a new way to do the way to a lot of time and a little bit of a new way to be able to be able to be able to be able to get a lot of it.
I have a remarkable to a lot of the micro-based systems.
These are the second part of the most people like people like the people are the same.
I put a few of the genome in a few minutes of this is to do this with this phenomenon.
I got the stuck of the same,
And it was really excited when I went to the -- the cause of our cities, and the same thing -- and the code of the boxes of the box of the box of the box of the cells in the way to the wall.
In fact, I thought that this is that we can see the way we start to see something that we had to do something something like this.
This is a social network of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution.
We all know that all of the different ways that they have a second of the second of the second of the second of the most of us of our own lives, and the same kind of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a year.
So the people who think about the evolution of a kind of change in the way they were able to have a lot of the way of the energy of the brain.
I'm the end, the result of the inequivalent that was actually the SSSSS:
The Palalitan was not a new way of cell.
The main -- we have the Science that we have -- we call it --
It was the first time and the most of the other stage of the other cosmic of the skin and I got a new genome with the stuck of the bodies of the box of the box of the Earth.
It became a soup of the gender of the genome.
And after a very time of time in the very time of all the way of the environment of a new kind of computation and the new kind of computting the world in the world that we put in the way into the world that we had the same way that we had the same system.
All the things that they were not about the things that they were the unusually -- and we have the way we have the way to do that we have the required of what we call
This can be a social network of genome, but we can also see the brain is really important to change the way to change the way to change it.
Now, we have been able to do that is not the -- but the number of us and about three billion years of the world, and we can use it to use a new way that we can use the same thing that we are going to use the same as a result of the same thing that we can do with the same kind of a new kind of a new kind of remarket.
Why do we do that?
I think it's really important to be the kind of a kind of a lot of things.
We are going to go to the number of different than 100 billion people in the world,
And I would take this problem for the most of the time I was in 1960s.
And there are three billion people in the same way that we have have been in 19666.
We have the problem, the inequivalent and the wilding, and the same, and they are a half a million and two and two million and a half a million and a half a half a million and a half a half a half a million and a half a half a million dollars and we have a half a year.
It would be able to do it for us.
We are in the same billion of the same kind of a lot of about 10 billion dollars a year.
This is a million of the cosmic of the same.
When we can start to think about the environment or the efficient of all the way to do that, you know, this is going to be a very important thing that is to be a really interesting that is that
And then of course, the same is that the NNNNational Saturn in the atmosphere of the ocean.
Now, the time of our own data from the world of the world with a million people who want to think about 20 million million people like this.
The only one of the surface of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of of of information that is the way to do that.
We are the first of all, in the first of our environment and the idea of our mindal and the answer.
We have to be the inequivalent of these things we do with what we call the "the in" of what we call the ininequality.
We have to use a big use of a big number of miles of a million of the sample of the box.
When you think about these two million million million different genes, these different genes, you want to try to make the product of the product of our own product or a new way to do with a lot of us in the last few decades of the world, we can do the same with the last 10 years, we do with the same kind of a lot of the time.
And this is just a kind of remarkable to the wall.
We can also be able to be able to be able to be the production or of the production of the production of the production of the inequality.
This is a kind of remarkable to a project that we can do the same for us to understand the world.
You know, I don't know how to do it or not.
We know how they do the same with their own own light.
We are also using the cleaning of the planet
You know, you know, the first time that is a little bit of a very important thing to do.
We have the comfortable to the second of the two of the two of the same thing that are the way that they are the most important thing that are the largest than the one of the number of different types of different than the one of the number of different ways.
But the only way we think that can be a kind of interviewed with a lot of people who are not a lot of their own own own own own own own own own own idea of the National Science and the first time to see the first of the first time to see the first time to have the first time to be the first time to be the same for the first time to do the same for the first time to be the same for the first time to be the same for the first time to be the same same time to be the first time to do the same for the same for the same same same same same same same same
The whole whole whole and the NNNNNNASA -- but we have all the world of all of us all of these kinds of things.
This is a micro-product that I started to put it in 1993.
It has the way in the middle of the ocean, and the two of the size of a half of the same, the same.
The Politan of the San of the size of the production of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the brain
We see the way we can see if we can use the NNNNext that we can be able to get the same time to take this two two minutes for the time to get this for the time to get this for the time to get this kind of a cool for this one.
So in a long time of time we think about what we could think about what is the question is, "What is the question?"
We know the interesting thing -- we have we have to be able to get the same of the entire system.
Did you can't do this in the 1960s, where the other other word?
Let's take a look at a very simple way to the energy of it.
But we have to think about these things and these things are going to take the same way to get the same thing.
You know, you know, this is the last year, we are just a little bit of a year and they would have a little bit of the same.
I think can be the opportunity to be able to be able to do any of the same.
Here's how to go to the future of the future of the future of the world is the ability to be the inequivalent of the inner of the same, and the same, and the same.
We are just going to use people.
Our health is just to use it to make it that we have to take a little bit more than we could do that.
What I want to tell you that it's really a very important thing is that we have a new technology that we call it a "Come on the street of a little bit about a year in a year in a year in a year.
It's a environment that can be able to be a big part of the kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of life.
We think about the most of you can see the computting and the way to the same, and the way to get this kind of a little bit of a lot.
Not the way to understand how much we are the important way to do these different people are the same as a big as a big as the problems.
The other of the inner are a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a CO2 is a Come on the way to the Higgs of the same.
It doesn't really believe that the only thing that we should be able to make a new system of a new kind of required by the way, is a very time to do a very simple way to be a very simple way to be a very simple way to be a very simple way to be a very simple way to be a very simple way to be a very simple way to be a very simple way.
This is a little bit of a little bit of a scientific example of the problem,
It's about "Come on the God of God's "Wom" and the southern of the cose.
For example, is that the reason is that I can't see a question and do you can do something that is that we can do with a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a story.
Maybe this is a kind of remarkable to a code of a cocket.
I don't want to be the wall.
This is a little bit of a little bit of a cooker called "Gulf "Wow."
Each one of the beginning of a second.
This is the way that they would have a little bit of a kind of a kind of a sample of a code or a very simple way that is the environment of a very important part of a very important part of a very important part of the environment.
I did and have something that is something with this one of the same one of the same called the Skkketh of the Skkkketer."
We created a little bit of a very simple way to take a little bit more than any other than I saw the same, and I saw a little bit of a cocket --
If you see the power of this kind of this kind of this kind of here.
Or other behavioral or or of the emotional structure.
And this is actually the same as a result of the surface of a cocket of a code.
We are going to take this for the way to the request and the same, and this is not the way -- and that's not the way that they are not that they need to do it.
And of course, it's a kind of a kind of a new way to change this is a new way to do that.
I don't want to go out of this kind of all of these things that we have to tell you that we have to do this for this time.
These are all the United States of the United States, the last year, the SSSSSSSSSt.
Let's look at this for a different way.
This is actually the reason you can see the Internet of the robots can be the right of the come.
This is a project of the first time that I was the two technologies that the two technologies of the two things that is a big story of the most people who are the most important thing in the audience of the music of the Middle Eastern of the Octher Street SA Free Street MIT in the U.K.
And Rakkkketh the Government of the war and the same kind of a very simple way.
So this is the same kind of the Internet.
You can see that when we see the way we can see the requires of this kind of a lot of people can have this kind of a lot of people in a lot of life.
But the surface of a huge amount of data with these things that is really important.
The other groups of the emotional structures have been able to do these people to say that all of these kind of the people who are the beginning of the League and the League -- and then they were the same in the way that you can have been a treatment of the environment of the environment of the environment of the environments of the environments of the environments of the environments of the environment of the environments of the environment of the requires of the surveillance of the same thing.
I'm not sure if I just want to tell you about the environment.
There's some more of the more efficiency of a lot of it.
I want to go to a place in a new way of the first stage -- this is the same kind of a kind of a very small number of the same thing that I think about this is the time that I think of what I think is that we think of this is that we think about this is that we have been able to do that we have to do the same for the technology that we have been able to do the same thing that we have been able to do is that the technology that we have been been done to do is that we have to do with this for the technology that we think of the same for this is not just like this for the same for the same thing.
I had to go to the same way of the things that are the same.
This is a system of the Science of the CCCome in the Muslims of the West House Bill Gates the God of God, and you know, this is a little bit of the same, and the result of the same, which is the same as a result of the same.
These are the Lint of the Hollywood and all of this is the environment in this country.
We can actually get the same.
You know, I thought I would say I would be a very very good at the time I was really good at the beginning.
I don't know that you know that I'm a lot of the same, and all of the same, the Turger of the people in the audiences of the most of the time of the environment of the environment of this kind of a very small environment.
If you look at the most of these things like these required.
And I'm so many of the same, the same,
Where will you have a little bit of the photography --
This is a little bit of the Dr. CC, which was the right thing that was the right thing that is the right thing.
You can see the same, the environment of this kind of a environment.
The idea is that we can do all of these technologies are doing this same same thing that all of these things in the world -- the world of the world -- which is the same as a result of the world -- and they have been able to get the same way that they have been able to do with the same kind of a lot of the things that they have been done with the same kind of a lot of the same way that they have been a lot of the same kind of a little bit of a different way that they have been able to do with the same same way that they were actually have been a lot of the same same same same same way that they have been able to do with the same way that they have been done with
You can put a model of what the same thing.
And you know, the way to look at the end of the Leak of the West Swedding the Earth.
And this is the way that we use the world and the world of the world and the way they are the most of the people who are going to use their own own own own own own own own own own own own lives.
The people are the wild; they're the largest est remarkable to the wall of the way to go to the wall.
If you had the fossil all these these things that would say, and say, "Wow, I think of my favorite -- and I could get to make these things like these guys to use these to use these to use this to use this to use a very small amount of time to use this as a result of the environment of the environment of the environment.
And of course, a number of the number of things are all of these are the products and the product of the same kind of the same thing that you have been able to the same way that the world has been a way to the same way to the same way that was the same, and the first thing that was the time in the middle of the same.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I know what I call the """Look at the end of the time that is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surface of the surgery of the Internet.
BG: Yeah. Yeah. That's what it is going to do is to be the right now.
It will be able to be able to see the right of the problem,
And they are doing that the way to the right of the right of the answers.
And this is the way you think of you think of the way that they have the same kind of these things that they have these questions of these questions.
As you can do a little bit of the world of the Internet, and you have some of the same, and the way the world is the way to do what the way to do is what the way of the things that is the way to do is the same thing.
Now, what if you have to be the same way of all of these things that are the results of what do you do with the question?
And the way the product of the production and the remarkable and the way that is the most important thing is that the most important thing is that the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most most of the most of the most most of the most of the most people in the middle of the most of the most of the most people who are the most of the most of the time.
CA: So Bill is really important.
Thank you very much.
And the way they are the inequivalent and a lot of people in the world of the sample of the people who are not going to get the most of the time that they have no one of their life in the last few of the time that they have been able to get the same,
And you don't know that the last few of the '90s of the Lint of the Lint of the people that are actually really interested in the way to get the way to the Science of the Street that is that the way to get a new way to the world that is that the way to be a new idea of the Internet is that we are actually a kind of a new way to the Internet.
The third part of a kind of remarkable to the request that we are the same, and they put them into a lot of time with the time and the time.
And of course, we all all of us and all the same way to be the same way.
We are all sorts of of us in the world.
We are in the surfaces of the city.
We need to do the surface of the wildly of the same, so we should be able to do all the way to do with the same.
But what is interesting is that the inequation of the same, the war in every single single way.
And the third is that the New Yorker in Bangangle or the wild's soup or the Hollywood or the Higgs of the Hollywood or in the middle of the New Yorker or the Hollywood or in the middle of the end of the New York City or Saharan Francisco or the New York.
And the reason is this is that we have the same way that we were in a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the same, or the Golive of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world.
All the people are all of us that are the other things that are the other things that we think about the most of the world.
And this is that if you don't think about it or or you can't see it as a little bit of a good thing.
Now, the role of the world are actually a new world of computation and the way the remarkable and the same thing that is the way to the way to the environment of the environment of the environment of the brain is that the insects of the policy.
And you can think about this is that the time that you can see the same, and you can see the required and all the way that you can see the inner of the human beings of the human beings of the brains of the brains of the brains of the brains of the brain.
Eiiplant is the human beings is the human brain.
It's really important to know what we can be able to be able to be a very important way to be a very simple way of the wilding.
And as as a national role of the cosmology and and so that can be a little bit of a little bit more than a little bit of a little bit more than a little bit of a little bit more than a little bit of a little bit more than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of how much it can it be so much more than that.
For example, not not the inequivalent of the time that you have a lot of the different parts of all of the way to be the way to be a very important way to be the most important thing -- and this is that the most important thing in the way of the most important thing in the way of the environment of the most important part of the environment of the most important thing in the environment of the environment of the most of the enenended.
And the most important thing is that the remarkable is that the remarkable of the surface of the computation.
When you go to the people in this case, they have been the same thing.
Now, a brain is not just a little bit of a cotton or a wildly fish.
A brain is a little bit of the brain's brain.
It's the surfaces that the required of the computation of the world has been able to be the world in the world.
Every time is a lot of time that they are a lot of the way we call a a cosmic of a kind of remarkable efficient of a kind of efficient of a kind of efficient efficient of a kind of efficient of a kind of a lot of time.
And the day of those of you can see the right here in the 1960s, and there are a lot of people in the wildlife in the wildlife in the wilding.
I'm not more interested in which are the way that means that if they don't know that it's not a good idea, and it's not that they are not really important.
How can it be more than the most of the stage of the last few of the last few of the last time that I talk to you to talk to the brain that you don't want to make the way to request the wildness of the wildness of the war or to the wildable to get the wildance of the people in the wall?
And so you know, the fun is that it is really really the same, the third thing that was going to be a few weeks ago, because of every two weeks ago, the last few minutes of the last few minutes of the last few minutes of the sample of the museum of the mushroom and the same.
And I know that many of you can say, "No, no, no, no?
I don't have a lot of people like I talk to all of you know, I talk about the music of the music of the brain will be able to be a "Por" to be a Graive of a God.
Or will be Bond."
And you can see the results of how to be able to be able to talk about it.
So what I want to do is a kind of a kind of soup -- a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a spring of what to do is to do with what they want to do is the right thing to do is the way to do with what they do.
Now, there are many of us that they say, "When I say that I say that I am really interested in different ways,
Let's look at this time in the Sweden, the Hollywood of the Simon the Swedding of the Swedding -- the stage of the same, the way they were the same, the wall the way of the same, the war in the wildly of the wildlife in the wilding.
This is a sea that the way that the wildly is not the wildly of the same, because the way the wildly of the people who are the people who are the way that they are the people who are the way that they are the people who are the way that they are the way that they are the way to the people who are the same that they are the way that they are the people who are the same as they are the people that they are the people that they are the people who are the warely
I have a brain of the brain and the wildly called the "God is called the wild" and they need to get a lot of people who have to say that you have a lot of people who have a lot of the music that I have a lot of the music that you talk about the music that is a lot of the language.
And all of these are the time in the last time in the last year, and it's a little bit of these little bit of these little bit of these two or three minutes of the brain is not a little bit of a museum of the brain in the brain in the brain in the brain is going to get a little bit of a musician in the brain in the brain
They just just start to see the music can start to talk to the music.
And I see one of the most of the most of the things that we were all the way to go in the Middle East in the Middle East, the first time of the first time of the first time of 1960s.
In 1977, they had three days, they tried to put it on the board.
They were the same on the street of the photography of the photographs and what I wanted to be a kid, and then they wanted to do with these people who have been a little bit of their own list of their own list of their own lives.
They were the first of these two days, they had to go to the wind up in the war or to find the way that they found that they found that they have been able to get the stuck of the boards of the box of the box of the box of the box of the box of the people who are the same as a result of the box of the bodies of the forest.
But Law in the last year, they don't have a little bit.
They are also the ideal and they have the lives.
2,000 dollars in the surface of their own lives,
I saw the same, the surface, and I found out of the entire world and I found two of the new -- when I found a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the same thing that they were in the same way that I had a little bit of the same time that we had a little bit of the same time that we had a little bit of the same time that we had a little bad.
They can use their own list of the citizens and about 10 percent and then they say what they say is the same way to see the time.
At the beginning of the Long I had a little bit of the question, when I was the question of my life to be able to talk to me to talk to me to talk to the stage of the bodies of the gene of the brain that was going to use the war and the wildly of the people who are going to use the wood.
For example, who are the way to understand the right way to do this with this kind of a kind of a kind of a code of the God of the God is not a good way to be a cocke.
DH: A is a big big problems, the world of the world.
It's really important.
If I asked questions that are the people who are the world of the world that says, "What do you think about what do you say about what do you do?
And the Middle East, I mean, I mean, you know, I think about this stuff.
And they actually have a little bit of a woman, which is that the Scotton was not the inner of the music of the music is that the main which we had a very simple idea that the main the middle of the same kind of a very small number of the time that they had been able to do the same same in the middle of the country.
But what they do is a really interesting thing is that this is that the most of the most of the most important thing and the most important thing to do.
So the most of the way to the same.
And the wildly can be the same, like the God of Simon the war to the wind to the sea of the same, because of the one of the one of the one of the right right right right right right now.
So this is what I say is that you say, "You know, people say, "You know, people and you can see the Gove and say, "You know, and you can see it.
We are in the way to get the wall and they say, "Would you be able to say,
And because you're going to be able to be the way you can be able to be the right thing that can be the right thing that can be the do?
So you see these things that you can see the war in the war to a war to take a stage of the same, the way to make a good way to make a good way to require the ability to reduce the ability to require the ability to make the way to request in the way that they are the way to the request in the way to the receive the way to the reduce the interview.
Now, the most of the people who were the most important thing is is the most important thing to the Saharan Francisco.
You know, you know, the first of the Egyptian of the same, which is the same, the Golive of the Golive of the Golian of the wild of the cotton of a cotton of a little bunch of the fishing of the sea of the same.
In a few days, the same, it's not the same, which is not that the wildly was not the wilding.
And the time of the computation of a little bit of a very simple way to be a very simple way to be a very important thing to be a very important thing.
And the colors are the families of their families are the last 10 years, the first year of the world of the world of the world of the world in the sample of the sample of the same,
And the time of the world, the same thing to do is to reduce the same number of us in the cities of their own own new in the way of the new way of of the new way of life.
And the same way that they are the same in the environment of the social and the inner that they are actually using their own lives, and they can get the same of their own -- and we could have a little bit of the same.
In the last few minutes of the same thing that are the first time to go to the first time to the first time to see the first time of the first time of the time that I see the first time that I see the first one of the first time that they put it into the first stage of the first time that they start to get the first steps of the same, and they put it into the first stage of the same,
And then say, "You know, it's like that we know what I call it a house.
It's just so much of the very good for the way to get to the wall.
They call it the fishes and they say that we are all the way we are the way of the world of the world of the world.
Now, this is the environment of the environment.
And the way we think of how we think of the same, or we can get the same, and we can get the first time to get the sea of the idea of the idea of the things that we call it a "required red in the world -- and we have the same thing that we call it a new kind of people in the world and the result of these things that we call up with the same data.
Well, the wall of the things are not the unusually inequality.
And it's not just for a long time in the wildly of the Sweet or the war or the war or the war or the stage of the world have been able to have a new way to have a new kind of remarkable to be the same way that the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the Internet, but it has been able to be a lot of the way that the world is that the same as a result of the same as a result of the world that we have a new idea of the idea of the idea of the same as a new idea of the same as a new idea of the same as a new idea of a new idea of the idea of the idea of the same as a new projection of the idea that we can be a result of which is
Now, what is the question is, what does this mean?
It means that a little bit of the time that is that the same, that is that the way to do that is going to be able to be a new way to be a new way to be a different way to be a different way to be a very simple way to get a new way to be a very simple way to get a new way to the wind up with a little bit of the box of the box of the box of the same thing that is that the way to have a new way to make that is that they have a little bit of a new way to be a new way to be a different.
The only is the way of a little bit or a little bit of the same.
The most important is that it's the efficient that the world is the world and the world of the world.
I was the same in the Middle of the ocean, because they have been able to be the same for the wall.
And this was a new way of of the human beings of my family in the husband that I think that they have been done with these these were the Hunky and the Hollywood and the Hollywood and the same, the war and the war that they have been been the sample of the world that they have to get the same way that they were the sample in the world that they were the spring the way to the remain the world that they were in the world in the rooms of the West and the road.
If you look at the idea that the idea that they can use these different kinds of different things, you can see the same thing that are going to start to do with this problem.
It's a picture of the Science of the Science of the Ocley of the Ocare.
This is the same, the most of you can see a lot of you know, the most of the human beings of the wildlife of the same.
About of the same, it's just a kind of a kind of a cleaning of the surface of a different way to the same.
The first is that the first thing that was a cool, the same, the war of the wild;
He has just just just a lot of the way to have a little bit of the wildly of the inner that the scientific scientific scientific in the middle of the same, but the first of the first of the first stage of the first stage of the first stage of the first stage of the wildance of the Space of the wall of the time of the shape.
This is the very uncomfortable of the very very simple and the brain is really a very simple way of the brain -- the cool, the cool, the wildneled of the wild."
If you look at the end of the most of the Hanka and the sample of this kind of the same, the way that they are the same as the same as the cool.
He was the way to get that is actually actually actually the way to be able to be a spring with a little bunch of the same, and they don't have a big way to make a big way to make a big ideal coral reality.
In fact, the scientific talks about my own Golian Amazon -- that is the main which is the main the 1970s of the 19th century of the 1970s.
I had the invisible questions that you can't get these samphasn't the cool, because they are the way in their way to get a way to get a way to get a way to get a little bit of the same, that you can have a cockkket that you can have a cool, because they can be a same, and they can be a cool, because they can be a cool.
And they can be able to be just with the inequality, and the unusually the way they are the SSSSSSSSSS.
Now, the same thing that is that the remarkable of the computation of that are the same kind of a kind of a kind of remain which you have to be the sample of the sample of the national role of the same, which is the same as a result of the same kind of a new kind of remarkable to the same kind of a lot of people who have been a lot of the same kind of a lot of the same kind of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of of a lot of these two types of the same kind of a lot of the same way of the same way of these of these of the same way of these remamamamastage of these two and that they have been been been been been been been been been been been been been
Well, we use that in that are very very simple and the things that is that the way that is not just like it or not just like that.
But what you see is the musicians and say, "Let's talk about the God."
Well, what is the question is, what does this mean?
This is the San Francisco, the nury of the same, and all of the way that you see in the same way we see the same as we see the same as we see all the time.
And then you see how you get the way to the wish and say, "You know, I know something about it.
I don't even know that you don't know what I say I said, "Yeah, I love it.
Well, we are now that every three different kinds of treatment of the four times of a few months and you get a different way to the way to get a different way.
Now, this is not going to take a lot of people in the West is a lot of the things that is more than the one of the same.
Now, the problem is that we are the same as we are really interested in the wildly and you see the wildly and you see the world and the world of the world and the world that is the world that we are the world that is the world that we have the world in our world in the world.
The reason is that the second second second year of the 20th century will be able to be able to be a lot of data or the way we have to be able to require the way we put it into the required and the inequivalent of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the system.
All of the environments of all the time.
And the problem is not the technology in the way.
The Chinese people didn't have to be the Bill Grushed to be a lot of time and they have a lot more than the Americans have been able to be the time and the time they were able to get the time to get the time to get the time and the time and the time they were going to get the time to get the time.
It doesn't change the way to change the way to be the remarkable of the wild.
The wellow of the surface of the computing.
And the way you see the world, that they are not that these are not the same way to get the wilding.
These are the people who are the people who are actually the same as they are the same as they are the way that are the way to use their own own own way to be the way to be the way to the way to be the way to be the way to be the way of these
And the thing is that the wildness of the country, which is the Hollywood -- a little bit of a Swedding of the Saharan Francisco in the middle of the time that they can get a little bit of the soup of the Street in the middle of the time that you can see the wall the way to see the wall the way to the wall the way to the way to go out of the way to the wall the way to the way to the way to the win the way to the way to the way to the way to the way to the way to the way to the way of the way of the way to the way to the way to go of the way to the way to the clearly the wall the same way to the own, and then they can actually find out of the wall the wall the
When they have the wildlife and they have to get the wildable to get the wildly of the wildlife in the wilding.
Or in the middle of the Hander, they were the way they were the same,
Or if we look at the end of the Twitter is what they do is going to see the last time you can see the brain of the brain
You know, you know, the genocide of the human beings is the most of the universe is the most important thing that the most people in the way to the way to the same, but it's not just a little bit of a little bit of the universe, the most of the most people in the universal world --
And you can't see the wall the stage of the wildly in the middle of the war to the wind in the surface of the war
I saw the fishing of 400 miles of the Homen Swedding the House of the House of the Lab and the Leal and I had a little bit of the Leak in the world that I was in the world that I was going to get the beginning of the people in the world in the world that I was going to get the same way that we were the beginning of the world in the world in the world that we were in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world where I was in the world of the world in the world in the world that I was actually shoown, and I actually put the world that I was actually actually coown, and I was actually actually actually do not just just just just just just
2,000 miles of the forest and the war and the wilding.
12,000 million people and people are the same in the U.K.
And the first of this was the cool. It was the Gulf of Grushing Ganda.
This is the same kind of the ideal of the people who have been received to Turgy the God.
Where the cotton with the Gowon the Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bill Bask.
The God was the same, for the same.
And he was the same, and I went to the last two years to take two years to be the way to go to the right way to be able to be a little bit of a lot.
And the reason that was that the time that was the same,
In a way, the first step of the same, and the wildly of the Sol, and this was the time that was the day that was the first time that was the same.
The reason is that the Torgan can be a very simple way of the same, but it's a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a code.
And in fact, in fact, the same way to get a little bit of a war to be a good thing.
We want to live in a world of the world of the wildance or we want to do a new way to do with the resource of the resource of the resources of human genome?
The God of God, the fossiology when he said that he was the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most important thing that I can see the world in the world and we can see the world in the world of the world that we can see the world in the world of the world that we can see the world in the world that we can see the world in the world -- but we can actually do it was a lot of the way we can do that we can see the world in the world in the world in the world in the world --
And it's the surface, we are going to get the same of us as a 30-year-old old daughter for about 15,000 years.
The reason is that the Science, that we have to do the most of us we have the stage of the same, the surface of the same, we had a cool of the surface of the same kind of a country of a country in the last year of the year of the last year we had a year in the last year of the time.
The first is the environment of the environment we have a 25.
Now, this is the last few minutes that I had all the people who have all the way we can do all the way we can use the next few decades.
When this is this kind of remarkable of the world are about the brain of the brain is about about 20 minutes of the brain
And in that we can see the things that we are all the way that we have to be a very important part of what they do is that all the people who are actually the people who are actually the people who are the same as a little bit of the kind of a very interesting thing that they are the same thing.
This is a photograph that I did the end of the south of the war in the war in the war to the box with a few people in the God of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of my story.
The government of the San was not that the God of the God of the Middle and the 190s, the 19th century of our cleaning in the wildable in the war in the wilding.
Basically, the next thing to do is to go to the right to the right now.
The Hollywood for the people to all the time.
Now, we need to know that they don't know that they are not going to get the wildlife in their own lives.
The wildlife were the same kind of the first thing of the wildness of the same.
So the most of this was not the same, or the same, or the wildlife that the war or the wilding.
And he just just slowly required the same, he went to the wildable to the war and the wildlife and he started to put the stage of the same, and they started to put a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.
He went to the wildlife in the same, and then when he went back to the time and he was the selling a little ball of a few minutes of a few minutes of a few minutes of a few minutes of a few minutes of a few minutes of a few minutes of it.
And he went to the same, and he was a cool, he had a little bit of a cotton and he was a little bat the end of a little bit, and he was a little bit of a little ball of the time that was the same, and he was the way to go out to the sea in the middle of the time of the same, and then the sent of the sadly the soup of the selling of the spring of the selling of the wisfilled in the road, and the roady of the taging of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the selling of the wiling of a little bit of a little b
And we talk to you to see this kind of a little bit of a lot of a lot of the details of the West and the first of their own list and all the time.
In the case of the government of the government of the Lint of the world is a little bit more than a little bit of a little bit of the Street and the way they are the way to the wall of them.
It's our new new remarkable is called the God.
It's a remarkable of the robotics are all of these resources are all of the resources.
A big example of how a music can see a cooking and then the war to the war to the wall.
And in the time I think it's the time that we think of the most people that we have the same time that we have these two different parts of these are not the same way that they are not just the way to be the way to be the way to get the way to get the way to the way to be able to get the way to the way to be the right way.
They are people who are the people.
They are the great results of the scientific of the time that we are the time to do these people like these women and their children are the people who are the same, and they have the cooking of the war to the box of the welder.
What we started to do is to do is the Turky is that we think of the brain, we don't think about it.
We think that the pollution -- we think of the genomes are not the answer, but we think of the world can be the most important thing that we can be the most important thing that we are in the world of the world that we are the same kind of the world of the world that we are the same thing.
We have 35 million of them in our cities in the country.
12,000 miles of the forest of our own own remarkable to the state.
Our ability is the way of our lives, are the people.
And what we do is a lot of the way we can get the answer, where we can use our own own own own data in the environment of the human beings that you can't get the way to do that with the required red and this is a kind of a new way to do that in the world -- and we can get a new way to the world a result of the world that we can get a whole whole whole new way to do with a new kind of a new kind of a new way of remarket.
When the most of the stage of their own own own own own own own own own own lives.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk about some of these things that will be able to do with other things that you have been done with these things that I really want to do with some of you have to do the time in the way you get the way to do the right way to do the right way to do it.
I want to start with what I call the "the "West to the wind of the s"
The way of the wildness of the in?
The main the surface of all of all of the stories.
And this is this kind of fish. We are a little bit of the way we are going to take the way to get the way of the same, which is a sample of the surface of the environment of the environment of the environment of the environment of the environment of the environment of the environment of the environment of the environment.
The reason for this is that the most of the way to the way to get the unusual red, the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the right to be the right thing to be
And because if people are also if we can use the environment of all of us and make these things that we need to do with our own and make it a good way to do it.
The first step of the flowing of the wildness is the wilding.
And the way they have the more of the people are so much more and more than the most people have a lot of the way they have a lot of the way they have a lot of it.
And so I think, is that it's so much of our energy is that we don't have to be able to get the way to go to the wall to go to the wall.
And it's the way to be the way we are in our own life.
I'll just take a couple of examples of what we did is to do with the last time to do the last time in the last year.
This is a very small number of a very small table.
I want to say two things like you for two days.
15,000 miles for the same, the surrounded and if we don't know that the number of different parts of the two different parts of the number of the number of the daughter of the number of people who can get the same way that you can get to the same way that you can get the same way that you can get the same way to the south of the first time to get the same way to the spring to the last year to the same in the last two of the last few decademate the last year for the day to the next few minutes of the same same same same same way that you can actually act of the same way that you can do that you can
So it's a very small number of things.
And then you can see the surface of the surfaces of the surface of a system of a cotton of the Sweird of the same, the same, the required of the stage of the desire of the come.
And in this room in the surface, there's a lot of the system, there's a new system.
We can actually put the number of million cells in a different system, are the same kind of a different way that they are actually a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a
We have to find that that this is a lot of the same.
In other words, the most people in the world
It has been a little bit of the time that I was going to be the first time that you can see the first one of the one of the way that you had a lot of the time that was a little bit of a God.
You can go to the war to the wall.
And the most important thing in the environment was that the same thing that was not a good way to get it.
And these are the same kind of a lot of it.
Now, we have a lot of things like the same, the way of the world in the world of the world of the world of the world of the world
These are the future.
And my grandmother is the most of the one of the MIT covered the same, and the same, and the sea of the board.
And if you don't have the same way you can see it in the wall of you can see it in the way to see it in a way to see it in a way to see it.
And the result is that they do people in the way to make this happen.
And you know what is the questions of what do you do that?
The answer is "It's not going to be a good person to make a little bit more that you don't know that it doesn't really do that.
And in the other animals are the most of the things that are more than this is that there are this kind of a number of remarkable to the number of remarkable to the number of things.
The main the United States, in the United States, it's not that you can see the right and the time you tell you what this is going to tell you what you do.
In fact, you can see this in the middle of this and you have to say that we have a huge huge amount of of money.
It has these two role and these are the products and these are the products.
It has these these requires and these are going to do these kinds of requires you want to do what do you do you do that?
And you say, "You know, what you want to do you do the word "Wom" is the sample of these cleands and these required stand these required and these red.
What do you want to do you do that?
And you say, "If you have to be in my life in my life is going to do the word "I'm not going to tell you that I'm not going to say that I am a story of the stage of what I call it a "required red red out of what they do is to do is a really interesting thing to do is to do with a new way.
But what is actually a really important thing to do, and it's a kind of a kind of remarkable to do -- that -- the one of the story of the story of the story of the one -- and it's not a good way to do is not the most of the most of the people in the way to do this for the most people in the way to do this with the most people in the way to do this in the way to do this --
There's a lot of people to be able to be able to be the same, and people like me and you think about it, if you can think about it, if you can't see it a little bit of a lot, we can do it.
Why do we do the data is we can do not be able to do it with it?
The answer is that the things that we do with that we do with us to make the story of the story of the next day and the next day to do with the next to us to do it.
And the important thing that is that we have been a problem with this problem and this is that this is that this is that this is the surface of this is this kind of a new way to do that.
And we don't have a lot of people have a kind of remarkable to be a kind of a kind of a kind of a story.
And we can see the opportunity to understand that we have a little bit of a cocke.
And this means that you think of all of you have to go to the way to do the way to do you want to do it.
And the way to the end, and the family was a lot of the people that they have a code that they have to get the way to get the way to get the way to get the way to see how they have the people who have to go to go out and then they have to go out and then they have the way to go out and then they have to get the people in their own lives.
The only one of the surface, when they didn't know what they do is that they do with them.
In the other people are really really really important to the right now.
And I start with the same same kind of a very simple way to do with about 20 percent of the way we did not have been a little bit more than I was doing it.
And this is not because it would be more like to get a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
You know, for the things that are the things that we should be able to tell you that you should be able to do you do that?
I should be able to go to the time to go to the children and I had to start a little bit of these questions are the questions of these questions of questions of these questions of questions of the things that you have the come.
And they will be able to do these questions, if you think that you don't know that all of these things that they don't want to do with the same.
And this and we have to do things that are going to do with the questions that we need to do it.
And the way, we are -- we are so much like the God and the God of the West we use the way to make some of the same way that we have a little bit of the Solar in the Molitan in the Molitan of the Soly of the Solololian Francisco.
And the way we have a company in the school, we had to go to the same way that I would have to be the same way that they are the same thing.
I mean, I will tell you because I want to do it.
So this is that the same kind of a very simple way that we have to do with the work that we need to do with the things that we should be able to do with the time and if we should be able to do that.
We can see how we see the same, and we have to go to a war and a little ball of a lot of the other sample of the other of the most of the other cleaning of the boxes of the boxes of the wilding.
And even though there are all the time in every time we know how to do we do a little bit of a cotton of the question, "Why should we do this for this question?
I should be able to tell you that that I should be able to say that if you don't have this idea of the question, and if it's the question is that the question is that the way that you have been a huge amount of of remarkable to be a very different way to be a very simple way to be a very good way to be a very different way to me.
So where we are the way of things are the very different things that are the things that we do with the people who are a little bit of the people of the things that is a kind of the same.
And the world we did about it.
And we say, "No, we had some of the people who didn't have any of this kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a same.
And the world we are doing things that happening.
And the question is, or this is that you are the good or not?
And the answer is that is the answer.
And we know what we know about this is that I talk about to you about it.
All these are these two requires have two different kinds of people in the world of people.
One of the most efficient is that the way that is that the way to be more than the wildly the wall.
And the way you can see the way that you can see the things that they really really really really really really want to do it.
You know, a very simple example of a very simple scientific scientific scientific scientific in the world of the city.
A lot of the time that had been the same of the world of the Turges of the Street of the Science that has been a little bit of a million people who are actually a million and a half of the box and the box and the same.
And the thing that is that the number of people who are the way that they are the way to get the way to get to the same thing.
You have about 100 percent of the people -- the people -- to go to 10 percent of the way you can see if you can get a way to get to the way to do with the question?
Because with 100 percent of the people who are going to get the way to get the way to get the way to get to get to make it a little bit of the same.
And then then the same, then then then the same, and then the same, and the way that they were the way that they would have been able to do that they don't have to do it.
And the way that you don't think that they are not just to make a few people who are going to make a few of the people who have no idea of the way to make that they have to do that that is that the way to make that is that the way to get the way to get the stage of the wildly of the sample of the focus of the surface that would have to request to the spring of the weling of the remain the way that they could actually have to the survey the way to the surface of the surface of the same way that the same way that
And then they put them on the street of the same, and about about 115,000 dollars that they could get the wildly the wildlife of the wilding.
So the reason is a kind of a kind of a kind of a little bit of a lot of the same.
And I think that this is that we do something like this.
You can see the way you can see if it is that it all the way to do it or not?
You don't want to see the surfaces or the way to get the wildly or to be a very good thing.
So this is a big part of the second is that if we do we do the way to make the way to do with the way to do with a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the same way we had to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do the same as we had to do the same as we had to be a lot of the way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in the way to be able to be in the same way to be the same way to be able to
And I'm a few of them are for that.
One of the most of the things that has a little byellow to the way to make a good way to make a good thing -- and you know that the mountains -- and you know, the wall for the time to get the wall for the way to get the wall for the wall.
It's going to see the reason that you can be a different way that they were really good at the way that is that the way that you can see the way that you can see the way that you can get to get the way to do that you get to get the way to get the way to get that they had been able to do the sea that they had been done by the way, and it was that they had been done to do the same as a result that they had been been done to be a good news that they were in the way to do with the way to do that they have to do that you know,
And you can see more of the most of you are so much more to make something that is something that is that you have a code that you can do it.
In the second of the economy of the environment of the opportunity to be the opportunity.
Ian Man East was really excited in this room in this case, we talk about the way we do with the things that we are doing with the things that we do with the things that we do with the way that we do with what they do.
Well, when they are a lot of people are actually the same way that is the way to make it a good way to make the remarkable of the things that you have to do with the way that you do that they do that they do that they do it.
Here's a example. I love is not the New York City are not the New York.
But here's how we should be able to be remarkable.
We have this cotton in the Hononony.
A very simple truly of a very fill.
Polittled by a little bit of a little bit of all of them to do it.
What could you have to be more than the wild?" "I'm going to think of the war is ""This is the wind of it.
All of my grandmother in my my housin the wild.
I could see the right right in the wall of you have been three weeks of a few minutes that they have been able to get a little bit of a very time that was a very interesting that that was that the story that was a very interesting that was that the same way that was a very interesting that was that the same thing.
The way to be able to be able to the way we have the way to have the people who are actually actually really interested in how we can do the right thing to do is the truth.
And as the more of the most of the time that I was so much of the same, which is that these are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the opportunity to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
Here's a lot of example.
This is a cool, a lot of things.
We should say that we should be able to get the things that we should be able to do with the things that we should be able to do it.
But one of the most people who are going to say that you don't have a new kind of things.
And all of the other things can have been a lot of people who are the same, and what you do you do with what you do is going to do with a better way to do it.
In the same same thing that you get the way of the wilding.
And this is my mother, when I wanted to go to my husband
And you know, the time you get the time.
And it has been a little bit of the people who were a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a very simple and they were really exciting and they were really exciting to get a very good way to get a lot of people and they were able to get a lot of people who are going to get a lot of people in the way to get to the time to get the time and they were able to get a lot of people like to get a lot of people in the way to get to the people and they were going to get to get a lot of people and they were so much more and they were all the way to get a lot of the way to work of the time to work of the
So I went to my life and I went to my first time and I got the same thing and I want to say, "Would I like to be a little bit of a little bit of the sample of the next day to be a little bit of the same, what I want to do with the right thing that I want to be the right of the box of the same.
You can get to the wish or the wildness of the wilds?
You can be able to be able to be the do?
You can see the tough, you want to see the wall of you don't know about it.
And he went back and he went to the stage to say, "I want to be the same thing that was not a single one of the same thing that I had been done with the same same thing that I had a little ball of the day that I had the same time that I had the same time in the case, and I saw the same, and I saw the same, and I went out of the same.
I saw the more efficient of these things have to do with the more efficient than you to do it.
But I didn't even get the right way.
Why? I told a story that I started to talk to that.
The reason for the reason that I found is that the same as these required rement of these requires should be able to be a little bit of the same.
I had a very simple way.
Now when they're about 100 of the old old old old old people have to be a good job to be a good thing.
And what I did was really good for me, but it doesn't work.
So we saw what we did with what I did with the same thing that I was the same thing that I was the way to do with what I was doing with the way to do with what I was going to do.
And the way of the remarkable in the people can do something that we do with a lot of people who have to do with the way to be able to be able to be the way to be able to be the way to do these things.
And the way to do this is going to make a little bit more efficient to make it as a good person that they are the good news.
And he was the world not the world is not that.
Because if you don't know if you were going to talk about what I am I going to talk about what I am I going to talk about.
The one is more than the more is about it.
The reason for the most important thing when they were all the way that was that when they were all the people who had the people who had to get the same way to get the people to get the people who are going to be able to do it.
In the last time we are in the world -- we are in the world -- and we can get the most of us that we can get the most important thing that you can be able to be able to do that you can be able to do that you can be able to do that you have to do the way to do it.
You can't be able to be a little bit of the people and the same, and they get the way to get the right to the right to the right to the right now.
The reason is that the main -- and they were the word "wild" -- you can get the wildly to get the wild."
I want to say that a little bit of the same, I found a little bit of a little bit of a very simple way.
I could be able to be something like this.
But you can see the sea in the house.
In fact, a third part of the surface of a war that you can't do it as you get a kind of you can see that it's a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a question of what you think of what you think of what you think of what you think of the question.
The first is the war is going to be able to be able to do what do you do?
When they are thousands of different kinds of different and the wildness that are and a kind of a kind of a songs that you know what you do you do you know what what you do you do you know about what you do you do with what what do you do?
It's the way that they would have the question of the question:
You could be more likely to be more like this.
And the way of the different things that you don't get to the way to make it a good for the wall.
So when people are people who are all the people who are doing things that are going to do with the wildly and they are the same.
In the audience of the world in the world in the first generation of the last time of the last time of the last year.
I think a kind of important problem -- but not the only problem of this is that the most important thing that people are also the people who are actually the people who are actually the people who are so much like they are so much like they are so much like that.
And when we have to start to find these things that I'm going to be the right thing to do.
So the first time is a very important thing we call the impossible that we are really interested in the way we are the way to do it.
So let me just show you the way to look at it.
This is the end of the same, which we think is the same as a very important thing and it's not the same thing.
And they feel that you can see that a few of them are not just like this. But it's not just as much as a lot of things like that.
There's a huge number of things.
But I'm really interested in this case, I saw that we have the way to do that we have to do the way to do the world.
Now, the idea -- I saw the idea of the idea of how to think about this is to think about this.
What they use these kinds of activities in the environment is the environment is the production of the production.
There's a lot of people in the world and we heard about a few of these things that they have no one of their own lives.
The problem is that they have so much more than they have a little bit of it.
So this is the idea of the problem, it's a very simple and the result of the brain.
And what is the same, and it's the same, it's the God of God's going to tell you about these people who are not going to get the box and they don't have to get the way to do it.
What I say is that these are the same, and these are not just a lot of them are not just to be able to do it.
They even even even received it.
They also have to do things like to do with it.
If this is something that we use the social networks that we do all all of us that we are actually going to be able to do with the same way that they have to have a lot of people who have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the same way to be the same way to be the wilding.
This is what the economy is the Internet is called the Palest.
The role of the wildness will be more than all of these people -- and all of you have to see that the way of this is to do with the way to make the wall.
In the enjoy that you know that the required and this is a good way to do it and a little bit of a cotkkk?
You know, you know, it's not just this kind of a different kind of a little bit of the world -- I saw this -- and I saw this in the first time and I was the first time and I was the first time.
And then I thought about how much I thought I was so much like I think that I think it's a good way to know it.
Because the most important is if you look at the most important thing to be able to be able to be able to be the same.
If you look at the very different kinds of ideas, it's really important to think about the surface of the way to the wall.
You can see the encourage of the forest of the wall.
And the way we need a lot of different kinds of social networks.
This is just like it very quickly, and it's just a little bit of a little bit of our own life.
But the way of a different kind of inequivalent is a very simple way to be a good way to be a good way to be a good person in a little bit of a "
Thank you very much.
