LH: I did a TED I did an introduction to LHC.
And I promised to come back and give you a data about how this is that they work on the apartment.
So here I go. And for the ones that didn't have been here, LHC is the largest scientific experiment that was asked for the 27-kilometers or is to recreate the contains of a two-kilometers or is to create the present of a billion times a fraction of a second to a billion-second second second to the universe -- the panel to creation from a second to the universe -- the panels of the universe.
It's extremely about both sides.
This is the Geneva.
We photographs of these minds "Big Bangs" inside of the decades.
I work on this. It's called the ATLASS detector, Lunaimeter -- Luntin 22 meters of a 22 meters here of ATLAS -- in building the building of ALAS in building the building to you can see the proportion.
On the 10 seven, I went out for the last year, I started the first data.
And this picture was the ATLALASS.
It caused to be a huge celebrating in the control room.
It's a picture of the first main particle that has quarted over the whole thing that has been in the LHC, crossing system of LHC deliberately by detector.
In other words, when I saw that 10 seven, I knew that 10 seven, I knew that the machine is an enormous successful success.
I don't know if that got the largest own, or this is that when someone went on the page of Google and the first page of this step.
It means that we did a cultural impact on the wall of the Rusintific.
And after about a week I had a problem with the machine that actually had to do with these days.
Those are put in a fire of a thousand ample that the maximum is working on the maximum of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of a 3,000 of the transport of the transportation of the transportation of the bubble in the fire of the flows of the fill of the motor of the motor of the motor that they are when the maximum
Now, engineers in the room, they look at these days, and they say, "You can't transport."
But I can do this because when they're at the temperature fear of what is called the superconducting.
So at 27, there is a degree of the sea of the step, and the fire can transport these customer can transport these customers.
At one of the layers of the '9,000 manets in LHC, was a factory of factory in the LHC, was a factory of factory in the LHC,
So the company was sicking a little bit of fun and the 13 thousand ample were talked the electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressive, and they are now spread over 20 tons of ton, and they moved about 30 cents of the tose.
So we determine about 50 magnetic magnetic make;
We had to take the outside, which we have to do.
I reconvicted on all the way to the tox, I repair it.
And now we take the magnetic and then in subteran.
Pana at the end of the March marine March Ten is going to be like it as new as well.
We're going to start again, and we are always going to get data in the sweet or her, and we're going to keep the research to find out the tools to find out the universe.
Now, of course, that in a way, those accidents of the importance of the importance of science and engineering the importance of extreme to break out to break the off.
I think it's so much because it's so hard to be so difficult to be the same inal of the fact that we have young people like LHC.
So I'll leave that with the words of a British of Britance, Humphrey Davely, who I think that when applications are not the protected experiments of protection, that is Michael Faraday, "Num" is not for the progress of our minds to our minds are finally finally honestly assessed to our debate decade, and that are not the same mystery, and that is not an enough, and that we are not finishing our births are not finished, and that we have been don't.
Thank you.
I want to start with the rate of the kid, when you have your childhood, when you have to play with box.
On the main you invite them to get up and raise them and get them and get them and get them to learn how to get to the way to understand the spatial issues and manipulate the spills.
The hospitals are deeply to how we understand how we understand a lot of the world in inconclusion.
So, in the quality of IT instruct that I replied by our own own own own own own own -- impreparing with my own Pattian Kalanii -- I started to start to inforce my Jeevan Kalanithia -- I would start to do a computer, in this unlike when we use a computer to a computer demand that we can use a digital flow of this un-screening visually if we can use both both of us to put in the digital and put together and put it on a computer to be both both both of the digital divigorgegegeon the next to the digital divide to be both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both male of the digital emitself with a computer, and put together and put together and we can put on a computer and we can we
It looks like how do we want it?
The question was so much about this was so that we hocked the research we had the answer to build Sishe'd put Swealth of Stttable to this Sttable to this question of the fascinating was so much by the way,
In short, Sifting a little bit of a biscal biscket.
They can be manufacturer they can perceive the desire can perceive the way of altered the foundation of the altered of the wireless of the wireless of the wireless of the wireless of the reference.
The most important is that it's palpable. So you can see the game, you can see them as they can only get them to the way they can only get them to the way they get them to the way they get them to them.
And Sifts offer the example of an ecosystem of the shape of the digital manipulation of the digital manipulation.
On the magic of these tools become more palpable and more and more constitutes of other, and the constitutes of the nutritions of our nutracks and destroyed new style to interact to interact with new styles of interaction.
I'm going to start with a simple example.
This Sifying is confifident to represent picture, and if you include it by a direction, and if they include the movie of the other part, they drive back.
These are the interactive are constellations of one of the other one of the other side.
So if I put them one to the other thing, they become interested.
If they're inconclusion, they see and this is a little bit of confused to be a little bit of confused to be a little bit of confusion.
and I can feel the miss and inclination.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of interaction is that we can use the same way we can use the data, how we could we use the table of how we would have a colleagues like a cold liquid of a liquid liquid involve a liquars.
In this case we have three Siftapes that we have a voice like the voice and they can use the color in the center of the center, where they will fall the way to the center, where they will fall the way to the center,
If we can get too much, we can get the dot back.
There are also interesting possibility for education, how would be games and sense, mathematical and logical ways we want to want people to want to determine the results of the way we want to see the results immediately the results of immediately as well.
So here I -- this is a Fibonacire that I do with a simple program that makes a simple program of equation.
This is a game of the former former of the words of Scrabs between Scrabs and Boggle.
Basically, in every first first one of the first one of the sample on every Sif, and on the magic of the words, they're really great, they are grew with a dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds of the second seconds red, and you have a new set of letters, and you have a new set of incleaning and we are incleaning in the last 30 seconds of the seconds of the seconds of the second where they reached a seconds are severely in the same seconds are re-seconds of the letterring out the letters
Thank you.
This is nistses in children who came up to the Media Laborator Media, and I came up with them and I had been able to film a material.
He liked them to crazy.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of applies is that you don't have to give them many other people's skills.
All you have to say is "Fa words are doing exactly what to do.
This is another few people who are asking them.
This is the most tanker testing in our right.
It turns out that everything he wanted to do was to do was to do it was to be a Siftable of one over the other.
So for him were just customers.
This is a kind of animated animats.
We wanted to build a tool, for the people who invest language.
And this is Felix.
He can introduce new characters in the scene, just raise those Siftapes that they can be the personajectectectors.
This is introduced sun.
Video: The race.
David Merrill: Now he introduced a stage in the scene.
Video: Hor's portrayl.
Very y! Y!
When Sifying the Sifting and assigned one of the other and the other way to interact -- Video: Wideo: Ham!
DM: create a narrative of the narrative.
Video: Hello!
DM: It's a open-end, and he decided, and he decided.
Video: Zboard, peak!
DM: The last example I have time to show you today is a lot of the time that we have to interpretty, and interprett, and where we built the role of sounds like the role of sounds like rhythm and all bad.
Each of these are four different variations that you want to use that you want to use it.
And you can get the sounds of a succession that you can see the same time you can see the same as you can see the same thing as you can do.
Shel off, you know, the sounds of sounds like a Siftable of succession.
There is effects that you can control the lights, how they would be reverberation and the filter of the filter.
You can see it as a certain sounds and then including it to help it reaches to help it.
It goes into the general effects like the pipe and the volume that applied the entire century of it.
Video: MM: We will start with a rhythm in two Siscameras we were throw in a serious amount of a serious one.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: DM: Now add a few of the dangerous.
Video: MM: And I'm going to add the movie, to control the top, to control the whole light.
Video: MM: I can be the whole sequencing century or annoyed in a part or elder.
Video: DM: Now I'm going to leave the bag, and more except for more expression.
Video: MM: I can reach out the door the quantity.
So I don't have to do the plan, can improvise, they can improvise, or a short of walking from the words.
Now, in advanced the whole base of the entire century of using the Siftape, inclined in the stangle of the state in the stangle.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is the creation is the creation of new interfaces that they apply better with our brain.
And today, we had time to show you a coordination of this new spatial of this new class that we try to get out of the lab.
The Gandon who I want to retiny is that we are at the new generators with this new generators with the middle of the digital world, which will bring information from our rule to our rule to our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of the rules of is that we are at the rest of our regulation of the world with our regulation of the way to our digital rule with the rest of our regulations of the world.
Thank you very much.
And these wisely with nerships to talk about you all of you are all going to be all of you.
I'm writing.
He written is my teaching is my teacher, but it's more than that.
It's all my love loads and fascinating a via a living.
And I don't have this kind of thing to do is change it.
But this is what was called "weird in the life and in my career and in my career who determined me to recycled my whole relationship with work.
And the odd thing is that I wrote this book, this is called "Mananua, Roaguit," which Roaged "Holy of all the books that categoryed in the world for a little bit of the world for a little bit of a little bit, and became this international senational sensible international.
The answer is that anywhere now I'm doing now, people treat me now, people treat the time.
Serioio, convicted -- condemand a conamate!
Will you for the ingrijors, "Don't you know it's theme -- don't you want to be able to be able to be able to be able to degrade performance?
You don't know it's going to go to the whole life of your life that you can do the time to make a book that you can get the world on the world that ever go on the world that ever will ever go on the world on this?"
It's very linked to true.
But it would be more like I didn't have all of the time that I didn't know about 20 years ago, when I was trying to get the people -- I want to become writer, and I loved the same kind of a memory reaction of the same kind of Africa.
And people said, "You don't have a little bit of you don't have any success?"
Don't you know that humility will be killing your breathers will kill you kill it?
Don't you see that the whole life of your life in this field of life in this field of the field of here and you will be a death of a boy of the filled with the mouth of the screen of the scream?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the short answer to all those questions is """"""""""""
Yes, it's the theme of all of those things.
And always hated me.
And you have been a lot of other things that people can't get macles that people can't get smoke.
As for example, the big algorithm and other things that are crucial and other things that are cruelated.
But when it's about the work that I was always thinking about the last time I was like, "What do I have been "What?
Is this rational?
It's logic to that anybody to be able to be able to do that they feel like they were destroying to do this Pame.
And what is so many of the creative initiativity, which seems like we are really looking at the healthcare of the health of some of the teachers don't do it?
My father was my chemistry was an engineer and you don't remember that in the 40 years of you have a chemistry to be asked, if anybody can be asked, it's a chemist.
It didn't happen -- John, how does the block in the chemic?
It just doesn't happen that way.
But to be honest, engineering chemists, like group not so much of the group of reputation of reputation to be alcools of maniactical maniactical maniactors.
We write the innation, we have this reputation, but we don't just write, but artists, it seems like this reputation of all the kinds of reputation to be powerful for us to be powerful for us to be powerful in the way to be powerful for it.
And everything we have to do is look at the numbers of the numbers only in the 20th century, in the 20th century, which have been died by young people and often often often often with their own man.
And even that they didn't know about their own page was really destroyed by the destruction of your own talented.
Norman Mailer, even before you did, he said, "Each of the last interview, he said, "Each me a little bit more than a little bit more t."
A great great great great characteristic about your own work.
But I don't clear when we hear someone saying that we hear anybody in the fact that we heard these things like these things like this, and we have unaccepted and unacceptable to collectively collectively and suffer and suffering and suffer is somehow to make sure that the suffer is going to take away from the suffer suffer to the suffer suffer on a end of the suit that the suffer to be all of the same times as well.
And the question I want to add this today is that all of this is you all of this is the idea?
You are comfortable with it -- because as it can see the eye of the lie -- I don't care about this ipocket.
I think it's odizzz.
And I also think it's dangerous and I didn't want to see it in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage our big artistic to train the artists.
And I know that I know my case, in my case, in my case, in my way to start to start to inqueue, especially for me to the cartoon this ipocket now that I find a circumstance.
For example, I'm pretty tanker for for for 40 years.
We probably have been probably four decades before you have the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of
And it's very likely to be able to write this moment to be judged by the way that the work that the work of my success of the last book, right?
What would be to say to the men, because of the ones here we are all the ones here we are all the ones that are very likely to be happen.
Oh, God, what God!
This is the kind of the way that could make someone you want to go to the nest morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I do to do in continue this message that I love it.
And then, the question becomes it?
And so I think it was a lot of meditation, like this -- to work now to make a bit of a psychological construction, it's by a kind of psychological construction, right?
I had to do that, I had to find a way to fly a distant distant to the unit that write, and my graduate lawyer to the thing that will be in the way to what it was writing about what it is going to do.
And as we all go into the last year -- I started to look at this sense, and I tried to find other society to see other society to see other society to be able ideas of how to be helping people to be helpful ideas of how to be helpful risk of our emotional risk to the emotional risk of artes.
This researcher this has been taken me to the ancient and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma was in Greece of this research.
So I mean, you have the certainly the circle.
But in the Anyway, Gomen and Rom's Rom's Rom's income from the inside of the human nature, right?
People thought that creativity was a spirit was a spirit that the people who are pounds of people who are poor unintelligence and unintelligent and unintelligent reasons and intelligence and intelligence.
The footprints called these spirits of the famous creativity.
It was famously famously because he thought he had a demon that he had a department that the wisdom of the wisdom of department.
The human were were the same pared, but they called the imateral, the imaterials.
What is great, because they were not really thought that a very unfortunate of a very unfortunately was a very destroyed.
They thought a genius was a kind of magical entity entitled by the way, what the fact is the one of the artist's studio as Dobby, as Dobby, the spirit of the houses of the artistic and unable work of her work in the work, the model of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the artistic
Absolutely -- this is really the distant thing that is the distant that I was talking about your psychological building that to protect your workers.
And all the world is that it works, right?
So the ancient artist was protected by things like this, like too much narcisism, right?
If your work was stralucalym was the whole world for her, you couldn't take this for the world as you have this genius that helped the tricky of the ball that helped me.
If your work was critical, it wasn't completely completely the sell of your job, isn't it?
Everything that you have your gene as you were kind of ignorance.
So they looked at people in the West for a long time for a long time.
Then he came Renasting and everything that was changed, with a certain main with a certain main was to put the man in the center of the universe and mysteries and mysteries that receives the way to creates the debt of the display for the divin.
It was the human sweet of rational, and people started to create the creatures that the creation of the individual in the individual of the individual of the individual of the individual people.
And for the first time in the history of people started talking to one or one of the other artists like genius, instead of making a genius.
And you have to married, I think it was a huge error.
Persian myself, a simple person, to create the receptor is actually the receptor is actually the receptor and the synthesis actually a little bit of the mystery is a bit too much too much too much more responsibility is a bit too much more responsibility for the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile
It's like you would ask you to get the wire to inghesheshess.
It's just incovering and they deformed all these together, and the generen't imaginable to realize performance performance.
I think that press us this is killed us one of the last 500 years ago.
Well, if it's true, and I think that is what do we do we do?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we go back to the older sends of the relationship between people and myself.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't just get to sterile 500 years of human human ancient in a human ration's ration's rush of 18 minutes.
And probably they are probably in people in the public that would raise the application of the theme, the fact that people are throwing on the the, which they are throw people and all their projects and everyone.
It probably won't cooperate to the whole idea.
But the question I want to ask is -- why don't I want to do it?
Why don't we think about this?
Because it has send send send something else, we have heard about the explanation of the very unnelusive of the creative process.
It has to be able to do something -- basically to create something -- basically all the people here -- you know, it's not always a rational.
And, in fact, sometimes you can go to the paranormal.
And I had a task where I met the great American Ruth of America, who had been known for 90 years and that has been the bridge of the entire life of the entire life and that was the poet that he told me that when the kid's life was going on on on the wall.
The story of it was like a split of the same.
And they fall over the campaign over the camps.
The sense of income in because it's gone is the ytap under the leg.
At that point has a single thing that it has a single thing that is, "Waw, to hurt as a applat."
And it goes like to the top of the hour the houses of poem, and the whole idea was to get to a piece of the map of the map of the map of the map and put it on it on the map and put it on it on the map.
Sometimes it wasn't enough to be a lot of it and runs and run, but it didn't go out and run, but he didn't go to the poems and the poems of the roots, and she loses his way to the rosten the roots, and I read it "another poet the room, I read "another poet -- a poet that I was a poet and he was like, "An another poet and he was not going to be al."
They were also about where -- and this is not going to look at this time -- the moment that the story of almost losing the story of almost losing it.
Her run, the house, and the poems and the poems and the car, and the story of his creature, and the story of him with the other man's other, and he was going to take it and through the other and the print.
The bridge of the code and the tree and then they put it on the table on the map of the magic of the main math.
So in the situation, the poems of the perfect applies, but it would be undouble-to-day making, from the last at the last word.
When I heard it -- it's just the suprantum was just how my own creative process.
My creativity, it doesn't receive this -- I'm not drive!
I'm a catching -- and the way they work to go out every day and go to the same day and translate me and take it to be so weight to go out and get it wrong.
But even in my housness, I was so much to me and I was so much to me sometimes that phenomenon.
And I imagine that they were both in the same way they were many of you.
And I was able to have projects or ideas that they came from a source that I don't know what they know is to be able to identify it.
And what do you do you all this?
And how do we should be reported to report us so they don't lose our minds, you know, we don't lose our minds, you know, we are healthy to reach our ancies?
For me, the most relevant in the day of our days, that we have to do is the musician of Tom Waits, I took a lot of years to be a big interview, in the demand in the demand in the demand in the demanding demanding the demanding of the days.
I was talking about this and all of this and Tom was almost all the way to the modern artist of the contemporary artistic artistic and to control these impull of controlling and gain, to fly controlled by completely completely inside the orders.
With the time he was taught and you get the story like a day of the story as a result on the street to Los Angeles and then everything that changed.
As I drive a short time of a short fragmented from a piece of the song that comes to the mind, as it turns out, as it turns out, as if you will, it's not the inspiration and a little bit of the wise, it's not how to ape.
It doesn't have any of you hadn't hadn't hadn't really created.
It was all the old that old old anxiety inner "A to lose the task for the banker for always to the money for always one.
I'm not good enough to reach a remaining to remain it.
And instead of the panick, just stopped it.
He stopped the whole thing and he did something everything and everything else and everything else.
He raised the sky and said, "You don't see that they're volan?"
"Are you going to write a little task, you know, you can write a little do?
If you want to be really in the way to be able to do it in a moment of youth.
If you don't take your one of the other today.
Go and you get to Leonard Cohen."
The whole creative process has changed the process.
Not the operating is not as much as it turns out that they always have a little bit of all that way.
But the process is in the process, and it was the whole thing that he took the moment in the moment of the moment he took the skyscan, and he took the way to go back to the road it goes back to the way back to the way to be something that it doesn't have to be something attached to to the inside and China.
It could be this unique collaboration, and the bizarre in the form of a conversation between Tom and the extent of the extent that wasn't like Tombie that was not too too too was like Tomor.
And after I heard the story of the story I started to change a little way that I was saved the data.
This approach me to the middle of the notion of "Mananua, Roaged House Humest," and I would all find out when we work with the wild of the wild that we are looking at the same point, and you would think it be a disaster, and it would be a proposition, that it would be the most propositions of the most proposit would be the most propositive.
Not just that, but the most propositive, the most propositive.
I had to think we should just think we should just abandon the project.
And then I remember all the way to the open, and I tried and I asked her hospital.
I took me to raise my manuscript and I brought my comments to a colleagues a colleagues a colleagues of the room.
I said to voice itself, "Lat," and you know that if you can know if this book is not going to be great to my go, right?
Because you can see that I put on the battle on the battle on the ball of the way to the base of the attacker and so on.
So if you want to be better from it, you have to be your apartment and you have to do your apartment.
Okay. And if you don't do this, you know, you know, you all -- you know, you all have to do this.
He would write to the story because this is my message to my message.
And I want to consists for that I did my three-to-day my third side."
Because -- the Conclusion is -- by hundreds of years ago, in the North Africa, they would have not to get to the tbattle to the till of the till of the footprint and music in a range to the range to the range to the range of hours of range.
And they were always wondering, because the dancers were the teachers and they were remarkable and they were remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable and were remarkably initive, right?
But sometimes very roughly something happens, and one of the fact that the fact is the fact that it's really about the community.
I'm convinced you you you know what I mean you all meant to you, because all of you know about a certain moment of the interpretation.
It's like the time it stops and the dancers is through a kind of porting part, you know, it's not something different than one of the other 1,000 sers, all of 1,000 sers, everything else.
It doesn't seem to be in the whole thing that it would be in the whole man.
It's liked out of the bottom and the bottom is the diving.
And as you know, when it goes to people knew what was called the numbers were saying,
and they were both the hands and they were "Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, Does, Games, Dows, Dows, Dows, Games, God."
It's God.
A interesting among announced -- when the main Spanish have taught the Spayment of the Spayment of the century was transformed over the century of "Allah," "Allah," "Alle" in "oles."
and they hear the fibers of the fight of the base of the flash.
In Spania, when a interpret has been able to do something impossible and magic is "Allah Tol, ollah, magical, means, the magnetic ar."
Her is smart -- a God's dress.
It's great, because we need to have something like this.
But the second part of the second day morning, when the dancers is selling and discovering that it's not a scale, and it's not a scale.
It's a dirt's dirty that you can not get the genes and you might not be able to do not worrying about it.
Would you want to do not get the name of Domb, when he was shown that he should be able to do with the rest of his life of his life.
It's hard.
It's one of the most paid of the most painful of the creation.
But it can't be a big tuned if you don't think about it if you don't think of the most extraordinary part, like your most awful bees from the inside of your eyes come from the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside the world.
Maybe if you were able to think about a result of the inkling of a little bit of the life of the life of the next to be dating data from the next to be dating data to be more and more of the moments.
If we think about it is so much starting to change.
I started thinking and I think and I was sure that the last months of the last months of the last months of the book that will be publishing the forest, perhaps, dangerous union, and the crypical crypy of my success.
And what I do, I do to do is when you get the cure is: Don't be the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-beaten does, and you do the cure of it,
It won't spread. You can just go and get the Continy of the Continy Convention.
If you get dance, then you dance, then dancing.
If the gene comes and excentric what you know is repair to get to the whole thing to hit the extraordinary of your effort through your efforts of your efforts --
And if no, they dancing anyway.
And all of these "le!" for you.
I think we should be teaching them.
"Hello!" for you, you just because you have a loap for humans and incaping for humans to participate in continue to participate in continue.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We talked about some of these projects, about human genome and what would be interesting to predict the human genes.
Now we start to a new point from a new biology, we have digital biology, and now we try to start to start to start to start in a new code of biology, modeling and synthesis of biology, and synthesizes of biology, and synthesizes of life.
We all the time to put us together and we tried to put our big questions.
"What is life?" It's something that many biologists have tried to understand to the different level.
We tried different approaches, simple ways of thinking about the basic components.
We are already about 20 years ago.
When I sequenced the human genome -- this is that the human rich of biology in the digital world in the digital world in the digital world.
Now we try to ask the question: Can we regenerate our life, or we can create new forms of life, in this digital universe, in this digital university of this digital university of it?
This is the map of a little organism Mycoplasma genitalium, which has the most of the genitalium, which can replied the only one of the lab.
We tried to see if we can come up with a smaller genome.
We were able to support the order, a hundred genes in the judge of 500 that are there.
But when we look at his metabolic map is pretty simple in our compared to our compared to our compared to our our compared to our our eye map of the map of his metabolic map of his metabolic map of his metabolic map of his metabolic map of metabolic map of metabolic map in our metab
And think that is simple. That's simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can get the first moment is probably a little bit of a life that is probably a little bit like this to produce.
So we decided that the only way we actually decided to stand to stand to stand to stand so that we can see the summer the components to ask some of the most fundamental questions.
And so I started on the road, "Can we s" the synom?"
Maybe the chemistry allows these synthesizing molecules that we never made any more of the molecule that we ever did ever do it?
And if we can take a crosis a crosis a crosis of a crosis of a crosis if you can take a crososis if we can take a crososis if we can take a crososososome, can we take a crososome, can we take a chromosome, can we get a crosomerosomerrow a crosom?
A crosome, by the way, is just a piece of chemical.
So our speed of digital life has increased the digital raising of life exponentially.
Our ability to write code code are moving so slowly slowly but it grew up there.
And the last time he got to an exponential curve on the same way.
I started this about 15 years ago.
We went through a few of the hill, actually, with a bio-ethic examining the first experiment.
But it turns out that the synthesis that the DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that make tiny little DNA, long enough to 50 letter to 50 letter the next general process, so that what you build a long piece of soon as a long as the chair.
So we had to create a new method to put these little bits together and the right and the right of the errors.
This was our first tentative, I start from digital information, to steal the genome of the Phi of the Phi X 174.
It's a little virus that killed bacteria.
We made the kill of the kitches, and we went through the right of errors, and I got a molecule of DNA DNA DNA of a letter of a letter of a letter of a letter of the kinds.
The interesting thing that was when I took this piece of chemical material, and we put it in the bacteria, and we put it into this bacteria, and we could put this cogenetic cogenetic cogenetic cogenetic code,
The viral partics were then released out of cells and they were returned and killed the cells of the E.L.
I was talking to the oil industry of the role industry and they said that they were doing this model.
They have laughter more than you are.
And so we think this is a situation where the software can actually build their own madware in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something larger.
We wanted to build the entire crosis of a bacteria.
This is over 5,000 letters of 5,000 letters.
So we said to put the wall the letters in the size of the size of the virus to actually understand the size of the size of the houses of a via cell cell phone.
The design is critical, and if you start with digital information, that information has to be very clearly very clearly is very good to be very clearly accurately accurately being very clearly very cleaning to be very cleaning the digital information, and if you start to start with digital information.
When I sequenced this genome in 1995, the assessment was a error at 10,000 of the basic payments of the basis of the basic basis of the basis of the basic steps.
We found it, in the reference, 30 to reach 30 herself in the original century, this was never able to be activated, that could never be activated.
Pir in design is the design is the project, which has to be a little bit of a little bit of a few other pieces of fun to build 50 letters to build smaller sub-grandmother sub-grandmother sub-grandparents to be compatible with each other with them.
We are doing unique elements.
You may read that we put "waters" in the hous." Grush to this: We have a gene code from four letters, Mr. T.
Triday of those letters, those letters -- those letters about 20 recently recently -- one literally acizes every racing of the acia.
So we can use the genetic code to write words to write words worked.
Ininitially, all we did was to be shown the code.
Some of them were disappointed that it's not poetry.
We designed those pieces so that we can see them was with enzyme.
They're aszzzzling and they are hurt them.
So we started doing the joke, starting with five to 7,000 lets up to 7,000 letters, and then they can make them join them for 24,000 lets the table to put the stones in these 2,000.
Each every step of these pieces of these loops to the abundance to sequence them to sequence them to try to create a very range -- as you can see a very roughly rode.
We try to get to that automatically automative.
So, this is like a basket.
When we get to the very large pieces of 100,000 payments of the basis not growing up so much more than the collight.
They are all all the modern molecular biology of modern molecular biology.
So we went to other hanism.
We knew that there is a mechanism, called recombination of biology that the biology that is using DNA, and that is using DNA, and that is really exciting to be happy and that they can be happy
This is an example.
There's a organism called Deincoccucucutting millions of rats that can be the portrait of millions of radiation.
As you see in the blood panel in his crosis is destroyed.
Two to 24 hours later, he put it back to the new waves like it was starting to start to start to skier.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be all all of the body.
They can live in the living in the living in the living in the life.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the exhibition in the exhibition of exhibition to find a new environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is going to happen there.
This is a micrographical micrographical microbes that we built using these proposes that using only the drugs with only the heat of the market design that we put in the market.
Drojja with automatically put them together in the
This is not a picture of a microscope with electrons, but just a to-micro-graphic to-micro-graphic micro-graphic image.
It's a big molecule that we can see it with a microscooptic.
These are images collected over a course of about six seconds.
This is an audience that we had a little bit of time.
These are over 5,000 letters of 5,000 letters code genetic code.
It's the largest molecule ever done with people, with a defined structure of people, with a defined structure.
It has a molecular molecular in 300 million millions of miles.
If we take it with a 10 and without a space of 10 and no space to get to interested in this genetic code.
So how do we start a crosis of crosis what do we do?
Evivil with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
And it's also easy when you get to the euutral of the new: you can just put the nuclear nuclear and put the nuclear and that is something you all heard -- cloning.
With the archa, the chain is integrated in the cell, but we showed that we can do a cure that we can do a completely completely transplant to the other one of the other at the other, and we can activate it.
We had a crowd of a microbial species.
The second is about as people and so much as people and a little bit like people and some kind of the people and a little bit of the two of these are the same way as well.
We put a few genes in addition to to this cross-eye for this crose.
We had it with enzymes to kill all the protein.
And it was pretty amazing when we put in the cell -- you'll appreciate our grafing grafts -- and the crosis has entered in the cell.
In fact, I thought this is how far it can go out and go and we tried to design the process of something more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and we thought we were trying to design the way it goes to go and go away,
This is a major mechanism,
We find all kinds of species that have corporated a second crosis a second crosis a three-way of the third part, in another part, in another wave of new feeding new numbers in a second.
So the people who think about evolution just as a single gene of changing the biology.
I'm called restricted restricted by restriction, which actually had the DNA that were actually worked.
The noise that was in the cells that was not a lot.
The clever -- the crosis that we put us --
It was expressed and he recognized the other crosis like the street, and we just got it with the crosis to the new crosis to the new crosis the new crosis the new chosome.
It became blue because of genomes that we put in the crosis that we put in the crose.
And after a very short time of time, all the characteristicated of a species have lost completely a new species in a completely new technology that we put in the cell that we put in the cell.
All the proteins were changed, the membranes were changed, is what we do is exactly what we transfer code in the genetic code,
This can soon as alchemistry, but we can move the DNA, but we can also change things pretty cruelatic.
Now, we support that it's not genesis -- but it has been to build three billion years and half years and we support that we can support that we can be a new version of the Cambria, which is a new version of magic that has a new magic specifically a new specific specifically a new specific design on the digital math.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obviously pretty obviously about the need of needs.
We're on the way to go from six and a half to six to a billion people over 40 years.
To put this in the context for me to me, I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for every one of us there were in 1946, in 40 years, will be four.
We have feed problems with housing watching water water and a few table of these six billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half of them and a half of the hats and a half of the house.
It will be difficult to do it for us.
We use over five billion tons of the book, more than 30 billion bars of bars of oil.
This is a hundred million bars a day.
When we try to think about biological processes or any of the biological processes that will be a huge challenge to be a challenge.
And then of course, it's all that CO2 is all the way that CO2 to this material, which goes into the atmosphere.
Now, from our discoveries around the world, we have a data that we have a database of the gene, and I like to think about these design design in the future.
The electronics is just a double-dozen or something like this, and this is the diversity that came out of this.
We are limited here, in the first one, biological reality and our imagination.
We now have the techniques of these quote quote step, to do what we call the genyet.
We have the ability to build a big robot that make a million crosis to make a day.
When you think about these 20 million different genes of different genes or trying to optimize the rate of the occurred procle process, or producing new pharmaceutututical and a little pharmaceutical, we can do more biology than the last 20 years, to do more biology than the last 20 years of all science.
And this is just standard.
We can select for viable viable substances for chemical or fuels, the production of vaccines, the city.
This is an eco-dol pattern of a design that we work that we work and work on to be able to work on these species in the computer.
You know, we don't know how it will show you.
We know exactly what they do is what their genetic code,
Now we are now focused on the four-generation.
You saw recycling that the mirror is just a bit of an un------en--by-experiment.
We have fuels fuel in the second and the third of the third and the third of the third of the range of compounds of high-value fuel or different kinds of flower or different buttons of the butterrain.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact impact on the food and the fall of the food costs and their limitation is if we start with CO2 as a maternal of the first stem cells to design to design to this go, and we think we will have the first of the fourth of the generation of the fourth in about 18 months.
Ten solar and CO2 is a method -- but in our discoveries around the world we have all kinds of other ways of other ways of other ways we have all kinds of other ways of the world and so many different ways of other ways of the O2 is a lot of the CO2 is a method and CO2 is a method of our world -- but in the O2 is a way of our world -- but in the world is actually in our world.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It goes into the deep ocean in the ocean ocean -- about two kilometers and half a deep, and half of the fear of the birth of the bears.
The CO2 in metan use of metan uses of molecular like the source of energy as a result of the energy source of energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 captured CO2 captured in the country, and we were converted to the same way CO2 to the fuel to lead this produced to the product to the product this one.
So one short period of time, we think we could have what is the basic question, what is the question, "What is the life question?"
And indeed, you know -- we have the patterns to replace the entire oil industry.
Yes. If you can't do that at TED, where another part.
To become a big source of energy.
But also, we work now to use these same same sources to invest in order to make a vaccine.
You saw this year, we always see the year at a year and a dollar in the minus when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think the situation can be changed by building vaccines that are driving vaccines that are doing the data.
Here's how it could start to show the future of changing the future of changing the evolution of evolution, accelerating the evolution of bacteria -- finally, the bacteria -- finally, the end, finally, the end, finally, the end, finally, of course, in the end, finally, of course,
We're almost to improve people.
Our goal is just to make sure that we have a lot of our opportunity to survive to survive so much more to be able to do this. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you the very quickly is a fundamental work of a new technology that we added up to Microsoft as much as we have to Microsoft a year. This is a year.
It's a environment that can interact with a lot of visual data in a lot of visual data in the visual data.
We now look at a lot of new new pictures and magnified by the digital and marriage in the continue to be able to anyone else.
It doesn't matter how much information we are looking at the big information is the images or how big images are the images of the big are images.
Most are pictures are taken with a common digital room, but this is a very unless and this is a scanning scanning scanner, for the World of the 300 meapixels.
It doesn't important because the only thing that we should limitate the performance of a way of the monitor is the number of pixels to a moment of a very data. It's also a very fly of a very flexible architecture.
This is a whole book of once a nonimaginative.
It's about "Chell Charles Dickens.
To show you that it's about text, and not imagine, and we can do that something like this, we can do that it's a real representation of a text; it's not a picture of a text; it's not a picture of a text; it's a picture of a text;
Maybe this is an artificial way to read a book in electronic form.
I would not recommend.
This is a more real. It's a "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian of "Gardian of a husband is a word.
Each image is the beginning of a section of a section.
This is really gives you a joke of a please of reading version of a part, which is inherently an inherent environment.
We did something little little of this little little cold with this number of "Gardian in "Gardian in "Gardian of the "Gardian of us and we did something we do and we did something smile with us and we have something smells with us with the cold of this number in the "Gardian in the "Gardianulanulanulanulans.
We created a fake reclaims to a very larger resolution -- and we have a very high fund -- and we have corporate a support.
If you want to see the properties of this machine -- you can see them.
Or other models, or even in technical specifications.
And this is actually by the certain ideas, the release of the limb of a monitor.
We hope that this is to be sweet pop-up and other people like this -- which are not necessary.
Of course, the mapping is one of the things that we have for a bit of this kind of thing.
I won't say a lot of time on this one, but just to tell you that we have contributed to this field.
These are all the road in the United States of the United States of NASA.
Let's go to now something else.
This is actually active on the Internet work; you can see the verified -- you can see
This is a project called Photosyn, which is the two different technologies.
and Rick Szeliski to Cerki Microsoft. A beautiful colleague.
This is the active active on the Internet.
You can see that when we create these kinds of perspective, when we can navigate through images we can have this kind of experience in a lot of solving experience.
But the space arrived, the space of these images really matter.
Algerian al-perception of visual perception have recorded these images together, so that they can code -- all of these pictures -- all of the Grases of the Western of the Western of Canadians -- they were shown -- they were shown to see these tools or panorry, and these elementary elementary projects, and these students were relation-opened space.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There are some that have much more space.
I'd like to go directly to one of the original steps of Noah -- that makes a big part of the Photosynth that I worked in the vast -- to show you what I think is the market that the market of this technology, just the Photosyn. It's not just by vision, not just visible to the website.
We had to care about the legal aspects of the legal aspects of the legal aspects of it.
This is a reconstruction of Catedral-Dams in the images of the images of the Damb on Flickr, and you find something like a little bit, and you find something like a couple of these contains are some pictures in these contains are found that would be found that they would find the coret is that they were found that they could see this pattern.
These are pictures on Flickr, and all were the relational remained space.
We can just not not to be in this way.
You know, I never thought I would go to Microsoft is very great to Microsoft is very much like to have a price here.
I guess that I'm a lot of the cameras they are a lot of the rooms at SLRs at LRs at SLRs LRs in LRs in this environment.
If you can find out the dynamics of these odds together.
They're so much mammmms, and so on.
One is going to be a series of photographs --
This is a poster with Nobel Dames who was recorded.
You can get you to a poster of a physical,
The idea is that I can do things with social environment. This means to collect data from all the world -- from a collective memory of what the Earth's visual memory of what the Earth's visual signs, they have been interconnected, they were interconnected to the summer than the summer than the summer part of the country.
You have a model of what comes out is all the entire Earth.
Think about this as the code of Stephen Lawler Lawler Lawler of the Earth.
And this is growing in complexity as the world as we use the world as well as they use them.
The pictures are the pictures of meters that someone else else has entered on the other side.
If someone would eaten all these villages and tell me who they are, then my picture of Hatedral Duman would improve with all these dates, and I could use it as a pattern to navigate the way to navigate the combined.
And of course, a very product of the base are and the rich of the rich and the virtual patterns of the Earth, collecting not only from the ground and images of the land and images of the village and images of a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: What will allow your software to allow your software to be like a moment of your data, is like a moment of the next few years, is like all the pictures of someone on the glob to be interrelation?
BAA: Yeah. Which does really do is to get the going.
It creates hyper-connected, if you want to know between pictures of the picture.
And it makes this based on the content of the image.
And this is becoming a quick of significant information that they have those images that have these images that have these images.
As you can do a picture of the Internet, you look at the Internet, and you look after the Internet is a lot of the Internet gives you a lot of information about what the picture.
Now, what would if that picture makes you connection to all the pictures of your picture?
So the amount of signal interconnection and wealth that is where the wealth of this is where the class of the remains.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible. Felicits.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense plants of the intense travel and one of the footprints of the footprints of the people who don't force the old box, who are still feeling of the raised by the pills of plots plot it in the leads of plot ploads of please please please please of please please please plants to the plants of plants of plants of plants that they have to the plane the plan.
You don't know that Jaguary Jaguary I wish still wish the Lace, or that the older of the older of the older of the wind of means, or that in Himalaia continues to tell our revelation of Dharming our revelation of anthropology, and this is actually an idea that we live in a sense that there is no sense, but it's just a sense of a model of the world that we live in a sense,
The consequences of a certain set of choices that we have to take our ancestors and success, even with success, and successful generations.
And of course, all we share the same imperative adaptive adaptive adays.
We all are born. We all bring kids to the world.
We go through the ritual ritual rate.
We have to do separate separate our death rate of morning, so we should all be surprised that we all play with art.
But what is interesting is the unit of the song of the song in every culture.
Whether is the Penan Penan Olneo in Boro in the Borneo, or war in Haiti, or the Wai, or the Kaut in the northern of the Curaut of the Curaut of the Curaut in the middle of Saharan in the middle of Sahara.
By the way, this is the guy that I traveled in the desert of the Qolar pants on Qolums of Qolums of the Moluma, the mom of the world.
All of these people learn that there are other kinds of things that we are other ways to think about other ways to think of the orientation to the Earth.
And this idea, if you think about to kill you like to kill you split up.
Now, the miridges of the world is form a spiral of spiral life that cover and culture, and it's as important for the biological healing as the biological supply of life, known as the biological network of life, knowing that the biological supply of life, knocks like that.
And you could think of this network of life as being the eaten as being able to define and you could define the summer of all of the dreams, intuitions of the advertising of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness.
Etnosphere is the main human ancests.
It's the symbol, and everything we can be like a surprising spectrum of iscoding.
And as the biosphere was severely the seeroes so and it can be a lot larger scale.
For example, no matter how much of the nice thing that would suggest that half of all the species was or more of all the species was or it's not true, because it is not true, and yet this -- the most -- the most of the biological diversity in the field of biological diversity -- it was about what we know the stage of what we know the stage in cultural diversity.

Well, the boxes are not feeling of nostalyes, not lose of nostalyers.
It's not too much for almost almost in the late of malaria in Asmen or in the Amaster wind in the wind window, but they created a traditional myself, they created a mystery of Earth, which is based on the idea of being able to be about by the idea of the idea that the Earth in the way that the Earth in the way that the Earth in the way that the Earth can only because it was addiction in human consciousness.
Now, what does this mean?
It means that a boy in And, who is grew up to believe that the Mount is the spirit will be a human being, will be a different human deep fire to be a different relationship to that resources to be different relationships, and that is going to be a different relationship to that a bunch of the moneye is a lot of my miner-a-for minery miner-endset.
It's the local is the local or a little bit of a minern is irrelevant.
Interesting is the metaphor that defines between individuals and the natural world.
I grew up in the U.K. in the U.K. to think that the birds were to be taught to be cutting for being taught to be boxed in the forest.

It's a picture of me in the northern Amazon the northern Amazon.
This is ayahuasca, which many of you would hear the most powerful psychopathoring of the failure.
Ayahuass is not just fascinating for the pharmacy, but for the preparation. It's made of his legacy for his prepage of two different sources.

If you ever saw the Yanometer of the Yanomami living that the crypes of the prized in the speculation is made of different species that contains and methods and they were all the way to the species that are all of the species that are all of the way that the Yylylthylthylthicked to the Yanomypties of the Yanomames that the fit of the flayers who are made of the treat is made of the fish.
He sits that break through the nose, is actually like you would be expulled by a baround, and attached to a baround, and aterizing a lot of electricity.
In fact, I was talking to my teacher Richard Evan Shulan Shulan Shult was a psychic of discovering discovering of the magicons in Mexicic 1930s.
I used to argument that you can't be the classified these tryptine flows like the moment you can do because in the moment that you are under their own coneffect is that they can be taken away from living with an orange. The problem with is that they can be taken order, because they're also called orders of a human human human aszed called the human killing oxytocin oxyl, called the human killing oxypine called the human oxygen, called the human human human killing oxypes called the human being.
They can be taken order, only with other compounds that they denied MAO.
Now, the fascinating thing is that the cars find the cars find in that time in that time is the MAO of the potential to the potential for the potential for a bypt: How would you get these two nurses of the 80,000 species of deaths that combined these two noses that combined in this morphology that combined a biological version that the whole whole by, have been a version of the whole best, that the whole best, which is the whole range of the whole base of the whole by?
Well, we use that woman, coverage, who is demade, who is often often often often like without sensense.
But you know, the Indians and they say, "Plants."

This trib Cofan 17 variety of ayahuasca, and they recognize all of them in the forest, and we see all of us as a species.
And then they ask them how they set their taxonomy and they said, "I think you know something about plants.
I mean, you don't you know no?" And I say, "No."
Well, we find that it takes every 17 different different different rates in a night night with a month to a different note in a different note in a different note in a different note in a different note in a different note in a different note to a different note in a different ways.
Now, this doesn't bring you a Ph.D. at Harvard, but it's much more interesting than the number of these are not interesting to the number of these are not interesting to the number of the newspapers.
Now, the problem is that until that was feeling of us who feel harmful with the hard blewing, we see as the bank of college, but as a result of the world, our teams as the world, our developing world, our world adverts as well.
The fact is that the 20th century, there will not be held minds for the wars or technology, but rather rather than than the technology we assisted as we assisted or we assisted or we encourage or we encourage the natural diversity and culture, on biological diversity is not change-changing biological and culture, on biological diversity is not changing.

From the dominant of the domination.
Where you look through the world, discoveries that are not destiny.
These are people living in the dinamong existence are in the gap that are on the ability that are all over their adapts.
Whether it's fun to fish farther the west of the Penbor of the Penbor nomorrow in Sarawake, in Sarawake, in Sarawake, and now all of a generation and now all of a generation, and now all of the sun and switch and swarm above mals, where you can see the ride of the snails and snapping out of the byards that looks at a lot of the Borrathic in the Borawaklady of the Blems of the Hor-for the Borgeon the Huntash of the main the Bladaways, and now that looks at a nosawaklorroute to a generation of the s' Dra
where the Japanese you have to fill the orizing hors with the pockets of the forest.
Or in the case of Yanomami are the diseases that came out of the exterior of the discoveries.
Or if we go to Talibet, where many researchers do a lot of researchers in the last time you can see the crude of political domination.
You know, the genocide, the physics of a popor is the universal demand it's condemand the way of life is not only the way of the poport, not only is it condemed the universal -- in many areas -- in many areas -- in many areas -- in many areas -- in many areas of development.

One day she had the way of doing Mao for Mao and for Mao for Mao to this crime in the crude of the crude of the hall.
The Tibet, the Tibet, but the practice spirit is something that is something like a admirror.
And finally, in fact, it's all about a choice.
Do we want to live in a monocromer of the monotony of the monocross of the romantic romance of diversity of diversity of diversity of diversity of diversity?
Margaret Mead, the big anthropologist, said before he said that he was that the biggest was that the largest generic and amorphans, and amorphans, and we can see the entire world of human imagination, but we will see the entire human imagination, but we will see in a more way of thinking about the vision of the vision of the vision of the dream.
And it's humiling to remember that our species existed exist, for about 600,000 years ago.
The Neolitical revolution -- that has been reminded us of the culture of his color was replaced by his food, we have created a source, of the prostate of the Arab specialized specialized by a range of specialized specialized specialized for 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial monsoon as we know it has just been 300 years ago.
Now, this super-effective history not suggests that we had all the answers to all the challenges that we will confront in the next millions of millennia.
When this lot of colors of colors are questioned by the human beings are answering to 10,000 different voices of 10,000 different voices of 10,000 different voices
And in that song we will rediscover new possibility to be what they call a completely consciousness, completely consciousness, that everybody and all the people and all the garden, and they're all the garden.
This is a picture that I made the loud of the Blafternoon the top of the Sweden, and some people in the poport, and this is the Arabic poport, and this is the great story of his grandmother told me the fantastic story of his grandgrandmother told me the fantastic story the fantastic story of his grandfather told me the great story of his grandmother of his grandfather

In the US 1999, the canadian ended back to the completely control of a larger zone of the larger and Texake together.
It's our new payment. It's called Nunavels.
It's an independent teritorium. Indeed, they are all controlling the mineral resources.
An amazing example of how a national state can look at the national and find repair for his poport.
And finally, at the end of the end, I think it's obviously for us that we had traveled in these similar places, we understood that they are not worried about that they are not worth in a very uncomfortable at all.
They're the payments of people.
They are the branch of human imagination that comes from the human imagination. And for all of us in the early '50s, like the dreams, like the dream of the geography of hography of hography of hographs.
What we tried to do to do in National Geographic is not going to do something like that.
We think policy -- we think policy -- we think policy are not convincing the story of the world, and so we think we are probably the institution of the world that is probably the best institution of the world that tells the best thing to do is
We have 35 million visits our web page every month.
156 to the nation of our television of our television of our television of the television of the nation of the nation of the nation of the nation of the nation of our nation.
Our drives are reading millions of people.
And what we do is a series of traveling in our own audience in our audience in places in our own own own own own own own mindset of what they see is not able to remain and hopefully, and hopefully, as they were going to be able to make the center of the anthropology, that is that we can find a way to live in a diversion of a whole whole world of a lot of the diversion of a whole world of many plant in a world of a lot of please in a world worth to be able world of the world that we can find out of the audience, that we can be able world to live in a lot of a lot of this world to live
where everybody understood the wisdom of all poverty can contribute to our collective prosperity.
Thank you very much.
I'll talk about some of the things of a book that I hope that they will be the resonated with other things that you would have heard of other things that you would have to do with some of the ones you have a rated.
I want to start with what I call "the doct."
Docchef,
The Docchef, the Western society of the Western society.
And this doctrine sounds like this: If we are interested in this if we are interested in the way we are interested in the free of the freedom to is the individual to be the individual level.
The reason is so that freedom is so good, value, valuable ways, the fact that the theory, which is the key to be manage to be manage to be manage to be manage to be many,
And because if people are free then every one of us can act with individual and makes our grandmother and makes our good decision, and no one need to decide in our ourselves.
The way to maximize the freedom is the maximum of election.
The more elective choice, the more people have been working and more freedom and more freedom of freedom have a lot.
So I think it's so well that it's so well in our system that would not get anybody in the system that would be able to put it on the table to put it on the table to put it on the table to do it in the truly of the way we think it's so well that it is so well in our castrating system.
And it's deeply to our lives in our lives.
I'll give you some examples of what he did was doing for us for the last time in the last last time.
This is a supermarket. It is not a very big sticker.
I want to tell you about two words about sake.
175 ses for the supermarket, that if we don't cover and the 10 different types of wild and the 10 different kinds of base and the 12 hours, the bones that you can buy your own own 175 pounds of whales that you can do your own own 175 to a very big number of them in a very large number of the 175 that no matter in the 1975 that no matter how the store the store is not the village of the 175 of the 15-different parts of the 175 of the steps of the steps that they can be able to the styl-different stymale
So it's the supermarket.
And then you go to the electronic components to make an electronic components a stereo -- the stereo -- the halls of the player, the transformat.
And in this electronic stereotypes are a lot of the stereo.
We can confident of millions and half million and a different stereo systems that are in the property of the stereo.
You have to recognize that means a lot of options.
In other fields -- in the world in the world in the world of communication.
It was a whole, when I was a kid, where you could get any kind of a vast phone-service service service as much as it was offered by Ma Bell.
Tristen the phone here.
By the way, one of the consequences of this actually was not the straight was not the straight of it.
And those days are a lot of apuse.
Now, we have a close diversity of nelse, especially in the world of phones in the world of mobile phones in the world of mobile phones in the world of us is we have a mobile diversity.
These are the mobile future.
My previous is the one of the middle -- MP3 player, apart from the nose, and the tuned for the soup of the fish of the fish that I had a sweet of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle --
And if you were not seen in the shot you still see in the store, you can stay in the shot of it.
And the result is that it makes people in the shops in the shops and put this question.
And you know what the answer is the answer question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to buy a phone that you don't know how to do it too much,
And in other domains of life that are much more important than buying the number of people who are so much more important to the number of option of options.
The health care -- in the United States is not the case you are going to do you take your doctor and you tell you what to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor and you say, "Well we have the range of B.
It has these advantages and these risks.
By these advantages and these risks. What do you want to do?
And you say, "Yoctopus what do you do?" And the doctor has these advantage and these advantages and the risks of these risks and the risks of these and risks to the risks.
What do you want to do?
And you say "But if you were in my place, you would do you do your doctor says, "But I'm not at your patient." And the result is -- I tell them what makes a part.
But what is actually a transition of responsibility and decisions and decisions of someone who knows something -- in this case of a -- someone who knows something -- someone who don't know is almost unsave and it's almost not the best form to make the best form to make decisions -- in this patient.
There's a huge level of published public for the drugs with reeternal for me as I think of people like me, and it has no love, which is not a lot, because we can't buy them.
Why do we add the nads of the audience if we don't have it?
The answer is that the people who are waiting for us to call our doctors in the morning to change our requires our recereby.
Something that our identity has become a problem of choice, and this role has been a role to show this.
That we don't change a identity of us are a identity of the way we have the opportunity to do it.
And we can reinvest to reinvest to us all of us have a chef.
And that means that every day when you get you gotten you have to decide what kind of person want to be able to bees.
With all the respect for the marriage and family, there was a lot of people who had to retap you at the time it was that you have to get the kids to get the kids to get to the kids to get kids to get kids to get kids to the kids to have to have children the more quickly than it was to have children to have children the more quickly existed for the more quickly existed to you to get the kids to the
The only option was a dinner, not when you do it after that you will do after that one.
In our days, we all is very much us to be very removing.
I remember a lot of intelligence students and give them 20 percent less than I have.
And this is not because it would be less because it would be less because it would be less map.
Do you think they are preserved with all kinds of questions "You should do it? Should I do it? Should I do it? Should I do it? Should I do it?
I should I get to the later? You should have my kids, or I have to have my kids?" All of this is consuming.
And they will answer to these questions, whether that means that they don't mean if they do all the ones that give them all the things that I give them the curriculum to the curriculum to the curriculum to them.
And this is also the questions that are important questions that you have to answer that you have to answer them.
Mountain -- we are being, as the Carl and Carl with the technology that allows us to work every minimum of every day -- less than the Hotells us in the planet -- less than the Hotell Randolph.
By the way, there's a region in a corner, which I didn't reveil to be revealing the wireless of the wireless of the wireless of the wireless of the so-called the wife,
I won't tell you about it because I want to use it.
So that means that this incredible freedom to choose to choose to be about the working, it's that we have to take a decision, and win and wall, if we should not work and do we should be working with.
We can go to see how our football of our football and we can have the mobile pocket and the other and the laptop in the other and laptop of the gen.
And even though they're closed every mind, you look at how the dog is how the door you do a football of the football of the water?
Would I be answer to this email? You should write this letter?" And if the answer is that "no" is that the question of your football of your little byball will be very different from your lamong to what it was really differently than it would be done.
So anywhere where we look at big and small, objects and things that are the state of life, is a thing of option is a question of options.
And the world I was living about it.
To say that, I had some elections that I had done but it wasn't all the way that was a question of option.
And the world we live now looks like this.
And the question is, is good or bad?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what we know about this, so I will talk about what I am hanging is her.
All these choices have two negative effects on people's effects on people's people.
One of the paradox, it's paradoxically, it's producing paralyzes than release.
Many option of options that can choose to choose to option for something difficult to opaths for something that is really difficult for something to do.
You can give you a very significant example of a very significant investment in the private investment plans in the private of the private investment.
A colleague of my Vancient had access to Vanderarts from Vandemanding a million of movie that has almost 2,000 sees and almost 2,000 sees and almost 2,000 sees.
And what he found is that for every 10 funnal shapes that offer the employees of the employees of the purpose.
You have 50 miles of movie -- they are written by 10 percent less people are getting less employed than if you have to be honest than if you give you a dinners of why?
Because with 50 times the movement of the way to choose to choose to choose to choose what you call to choose what fund is so going to choose it.
And then on the pop and then the bread, and then the bread, and of course, all the way back and of course, it doesn't come to hit never come back.
You know that this doesn't mean that they don't just mean that those people will consume for dog to the dog for the foot of the footprint of a bunch of money to put a decision, is so hard to make that stable to make the sum of compensation that would give you the employment of compenses that would give you the hire the employees that would provide the employees the hiring for the employees of the employment.
We were looking at the legs at the least, and at 5,000 dollars a year in the employees of the employees of compenses.
So the credit is a consequence when you have too much options.
And I think that makes the world look like this.
You want to take the best of the best if it's for all of the ethernity, right?
You don't want to choose the investment of the demand even if you were wrong for the wrong for the wrong road.
So this is a effect. The second is that if we can actually get to define the station of the station of the election of the election of choices than we were doing with the results of the election of choosing choice.
And there are some reasons for this.
One of them is that you had a lot of selling for the snoses for the one of the ones that are not -- and it's perfectly -- and it's not -- and you know, what?
It's easy to imagine that you could have been able to imagine that would be better choice. And what happens is that the alternative that is that the alternative that you can imagine the regrets of choice that you have done and these regret regret from the village that you can actually do if this was a good decision.
The more option you have option, the more easy to regret to regret with the option of the option you have the option you have ales-okay.
Second, what economists call the cost of opportunity.
Dan Gilber of Grand in this morning in this morning talking about how we assessment we see things that we compare to what we compare to do.
Well, when they're a lot of the alternative to take in the alternative to imagine the characteristicated of the alternative to imagine the characteristics of the alternative of the alternative to make it less satisfy that you have aleso-doo.
Here's an example. I mean, I'm not New York's not New York's New York's Council of the people.
But here's how we should be rational.
We have this box in Hamptons.
A very expensive properties.
It goes up to the superbit. They have everything like it. They have everything to do.
What could we want to want to do they think about the drug is an auge.
Everybody in Manhattan are leading in Manhattan are leading to the box.
I could be like in the front of the office." And I spend two weeks of the idea that the chances of the opportunity to have a place of day, to have a place of parking parking parking parking for a parking place to have a place of the office." And I could be like in front of the office." And I could be part.
The cost of the villages of the village that we have to have the election that we have to choose the election is exceptional.
And the more option of the more options in the same way that the characteristics are going to be perceiving for us as being perceived for us as being for us as being for for us as being an opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon tells a lot of things.
He says that we should live in the lack of the lack and probably we should do things slow.
But one of the things that tells is that anybody tells you that you don't do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of the lives of the lights and that will make it less attractive and that will make it less attractive what you do you do is going to do what you do you do is what you do is going to have a lot of things can have a lot of things can have a lot of the other things can have a lot of the other things can be doing what you do you do you do you do what you do you do you do what you do you do you do you do you do you do what you do you do what you do you do you do you do you do you do what you do you do what you do you do you do you do you
Third third of the way: the expectation.
This loved when I wanted to replace to replace my blue.
Port flew about all the time.
And there was a single one that the ones were one like one as a single kind of the same and you buy them as you can get incredibly unknown as the drouter of them and if you had to stay for a long time and spread them out of the destroyed them to stay better.
So I went to to replace to replace my old after I had gotten for the old and I said, "Would a wall of the blug, and the window of my beats, and the window the goal of my beings, and so sweet the beetles of it?
You want to be nasty with farmer? Do you want you to prespread or sweet in acith?
Do you want to be able to do it?
You want to avoid it, you want to get out of the blah -- not finish.
He painted my face after I came up and said, "I want to be the guy who were the only guy who were the only guy who were the only one of the guy that I spent a hour and so I spent all the wall of the beetles of the base of the bill and I went out of the bill I had the right -- it was the best I had.
I chose better. All these options have made possible for better.
But I was feeling worse.
Why? I wrote a book that I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt worse is that I felt worse is that I had all these option option of my expectations about how to be a tunugly fallen is grown up.
I had very sick. We didn't have any expectation of the fact that when they were one of the same way.
Now when they're 100 sisters, my mother mother was perfectly perfect.
And what we did was good, but I don't get perfect.
So we compared what we were expected with what we expected and the result is that we were disappointed in compared to what I have.
The option of options in the lives of people can't do something else.
And as it will take a little bit less satisfaction if they get good results.
Nobody in the marketing world doesn't know that.
Because if you knew you would not have the idea of what I'm talking about.
The truth is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was wrong is that when everything was wrong was really possible to experience was really possible to experience the people to expert bees.
Today in the world we live -- we live -- we are industrialized and industrialized and you have to be perfection -- the best thing you can hope is that things will be so well as they can be so well to bet how good things will be so much of how well you expect to be so well
You never have a surprised because your expectations and my own expectations and my father's excuse to the sky.
The happiness of happiness -- for that you all came up with -- the secret of happiness is to have waiting for the doors.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- just a little bit of -- that I actually have a wonderful wide of the wonderful --
I couldn't find something better. I didn't have any better.
But you can wait to your house doesn't necessarily have that you don't necessarily do it.
In the end, a consequence of a bubble of a blueprint of bluggling that is that when you can buy a single kind of tumor and ask why that is that and ask the answer is clear to clear is clear to clear is clear to clear is clear to the end is clear is clear to the end is cloud.
The world is selving. What did you could be able to do it?
When are hundreds of different starts available and there are one of these different style and you buy a little bit of the bees of why, why do you ask what?
It's as a clear that the answer is: I would.
You could be a better choice.
With a hundred different waves of different ways, you can't have any excuse for etheless.
So when people take decisions, even if the results of choices are doing these choices are good to them, they feel like them, they are good to them.
Depression in the industrialized world in the industrialized world in the last generation.
I think a big contribution -- not only -- but important to this erupper to this erupper erupon the erupper depression that people are disappointing because the standards are too much too high in their lives.
And when we have to explain these experiences I think they are coming out of the experience of the house.
So the general result is that we do better good, and we feel worse.
So let me remind you to remind you.
This is the doctrine doctor, that all the way we all think and it's still not true.
No discussion that you have a few choices better than noses than ning, but this is better than a few choices are better than a few choices are better than a few choices than a few choices than a few of the choices are better than a few choices are better than a little bit of choices than a few choices of choices is better than noses to have a few choices of choices than a little bit
There's a magicic. I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty sure we have been able to think we have been doing that the fact that the choice our lifetime of life.
Now, the idea -- almost over-donated -- the idea that you can think of that is this.
What allows these kinds of industrialized in the industrialized society is good for the materials.
There are many places in the world in the world and we heard of a few of them are not too much option.
The problem is that they have too few few of them.
So the thing about talk about is a weird problem of Western society and rich societies.
And what is frustrating is frustrating is this: Steve Levitt talks about how these chair kids on and they are throw for installed.
What I'm saying is that these option, expensive, expensive not only helpful.
They actually have painting.
They are actually doing worse.
If something that allows us to do in our society to make all the election that we do all the election that people are too much too few options are not only too few options that would be improvement but our lives would be improvement but our lives would be improvement but our lives would be improved.
This is what economists call the Pareto.
Redwwwood will be better for all -- not only people -- not only for poor -- because of the way that this excess of choices are enough.
In conclusion. They assume that you look at this cartoon and being a sophisticated person you are the fish of the stars?
You know that nothing is possible in this account of the range of poverty, a miror on the world -- so I read it and the first time.
But the more I thought I had thought I was so much about it was something that I got to think of something like this.
Because the truth is that if you switch the acquisite of it is possible, you don't have freedom of the wild.
If you switch the way that it is possible, the way that the village of satisfaction.
You think the credit and the scale.
Anyone takes a variety of the ways.
This is almost too limited -- probably even for a fish -- probably even for us to be safe for us.
But the absence of a metaphor is a retise for unfortunately and proud for unfortunately and presure, unfortunately
Thank you very much.
