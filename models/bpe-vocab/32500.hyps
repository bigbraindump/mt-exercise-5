And the year we showed these two diaps to demonstrate that the second diet to demonstrate that the big police that was the most of the last three million years was the size of the 48 countries was a little size of the march of 48 percent of it.
But this morning, the serious problem because it doesn't look at the same time.
The police is in a way, the heart of the global warming system.
She was extended to the falls and the fear of the far.
The next slide I will show you the next thing is going to be a lot of quickly going to be a lot of years.
Gheat is the pemancy is the mark of the smell.
That's how the blue of blue inchis.
This is the anuary anually on the street.
And it turns out the summer.
Asad guardless than a five-year-old, you can see that it's almost like a body of a body of a body.
In fact, in the 25 years of this is about this one.
This is a problem because the inner of the challenge of the finger on the ocean.
where it is a massive amount of carbon carbon quantiting -- which, when it comes to meters in metan catch of micro-organisms.
Compartial pollution with the global warming of global warming in the atmosphere may be that we go to if we go to this particular point in the extreme possible.
Alaska little lacks in the Alaska metan effective of metaphor is from the suffering water.
The Professor Katey Walter was at the University of Alaska little lac of a little lac of a little lady in the past.
Oo! ! Al Gore: OK is OK --
And a reason is that enormous "wor" is the Groenland.
This is a race that all over the year.
But volumes are much more than that.
This is the Kangerussuain the Sweenland.
If you want to know how the credit is the fish of the fish of the frog that is where it gets to the big place.
These debate is growing very quickly.
And at the other end of the planet, Antarctica largest map from the planet.
The last people who are reported as a report like the continent of the continent is the continent is negative and the Western Antarctica, and the Western island is submarine submarine remarkably fast far.
This is equal equipment over the big level, like in the Groenland.
In Himalaya, the third of the third of the third of the new vision, on the top of the new formats, who was going to be a little bit.
40 percent of the population of the world of the world of the water water in the water water water in these topier.
And And, this guardless is the source of this hour of the house.
The hands have grown up.
But when it were, it was going to be with pottable.
In California was a 40-percent of the fear of 400 percent of the fear in Sierra.
This is the water affection of water.
And predictable, as you read and they're serious.
And the global all of the global has led to a dramatic creative credit incentives of incentives of incentives of incentives of the global warming.
And disasters on all the world has grown up with a graduate rates,
four times more of the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the 75 years of the 75 years of the year.
This is an absolutely unsustainable.
If you look in context in context you can see what happens.
In the last five years, we added 70 million tons of all the carbon dioxide every 24 hours of 25 million hours every day every day.
And here is going to have with the Pacific area of the Pacific area from the Western Indian where the subcontinent of the subcontinent of the ocean of oxygen oxygen in the oceans.
The biggest because the global warming global warming of deforestation, which repress the report of 20 percent of the fossil fuels.
Petricole, is a problem and the best of serious book.
The United States is one of the two big emerging of China.
And it was going to be built more factory factory for the book.
But we start to see a change.
Here are the people who have been anxed in the last few years with proproproproduced.
All right, there is a fifight of our political in your own own own own own own way.
And the carbon industrial industry has spent a lot of the oil spills of dollars a hundred dollars in the last year for the last year for the last year for the last year
And so the very very cool.
This image of a reminder of something like this.
In the previous Cracial Cracial Tennesness, a billion-to-star cartoonist was imprastid.
You've probably seen the start.
This is all the room, the second big deal. He was the second big deal.
One of the reclames of the book, about the Cracial Cracial Cracial was this.
Video: Yeah, yeah, the grandmother, it's a slowly shaped and your happiness and ves."
It's from abundance, here in America, and it helps to the economy.
Frosty, the stomat is getting better.
It's an adorable and workers are going to work on the road.
Al Gore: This is the source of the cartoon in Virginia Western Virginia
The largest one of the largest mammoth of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenshi: I want to be clear clars, Nans, Nans, the Pelosi, Harry Reiro's not about what I talk about.
Al Gore: So this is so like Aliquid Climate Climate has launched two campaign campaign in of the campaign --
This is one of them in one of them on them.
Video: Actu: At COALergy we see the climate change as a very serious threat that we are very serious threat to our business.
That's why our main is to spend a lot of money for the public forces for public forces that will help us show us the real data.
The real is that the goal is not dirt.
We think it's curved -- and we are bad.
So it will not be the climate change for the climate change
You have this in our ways.
Video: The good; you heard a lot of a gray of a gray of it.
So let's do a little bit of this poor of this poor forest of this pool of the football of the book.
I was send y! Masin's about the noise of the noise yet.
But this is the sound of technology of the technology of the food.
And as the book is a lot of the main causes of remarkable global warming technology, the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the football that you see all the time.
Look at this point, this is the technology today is the technology of the food.
Al Gore: In the alternative positions are the right to the economic challenge of the economic challenge and the problem with national.
Video: Narrator: Americans is in the crisis, economy, economy; the nationality, the crisis.
The journey that you have all the addicted addiction of carbon fuel on the carbon footprint of carbon divided by carbon dirty but own.
But now we have a new solution to the new solution to the incurioses to the incurcled.
You get America with 100 percent electricity in 10 years ago.
A plan to put America, then they can do more save us more significant and help us to help to the global warming.
In the end, a solution that is a lot of the solution to help us solve the problems.
You can be America. You have America.
Al Gore: This is the last one.
Video: It's about re-sustaining America.
One of the fastest ways to innocent the fastest of the old fuel bustiles that we killed our planet, the Viit's planet, the Viitan is here -- the Life is here a new real.
Barbered nnring: We investment to create the plates.
Narrator: Rophett: It's time for activist.
Al Gore: Exista proversus African old old old African who says, "Yes, you want to go fast,
If you want to get to get to go away.
We have to get it fast.
Thank you very much.
The year at TED I did a result to the LHC.
And I promised to come and give you a data data about how it works.
So this is my job for the ones that have not been here, the LHC is not the largest science that was asked -- the largest science or a 27 kilometers or is the Street is to recreate the presence of a billion times at the pressure of a billion times at the universe -- the fear of a half a second.
It's extremely both of them.
This is the Genevelopment of Geneva.
We do photographs these minds "Big Bangs" inside the decades.
I work at this. It's called ATLALASS -- Lun4 meters of 44 meters of 22 meters of a picture of the detector, this is a picture of ATLALSS in construction in the construction of the ATLALSS in the construction.
On the 10 seven-seven-nine years I started on the first time.
And this image was taken by ATLAS.
He caused a celebration of control.
It's a picture of the first of all, the particle of particle that has been through the LHC, cross the LHC, cross is to be free, and it's a part of the LHC is a typical part of the detector.
In other words, when I saw that last 10 seven-seven-fighting that the device has a huge success.
I don't know if that was the largest own, or that somebody went on Google and she went on the Google and she was the first page.
It means that I did a cultural impact on the impact of the impact of the science of the disruption.
And after about a week I had a problem with the machine, which actually had to do with these days, these days, these days, these days.
Those three thousand figures when the machine works of the motor is going to get to the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of
Now, engineers in the engineers are looking at these days, "Not to transport the away.
But I can do this because when they're at temperatures become what they call the superconductive of the superconductive beepers.
So as a 271 degree -- there is more cold than the hospital between the stars, those of the steps can transport these these box.
At one of the layers of the past 9,000 magnetic in LHC, was a factory of factory factory has been a factory of factory of factory between the layer of the layers of the layers of the layers of the over 9,000 magnetic mammalnet in LHC, C,
So as a company was fun and those 13 thousand ampers have been reminded of electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressive, and they have a lot of magnetic cafeteria and they move over 20 tone, and they move it to 30 miles away.
So we have a lot of magnetic 50 magnetic math.
We had to take the end, which I did, which I did.
I reconvicted all of the topic, I repair
And now we take magnetic in the subterm.
The end of the end of the March of the LHC is will be like new lass.
We will start again, and we get us to get the data and we get to get the data or yet, and we're going to keep the research and keep the research that are the elements of the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, those accidental accidence of the importance of the importance of the importance of the engineering and we have to break it up.
I think that it is because it is so hard to do that is that we have young inalso, this is the important thing to have the LHC.
And so I'm going to leave the words of a British scientist, Humphrey Davy, which, I think when the country I think about it, when the experiments of protected the protected of the protection of the protected and our minds are not for our minds and our minds are not that our minds are not that our science is not the same mystery are not finishing as we are not finally intified as our death are finding and that we are not finish."
Thank you.
I want to start with the kid's reminded you when you play with your kids.
And as you can get them to get them to get them and get them and get them to get them and get them to get them and sold and sold and sold and sold the toughness and manipulate the hospital.
The hospitals is a deep law of how we understand a lot of the world in inconclusion.
So, in the way, in the way that I was trying to do this report of our interactions with our physical objects, -- impression -- impressing my collaborator and my color and my color Kalanithanies -- I was starting to go to the computer -- I was starting to go to the computer -- I would start to go to a computer that would be so much digital that we can be so much more to be to a little bit of a finger and to have so that we could have so much to get to be so much of the way to go to have to be so much to be to be to be able to be able to do we can we can be so much more informed by the mountasting and then apply to do to do with a little bit of this untastonishing and then apply to go to be so much informed with a little badmess if we can be so much more
And it turns out that we want to now?
And this question was so much of the fascinating we had the research, and we went through Swettwed.
And in a short Siftable is a computer interactive computer interactive in a biscy.
They can be manufactured it, they can perceive the reef, you can perceive the weight, and they have a radio screen and a radio of wireless and a radio wireless of wireless --
The most important is that they're palpabled, like the game, you can just get them like to get them to get them out of it.
And Sifwitwitness off, a new ecosystem of the digital tools of digital manipulation.
And on the magic of what these tools are getting more palpably their mission of their mission of each other, and it constantly is to explore new or new new new or destroying new new and destroying new new and destroys.
I'm going to start with simple examples.
This Sifting is configuring the video, and if it was on the road, and it is it all the movie -- if it is it includes the moving.
These portraits are constantly constantly one of the other.
So, if I put them one of the wind one of the other, they become interested.
If there are inconcepted and this is going to be a little bit confusion.
They can also feel the mission and inclining.
We realized that one of our interests interactions of interactive interaction is that we can use the data, as we can use the data, as we would be a cold cold of how we would be a college of a high high high high high high high school school.
In this case, we have three Swe'd have three Sweet tallets and they can use the torn in the center in the center of the center, where they want to be the center in the middle of the one where they want to be done.
If we can get too much, we can get the road.
There are also interesting possibility for education, as they would be a very language and logical and logical logic and logical and logical people who want to be able to see the possibility to see the results immediately.
So here I -- this is a Fibonace, the Honacks that they do with a simple program that I do with a simple thing.
So here we have a form of words of the words of the combination of the combination of Scrabs and Boggles.
So in every single first one of the first one of the first one of Siftwed, and on the masurround that I was really grew up with a dictionary, they are grew up with a dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds are residents in the letter of the letters, and you have a new set of letters,
Thank you.
These are nists, children who came to the Media Laborator Media, and I came up and we came up and then to be a material.
They like them crawy.
And one of the interesting aspects of this kind of applications is that you don't have to give them a lot of instructions.
All you have to say is "F" and they know exactly what to do.
There are people who are people trying to get them.
This is the most tank, our worst test, down in the right in the right.
It turns out that it was all to do was to do was to do the Siftable to do it.
So for him was just cubing.
This is an interactive,
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who invest language.
And this is Felix.
And it can put new personajectorously, just by the time that Sifwitwitscans on those Switwitwitnesses that they are the person.
And this is where the soarrives
Video: The racing racing.
David Merrill: Now he has put a tractor in the scene.
Video: The portrayl.
Very good.
When Swedding the Swetlanger and the langer can do the person's going to interact with the person's person, Video: Wide.
DM: It takes your nart.
Video: Oh!
DM: It's a very exciting, and he decided, and he decided.
Video: Hello.
DM: The last example I have time to give you a time to make it a team of created and interpreted music and interpreted the music that we built the role of sounds that we had the role and all the rhythmic and all of the sounds of the sound like a bad.
Each of these four different variations of them who want to use it.
And you can get a succession that you can have a succession that you can have to do it.
Sif, the sound touches the sound of sounds of a Swetable Sttaggated Sttable of success.
There are effects that you can see the poem control, like the reverberal and the film.
You can see a certain sound of sound, and then it includes it to help it off.
The general effects like the general effects like the volume and the volume of the intrees of the sequence to see it.
Video: I will start with a rhythming in the second Swe'd be a serious remote to a serious amount of success, and we had a lot of it.
I now put a basic line.
Video: Yeah, I hear it ft.
Video: And I'm going to add the film and I will add the top, to control the side effect of the side effect.
Video: MM: I can tell the inclined the inclining and the inclining or else's inclined or else.
Video: I will now give you a bunch of base in the time.
Video: Yeah, I can do the long time they do the long time.
So I don't have to do the plan, they can improvise, previous or short or shortcus or short of the words.
Now, in the end I can enjoy the third of the Swe'd be using the volume of volume Switwitscscape.
Thank you.
As you can see, my passion is my passion of new interfaces that are better than the way that they work better with the way to our brain.
And today, we had time to show this new coordinated by this new space; a few of these new ideas, and we were trying to get from the law.
The Gand's Gandle is like we are at the new generators with this new generators with the new interaction with the digital interaction with the digital rule of the rule of our rules of our rules of the rule of our rules.
Thank you very much.
These eps with the nervous work of you all of you to all of you do.
I'm writing.
He wrote the book, but it is my teacher, but it is more than it is.
It's my mother, my love and fascinating a life.
And not that enjoy this is going to change it.
But these are a little bit like this was a lot of happened in my career and in the book, which he determined me to requalified my job with work.
And the unbelievable is that I wrote very long -- this is the case of Manancy, the Roaga, Iubest, Iubesty," which is dealing from any of my books to a very important sense, and it became this international sensational selled in the world for a little sense, and it became this very important sential sending this very simple sential myself.
The result is like the anywhere in the way that I go now, people treat the time as it was dead.
Serio: Serio.
So as you get the task, "Don't you tell you, it's your theme -- you don't have the theme that you never could be able to do this?
Don't do you want to keep the third of your life that I was going to be more to create a book that ever have a book ever se?"
It's very linistic.
But it was even more than it was I never remember it was 20 years ago, when I was going to start to marriage when I was a teenaged -- I want to become written by the same kind of as a guy on the same kind of African reaction of the same African reaction of the same African reaction of the same African reaction.
And people were saying, "Not your theme as you had never have any success of success?"
I don't know that humility is going to be held your remarkable?
Don't do your fear that your life was going to work in this field and nothing will be here and not going to be here and you have a dream of the dream of the flu of the filled of the filled of the green of the screen?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the answer to all those questions at all those questions is """"""""
Yeah, it's a the-to-day the-to-
And it always meet.
And it's a lot of other things that are going to be the didn't.
As a result of the big algorithms that are cross.
But when it is what I thought I was always thinking about the last time I was all the time I was like, "Why is it "What?
Is it something rational?
It's the logic is to have to do it that they would be enough to do that they were destroyed to do this Pamp.
And what is that the specific fic fic that seems like we have a real thing that seems to us in the support of a mental mental health in any other teachers don't do it in other teachers?
My father was my father was an engineer chemicals and I don't remember it as in the 40 years of the engineering of the engineering is not a chemical engineer to be a chemical.
It wasn't happened -- John, how does the block in the engineering in the engineering in the engineering in the engineering of it?
It's just not happening.
But to be honest chemists as a group of chemists, like the group of them in reputation of reputation in the reputation to be alcoholes of being alcools
We write this ins; we have this reputation, and not just writing, but not just written -- but it seems like this is a straight to be a straight of being better than reputation.
And all we have to do is to look at the numbers of the named only in the 20th century, in the 20th century, in the 20th century.
And even those who didn't have the own one fun was really very much of the destruction of your own talk.
Norman Mailer, even before I was going to die in the last interview, he said that she said, "Every little bit more than my books."
A great great great for your work of a life.
But we don't have to be when we hear somebody else that I hear someone like this, because we heard this is because we heard that many times and something, and we have been absorbed and unaccepted and sufficient is a collective idea as the creative and the artapped up and like the arting, it will lead to the event in the next to the hurt, it will always get a lot of the word.
And the question I want to add this today all of this is that you all here are you all the impacts with this ide?
You're comfortable with it -- because the list as it is as the list -- I don't care about this -- I don't care about this ipoteous near the hypothese.
I think it's like own.
And I also think it's dangerous and I didn't want to see it in the future.
I think it's better if we encourage to make the big artistic to live in the way to go away.
And I know that I was like, my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to go to the next day to me to my career for this ipotent in which I find a circumstance.
As a result of example, I just have a 40-year-old was just about 40 years.
We have to have a four-and-a-a-decades.
And it's very likely to write that what I'm going to write the judge of the human beings as a work that came back after my career was going to take my career and she was right therefore right?
What would be to say the summer, because of the one of the one of the most of you here -- it's very likely to be happened.
Oh, my God!
This is the kind of the way that could be somebody to get to the gin to the nine in the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I want to do this is continuing this message that I love
And then the question earli: OK?
And so I am a lot of meditation, like the mania was that I need to work now, to keep it now, to try to make a kind of write a kind of psychological construction, right?
I had a way to find a way to find a way to fear a safe distant distance to me, and my absolutely not, and my father who was going to be now before before we were now going to be in the way to what he wrote about what he was written by what he wrote up.
And as we all came up with this last year -- I started to look across the time, and we tried to find other society and I tried to see other society to see if we could have better ideas to be held and healthy people create people to be held emotional risk.
This research has been taken me to the Greece, and the Roma and Roma Roma and Roma Roma and Roma and Roma research.
So I mean, you have the skyl, you know, the sky.
But in the Grectent and the ancient Rom's Rom's arrest, they didn't believe that the creativity came out of the human being, right?
People thought that creativity was a spirit was a helping people who are helping people in a source of people from a source and unintelligence, and unintelligence, and unintelligence,
The solutions were called these spirits of famous creatures of the famous creatures "the term of the term of "the ter."
Socratic was the fair that was a demand that he has a department that has a smart in department of department.
The Roman had the same peak, but they were the creative -- imimmoral, the immoral --
What is great, because the notes, they actually thought that a lot of it was a very exciting individuals were a very exciting individual.
They thought a genius was a genius was a kind of income and what it was going to do is an incentives of artists, in a kind of like Dobby, the snassy, the snassy, the shape, and the path of the work of work that work that was the work of the work of work that work was that the work of work of respective work that we were going to respect.
Absoldiers -- this is really the distant is the distance that I was talking about -- that the kind of psychological building that is to protect your work that is to protect your work of work.
And all the world is that it works, right?
So the artist was protected by the way, as example, for example, too much narcision, right?
If your work was stralucity, you couldn't keep the whole world for her, all the way the world the day that the country has been helped this genius in the body that helped us to help it.
If your work was critical, it wasn't completely completely income, it was not completely worked.
Everybody is the star as your genius was about ignorance.
They have looked at the people in the West creativity,
And then came up with the Renasting and everything was changed, the idea of a massive idea to put the killer in the center of the universe on all the way to the universe on all the mystery of the universe that they received from the divind.
It was the beginning of human rational, and people started to make the creation as creates the creative of the individual arm.
And for the first time people started talking to one of the history of the artistic or the other artists, instead of genuine genius.
And I have to marry that I think was a huge error.
And you can see a simple person, a simple person, like he or she is actually the receptor is actually the receptor and the theme and the theme and the intree of mysterious and the four-founded human beings, four-foot psychological emotion.
It's like you have a little bit like the host of the house.
They just incover and they are reforming all these astonishes and genders that are inimaginable to figure out the performance.
I think that the pressure of this is killed us one of the last 500 years.
And if it's true, and I think that is the question is, what do we do?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we go back to the higher senses, the relationships between people and the creativity.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't really get 500 years of a human ancient human thinking.
And it probably is that it would be in the audience that would raise the layers are absolutely known to the theme that the people are actually going to get people and all their own fingers and all their projects over the projects over the projects over the projects over the projects over the projects over the projects of the projects that are all in the world that would be absolutely be that we have absolutely known as well.
It's probably not to coopt to this idea.
But the question I want to do is -- why don't I want to do this?
Why don't we want to think about this kind of the way to the way that we want to think of this?
Because it has a long way that we heard something else I've heard about anything else I heard about how much we have heard about creative explanation.
It turns out that anybody has to make something -- basically to make something -- basically all of the here -- it is that it doesn't always usually useful behavioral.
And in fact, sometimes it can be the paranormal.
I had a lot of the way I met where I met the extraordinary American poet American poet Mr. Stone, who was now about 90 years and who was the poet that was the poet that she was when childhood at the summer when she told me when she was working on the room, and he just felt and he feels to work on the room, and I just hearted a poet of poet on the room,
The story was like a vast vast vast vast of air.
And it was the road over the room.
The feeling income and because you have the fisheritakers are under the feet.
And that moment has a single one thing that was going to do -- and that is what it is like the aler."
And it goes like to go to the house to the house and the third of the time was to get to a piece of map and a lot of quickly fast enough to the time when they went to go through her and she was going to get it through the map.
Sometimes it was not quickly quickly so it was running and running and running and running and running the house, and she was going to fall through the roots, and she lost the poems and she was going to go out and she was "another poet on the room, I read "another poet of the poet was "another poet
They were also the moments of the moments I would have never forced it -- moments in which the story as almost loss.
The running home, the mother, and the poems and the poems and the card the way it was the time when the teacher was going to get the other and the story of the other, and the story of the other, and it goes up.
And the first one of the code and then it came out the body and then it was translated the table.
And so in this situation, the water water water and it was a perfect and intact and unless and it was none of the last word.
When I heard it -- it's just like -- it's just like this creative process of how it works
My creatures are not limited to this -- they're not drive!
I'm a way that I work and I work in the way I work every day every day every day and get to be able to move and get them wrong.
But even I was like, my inner and I was going to be so much that I was so much that I was so worth to me.
And I imagine that they were also the same as many of you are.
And I had the ideas and I had the ideas that they were from a source that I don't know what I was doing is not to see it.
And what do you do you all this?
And how do we should be able to report that we should be in the way that we don't lose our minds, the right to help us reach our health.
For me, the most relevant example of our days, which I have about how we can do is do the music of Tom Waits, we took a pig I took a time to be a time in the demand in the demand in the demand in the demand in the demand in the demand in the whole whole of our daughter of our daily
I was talking about this subject and all of this was almost all the way to the contemporary artist's contemporary artistic artist and domestic to control and gentlemen, to fly and gentlemen,
With the time it was running out the story as a day as a day by a day by the time in Los Angeles, and then everything has changed.
While I drive a little bit of a short fragmented from a piece of the song that comes in the minds that was going to be dealing with the inflection and the welcome and it's not the way to her, but it has no way to do it -- but it doesn't have to see how to watch it is.
It has no figured out of the math, has no report.
The experience that I was the old old old anxiety and they would lose the moment to lose the momentum for me.
I'm not a good job of a good to reveget."
And instead of getting into the panical, just stopped it.
He stopped doing something that was all the way to do something all with it.
He raised the quick and said, "You don't see that they're at the volaner?"
"You know, you might write a little bit like a chance of the note?
If you really want to be able to be in a long time in a moment of right now, when I can do it.
If you don't have any other things like this.
Go and you get the Cohen."
He was creative processing this has changed my time to this.
It's not the opera is continued to be the same as much as it happens.
But the process of the process and the third of the rooms around him, and he had taken the time he had the chance that was going to go back and because it was only unknown to where he came back to the way to where he came back to the way to be a lot of the way to be a lot of the inside and then it has to be a lot of the initially to be to be China.
It could be this collaboration and the bizarre, and the bizarre in the form of conversations in the external external and the external that was not too too much that was not too much that was like Tom.
And after I heard the story I was starting to change a little bit of the way I was working on a data.
This approach me to me when I was at the middle of the "Manancy, the Roags, I, I, and I had a lot of a kind of disappeared to everything that we were going to be a disaster to be a disaster to be a disastastasting, as a disaster to be a disseminated as a disaster.
Not just that, but the most propositive, but it always was written by
I had to think that I should just think that I should just abandoned the project.
And I remember my song of my hospital open, and I tried to do and I tried to do it.
I got my job on the manuscript and I brought my comments to my commentary of camera.
I said to me, "Low, and you know that if this book was not just going to be the wrong is not just going to be very extraordinary to be my own saying, right?
Because you can see that I have one of my daughter all the way to the bed, and more than it is.
So if you want to be better than you want to do your own machine, you have to do the same thing.
Okay. And if you don't do this, you know, you know, you all of it.
And I would write my job.
And I want to do this today as I did my job I did my third six."
Because -- the Conclusion is -- -- by hundreds of years ago in the North Africa, people would have to add the people who have to require the long-term muscles and music in the waste of hours of the waste of hours of class hours in hours of the racy.
And they were always very beautiful, because the dancertainly were teaching and were remarkably remarkable; right?
But sometimes very roughly, something happened happened in the one of the death of the people who are really going to be in the community.
I'm sure you all know what I mean you all of you see what I was going to see in a particular moment that I was a very time that I have interpret.
It's like the time it stops and the dance is all the password is not by a lot different than it has not done by usually different than the other 1,000 serts, all of the other 1,000 serts,
And in a time seems to be in the third time,
It's liked out of the bottom and the bottom is the frogs of the footprint.
And when it was when it was going to be what was the named were named names.
They have the mothers and they were "Alllah, y," and they were "Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, the Gam," Gamame, Gamn Gamne."
It's Godd.
A interesting among the history of the story -- when the mother's retails had been taken up with this Spanish's Spanish in the Allahh of the Allah, Allahh Allahi, yeah, Allahh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ylah."
and they hear the fight of the fight of the roads and dancing and dancing and dancing
In Spania, when a interpret something impossible and magic is impossible and the motor is "Allaw, Allah, y," the magnificent, your arguing it."
It's a little bit of a God's base of God's God's dad.
It's great, because we need to do something like this.
But the gaps of the second day the morning, when the dancer's arrest, it's like the march, 1st morning, and it's not a score and it's not a score scale,
It's a dishrter that walking is also the genuine and it could not be able to do it for anymore.
Would it be anybody to do when he was the name of the Domnesses when he was supposed to do with the rest of his life say?
It's wrong.
It's one of the most painful acceptions of making creature.
But it can be a very big tin the right if you don't think about it as much as you think of your most extraordinary you have been from your own fairly income from the inside of your eyes.
Maybe if you think about them as they were improud of a cake of invisible source for your earth from your life to be dated to be dated data, when they moments have been a database.
If we think that all that it is all the time.
I was going to think of this and I thought that the last months of this book, which will be published by the book, continuously being published by my distance and crypt, dangerous and crashing and crashing my strain.
And what I do is that I do when you get the clean up the hour the cause of the song: you don't be theater.
It wasn't the spread of the job and just the Continy Continy the Conference you would have it.
If you get the dance, then the dancing up.
If the gene comes and the center of the divide that you can make it a tasted by the way, even for a mom, even for a mom, even for a mom, then the "le!"
And if no, they die anyway.
And all of these "bad!"
I think in these things and I think we should have them.
"Oh!" for you, all you have a love for a load love for humanity and the inner and the inner to keep the enabling and keep it continues.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We talked about some of these projects, about the human genome and what could be the question, and what could be the very interesting, and about all of us by discovery.
We start with a new point, in fact, from a new biologist, and we try to start to start to start to start to start to start nine from this code and go into a new biology, and it's a new formating and synthesize forced forces and synthesize forced forces of life.
We all tried to figure out the important questions.
"What is life about?" It's something that I think a lot of biologists tried to understand the variety of variety of variety of various levels.
We tried different approaches, simple approaching the lives of the basic components.
We all have been about 20 years.
When we sequenced the human genome of the human genome of the analogical world in the digital world in digital world in digital world in digital world in the digital world.
We now try to ask the question: Can we make new forms of life, or we can make new forces of life forget about digital digital digital universal universes?
This is a little bit of a little organism Mycoplasma genitalium, which has the smallest genitalium, which can replug in the lab.
We tried to see if we can come up with a genome and smaller genome and smaller
We have been able to get the surface of a hundred genes from the one of the 500 that are there.
But when we look at the metabolic map is pretty simple at all.
I think this is simple.
But when we look at all of the genes we can just take a moment to a time, it's a little bit of a life that is a little bit like a cell.
So we decided that the only way before it is that we actually have this crosis, we can know this cross to the stem to add some of the most fundamental components to questions.
And so we started on the road, "Can we have a cross of the cross?"
Maybe chemistry allows these very large molecules that we ever did ever do before?
And if we can make a cross-gray cros?
A crosome, by the way, is just a chemical piece of chemical.
So, our digital speech of digital life grew up to a rhythm.
Our ability to write code code that genetic code, but it has been moving up.
The last time he got to an exponential curve of an exponential.
I started this on a better than 15 years.
I went through a few etheless, I was starting to say, a bio-etal examine the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesis that the DNA is very hard.
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make small small pieces of DNA, long enough to 50 gallons of a generative process, but it's a generative process, so what you build a long piece of the higher and more error.
So we had to create a new way to put these little little pieces together and the right and the right and the right and the right now.
This was our first tentative information from the digital information from digital information from the general information of the genome of the Phi X 174.
It's a little virus that killed bacteria.
We made the design of the piece, we went through the right through the right by right by the error of DNA DNA molecule DNA by about 5,000 letters.
The interesting thing was when I took this piece of this chemical material material from the chemical material material and we put it in bacteria, and we put it in the bacteria, and then to make this genetic code, and to make this genetic code.
The viral Partics were then released from the cells and they have returned and they have been returned the E.
I was talking to the oil industry with the curriculum industry and they were doing this model.
They have a lot more than you are.
And so we think this is a situation where the software can build their own madwall in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something better.
We wanted to build the whole cross of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 little, genetic code.
So we said to put the letter the letter of the little bits of the virus to can actually understand the size of the size of the size of the size of a life cells.
And the design is critical, and if you start with digital information in the computer information has to be very accurate.
When we sequenced this first time we have this genome this genome was a precision of the precision of 10,000 payments of the basic basic basis of the basic basis of a basic basic basic basic basic stoms.
I found it was reaching, 30 to report the 30 error. If we were used to be done to be the original sequence, that couldn't be activated.
The design is a design of joining the design of 50 letters, the long way to have to do with all the other hands to build 50 gallons of other letting the other hands to be able to build some of the very small ones that lights are compatible to some of the very small and the common.
We create a unique elements.
You may read that I read "marks" in the hous." Good up to this one of the genetic code, we have a genetic code, and you can see in four letter: Oh, and T.
Triplete you in those letter of these letting about 20 amines of these letting a literally literally literally acid.
So we can use the genetic code for the word words,
I had done all of the way we did was to be the code.
Some of them were disappointed to the poetry.
We designed those pieces so that we can have been to the dignity.
They're they're repair that they repair them.
So we started doing the joy of the end, starting with five to six to seven to do the road, and it goes through 24,000 gallons and then put it in the other and then put the stone in these 2,000.
Every time we have these pieces of these pieces of the abundance to sequence them to make them a sequence that we try to make a very robust -- as you will see a very robust -- as you're going to see in a minute.
We try to get to that point of automative.
So, this is a basket.
When we get to the very big market, over 100,000 payments of the basis of based on the E.
It is all all of modern molecular molecular biology.
So we went to other hand.
I knew that there is a mechanism called recombination of the biology that biology uses Aology used DNA revegetables.
This is an example.
There's a organism called Deincoccucutting radio radio that can be the radiation.
As you see in the fun of the cross of the cross is is destroyed.
12 hours to 24 hours later, he put it back to the new wave as a little bit like it was starting to start to skie.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be often often all of them.
I can live in the living in the life.
I'm absolutely sure life can be in the extension of the extension, to move the wider environment, to find a new environment in a new environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is going to happen
This is a micrograph of a molecule that we built using these proclever -- actually using these procleaning the design of the design of the design that we had been put in the design that we put in the market.
Drojan it together together together
This is not a picture of a microscope, but just a micro-graphic towards micrographical.
It's so a molecule that we can see it with a optical microscope of optic.
These are collected images over a thousand a period of about six seconds.
This is an audience that I had a little time.
These are over 580,000 liters of genetic code.
It's the largest molecule made by a defined structure of the definite structure of the definition.
It's a male molecular molecular molecular ar ar molecular
If we put it with a 10 and no time and the space, 142 pages to get this code code.
So how do we start a cross of the cros?
Evivivil with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
And also, more of course, when you get to the euplot, you can just take the nuclear and get the nucleus and put it together -- clean up and that's something that you all heard --
With the archa, the cross is integrated in the cells, but we showed it by clean you can do a completely transplant to a completely transplant to the cells, and we can activate it.
We had a chance of a microbial species from one of the microbial species.
The second is like like people and the people and the house.
We added a few genes in the plus to be able to sell this cross for this cross for this crossed for this crossed a few genes of this crossed a few genes of genes in this crossed a few genes in the forest of the genes in the plus to get a few genes in this cross in the streets of this chose.
We had to die to kill all the proteins.
And it was pretty amazing when I put in the cells, you will have our very sophisticated grains -- and the cross came into the cell.
In fact, we thought that was how far it can go away, but we tried to design the process something beyond it.
This is a major mechanisms.
We keep all the kinds of species that have been embarrassed a second cross or a third of the third of the time, the other hand, from the other new characteristics of new features in a second.
So those who think of the evolution just like a single gene of changing the time that they have lost a lot of biology.
They're called restricted restricted by restriction, who had been deliberately immediately.
The noise that was in the cell.
The -- the cross I put us --
It was exposed to be connected and recognized the other cross as the street, and that we had just to be with the cross of the new cross at the new time.
It became blueprints because of genuine that we put in the crosis.
And after a very short time, all the characteristics of a species have lost lost lost and it was all a completely new new new new data, and it was a new new basic new basis,
All the proteins have been changing, the membranes were changed, when we ask the genetic code. It's exactly what we do we transferred the genetic code.
This can sound like alchemistry, but we can move the software and move the software to change the software and change things pretty dramatically dramatically dramatic.
Now, I suppose that is not genesis, but it has been built three billion years and half years and a half years and a half years and we support that we can think we are on the way to create a new version of a new version of massive new species.
Why do we do this?
I think it's pretty obviously obviously of nearly nearly of new.
We are on the way to go from six and a half billion people over 40 years.
And so I can put this in context for me to me, I was born in 1946.
There are three people on the planet for each of us in 1946, in 40 years, in 40 years, in 40 years, will be four.
We have a death of death and split down the potable water drug of six billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half to a lot of the issue of the death of the death of the bed, and they have a half of the pottttable
It will be difficult to do it.
We use over five billion tons of books, more than 30 billion tiles of oil bars of oil bars
This is a hundred million barils a day.
When we try to think about propose and any process of the process that will be a lot of the process that will be a huge challenge to be a huge challenge of it.
And then of course, that CO2 is all the CO2 from this material, which is that it gets in the atmosphere.
Now, our discoveries around the world, we have a basic data, we have a basic data, and I like to think about these as a component of the design of the design of the design of the design of the design of the design of the future.
The electronics has just a double-double-size, or the diversity that came out of this.
We are limited here, first of all, a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have the techniques of these quickly high-quarters to do what we call genuical.
We have the ability to build a big robot that make a million cross a million cross a day.
When you think about these 20 million different genes of these 20 million genes or try to make the opportunity to make the opportunity to produce the champigs, vaccines that we can change the pharmaceutical equipment than the last 20 years, we can do more biology than the last 20 years, to do more biology than the last 20 years,
And this is just a standard selection selection.
We can select for viable viable substances and chemicals or fuel, producing production vaccines, production production of vaccines,
This is a piece of design design design that we work on the design that we work and can work and work on these species in the computers in the computer.
You know, we don't know how it will show it up.
We know exactly what their genetic code.
We now focused on the fuel fuel in the generation.
You have recently seen that in the ethanol is just a needle of it.
We have the second generation of the generation of the third and the third and the third of the way they are going to be higher and more valuable to the fuel or different values or different types of poorest or different buttons of buttons of the buttons of the first steps of the generation of the second and the third of the same as a curration of the third and the third of the third of the third of the same as a curriculum that are going to be routes,
But the only way we think biology can have a major impact the product of food and more than their food costs and their limited the way they start with the limitations of the same is if we start with the same as we are working on the first generation to design the goal to design for the fourth generation of the fourth generation of the fourth generation in about 18 months.
Lumber solar and CO2 is a method -- but in our discoveries around the world, we have all sorts of other ways that we have all kinds of other ways that we have all the kinds of other ways of the methods and CO2 and the CO2 is a methods and CO2 is a method of our world is a methods -- but in this is a way of our world --
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It goes into the deep deep in the ocean's deep and half the deep, and half the rooms of the frogs.
The CO2 in metan use of metan use of molecular as a surround surround
We try to see if we can take CO2 capital captured in the country that can be transported in the country in the country to make that CO2 back in the fuel, to lead this way.
So in a short time, we think we could have this basis that we could die the basic question, "What is it life is life.
We really know -- we know -- we have the shared the whole industry of replacing industry.
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where another part.
So to be a very large source of energy.
But we also work now to use these same same sources to invention goals to invention companies in the room.
You have seen this year with the blood and a year ago in the minus of a dollar in the minus when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think the situation can be changing the combination of all the time.
Here's how it could start to start to look at the future of changing the evolution of evolution that we see the evolution of bacteria and eventually finally, initially initive, and finally, finally, infinally, infinally, the initially they could be starting
We are almost to improve people.
Our own is just to make sure that we have a lot of us have a long time to survive so much longer, thank you very much.
What I want to show you first to you, is a fundamental work that we had a new technology, a new technology that we brought to Microsoft as a part of a net. This is a year. This is a year. This is Sealololoload.
It's a medium that can interact or local or a large amount of visual data.
We now look at a lot of digital pictures of digital pictures and magnificent on the next to the next one, showing it through this one, rescued it anyway.
It's not contemplate to us as much information, how much the big images or how big images are images.
Most are taken with a common digital camera, but this is a common digital room, but this is a Congress, a fingerprint from the Bible Bylonely.
It's not important because the only thing that should limit the performance of a system of the performance is the number of your monitoring on your own monitoring at a time. It's also a very flow.
This is a little book of the three, a non-imaginative example of it.
It's about "Catheist" -- Charles Dickens.
To demonstrate that is about text, and not a image, we can do this. And so we can do this. It's really a real representation of a text; it's not a position of a text.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read a book in formed electronics.
I would not recommend.
This is a real case of a house. It's a "Gardian "Gardian of "Gardianulanulardian of a house.
Every image is the beginning of a sequence.
This is really it turns out that a piece of joy experience, the version of a revid of a revia or a revil of a a multi-dimensional environment.
We did and we did something small with this number of this number of the number of "Gardian Ocean COO."
We created a false reclaim to a very large resolution -- much more than any claming -- and we got a common claimed contained a suit contained.
If you want to see the properties of this car, you can see here.
Or other models, or even more technical specification.
And this really is through the idea, the remote of the limits of a monitor.
We hope that we can do this is the pop-upon popping and others of the kind of like this -- which is not necessary.
Of course, the mapping is one of the applications of the technology of this kind of thing.
I'm not going to be a lot of time on this one. But just to tell you that we have to tell you that we have contributed to this field.
These are all the road in the United States of the United States of the United States of NASA.
Let's go to a little bit else.
This is actually active on the Internet us; you can see great.
This is a project called Photosynt, which is the two different technologies. Some of them is Sealoby, and the other wonderful research in the domain of visually visually visually notice of the universe of the University of Washington Snaven's University in Washington Snap, and he was going to round the U.S. Washington at the U.K.
and Rick Szeliski to Cer's Cerki Microsoft. A beautiful collaboration.
So this is active active on the Internet.
You can see that when we create this kind of perspective, when we can have this kind of imaging imaging through imaging imaging in many of the experience.
But the space looks like these images of these images that really really really true.
Algerian visual perception of these images have recorded these images, so that to recover the real where these pounds of the Grases of the Grases of the Grases of the Western students -- they were done these elements here -- have these elements, and these elementary elements.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other media.
There are some of the space.
I want to go directly to one of the original Noah -- this is a part of a very long time I worked in a very long time I worked in the vast ast -- so I think it's a very good resistance of this technology of the technology of this technology of this technology that I think is just possible to visit the technology of this technology that we put on the website.
We had to have a lot of the things that are launched.
This is a reconstruction of Catedral's Catedral Damn images from the Dams on Dame, and you find something like Dam's Dam's and you find something like a little little bit of these book, and every one of these contains are found that would find out that was found that they were found that was that covered was that coded by this model.
These are a Flickr, and all of them were reported spaces in this motion.
We can just be able to navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I would have to work at Microsoft is very well to Microsoft is very much a primary to have a primary prime here.
I don't have notice that I noticed a lot of the room of the room from the rooms of the camera at SLRs at SL: a very big number of big deal.
If I can find out the strange of these strange ways.
There are so many mammms, and so on.
And one will be a series of photograph --
This is a No-Damer Ham's Dams who was recorded by the right now.
You can be a poster at a physical medium to a physical media.
The idea is that I can do certain things with social environmental. This means to collect data from all the world -- from all of the world -- from a collective memory, and to interconnected to what the Earth was interconnected to those pictures. All these pictures have been interconnected to the very summer.
You have a model of what it comes out of the entire Earth is the entire Earth.
Think of that as Stephen Lawler Stephen Lawler "Virtualture."
And this is growing in complexity as well as the world as well as the world as well as the use of benefits as well as users as well.
The design is the footage of meters are the meeting of meters ended up here.
If somebody would have all these sfined these sfined and tell my picture who I are, then my picture of Nowhere, the Dame, and I could make it as a while, and I could use it as a particular particular particular kind of like this space to make a sense of social experience.
And of course, a product of the product and all of these are the huge models and virtually the ecosystem to be interested in the Earth, collective wake and in the village of the village and images from the village and images of the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood good? What will allow your software to do is that a moment in the next few years, is that all the pictures of the few years of somebody on the road to be interrelated by the time that picture?
BAA: Yeah. I mean, it's really really to be the good."
It creates hyper-connected -- if you will,
And it makes this data by the imagery.
And this is becoming a quote when you think about the signal information that they have those images that have these images.
As you do a little bit when you do a picture of the Internet, you have a lot of words, and the text on the Internet gives a lot of information from information that is here.
Now, what would be if that picture is the connection to all the picture?
And then the amount of signal interconnected and the disease that is a huge class of this is where the classical effect of the country.
CA: Blaise, is really incredible. Felics.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of the intense journey and one of the ethnography is the opportunity is the opportunity to live in the old wide, who feel their old in the window, who feel their last roads, they still have the last roads of the boy of plants in the lead it in the leaves of plants that are pleasant to the boundary and a pleasure of plants and
I don't know that the Jaguan Jaguary lames of the Western Miluary of the Milalay, or that the myth of the people who continue to understand the Himalay, or that is still breaking our revelation is actually the center of Dhard, is actually the world that we live in a sense that we live in a sense that we live in a sense that we have no sense, but it's just a model of reality, it's just a model of reality,
The consequence of a particular set of choice that our strangers who had their strangers to take their own generations in the next generations in the next generations in the next generations in the next day.
And of course, we all share the same adaptive adaptive adaptive and imperative
We all are born born with children to bring kids into the world.
We go through the initial ritual ritual ritual ritual rituals of the initiatives of initive.
We have to do the separation of the dead separate of morning, so we should have to surprising that all of the songs, we all have arrived.
But what is interesting is the unique of songs, the dirty of every culture.
Whether is that the Penan Penan Penan Boro, or the Voodoo from Haiti, or the Witdoo war or the Katheist Katheist Kade Raw Curander, or a meter of the Karea or a meander.
And this is the guy that I had traveling through the desert and even a month, or even a long nurses of Qomold, Everest, the Everest, the welcome to the world of the world of the world --
All these people are all the other ways that we have other ways to think about other ways to think about other ways of thinking about the other ways to think about it.
And this idea is, if you think about it, it can't be shared by the hope.
Now, the miridges of the world together and they form a spiral life of the planet and culture, and it's the cultural health and it's as important for the health health health remaining biological resideth of life, known as the biological networks, known as biosphorus of life, we know the biosphorus of the world together.
And you could think about this network as being the network as being the ethnose, and you could define all of dreams like being the summer of the vision, intuitially intuitially from the morning of the science of the conscience.
The Etnosphere, the human magic of humanity.
It's the symbol, and everything we can be that we can be like a cross-crusher.
And as the biosphere, the biosphere, and so it can -- and the ethnose, and maybe a lot more higher scale.
For example, no matter how much of the nice thing that was going to suggest that half of all the species was or much more of the extended by the queen, because it is not true, and yet, because we know that -- most of the scenario in the field of biological biological field -- the most optimistic in the field of what we know the scenario of what we know the most optimistic in the field of the cultural diversity of what we know the scenario of the most optimistic and more of the way of the store the star in the reflection of all the way of the
And the largest indicatory of this is the limb wider walls.
When you were born you, the people in this room, there were 6,000 languages speak about 6,000 languages.
Now, a language is not just a layer or a layer, or a set of grammar rules.
A language is a language of the human spirit of human spirit of human spiritual.
It's the vehicle that the sea flech of the particle of particle solves in the material.
Every language is an old mind, a very high school based on recept, a reception, a cockle of spiritual possibilities.
And from those 6,000 languages, as we know here in Monterey, a half of them are not incidentally are not innocent in the next children.
They're not learning to be learned, which means that if it doesn't change something that is that they are all going to change something, that are already in the language.
What can be the only one of the ones that are going to be the last of your own mind, you know, to talk to your language that you don't have the language to be the language of the frequency of the ancestor anotherwise of the children or to the children who are going to be the same as a kid to be the same as a kids?
And yet, that sounds like a little bit of a little bit of a whole, about about every two weeks, because every two weeks, because every two weeks, a older and it takes in the morning.
And I know that some of you will say, "Well, would it be better?
It wasn't a better place if I all talk to me if I all talk to him, and I said, "Grozav, that was to be the Cantone;
Or it would be Kogi."
And then you will find out how it would be able to talk to your own language.
So what I want to do today with you is a journey by the ethnose, a short journey to try and make a short journey to try to figure out what it is that they lose to be losing of what it is that they are losing to be in the truth of you today
Now, there are a lot of us to look like when I say "which, I really understand ways to be understood ways to be a different ways to be done.
So let's take this child from this child Barasana Barasana in the northeast of the northeast of anaconeous -- they thought that -- they were the left, in the road, in the room, in the room, in the flower in the rogs of the sea of the sun in the roof.

I have a curious language and the rules that called linguistic exogames that call your linguessons with someone who speaks another language.
And all of these are all rooted in the past mythological mythological thing where they talk about six or seven languages where they talk about six or seven languages, never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever before,
They just listening and then I start to talk to the language.
And, one of the most fascinating tribes that I ever lived and all of the Waorn Ecutttttle, a popor a remarkably contacted in 1958.
In 1957, five missionals tried to contact and they did a critical mistakes.
They put them out of the aircrafted with them and they wanted to be a friend of the jungested friends, looking at the bottom, and they have never seen in their lives, they have no dimensional.
They took those photos on the solar photographs behind her face, and they came back and find the shape or fine, they found anything, they found anything, they found anything, they have been carried by the diold, so they have killed the five missions.
But Waoran was not killed by the streets of the rooms.
They have been killed between them.
Third percent of their mortality is based on the roads of the windness of the wild.
I followed the genealographic disease, and I found two generations, and we found two cases of natural and when I gave them a little bit about it, they have been a little bit about it, they got so old that we died the old that we did, so we enjoyed the same as a result in the same time they were amazing.
Those trees can smell of the animal is from 40 steps and tell you what the species is going to be in the next time.
And at the beginning of the 80s, I had a surprising mission when I was asked to Harvard at Harvard if I would have interested in in in Haiti, to give me to the secret of Daaathes that were the basic and TonMacouacoutes, and to make sure that they were the people to make the human beings to make the human beings to make a little missing to make a bad.
To understand what it is that the point behind the sensation, I had to understand something about this remarkably credynamic crediting is not a cold of voice would not a cold of voice voice.
Dimap, it's a complex look at complex,
It's interesting.
If I wondered what the big religious religions, what you would say, what are you say?
I think of Islamism, Budism, Budism, Iudiac anything else,
It always always a continent of the continent, the precise that Africa was sub-S-saharian was not the religious credites that they had the distilling of these religious ideas that they had been the distressing the ocean of these religious ideas that came up in was from the ocean that had the ocean the ocean was in was in the aircraft.
But what Voodoo makes this very interesting relationship between the life and the dead between the life and the dead
So the one is a little bit of a spirit of initive.
The sun can be innocent in the Middle East, like the dancing to replace the dirt of the sea slowly the sea slowly becomes the short tile smoke.
That's what I say to Voodoo of Voodoo people go to the blue, people go to the best, and you talk about God's God's Goda.
We are looking at the theater and we become God."
And because you're a positive, are you dominated by spiritually as you could be the vast majority of it?
So you see these demonstrations of these demonstrations of Voodoo strengthots of the remarkably arresting in perfect demonstration, a pretty remarkably properly demonstration of the minds that the body is catalyzed in the blood in the extreme straight of extreme meant that is a dealing of extreme meant that I was excited.
Now, from all the poppier I met is the most extraordinary Kogi in Sierra Nevada Sierra Mart Santanta Mart of the Columbia.
You have the old civilizations of Tairon's civilizations that once the fast of the coastal pioneer coastal pioneer of Columbia, that popped by a southern of a frog of in a map of a froger of that was raising the map.
In a continent of blood filled with this popppor is not was the spans.
They are actually confident of them are initially ritual prepared to be a price of presented to be pretty extraordinary.
The young people are born of their families at the age 3-year-old families in a dark world dark world in the dark world in schools in schools, for 18 years.
Two years of nine years of deliberate divergestation to send the nesting of their nesting faces in their own natural diverge, are now now now now in the night.
And all of the forest, they are introduced in their society, values that are the values that are supposed to their own body and they just relaunches and just could tell their equilibrium -- or could tell the equilibrium.
At the end of this amazing initive, one day in a day and the first time in their life at their own time in their lives at the age age 18 years, they see a remains of consciousness as a containing moments of the first light, the Same begins to start to scaling the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish is a confirming of the fish, and the presented in a glorouse.
And he says, "You're really like I said, "You're really like you saw.
It's just so beautiful. It's your own to protect it."
They call the older fras and they say that we are the more young people are responsible for the world to destroy the world.
Now, this level of intuitial intuitive.
Of course, how many times we think of our bodies, or and we have the fish and the opposite and the old and the old knocked and old the old noble idea that is a racecologist in the simplicity, or alternative, we are closer to our innoise like these people are closer to the Earth.
Well, the board is not feeling of feelings, no no nostalgia.
It's not very much for none in the walls of malaria in Atinier or in the wind or in the wind tunneled and they created a traditional traditional traditional traditional traditional myself, who is based on the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea that the idea of the Earth can only be in a lot more subtle in the human consciousness of the human consciousness of the human conscience that is that the Earth can only be in human human consciousness of humanity.
Now, what does this mean?
It means that a little boy in And, who is grew up to think that the work is the spirit of Apple who will diride the destiny, and it will be a different human related and that will have a different relationships that was a different relationship with that resource is a lot of work with that a lot of work is a lot of work of meant that was a lot of meant that the brings for meeting is a lot of meeting that for a meant that place is a lot of work of a lot of work of work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the way to minerrough-professor that it is a lot of the monkeep.
It's a little bit of a spirit or a little bunch of minds is irrelevant.
The reverse is the metaphor that defines the connection between the natural world.
I grew up in the Columbia of the Columbia to think of the forests were to be bounded to be bounded in order to be bounded in the food.
This is a different human beings me different than my friend of the Kwagia, who believed that those who thought that those focus were the local food. And the Huhkkkkill and the spirit of the Canybody and the spirit that they had to initially in their own north of the north of the world, the spiral in their own initiative in their initiation with the Hamatamatory Hamatamatamatory Hamatamatamatamn and their initiquote to iness of the Kwaggulia, who had to incient Kwagia, who had to inopbybybyming of the cootes, who liagispread,
If you start to examine the idea that these cults could make differences, you will start to understand their own extraordinarily understands their extraordinary example of this please.
It's a picture of me in the northeast of the northeast of the northeast of the northeast of me.
This is the ayahuasca, which many of you heard before, most of you heard the psychopaquactive of the failure.
Ayahuass is not just fascinating for the brilliant potential for the law, but for his prepage of the law. It's made in two different sources.
The first one is this time that has a series of a series of a mind, magic making, magic maybe, modern maybe, modern childhood.
It just consumes the way it was more like a blue of blue whole, but the same as your own consciousness that is your own consciousness is the frogs of a bunch of the citizen family called Psychchchchchchy Psychchchchchchchchchchcheck Psychtic act.
This plant has some very powerful trypties very powerful tryptices, very close to the brain, dimethylthylthylthylthylthylthylthylthylthyltrick.
If you ever have seen the Yanom's Yanometers live with that the frog of the prison of their nose, that substances are made from different species that they contained and methylthylthylthylthylthylthylthylylthylthylthyltry.
He was a traveling that dead is actually like if you have excled by a painful of paintings with paintings and attacking up a big electricity. No more electricity. No more electricity. No more than reality is creating a diold,
In fact, I was talking to my teacher teacher Richard Evan Shult was -- which is the man who was killed psychosophical psychology in Mexichousing of magical discovering in the 1930s.
I used to argue that I can't classified these tryptoms like hallucinogens, because when you're under their effect is not anymore. It's not anymore. It's not anymore. The problem with a sample of hallucinations. The problem is that they can be a blind, because they are the fun that they can be taken by a lot of a fingernamed that in the aggas are as a result of the oxyptint of the oxyptoms of the oxyptoms of the effect of the effect of these tryptyptyptominoption.
They can be taken oral to each other with others that they have the MAO.
Now, the fascinating thing is that the carrony was in that time it was in that time the MAO is necessary to potentially be able to potentially be to be a trypth of 80,000 species of a 80,000 plants -- they found out that they found a green plane that combined in this mobile phones, have found version that all these two dinitches that all of these two dies of death is larger than the summer?
Well, we use that great women, we use that sounds and heroes, which is that it is that it is that it without the meaningful of them.
But you know, individuals and they say, "Plants."
Well, what does this mean?
This trib Cofofa Cofa has 17 variety of ayahuasca, and they recognize all of the forest and we see all of the distance and we see all of us as a species.
And then they ask them how they set their feet, and they said, "You know, I knew something about the planet.
I mean, you don't know anything?" And I tell you, "No."
Well, we know that every one of the 17 smallpox in a long net, and you can see it in a different note in a different note to a different note
Now, this is going to be a Ph.D., but it's much more interesting than the numbers of the statement.
Now, the problem is that even though those of us who feel the difficulty that sympaths with the hardware and weight and so that we see them as a reduction as a reduction as the world, which is our world -- developing our world is developing our world developing our world.
The real is that the 20th century, over 300 years of the wars for the wars or innovation of the wars or innovation of technology but we had assisted or we had been enencouraged or we accepted the passion of biological diversity and cultural diversity and cultural issues and cultural issues and cultural issues on the planet. The problem is not change.
All the cultures in all the time, they were trained in a lot of the possibilities of life.
And the problem is not the technology in the synthesis.
Indians have been slowed up to be Sioux when they gave them to the arm and wished to the American and they were Americans to be Americans and they lived at the time.
It's not changing the technology or threatening the ethnose.
The foot was dominated by the domination.
And you look at the world, you look at the world, we find that they are not enough college to disappear.
These are people living their dynamic have been held and in their existence that are all over their ability to adapt their ability to adapt their adaptation.
And that is that the deforestation of the Penor the Penor of Penn Sarawak -- a pop-nomin-nomin-Sarawak of Sarawak -- a popped generation, and now a generation, and now all of a generation, and now all of a generation, and all you can see where you can see the river and see where you can see the river and dirty and didirty and the dirty in the Borthanks that you can see the rightly in the snomort in the snomorwake of the snomorn from the snomor-town of the snomorous and that it that it can see that it has been a lot of the snomorwakladmale of the snom
where the Japanese you have to be the horizontal to the pockets with the pockets of food.
Or in the case of Yanom's tribes that came from the exteriorange of the Nanometers were the zurn of the aura.
Or if we go to the Tibet, where they do a lot of research, you will see the face of the time you can see the body of political crude politics.
You know, genocide elimination, the physical elimination of a popor is the universal convicted to the way of life is not just the way to a poport, not just that it's not just a universal -- in many areas -- in many areas -- in many areas -- in many areas as as as as as as part of developing as part of the developing of the developing of a lot of developing pops.
And you can't understand the painting of the Tibet, until you don't travel through the solar level.
I had ever been triped 9,600 miles from Cheng's Western Chinese in the Western Chinese food. And I got to Lhave, and only when we got in Lhan with a cold cold college that we have been behind the statistics that are behind the statistics that are behind the statistics that are behind the statistics that are behind the statistics that are behind the statistics of the statistics of the statistics of the statistics of the Upelse's statistics of the UK to Lhad's UK to the Ugelse's statistics of the Uphable's statistics of the statistics of the statistics of the statistics of the statistics of the bottl, and only one of the statistics of

One day she had a little bit of the needle with Mao, and for Mao, and for this craction had seven years of work was going to get seven years of work in a work of work of work in a work of work of work in a daily password.
The Tibeta Tibet, maybe be impossible to be impossible to be a little bit of admired people is something to admix is something to admit
And finally, it is all the way up to a choice to a choice.
We want to live in a world of monotonies or we want to accept a world of policy world policy world policy world policy world.
Margaret Mead, he said before we get the big anthropologist once the biggest was that the largest generated by this general and we have been generated to this generate and we will not just see the entire game, and we are going to see the whole range of thinking about a little bit of thinking about a day and other possibilities.
And it's humans to remember that our species that our species exists, for about 600,000 years.
The Neolitical revolution -- that has brought us agriculture, the moment we had the cold college of his hands was replaced by his hand, we had a replace, we had a surplus in a range of specialized specialized in the next -- had just 10 to a 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial industrial is so that we know it has only 300 years.
Now, this superficial history of not that I would have all the answers to all the answers to all the challenges that we will confront in the next millennia.
When this lot of this lot of column culture of the world are questioning about the meaning of 10 thousand different voices of 10,000 different voices
And in that song we will rediscover all the possibility to be what the possibility of being a completely conscious, completely conscious, that all of the people and all the people and all the fast of prosperous knowledge of prosperous than it that we have been so optimism.
This is a picture I made of the north of the north of the Bouaffected the Baffected the Sware at the narrow of people from the Inudie, and this is the Olayyk, and this fantastic story of the great grandfather told me the fantastic story of his grandmother's story of his grandmother told me the fantastic story of his grandfather told me the story of his grandfather was told me to me to the Baffected the Baffaffected the Swedence of the Baffected of the Baffaffected the Mounding of the Baffected the Baffected of the Milet of the Bank of the Bank of
The canadian government was always so that was not always so that the Swean's Government in the 1950, to our suversus our suverance, we forced in schools.
The guy was refused to meet.
Familia, the fun for his life, his own arms and all the elements and all of the elements.
Now, you have to understand that initions are not reaching their cold finger, they use their cold in their advantage.
The Ghidden was made the original of their original fishing in the caribu.
So the grandfather was not the good night was not the night or the dream of the cold or the dream that the slow.
He just took the fast of the fast finger, and he just down the road and he had a fece in the hand. And how he started to fit in his hands. And as they started to fit from a kind of lamong.
He put the base in the sky of the finger in the excrete and when he finally finished a boy, he was a little bit, he was a little bit of a dozen with it.
He had judged the door and he has been a map of a magic of a few torches and she was walked a snapped of a snapped out of a blood flowing up and didn't, and it was a froging up to the boy in the excrediting, and it was in the excreding.
And we talk to you to be a little bit of a little bit of the way. And this is a symbol of the people of Industrial and all the popping and all the popped and all the world.
In the airport 1999, 1999, the canadian end, the completely wider of a larger than California and Texasasassrooms together.
It's our new new new way. It's called Nunavela.
It's an independent territory territory ters.
An amazing example of how a national state can look at the parts and find repair of parations.
And finally, at the end of it, I think it's obviously that we travel in these kinds of planning, we had traveled in these planet, we understood that they are not going to be worth in the end of the time.
They are the payments of people.
They are the human images that come from the human images. And for all of the time. And for all of us and all of us as a dream of the children, like the dreams of the bodies of hope.
What we tried to do to do the end of NGeographic is, we think politicians will never realize anything.
We think that polements -- we think that polements -- we think that the policy is not sustainable, but we think the story can change the world, and so we are probably the most of us are the worst of the world that the worse.
We have 35 million visits our web every month.
15-16 nations transmit our earlier.
Our teachers are read millions of people.
And what we do is a series of trial trials in our ethnic journey in our own own own own own own own mind, that they can't be able to remain and hope that they will be able to do what they want to do and so we can find that the world that will accept, and that we can find a way to live in a world that we can find a way to live in a world worth a way to live in a way to live in a world in a world worth in a way to live in a world of a diversion of diverse in a lot of a lot of a way to live in a lot of living in a way to live in a lot of living in a lot of a lot of a lot of a
where all the wisdom of all the poor can contribute to our collective prosperity of our collective prosperity
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some of my book that I hope that they would be going to be able to do with other things that you have heard about it and I would try to make some connections that you would have some connections, in the case you would have a rating.
I want to start with what I call "the doctor.
The Docchchance of what?
The Western society of all the Western societies.
And this doctor, this is like this: if we are interested in the way we are interested in the good state of the citizens of the citizens of the citizens of a massive freedom.
The reason is so free for this is so frequency is enough, the word, the real word, essentially to be humanitarian to be human.
And because if people are free then people are free and individual can make individual things that are going to make things that are going to decide in our own places.
The maximum of the freedom, the freedom.
The more choice have choices, the more freedom of choices, and the more freedom of freedom of the more frequently they have a lot of frequently ented to them.
And so I think, is so well that our fear in the system that would have no way to get through the house and it would have to put it on the dozen to the same.
And it's deeply to our lives in our lives of our lives.
I'm going to give you a few examples of what made for us for our progress in the last time.
This is a supermarket.
I want to say two words about the soses for says.
175 sets of her supermarket, this if you don't code and the 10 different types of waste, and the 10 different types of water and the 12 of the balloons that you can buy the 12 of the balloons that you can buy the own sample that you can buy your own in a very large number of people who are in a very large number of the store of the store of the 175 that the store is not the satisfy of the strogs that you can buy the stropes of the sticky of the stage of the stage of the stage of them in a lot of the stage of the st
So this is the supermarket.
And then you go to the electrical store the electrical store to make a stereo system, the sun -- the house.
And in this room, the electronics are a lot of electronics are stereo.
We can be six million and half million and half a different systems of the components that are in the car that are in the office.
You have to recognize that that this means a lot of options.
In other domains -- in the world of communication.
There was a little bit of a kid, when I was a kid, you could get any kind of a way of getting so much of the MBell.
The late of the phone here.
And one of the consequence of this was that the phone was never the straight was never the street.
And those days are a lot of apuse.
Now, we have a close diversity of the telephones, especially in the world of mobile phones in the mobile phones
These are the mobile food.
My favorite is the one of the middle -- with MP3 player, the froger from the nas and the tunnas and the tunnas a wide.
And if you had seen them not seen in the store you can still in the store you in the stroke you see it.
And the result is that it makes people to get people in the store, and to put this question.
And you know what the answer is the question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to buy a phone that you don't know that they want to know that it is too much
And in other domain of life that are much more important than bubbles, there are this growth of options.
The health care -- in the United States is not the case you are going to do you get to do what to do to do to do with you what to do.
Instead, you know, you go to the doctor and say, oh, we have a and the various various of B.
It has these advantages these rises and these risks.
It's B has these advantages these risk. What do you want to do you to do it?
And you say, "Dock," what do you do?" And the doctor has these advantage and these advantages and the risks and the risks and the risks and the risks and the risk.
What do you want to do?
And you tell you that if you were in my place, you know, you all do you do, and the doctor says, "But I'm not in your own place." And the result is -- I tell them that it's -- I tell them what a lot of it makes a lot of it quite a basic thing.
But what is actually a transition of responsibility and decisions of the decisions of the decisions that you know something -- in this case, and it's almost unlikely to make sure and it's almost not that in the best form of choice.
There's a huge level of published public levels for the medical medicine. And as a young people like me, and as you think about a lot, if you think a lot, it has no love, that we can't buy it.
Why is it that we add the narratives if we can't be.
The answer is that the one is that they do this is that we are going to call the doctors in the morning and we want to change our own country.
Something that our identity has become a problem now has become a choice and this transition of choice to look at this.
And we don't have a identity of a identity but we have the opportunity to invention.
And we can reinvest our reinvention we have a check.
And that means every day when you go to make you make your job that kind of person you want to be able to be to be there.
With all the break for the road and family had a eater of the precise that the people who had to be like it was that you have to be like to be if you start to get the poorest and then you start to get kids to have children to have children to have children to have children to have to have children to have children to have children to have children to have children to have children to have children as quickly a lot of it was
The only option was a five-fighting when you do it after that.
Our days, all of our days, all we are all our hand.
I prepared to add students and give them 20 percent less than 20 percent less than I do.
And this is not a little bit more than the falls, and not because it would be less than a map.
Do you think they're preserving all the kinds of questions "should I do it or not?
I should I be going to be lose to be my children, or I had to receive your questions? All of this is usually questions that consumer you have questions that consume you have to be questioned to you to me.
And they will answer these questions, no matter how to do it if that means not to make all the daughter that means not take a good note to the curve.
And this is what we have to do. These are important questions that you have to answer them.
The work -- we're blue, as the Carl and Carl and Carl and Carl and the technology that allows us to work every mind, every mind, a little bit of every single day -- less than the Hotel tells the Randolphenomenon.
And by the way, there's a area in a cold of a cold where I didn't reveal anybody in which works like nobody has no wireless in the so-called the wireless of the so-called the wife.
I don't tell you about it because I want to use it.
So this really means that this incredible freedom to choose that we have to choose to do with work, is that we need to do a decision, and again, and it would have to work and even though we should have been working with, and we should have to work with.
We can go to see how our football and and we have the mobile mobile phone, and the Blackberry, and the Blackberry, probably that on the other and the laptops,
And even though all of the mind, every mind, every mind, which is how we look like the door moves a fitbus, we ask the "Would we be answered to this water?
Would I be answered this email? I should write the fighting of this letter?" And even if the answer is "not that the question is "not that the experience of your little bbbby, your little bit of what it was was completely different from what it was was yness?
So in the origin and small things, and small things that are the things that are the state of life, life, it's a thing that is a thing that is a thing that is a thing that is a thing that is a thing that we do.
And the world I was doing something like this.
And so I had a lot of the choice of made -- but it was not all a thing that was a thing that was a very option.
And the world we live now looks like this.
And the question is, is good or or right?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what it is good at this, so I will talk about what I am going to talk about what is about.
All these two choices have two negative effects, two negative effects on people's people.
One of the more effective, it's a paralyzed, it's more more than released.
And so many options that can choose to choose are very difficult to choose for something difficult to opposite anything.
I offer you a very significant example of a study of the investment of privacy.
A cold of my collection had access to the data from the Vanderal investment in the Vancient company has almost a million employees and almost 2,000 seven-million times.
And what it was that for every 10 foundations that the employees that offer two percentage of participation, the rate with two percent.
You get 50 foundations -- it was a little bit of a 10 percent of you engage than if you give them a little bit of a whistle for whists.
Because with 50 foundations of moving the choice of choices, is the way to decide what you want to do is to choose what you want to do is so much to choose it.
And then on the potent and then the fun and then the time and the table, and the tuned and the fun and of course, it never come in.
You know, that this is not just that they don't just mean that they have to take the food for door after the dogs after the food is to put money to eat the time, that means that the stable is so hard to make a decision-making compensation of compensation that would give you the employment of compensation that would offer the employees that would offer the employees that would provide the employees of the people in the food that they would provide to the food for the food that they would be to the food for a lot of money to the food for
We enjoyed them with the mom to 5,000 dollars a year to the employees of the employees that would be happy food,
So the credit is a consequence when you have too much eight to them.
And I think that this is what the world is going to look like this.
You really want to take the best decision, if it's for all the ethernity, right?
You don't want to choose your own defense or even wrong.
So this is a second is that we can do to be able to keep the stepping strength and make a little choice to do a little bit more satisfy to the result of the choice than we were to choose the choice that we are going to choose the choice that we choose to choose the choice that we choose to choose
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that we had a lot of selling a lot of selled if you buy a and a bunch of one and it's not -- and it's not -- and you know, who are soon as a be?
It's easy to imagine that you would have been able to do a different choice that would be better choices. And what happens is that you have been able to imagine that you would imagine that you have done in the election that you have been able to do and these regret and these regret decisions that you really had a decision.
The more option you have to have a little easier to regret something that is deeply in the option that you have otherwood.
Secondly, what economists call the opportunity cost.
Dan Gilber Gilber demonstrated that in this morning talking about how we evaluate the way we see things that we see what we see is that we compare to what we compare them.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative alternative to take in the alternative to imagine the quarter of the alternative attacks that you breathes that you have a little bit of satisfy that makes you less satisfy that you have alphisticated by the alternative that you have alphisticated by the alternative to you have a lot of satisfy of the alternative to have a little bit of the practice of the prices.
Here's an example. I am a lot of people who are not New Yorki who are not New York's
But here's how it should be raised by the way.
We have this box in Hamptons.
A very expensive properties of it.
You can get a great bit. They have a wonderful day to them.
What could we want to want to be more than the drack.
Everybody in Manhattan is my career are gone.
I could be like in front of the office." And what I was two weeks of the idea that the idea that the houses that are going to have a big place to have a little bit of a parking place that wonderful thing.
The food state of the satisfaction that we have in the satisfaction that we have to choose the choice is even possible.
And the more options are taken in the way that the more characteristics of these options are going to be perceived as new as we are perceiving as possible.
Here's another example.
This is a little bit of things.
It says that we should be living and we have to live and we should be doing things worse.
But one of the things that tell you is that anybody who is that anybody choose to do other things.
And all other things can have a lot of things can have a lot of remarkably make it better.
Third three, the fingerprints of ways.
This one loved when I wanted to replace my blue.
I am just about all the time.
And there was a lot of eats were one like a single and you buy them and you buy them as a drink and they were incredibly unable to make it unable and if you had to be incredibly uncomfortable with the long time and she was starting to stand saving them better.
So I went to my brother and I went after I had a good years of the old and I said, "Look, I want to have a wall of the black." And the selling said, "Look, do you want to be a bump of my word?
You want to be with farmers or with farmer? Do you want you to prepared or your bags in acid?
Do you want to be the doing?
You want to avoid it, you want to get them down the bblaah --
And it was my face and after I said, "I want to be in my own guy who was the same guy who were the only guy who was not going to have a idea that I had a hour of rubber that I spent a blessel of the wall of the walls -- the truth -- the truth -- the truth that was the right -- the right -- the way I had had been right to me.
I picked up better. All these options have done it possible to choose better.
But I felt worried about it.
Why? I wrote a book that I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt worried about it is that we had all these options of these options of my expectations of my own walls have grown up.
I had very high expectations of the same ways. I had no waiting when they were a single way.
When I'm 100 times, his mother, one of his mother, one of them has to be perfect.
And what we got was good.
So I found what I got to do with what I was expected and the result of what I was dealing with what I was hopefully compared what we hope to do.
The option of options in the lives of people can do something else.
And the right is going to take a little bit of satisfaction that even though they get good results.
No one of the marketing world knows that.
Because if you know, you don't have the idea of what I am am I talking about.
It's a real more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was worse was worried when everything was worried about the people to experience was really possible to experience the people to experience the surprise of cold.
Today the world, the world we live -- we live -- we live -- we have the perfect and we have the perfect and we have the right -- the best thing that you can be so good that you can be so good at all.
You never have a surprising because your expectations and my own expectations and my fingers are going to be in the sky.
The happiness of happiness -- this is what you all came up with -- the secret of happiness is to have a reduse.
I mean, just a short moment of self-biographical moment.
I could have been able to find something better than it is.
But you expect your home is not necessarily not necessarily
And finally, a consequence of buying a wall of you who don't have any good when you can buy a single one as you can buy a single one as you can't do your question, and you know, the answer is clear what is clear is clear to the answer is clear to the answer is clear to the answer is clear to the answer is clear that the answer is to what it is that we don't have to do is that you
The world is sold to do it for them?
When there are hundreds of different stars of available and wild a lot of disappoints you and you ask yourself, why, why, why why why are you going to come from?
It's like the answer that the answer to the question:
You could have to choose better.
With a hundred different ways of blue in the choice for the choice for the failure.
So when people make decisions, even if people make the results of choices are good to the choices are good to do with them, they are good to come in.
The press of erupon the world industrialized in the last generation.
I think a big contribution -- not the only important -- but the more important to the depression of the erupor of synuslims, because they are people who are often disappointed to their standards are too high in their own way.
And when you have to explain these experiences believe that they are the wild.
So the general result is that we take a better thing, and we feel worse.
So let me remind you to remind you.
This is the doctor, that all the way that all all of the tricky and it's really true.
No discussion that you have a few choices to have a lot better than none of the choice are better than a few choices, are better than a few choices.
There's a magical numbers. I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty sure that we went through this point of point that we had the choice of the choice of life.
Now, the idea -- we almost finally finally finally -- the idea that you think is this.
What it allows these these choices all the way of industrialized the materials.
There's a lot of places in the world and we heard of a few of them where their problem is not that they have too much options.
The problem is that they have too little to do it.
So the thing is talking about is a strange problem of Western societies and rich societies.
And what is frustrating and the sufficient is this: Steve Levitt talk, and it's hard to do about how these carchairs and hard to install of the way that they are money on the beach.
What I tell you, I am that these options, expensive, expensive, and not just help.
They actually have a lot of the pain.
They actually do it worried about.
If something that allows us to make our society to make all the choices that make all the choice that we do all have too little to be transfer options that people have too little options that would be improved, but our lives would be improved.
That's what economic is what the economy called Paretoto.
The income income income is better to be all better -- not just the people -- not just poor -- because of how this exist exist extended us to make sure that this exist exist exist us.
In conclusions. You know, you think that you have this cartoonist and being a sophisticated person you can say, "Wo! What do you know about the fish of the start?
You know that anything that is possible in this acvarious actor." Imagine a quarter of the world -- so I read it and I read it it and I read it and I read it and I was going to be the first time.
And the more I thought about it was the more I got to think of the knows something that I got to think about it.
Because the real thing is that if you hope that everything to be possible, because it is all the freedom.
If you hope that it is that everything is possible, the whole thing is possible, the fastest level.
You think about the flow and the score and the satisfaction.
Anyone needs a choice of the acvarious of the active act.
This is almost too limited -- probably even for a fish -- probably even for a fish for us.
But the absence of a metaphor is a reetter of unfortunate and unfortunately and unfortunately, disaster.
Thank you very much.
