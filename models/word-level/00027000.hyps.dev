<unk> last year we <unk> these two <unk> to <unk>  <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>   <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>   <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But this <unk> the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> problem.
The <unk> of the <unk> is, in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
She <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you is going to be a <unk> <unk> of what has been <unk> in the last 25 years.
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk>
As you can see, <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> or more,  You can see that it's almost like <unk>  <unk> <unk> from a <unk>
In 25 years it came to this <unk>
This is a problem because <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
where it <unk> a huge amount of carbon <unk> -- when it <unk> is turned into <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>  <unk> you might <unk> if we go through this <unk> <unk>
<unk> in certain <unk> a little bit of <unk>  <unk> actually <unk> to the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> at the University of <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> to another <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> She is <unk> <unk> if we are going to <unk>
And one reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> are much more than the <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
If you want to see how you <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk>  this is the place where it gets to <unk>
These <unk> grow very <unk>
And at the <unk> <unk> <unk>  the largest <unk> <unk> on the <unk>
<unk> <unk> people have <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> is <unk>  And <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk>  And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
In the <unk> <unk> the third than the <unk> <unk> <unk> who were <unk>
40 percent of the world's world's <unk>  <unk> <unk> percent of these <unk>
In <unk> this <unk> is the <unk> <unk> for this <unk>
<unk> have <unk>
But when you get that <unk> and the water <unk>
In <unk> it was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> as <unk> <unk> are <unk>
On the <unk> <unk> went to <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> on all the <unk>  have <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk> more in the last 30 years.
This is a <unk> <unk>
If you look at the <unk> <unk>  You can see what's going on.
Over the last five years --  I've been <unk> <unk> million <unk> of carbon <unk>  every <unk> <unk>   10 million <unk> hours every day in the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> and every part of the <unk> to the <unk> and every part of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
The biggest cause of <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> 20 to <unk> in the <unk> of it, it's <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is a problem and <unk> is the most <unk>
the United States is one of the two great <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> was to get more <unk> for <unk>
But let's see a <unk> <unk>
Here are the people who have <unk> in the last few years --  <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> there is a <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> industry and the <unk> <unk> a billion dollars in the last year <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>  what is a <unk>
This picture is my <unk>
In <unk> <unk> to me in <unk>  a billion <unk> <unk> was <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This is all the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
One of the <unk> <unk> kind of around the <unk> <unk> was this.
<unk> <unk> <unk> the man with <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and <unk>
He is from the <unk> here in the <unk> and helps <unk> <unk>
<unk> the man with the <unk> becomes <unk> <unk>
This is <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> This is <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> I want to be <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> don't have what I'm talking about.
<unk> So the <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
This is one of them, some of them.
<unk> <unk> At the <unk> we see <unk> <unk> like a <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's why our main <unk> is to <unk> a big <unk> of money to <unk> <unk> <unk> that help us <unk> and <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
<unk> is that, in fact, it's not <unk>
We think it's <unk> -- and <unk> and <unk>
So it's not going to <unk> <unk>
You see this in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> heard a <unk>
So let's make a <unk> of this <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is about <unk>
But this is the sound of technology <unk>
And while the <unk> <unk> is one of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> technology of the <unk> that we <unk> here  <unk>
<unk> with <unk> this is the technology of <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> America is in <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> that <unk> all the <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>  <unk> and <unk> <unk>
But now we have a new <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>
<unk> America with <unk> <unk>  in 10 years ago, <unk>
A plan to put America in the <unk>  to make us more <unk> and to help the <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> a <unk> which is <unk> to help us <unk> our <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> This is <unk>
<unk> <unk> It's about <unk> <unk>
One of the most <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the planet <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is here <unk> <unk> a new <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We <unk> to create <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> It's time for <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you want to <unk> <unk>
We have to get <unk>
Thank you very much.
<unk> year at TED I made a <unk> <unk>
And I was trying to show you a little <unk> about how do you <unk> this.
<unk> <unk> And for the people who have not been here,  <unk> is the largest experiment that was <unk> <unk> --  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or is it <unk> <unk>  <unk> or is it <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> --  -- to <unk> billion times per <unk>
It's extremely <unk>
This is <unk> under the <unk> <unk>
<unk> the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk>
I work on this <unk> It's called <unk> <unk> --  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>    <unk> <unk> <unk> here <unk> in <unk>  So you can see the <unk>
On the 10 <unk> last year we started <unk> for the first <unk>
And this picture was the <unk> <unk>
He <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> room.
This is a picture of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that has <unk> across the <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> with some of the <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> in <unk>
In other words, when we <unk> that picture on 10 <unk>  -- I <unk> as a <unk> of <unk>  what is a <unk> <unk>
I don't know if that <unk> <unk> the biggest <unk>  And that, when someone went on Google <unk>  and he <unk> that the first <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> that we've made a huge impact on <unk> <unk>
<unk> about a <unk> we had a problem with <unk>  that actually had to do with these <unk> -- these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> thousands of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now, the <unk> in the room look at these <unk> and <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But I can do it because  when I am at the <unk> <unk> get what <unk> <unk> <unk>
So at <unk> <unk>  being more <unk> than the <unk> between the <unk>  -- those <unk> can <unk> these <unk>
At one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>  it was a <unk> <unk>
So the <unk> has <unk> <unk> and the thousands of <unk> have <unk> <unk> <unk>
This was <unk>
This is <unk>  <unk> that those <unk> <unk> over 20 <unk>  and they <unk> almost 30 <unk>
<unk> we <unk> about 50 <unk>
We had to ask them what we've <unk>
I <unk> <unk> <unk>
And now the <unk> <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> will be like <unk> <unk>
<unk> we're going to <unk> again, and <unk> us to <unk> data in <unk> or <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and we're going to <unk> to find out what the <unk> <unk> of <unk>
Now, <unk> like in a way,  those <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I think the fact that it's so <unk>  The fact that we have <unk> <unk> this is the <unk> <unk> like <unk>
So I'm going to <unk> the words of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --  -- which I think of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  -- <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> are no longer <unk>
Thank you.
I would want to <unk> you to <unk> <unk> <unk>  when you <unk> with the <unk>
What do you want to do is you want to <unk> them and <unk> them <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> of how many of the <unk> world.
So, as a <unk> <unk>  <unk> by this <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> <unk> --  -- <unk> with my <unk> <unk> and my <unk> <unk> <unk> --  -- I started to <unk> me -- <unk> if I use a <unk>  instead of this <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> with a <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> how do we want <unk>
<unk> that was so <unk> I wanted to <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
In the <unk> a <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They can be <unk> <unk>  <unk> they can <unk> <unk> one <unk> and they have a <unk> and they have a <unk> and <unk> <unk>
The most important is that I am <unk>  <unk> like <unk> <unk> you can only <unk>
And <unk> the <unk> of a new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
As we <unk> these tools become more <unk>  <unk> of their <unk> <unk> <unk> each one of the <unk>  and the <unk> of our <unk> on the <unk>  and we can try and <unk>
I'm going to start with some examples of <unk>
This <unk> is <unk> to <unk> images of <unk> and if you <unk> it in a <unk> <unk> the film <unk>  If you <unk> it in the <unk> <unk>
These <unk> <unk> are <unk>
So if I put them one <unk> <unk> become <unk>
If there are <unk> they will be a little bit <unk>
<unk> can also <unk> and <unk>
We realized that one of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  how would it be to <unk> a color <unk> I <unk>
In this case, we have three <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and I can use them <unk> color in the <unk>  where they will <unk>
If we spend too much, we can <unk> a little bit <unk>
We also <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and see the <unk> <unk>
So here --  This is a <unk> <unk> that I do with a simple <unk> <unk>
Here we have a <unk> <unk> a kind of <unk> between <unk> and <unk>
<unk> every <unk>  —  <unk> a <unk> <unk> on every <unk> and <unk> and <unk> what you want to <unk> they are <unk> with a <unk>
And then, after about 30 seconds is <unk> <unk> and you have a new set of <unk> and new <unk> of <unk>
<unk>
These are <unk> children who came to the <unk> <unk> <unk>  and I started to <unk> them and <unk> a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
And one of the <unk> <unk> of this kind of <unk>  is that you don't have to give people a lot of <unk>
All we need to do is is <unk> <unk>  and they know exactly what to <unk>
Here are <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It turns out everything that he wanted to <unk> was to <unk> the <unk> each other.
So for him were just <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
We wanted to build a <unk> that <unk> <unk>
And this is <unk>
He can <unk> new <unk> in the <unk>  only <unk> on the <unk> <unk>
Here we <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
David <unk> Now he <unk> a <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk> one <unk> <unk>  he can make his <unk> --  <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> your own <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> It's a story <unk> <unk> and he <unk> the <unk>  and he <unk> how to <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> example I have time to <unk> <unk> today  is a <unk> that created and <unk> music <unk> <unk> <unk>  that I built <unk> and in which <unk> have been <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Each one of these has four different <unk>  <unk> you want to <unk>
And you can <unk> in a <unk>  that you can <unk> after the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by a <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> that you can <unk> <unk> like <unk> and <unk>
<unk> by a certain <unk> and then we <unk> it to <unk> it.
<unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> and <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
<unk>   <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk>  in two <unk> of <unk> you <unk> them in a <unk>  a more <unk> <unk>
Now I put a line of <unk>
<unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk>          <unk> now I'm going to <unk> the <unk> <unk>
<unk>
<unk>  <unk> Now I'm going to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk>
So I don't have to make <unk> in <unk> I can <unk>  <unk> or <unk> <unk> in <unk>
Now, in <unk> I can <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
You know how you <unk>  My <unk> is <unk> by new <unk> <unk>  that <unk> better with the way the brain and our <unk>
And today, I had time to show you a <unk> of this new <unk> of <unk> and some of the <unk> that he <unk> to <unk> from the <unk>
The <unk> I would like <unk> <unk>  is that we are at the <unk> with this new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that will bring the <unk> into the <unk> world.
Thank you very much.
<unk> with the <unk> to <unk>
They're <unk>
<unk> write <unk> is my <unk> but of course, more than that.
It's my big <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And I don't think this thing to change <unk>
But these being <unk> something kind of <unk> has been <unk> in my life, and in my <unk>  that <unk> my <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk>
And the <unk> thing is that I wrote recently --  -- this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- which is <unk> to any of my <unk> <unk>  -- -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is that <unk> I go now,  people <unk> me <unk> I would be <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> for example, <unk> and I say, <unk> <unk> is <unk> -- it's not <unk> it's not <unk> it's <unk> that you're not going to be able to <unk> this <unk>
It's not <unk> that you're going to continue to <unk> your life <unk>  <unk> <unk> a book that <unk> them to <unk> a book to <unk> them on this world.  <unk>
It's very <unk>
But it would have been even more <unk> if you're not <unk> <unk>  that 20 years ago, when I started to <unk> people -- at the time I was <unk> --  that I want to become <unk>  I <unk> <unk> on a kind of <unk>
And people say, "I don't know you have the <unk> of <unk>
You don't <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's not <unk> that you're going to work your life in this <unk>  and nothing <unk> will <unk> from here  and <unk> is going to <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> like this.
<unk> -- <unk> <unk> all those <unk> is <unk>
Yes, I think of all those things.
And the <unk> <unk>
And my <unk> is <unk> <unk> a lot of other things --  that people <unk> can't <unk>
For example, <unk> <unk> and other things that are <unk>
But when it's all about --  the thing that I've been <unk> that I've been thinking about for the last <unk>
It's <unk>
It is <unk> that anyone to think that  to be <unk> by the work that they feel that they have been <unk> to <unk> on this <unk>
And what is so <unk> <unk> <unk>  what seems like we are <unk> with <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  in a way that other <unk> not <unk>
My <unk> for example, has been <unk> <unk> <unk> and I don't remember that in the 40 years of <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> if you're not <unk> them to be a <unk> <unk>
It was not <unk> -- <unk> how does it <unk> in <unk> <unk>
It's just not <unk>
But in order to be <unk> <unk> <unk> like group  <unk> not too <unk> across the <unk>  to be <unk> <unk>
We <unk> <unk> we have this <unk> and not only <unk> but <unk> of all the <unk>  It turns out that they have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> <unk>
And what we have to do is to think about the <unk> <unk> <unk>  only in the <unk> century in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that died of young and often their own <unk>
And even the <unk> that didn't <unk> to the <unk>  seem to be with the <unk> <unk> of their own <unk>
<unk> <unk> even the <unk> to <unk> in the last <unk> he said, <unk> the <unk> of my <unk> me a little bit more <unk>
A <unk> <unk> about your work <unk>
But I didn't even know when I was <unk> someone <unk> this is because I heard so many things so many times  and kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>  The idea like <unk> and the <unk> are kind of <unk>  The idea like <unk> and the <unk> are kind of <unk> to the <unk> in a <unk>
And the <unk> that I want to <unk> a <unk> of all here  The <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
<unk> <unk> with it --  because the way you see it with your <unk> <unk> --  I don't don't get <unk> at this <unk>
I think it's <unk>
And I also think it's <unk>  and I would never like to <unk> it in the <unk> century.
I think it's better if we <unk> our <unk> to <unk>
And I was <unk> that my <unk> -- in my <unk> --  would be very <unk> for me to try to <unk> my <unk> <unk>  of this <unk> in particular <unk> <unk>  where I am now <unk>
As an example,  I'm pretty <unk> I only about 40 years.
I have probably <unk> four <unk> <unk>
And it's very likely that all what I'm going to write <unk> with this <unk>  be <unk> by <unk> <unk> like what it came after  The success of my <unk> <unk> <unk>
What would I say to do is I <unk> because in a kind of <unk> the <unk> that we are already friends --  -- it's very likely to be <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This is the kind of <unk> that you might have someone <unk>  to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and I don't want to get that <unk>
I'm going to do this <unk> that I <unk>
And then, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And so I was <unk> after the <unk> <unk>  that I have to work right now, to keep <unk>  is by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> in a way, to <unk> a <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>  between me that my <unk> and my <unk> absolutely <unk>  that will be <unk> now <unk> to what I <unk>
And as I've been <unk> in the last year in this <unk>  I started to <unk> over the <unk>  and I started to <unk> other <unk>  <unk> <unk> if I could have better ideas and more <unk> and more <unk> <unk> of our <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> this took me to <unk> and <unk> <unk>
So the <unk> <unk> <unk>
But at the time, the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
People thought that <unk> was a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that <unk> on people in a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>  for <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> was <unk> because it <unk> that it has a <unk>  that <unk> them out of the <unk>
The <unk> had <unk> <unk>  but <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
What is <unk> because <unk> don't actually <unk>  like a <unk> was a <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> like a <unk> was a kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a kind of like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> -- this is, this is really the <unk> that <unk> --  that <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> to <unk> <unk>
And we <unk> the world like this <unk> <unk>
So the <unk> <unk> was <unk> by certain things like this,  For example, too much <unk> <unk>
If your work was <unk> you couldn't <unk> you could <unk> all the <unk> for her, <unk> the world like <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk>
If your work was <unk> it wasn't completely <unk> your <unk>
<unk> the world <unk> that <unk> <unk> was about <unk>
So they <unk> people in the <unk> <unk> for a long time.
And then it came up and everything was <unk>  <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> the idea of the <unk> is to put the man in the center of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that get <unk> from the <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> <unk> and people started to <unk> as a <unk>  <unk> with all of the <unk>
And for the first <unk> in history --  people started thinking about one or some of the <unk> as being <unk>  instead of <unk> a <unk>
And I have to <unk> I think that has done a <unk> <unk>
<unk> the <unk> of a simple <unk>  to <unk> that he or she is actually <unk>  that it's actually <unk> and <unk> and <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's like <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>
It's just <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> all of these <unk> <unk>
I think that   <unk> has <unk> us <unk> one after <unk> in the last 500 years.
<unk> if it's <unk>  And I think that it is,  <unk> <unk> what we do <unk>
We can make things <unk>
We can think about <unk> <unk>  <unk> of the <unk> between people and <unk> <unk>
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't just <unk> 500 years of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  through a <unk> <unk>
And there are probably some people in the audience who would <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> you're not going to <unk> to this <unk>
But the <unk> I want to put it is --  Why <unk>
Why don't you <unk>
Because it makes sense as much as anything that we've heard about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> that anyone who has <unk> the <unk> to create something --  -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> in fact, sometimes maybe <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> I had a <unk> where I <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that now has about about <unk> years ago, and who was <unk> his <unk> to his life and he <unk> me that when he was <unk> in the <unk>  <unk> and it just <unk> to work on the <unk>  <unk> and it just <unk> over the <unk>
<unk> it was like a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And she <unk> she <unk> over the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> because he <unk> his <unk> <unk>
At that point, that <unk> has a single thing of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
And I thought I was going to <unk> <unk> <unk>  and <unk> the idea was to go to a <unk> <unk> and a <unk>  fast because when I <unk> it was going through it <unk> and <unk> it <unk>
Sometimes it wasn't enough <unk>  So that <unk> and <unk> and <unk> but it doesn't <unk> in the home  and the <unk> is <unk> through it and <unk> it <unk> and <unk> it <unk> and the <unk> <unk> on the <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>
There were also <unk> where --  and that part of the <unk> I'm not going to look <unk> --  <unk> <unk> where the story like almost <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the story of the <unk> <unk> and the story was <unk> after he with the <unk> <unk> and he <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> it into the body and <unk> it into the body <unk>
In this kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>  But the <unk> from the last <unk>
<unk> I've been <unk> -- it's <unk>  it was just like my own <unk> <unk>
My <unk> <unk> is not <unk> to this -- I'm not <unk>
I am a <unk> and the way I <unk>  I was trying to <unk> me every day at the end of the day at the time I was <unk>
But even me, in my <unk>  But I was actually <unk> by that <unk>
And I <unk> that have been <unk> and many of you.
<unk> and I had <unk> projects or ideas from a <unk> that came from a <unk> to <unk>
And what do you <unk>
And how it turns out that we should be thinking about it so that we can't <unk> our <unk> <unk> <unk>
For me, <unk> the most <unk> in our day that we have about how you can do --  <unk> is the <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> I took a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We talk about <unk> this <unk>  and the <unk> has been almost <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>   <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And with the time of the <unk> has been <unk> and me as one day as a <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and then everything has <unk>
<unk> the <unk> of a <unk>  <unk> a short <unk> from a <unk>  that comes to mind and <unk> as it <unk> <unk> with <unk> and <unk> as it <unk> <unk> and it's <unk>  <unk> to it, but it has no way to <unk> it.
It has no <unk> no <unk> no <unk> no <unk> no <unk>
I was trying to <unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk>  <unk> <unk> and <unk> that will <unk> me for <unk>
They're not good <unk> they will <unk>
And instead of his <unk> just <unk>
He <unk> the process of <unk> and he did something with all <unk>
He <unk> the <unk> the <unk> and said, <unk> you don't see that they're at the <unk>
It turns out that I could write a <unk> <unk>
If you want to <unk> <unk> at some point <unk>  when I can get <unk> you.
If not, <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> process has changed after that.
<unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> as <unk>
But the process of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> around his <unk>  He <unk> the moment he <unk> the <unk> what he <unk> in him and he <unk> his way to <unk> the <unk> where he <unk> <unk>  <unk> that it doesn't have to be something so <unk> and so <unk>
It could be this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> of a <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> which was not too <unk>
Once I heard the story I started to change a little bit of <unk>  the way that <unk> me and has already <unk> me a <unk>
So this approach that <unk> me when I was at the middle of the <unk> <unk>  and I <unk> in a kind of <unk> of the <unk> when I was working with something that doesn't come and <unk> it is going to be the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Not just <unk> but the most <unk> book <unk>
Let me <unk> that I should just <unk> the <unk>
That's when I <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I <unk> my <unk> <unk> and I <unk> my <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> of <unk>
I said to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  And you and I <unk> that if this book is not <unk>  it's not just my <unk> my <unk> <unk>
Because you can see that I <unk> one <unk> all I have to <unk>  and more so not <unk>
So if you want to be better than <unk> you have to <unk> you have to make your <unk> <unk>
<unk> And if you're not going to do that, you <unk> something, <unk>
I'm going to write because that's my <unk>
And I want to <unk> for <unk>  that I made my <unk> <unk>
Because --  --  -- <unk> is, <unk> --               — — — —  — —    — — —   — — — — — — —  — —  — —                    <unk> <unk> is, by hundreds of years.
And they were <unk> <unk> because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> <unk>
But it <unk> very <unk> something <unk>  and one of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I am <unk> that I am <unk> to what I <unk>  because the <unk> <unk> <unk> in a certain certain <unk> of this <unk>
It's like the time is <unk> and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> nothing different than <unk> in the other <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> it doesn't seem to be in <unk> <unk>
It's <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> when it <unk>  <unk> people <unk> what was and <unk> them <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's <unk>
A <unk> interesting interesting --  when the <unk> <unk> <unk> led to them this <unk>  And the <unk> turned into the <unk> <unk> <unk>
and it <unk> <unk> during the <unk> with <unk> and <unk>
<unk> when a <unk> has <unk> something impossible and <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> -- a <unk> <unk>
It's <unk> because we need that.
But the <unk> part of the next day of <unk>  when the <unk> <unk> is <unk> and <unk> that it's <unk> 11 <unk> and it's not a <unk> of <unk>
It's a <unk> that <unk> that you <unk> <unk>  and you may not be <unk> <unk> at the same <unk>
You might not know that no one more <unk> the name of the <unk> when he <unk>  So what would <unk> that we should be able to do with the rest of the <unk> <unk>
It's <unk>
It's one of the most <unk> <unk> <unk>
But maybe it wouldn't be a <unk> even so big if you don't think <unk> from <unk> <unk>  that the <unk> <unk> of your <unk>
Maybe if you think that <unk> was <unk> <unk>  <unk> a <unk> <unk> for a few <unk> <unk> of your life <unk>  to be <unk> <unk> when the <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you think that everything <unk> to <unk>
And so I started to <unk> and so I <unk> <unk> in the last few months of the book that will be <unk> <unk>    <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And what I have to <unk> <unk>  when I <unk> my <unk> is: I don't <unk>
It's not going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> whatever it is.
If you <unk> the <unk> then <unk>
If you <unk> the <unk> and you know what <unk> is <unk>  <unk> to <unk> the <unk> even for a <unk> <unk>
And if not, <unk> <unk>
And all of this <unk> for you.
I think in these things and I think we should <unk>
<unk> for you, <unk>  It's just because it <unk> a <unk> <unk> for <unk> and <unk>  to <unk> in <unk>
<unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
We've also talked about some of these <unk>  about human <unk> and what he might be <unk> and what he might <unk> and <unk> of new <unk> <unk>
Now <unk> in fact, from a new <unk>  So we've been <unk> <unk>  and now we're trying to <unk> from this <unk> <unk> and <unk> in a new <unk> of life.
We've been trying to ask <unk> <unk>
"What is <unk> is something that I think a lot of <unk> <unk>  different <unk>
We tried different <unk>  <unk> life to <unk> <unk>
<unk> for about 20 years.
When I <unk> the <unk> <unk>  This went out of the <unk> world of <unk>
Now we're trying to <unk> we can <unk> the <unk>  or we can create new forms of <unk>  from this <unk> <unk>
This is the <unk> of a small <unk>  <unk> <unk> that has the <unk> <unk> for a species that <unk> the only <unk>
We have been trying to see if we can <unk> it with a <unk> and more <unk>
We were able to <unk> a hundred <unk> of a hundred <unk> to be there.
But when we look at <unk> <unk> <unk>  is pretty simple --  in <unk> with our <unk>
<unk> this is simple.
But when we look at all the <unk>  that we can <unk> at some point,  it's probably a little bit like this to <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
So I decided that the only way I was going to be <unk> this <unk>  so that we can <unk> the <unk>  to <unk> some of the <unk> <unk>
And so I started on the <unk>  <unk> <unk> a <unk>
Maybe it allows the <unk> of these very big <unk>  that we've never <unk>
And if yes, we can <unk> a <unk>
A <unk> <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk>
So our <unk> of <unk> life has <unk> to <unk> to a <unk> <unk>
Our ability to write <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> but it <unk>
<unk> has come to a <unk> <unk>
I started this more than 15 years ago.
We went through a couple of <unk> <unk>  In fact, with a <unk> <unk> before we do the first <unk>
But it turns out that <unk> <unk>  is very <unk>
There are <unk> of thousands of <unk> in the world --  that make little <unk> of 30 to 50 percent <unk>  but it's a <unk> process so why is it <unk> a piece of <unk>  with so many <unk> <unk>
So we had to create a new <unk>  to put these little <unk> together and <unk> all the <unk>
This was our first <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a little <unk> <unk> <unk>
We made <unk> <unk> we went through the <unk> <unk> and we <unk> a <unk> DNA <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> came when I took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk>  and I <unk> in the <unk>  and the <unk> started to <unk> this <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> have been then <unk> out of the cells and then <unk> and <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and I think that I understand very clear this <unk>
They <unk> more than you.
And so we think this is a <unk>  where <unk> <unk> can build their own <unk>  in a <unk> system.
But we wanted to do something <unk>
We wanted to build the entire <unk> of a <unk>
This is over <unk> <unk> <unk>
So we said to put the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> the size of the <unk> <unk> to actually <unk> the size of the <unk>  that is the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk>
<unk> is <unk> and if you <unk> with the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>  that <unk> has to be very <unk>
When I first <unk> this <unk> in <unk>  <unk> <unk> was a <unk> <unk> <unk>
I <unk> in the <unk>  <unk> If we would have used <unk> <unk> <unk>  this never could have been <unk>
<unk> from design is <unk> <unk>  that has <unk> <unk> 50 <unk>  that has to be <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk>  to build the <unk> so that you have to be <unk> so that the <unk> are <unk> with each other.
<unk> elements <unk>
You may have read the <unk> in the <unk>      <unk> <unk> we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> in four <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> percent of those <unk>  <unk> <unk> 20 <unk> <unk>  one single <unk> <unk>  one single <unk> <unk>
So we can use the <unk> <unk> to write words to <unk>  <unk>
<unk> everything we did was to <unk> <unk>
Some were <unk> that it's not <unk>
We <unk> those <unk> so we can <unk> them with <unk>
There are <unk> that <unk> and <unk> them.
So we started to make <unk>  <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> on these <unk> to make <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and then the <unk> <unk> of these <unk> <unk> to <unk>
Every single <unk> we <unk> these <unk> in the <unk>  to be able to <unk> it <unk>  <unk> we try to create an extremely <unk> <unk> process -- and as you will see in a <unk>
Let's get to that <unk>
So this looks like a <unk> <unk>
When we get to very large <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  not grow so in the <unk> <unk>
<unk> all the <unk> <unk> <unk>
So we <unk> to other <unk>
I think there is a <unk> called the <unk> <unk> which I <unk> it uses to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
This is an example.
There's a <unk> called  <unk> <unk> that can <unk> millions of <unk> <unk>
And as you can see in the <unk> <unk> his <unk> is <unk> in <unk>
<unk> 12 to <unk> later, he put it in <unk> and it was at <unk>
We have thousands of <unk> that can do that.
These <unk> can be <unk>
They can <unk> in the <unk>
I am absolutely sure life can be in the <unk> <unk>  to be <unk> a new <unk> <unk>
In fact, <unk> showed that this was <unk> up there.
Here is a <unk> of a <unk> that we <unk>  using these <unk> -- actually using these <unk> -- actually using just <unk> <unk> --  with the <unk> of the <unk> that we <unk>
<unk> put them together <unk>
This is not a picture from a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's so a big <unk>  that we can see it with a <unk> <unk>
These are <unk> images <unk> over a period of about six <unk>
This is a <unk> that we've <unk> a little bit of time.
These are over <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's the largest <unk> ever made by <unk> with a <unk> <unk>
It has a <unk> <unk> over 300 <unk>
If you <unk> it with a <unk> <unk> and no <unk>  <unk> takes <unk> <unk> <unk>  to <unk> this <unk> <unk>
So how does a <unk> How do you <unk>
<unk> with a <unk> is pretty <unk>
But it's much more <unk> to <unk>
<unk> also when you get to <unk> to <unk> as a <unk>  You can only <unk> <unk>  And you can just <unk> <unk> and that's something that you all heard -- <unk>
With <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the <unk>  but I showed that we can make a completely <unk>  of a <unk> from a cell to a cell <unk> and we can <unk> it.
I <unk> a <unk> from one of the <unk> <unk>
These two are as <unk> as people and <unk>
We <unk> a few <unk> <unk>  so that we can <unk> for this <unk>
We <unk> it with <unk>  to <unk> all the <unk>
And it was quite <unk> when we put it in the cell --  -- you will <unk> our very <unk> -- and the <unk> has <unk> in <unk>
In fact, I thought that was how far you could <unk> but I tried to <unk> the process something on.
This is a <unk> <unk> of <unk>
<unk> all kinds of <unk>  that have <unk> a second <unk> or a <unk> <unk> or a <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> thousands of new <unk> <unk>  in a <unk>
So the people who think about the <unk>  just like a single <unk> <unk> at some point of the <unk>
There are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that actually <unk> <unk>
<unk> who was in a cell -- not <unk>
<unk> -- the <unk> that we put new -- <unk>
It was <unk> and it was <unk> and it <unk>  The other <unk> as a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It became <unk> because of the <unk> that we put in the <unk>
And after a very <unk> period of time,  all the <unk> of a species have been <unk> and it <unk> completely in a species --  based on <unk> that I put in <unk>
All the <unk> were <unk>  <unk> were <unk> --  <unk> when the <unk> <unk> is exactly what we <unk>
So this can <unk> as a <unk> <unk>  but it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  We change things quite <unk>
Now, we've <unk> that this is not <unk> --  but to build three billion years of <unk> and a half <unk>  and we <unk> that maybe we are on the way to create a new version of <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Why do that?
I think it's quite obviously <unk> <unk>
We are about to go from six and a half billion people over 40 years.
So to put it in the <unk> for me <unk>  I was born in <unk>
Now there are three people on the planet for every one of us who are <unk> in <unk> 40 years, will be <unk>
We have <unk> <unk> water <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
It will be hard to do it for <unk>
<unk> over five billion <unk> of <unk> <unk> to more than 30 billion <unk> <unk>
This is a hundred million <unk> a day.
When we're going to try to think about <unk> <unk>  or whatever process that <unk> that,  is going to be a <unk> <unk>
<unk> of course, is all that  <unk> from this <unk>  that goes into the <unk>
Now, from the <unk> of our <unk> around the world, and we have a <unk> of over 20 million <unk> and I like to think about it as the <unk> <unk> in the future.
<unk> <unk> only has a <unk> or so something, <unk> and this is the <unk> that came out of this.
We are <unk> here, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and our <unk>
We now have <unk>  <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk>  do what we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have the ability to build a big <unk> per day.
When you think about to <unk> these 20 million different <unk>  or try to <unk> the <unk>  to produce <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> we can only <unk> a <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> than the last 20 years of <unk> from all the <unk>
And this is just <unk> <unk>
We can <unk> for <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> of a design <unk>  that <unk> to be able to <unk> us and work on these species in <unk>
<unk> we always know how it's going to <unk>
We know exactly what their <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now we are <unk> to <unk> <unk>
You have recently seen that from <unk> to <unk>  is just a <unk> <unk>
We have <unk> <unk> the second and the third <unk>  that are going to be <unk> <unk>  that are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that are <unk> <unk> or different types of <unk>
But the only way that we believe that <unk>  can have a huge impact <unk> without <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of their <unk>  is if we start with <unk> as a <unk> <unk> and we work to <unk> cells for this <unk>  and we think we are going to have the first <unk> of <unk> <unk> to about <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> --  -- but in our <unk> our <unk> around the world --  -- we have all kinds of other <unk>
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>  about two <unk> and a half <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> in <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk>
We want to see if we can take a <unk>  <unk> that can be easily <unk> in the <unk>  and <unk> that <unk> back to the <unk>
So in a <unk> period of time,  we think we could <unk>  what is the basic question of <unk> <unk>
We know --  We have <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> the entire <unk> <unk>
Yeah. If you can't do that at <unk> where another <unk>
<unk> a <unk> <unk>
But <unk> we're working now using these same <unk>  to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
You have seen this year with <unk>  We are always a year ago, and a <unk> in the <unk>  when it comes to <unk> <unk>
I think <unk> can be <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So here's how it might look like the future <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are almost to <unk> people.
Our <unk> is just to make sure that we have a <unk>  <unk> <unk> enough to be able to do that. Thank you very much.
So what I want to show you a little bit more <unk>  is a new <unk> technology --  is a new <unk> a new technology -- which is <unk>
There is a environment that can be <unk> or <unk>  with a big amount of data <unk>
Now we look at the <unk> many <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in <unk> almost <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
We don't think about how much <unk> are these <unk> or how big these <unk> are <unk>
Most of them are <unk> by a <unk> <unk> room, <unk>  but for example, is a <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> of 300 <unk>
It doesn't have <unk>  because the only thing that you should <unk> <unk>  of a system like that is the number of <unk> your <unk>  at some point of your <unk> is also a very <unk> <unk>
This is a book <unk> an example of <unk>
It's the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Each <unk> is a <unk>
To tell you that it's about <unk> and not <unk>  We can do something like that, to show with <unk>  that it's a real <unk> of a <unk> it's not a <unk>
Maybe this is a <unk> way to <unk> a book in <unk> <unk>
You don't <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk> It's a <unk> of <unk>
Each image is the beginning of a <unk>
This <unk> gives the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk>  to <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We also did something <unk> to the <unk> of this number of <unk>
We created a <unk> <unk> at a very large <unk> --  much bigger than any <unk> <unk> -- and we <unk> a <unk> <unk>
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> you can see it here.
Or other <unk> or even <unk> <unk>
And this really <unk> at certain certain <unk>  <unk> the <unk> of a <unk>
<unk> like this to <unk> <unk> <unk> and other <unk> like this -- which are not <unk>
<unk> <unk> is one of the <unk> <unk>  for a technology like this.
I'm not going to spend a lot of time on <unk>  but just to tell you that we have more <unk> to this <unk>
These are all the <unk> in the United States <unk> <unk>
Now let's go to something else.
This is actually <unk> on the Internet <unk> you can <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>  that <unk> two different <unk> One of them is <unk>  and the other <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and <unk> <unk> <unk> A <unk> <unk>
So this is <unk> on the <unk> <unk> because of the <unk>
You can see that when we create this kind of <unk> <unk>  when we can <unk> through <unk> <unk>  We can have this kind of experience in many <unk>
But the <unk> <unk> of these <unk> really <unk>
<unk> of <unk> <unk> have <unk> these <unk> together, so that they can <unk> the real <unk> where these pictures --  all the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> --  all the <unk> <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> --  -- all these <unk> have been <unk> <unk>
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other <unk>
There are some that have much more <unk> <unk>
I would like to go directly to one of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> --  -- this is part of a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> that we've been working in the <unk> --  -- to show you what I think is the <unk> of this <unk>  The <unk> is obviously not just <unk>  The technology is obviously not just <unk>  The fact that we <unk> on the <unk>
We had to take care of <unk> <unk>
<unk> is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>  from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>  <unk> And every one of these <unk> is a picture of this <unk>
These are <unk> <unk> and all of them were <unk> <unk> in this <unk>
We can just <unk> into this <unk>
<unk> I never thought I would get to work on the <unk>  It's very <unk> to have this kind of <unk> here.
I thought I was a <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> all the <unk> from the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in this <unk>
If I <unk> I'll find <unk> <unk>
There are so many <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> here is a series of <unk> -- <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk> who was <unk> <unk>
You can <unk> <unk>  towards a <unk> environment of this <unk>
The point is that you can do things  with the environment is to <unk> data from everybody --  -- from a <unk> <unk> <unk> --  from a <unk> <unk> <unk> --  -- from a <unk> -- and <unk> them all <unk> were <unk>  -- and to <unk> them have been <unk>  which is the big than the <unk>
<unk> a model of what around the entire <unk>
<unk> to that as the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this <unk> in <unk>  as the world <unk> the world <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> are becoming bigger as the <unk>
<unk> <unk> are <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk>
So if somebody would all of these <unk>  and they would say who are, then my <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> with all this data,  and I would use it as a <unk> point of <unk> to <unk> through that <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And, of course, a <unk> product of all of these are <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> not just <unk> above the <unk> and images of <unk>  <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris <unk> I understood <unk> What will it <unk> <unk> <unk>  is like a <unk> moment in the <unk> some years,  is that all the <unk> <unk> someone on the <unk>  to be <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does is it <unk>
<unk> <unk> if you <unk> <unk>
And this <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that becomes <unk> when you think about <unk>  <unk> <unk> that they have those <unk>
Like when you make a <unk> of images on the <unk>  <unk> after certain <unk> and <unk> from the Internet to the <unk>  gives a <unk> of information about what the <unk> is.
Now, what would be if that picture is <unk> with all the <unk> <unk>
So the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that <unk> from this is <unk> where the <unk> <unk>
CA: <unk> is really <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
One of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> <unk>  is the <unk> of living among the people who have never looked at the <unk>  that I still feel their <unk> in the <unk>  <unk> <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> still beyond the <unk> <unk>  or that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or that in the <unk>  <unk> <unk> still <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  And this is that the world we live in the <unk>  and this is the idea that the world we live that we live in a <unk>  It's just a <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> a certain set of <unk> <unk> that our <unk> have <unk> even though the <unk> <unk> many <unk>
And of course, we all <unk> the same <unk> <unk>
We all are <unk> we all bring kids to the world.
<unk> through <unk> <unk>
We have to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>  so we should not <unk> that all the <unk> <unk>  We all have <unk>
But what's interesting is the <unk> <unk> of <unk>  <unk> <unk> every <unk>
I think it's the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> or the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or a <unk> in the middle of the <unk>
So this is the kind of <unk> that we <unk> through the <unk>  or even a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world.
So all of these people learn that there are other ways of <unk> <unk>  other ways of <unk> you <unk> to <unk>
And this <unk> if you think about it,  maybe you <unk>
Now, the <unk> <unk> of the world together  form of life <unk> and <unk>  that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and it's as important for the health of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And you might think about this <unk> <unk> of life.  and you might have <unk> <unk>  and you might have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is the great <unk>
It's the <unk> of what we are and and everything we can be like a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as it <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk>  and it <unk>  -- and maybe a much larger <unk>
For example, no <unk> would <unk> to <unk>  that half or more of all the <unk> was or more of the <unk> because it's just not <unk>  and yet it's not <unk>  and yet yet it is -- the most <unk> <unk>  — in the <unk> <unk> <unk> --  in the <unk> <unk>
And the largest <unk> is of course <unk> <unk>
When you were born you, the people in this <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> on the planet.
Now, a <unk> is not just a <unk> or a set of <unk> <unk>
A <unk> is a <unk> of the human <unk>
It's <unk> by which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Each <unk> is a <unk> <unk> of <unk>  a <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And from those <unk> <unk> how we <unk> <unk> here in the <unk>  half of them are no longer <unk> in the <unk>
They are no longer <unk>  what it means in fact, if they don't change something,   -- that they are already <unk> <unk>
What can it be more <unk> than being <unk> by <unk>  to be the last of your <unk> that <unk> your <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>
And yet, that <unk> <unk> is actually <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> every two <unk>  -- because every two <unk> a <unk> a <unk> <unk> and it <unk> in the last <unk>  and it <unk> with it in the last last <unk>  and it <unk> with it <unk>
And I know that some of you will will say, <unk> <unk> <unk>
It would not be the world a better place,  if we all talk a single <unk> And I say, <unk>  that <unk> to be <unk> Or be <unk>
Or be <unk>
And then you will discover <unk> what it would be  not to be able to <unk> your own <unk>
So what I want to do today with you --  is a kind of <unk> <unk> --  a <unk> journey through <unk>  to try to give you a sense of what's really <unk>
Now, there are many of us who seem to be <unk>  that when they say different <unk> of <unk>  I really understand different ways of <unk>
Let's take an example of the kid in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>  that <unk> -- they came to the <unk> -- they came to the <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> that <unk> through the <unk>  You don't <unk> the <unk> <unk> because the <unk> is the <unk> <unk>  that people <unk>
I have a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>  which is called <unk> <unk> <unk>  You have to <unk> you with someone who talks about a different <unk>
And all of these are <unk> in the <unk> <unk>  yet it's a <unk> thing in these <unk> <unk>  where they talk about six or seven <unk>  because you never hear a <unk>
They just <unk> and then they start to <unk> the <unk>
<unk> one of the most <unk> <unk> that I have lived <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the first time in <unk>
In <unk> five <unk> they tried to <unk> and they made a <unk> <unk>
They <unk> out of the <unk>  <unk> with her <unk> <unk>  what she wanted to be a <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> that these people in the <unk> <unk> <unk>  They didn't see it in their life something <unk>
They took those <unk> on the <unk>  They tried to <unk> behind the <unk> to find the <unk> or the <unk>  They found <unk> <unk> that these are <unk> <unk> <unk> that these are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But <unk> do not <unk> <unk>
They <unk> and each other.
<unk> percent of their <unk> <unk> <unk>
We <unk> <unk> back with eight <unk> and we found two cases of <unk> <unk> and we found two cases of <unk> <unk> and when we <unk> them a little bit of <unk> <unk>  But the same time have a <unk> <unk>  But the same time they have a <unk> <unk>  But at the same time they have a <unk> <unk>  But at the same time they have a <unk>
<unk> <unk> can <unk> <unk> from 40 <unk> and tell you what the <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the early <unk> I had a <unk> <unk> <unk>  when I was asked my <unk> <unk> <unk>  if I were asked to go to <unk>  And if I were interested in my <unk>  -- which was the basis of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
To understand what <unk> behind the <unk>  I have to understand something about this <unk> <unk>  of <unk> and the <unk> is not a <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is a look at the <unk> of the world.
It's <unk>
If you look at the <unk> that are the <unk> <unk> of the world,  what would you <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> anything else.
<unk> <unk> out a <unk>  <unk> <unk> because of Africa is that <unk> Africa --  and the <unk> is the <unk> of course, they had <unk> <unk>  And the <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of these very <unk> <unk> <unk>
But what does it <unk> so interesting is this <unk> <unk>  between the <unk> and the <unk>
So the one <unk> <unk>
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk>  <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  so that for the short moment of <unk> <unk> is becoming <unk>
This is why I say <unk> <unk> <unk> people <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And because you're <unk> you're <unk> by <unk>  how you might be <unk>
So you can see these <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>  a pretty <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  to <unk> the body that is <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
Now, from all of the <unk> I met  the most <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>
<unk> you have <unk> <unk> <unk>  that once you <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> this <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a <unk> <unk> <unk>  this <unk> is the <unk> that has not been <unk> by <unk>
<unk> they are <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk>  but <unk> to be <unk> is pretty <unk>
<unk> young people are <unk> by their <unk> to the age of <unk>  <unk> in a <unk> world of <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the nine months of <unk>  <unk> in <unk> their <unk>  They are now <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>
And on the entire <unk>  They are <unk> in <unk> their <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> that their <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> --  -- or we could say, <unk> <unk>
At the end of this <unk>  one day I am <unk> <unk> <unk> and for the first time in their <unk> to 18 years,   I see see a <unk> And in that <unk> moment of <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> what they learned to <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and he says, <unk> That's the way the <unk> <unk>
It's really so <unk> It's your <unk> to <unk> it.
They call them <unk> <unk> <unk> and they say that we are <unk> more <unk>  We are the <unk> <unk> of the world.
Now, this level of <unk> becomes very <unk>
<unk> how many times we think about <unk> and <unk>  or <unk> <unk> <unk>  and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>  -- which is a <unk> idea in her <unk>  or <unk> new <unk> <unk> and say that these people are more than you <unk>
Well, <unk> are not <unk>  <unk> <unk>
It's not very place for <unk>  in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> but they created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> but they created a <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>  which is based on the idea of being <unk> by the idea of being <unk> by it <unk>
Now, what does that <unk>
That means that a <unk> in <unk>  which is raised to <unk> that <unk> is <unk> <unk>  that <unk> is going to be a <unk> human human <unk> and it will be a different human <unk> and it's going to have a different <unk> with the <unk> <unk>  <unk> that a <unk> is a lot of <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>
<unk> is the <unk> of a <unk> or a lot of <unk> is <unk>
<unk> is the <unk> that <unk> <unk>  between <unk> and the <unk> world.
I grew up in <unk> <unk> <unk>  to think that the <unk> <unk> to be <unk>
And that made me a different human <unk> than my <unk> in <unk> <unk>  who thought that those <unk> were <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> who lived in the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> who have lived to <unk> in their <unk> <unk>
If you want to <unk> the idea that --  these <unk> were able to create different <unk>  You will be able to start to <unk>  some of their <unk> Let's take this <unk>
It's a picture of me in the <unk> <unk> in <unk>
This is the <unk> that many of you have <unk>  The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is not <unk>  for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  but for his <unk> It's made of two different <unk>
The first one is this <unk>  that has in him a series of <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> only <unk>  is a kind of a kind of <unk> <unk> <unk>  that <unk> your <unk>  that <unk> your <unk> but the <unk> is <unk> with a <unk> of a <unk> in the <unk> family called <unk>
This <unk> <unk> some very <unk> <unk>  very close to the <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk>
If you ever saw the people in the <unk> <unk>  <unk> that <unk> of <unk> in their <unk>  that <unk> is made out of different <unk>  that <unk> and they <unk>
<unk> that <unk> through the <unk>  is actually like being <unk> from a <unk> <unk>  <unk> with <unk> <unk> and <unk> in a <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in a <unk> <unk>   It creates a <unk> of <unk>
In fact, I was working with my <unk> <unk> <unk> --  -- which is the man who <unk> was <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I was trying to <unk> that you can't <unk> these <unk>  as a <unk> because at the time you're under their <unk>  The problem is that they can't be <unk> a <unk>  The problem is that they can't be <unk> <unk>  -- because they can't be <unk> by a <unk>  -- because they can be <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk>
They can be <unk> <unk> only together  with other <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now, the thing <unk>  is that <unk> <unk> in that <unk>  are <unk> <unk> exactly the kind of <unk> <unk>  to <unk> <unk> So you <unk>  how about <unk> species of <unk> species of species of <unk>  that have found these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  which is the entire <unk> of <unk>
Well, we use that <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>  which is <unk> like <unk>
But <unk> <unk> and they say, <unk>
Well, what does that <unk>
This <unk> <unk> has <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> them on all in the <unk> from the big <unk> and we see all the <unk> as a single <unk>
And then they tell them how they <unk> their <unk>  and they say, you know something about <unk>
<unk> I don't know <unk> And I say <unk>
Well, we find that it takes every one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> you in a <unk> <unk>
Now, this <unk> is going to bring a <unk> to the <unk>  but it's much more interesting than the <unk> <unk>
Now,   <unk> the problem is that even <unk> from us to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  see it as a <unk> and <unk> <unk>  but it kind of <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk>  as the world, which is our <unk> is <unk>
The <unk> is that the <unk> century, over 300 years old.  -- it's not going to be your mind for <unk>  or <unk> <unk> but rather as a <unk> where we <unk> and we <unk> <unk> <unk> or we <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> from the planet.
All the <unk> of all the <unk>  have been <unk> <unk> in a <unk>  with the <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
And the problem is not the technology itself.
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk>  -- more than they have <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk>
It's not changing or <unk> <unk> <unk> It's <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> you through the world,  discover that these are not <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are <unk> people who are <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that are over their <unk> <unk>
I think it's <unk> <unk>  in the country of <unk> <unk> <unk> --  a <unk> <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk> --  -- a <unk> <unk> who lived <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --  -- and now all being <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk>  where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that seems out of <unk> <unk> <unk>
where the <unk> <unk> are <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Or in the case of <unk> <unk>  are the <unk> that came from the <unk>  in <unk> <unk> <unk>
Or if you go to the <unk> <unk>  where I make a lot of research in the last <unk>  you'll see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> the physical <unk> of a <unk>  is <unk> <unk> but <unk>  <unk> <unk> of life of a <unk> not only is <unk> but it's <unk> <unk> -- in many areas --  -- as part of the <unk>
And you can't understand the <unk> <unk>  until you <unk> through it at the <unk>
I <unk> once the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> to the <unk>  with a <unk> <unk> and only when I got to the <unk>  I understood what was behind the <unk>  that I <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk>
<unk> million people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> of this young <unk> was <unk> <unk>
So this <unk> <unk> <unk>  when <unk> <unk> <unk>
His <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>
His mother was <unk> to be <unk>
He was <unk> on the <unk> in the <unk> at the age of <unk>  to <unk> under the <unk> <unk>  because she couldn't be without <unk>
<unk> who actually did that <unk> --  was <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
One day she <unk> out of the <unk> on a <unk>  with <unk> and for this <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> can be impossible to <unk>  but the <unk> <unk> of people is something to <unk>
And finally, in fact, everything is <unk> to a <unk>
We want to live in a <unk> world of <unk> or we want to <unk> a <unk> world of <unk>
The <unk> <unk> <unk> said before he <unk> <unk>  that <unk> her <unk> was that the biggest was that as I <unk> to <unk> and the <unk> on the world --  <unk> not only we're going to see the entire <unk> of the <unk>  but we're going to <unk> from the <unk> one day of the <unk>  <unk> that were other <unk> and <unk>
And it's <unk> to make sure that our <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> -- who gave us the <unk>  moment where we have <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --  -- there was a <unk> of <unk> <unk> --  -- it was the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> as we know --  it's only 300 years.
Now, this history <unk> I don't <unk>  that we would have all <unk> to all the <unk>  that we will <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
So when this <unk> <unk> of the world are <unk> about <unk> <unk>  They <unk> with <unk> different <unk>
And in that <unk> we're going to <unk> all of us to be what we <unk> a species completely <unk>  <unk> completely <unk> <unk> that all the people and all the <unk>  -- I find a way to <unk> And there are <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>
This is a picture that I made at the top of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  when I was at the <unk> <unk> with some people in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and this <unk> <unk> told me the story of his <unk>
The <unk> <unk> has not always been so <unk>  with <unk> <unk> and in the <unk>  to <unk> our <unk> we <unk> it in <unk>
The <unk> of this man <unk> to <unk>
<unk> <unk> for his life took all the <unk>  and all the <unk>
Now, we have to <unk> that <unk> is not <unk> by <unk>  They use <unk> in their <unk>
The <unk> of their <unk> were made from <unk> to <unk>
So the <unk> of this man was not <unk> by the night <unk> or the <unk> <unk>
He just <unk> the <unk> <unk> down the <unk> from the <unk> <unk> and he <unk> in his <unk> And how he <unk> started to <unk>  And how the <unk> started to <unk> and he kind of a <unk>
He <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and when he finally <unk> the <unk> he <unk> a <unk> with him.
He <unk> the <unk> and he <unk> a <unk>  took the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> a <unk>  <unk> a <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> and it <unk> over the <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> to <unk>
And then we're going to get out of anything.   And that, in many <unk>   is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  and all of the <unk> <unk> around the world.
In <unk> <unk> the government <unk> <unk>  gave back to the <unk> <unk> of a large <unk> than <unk> and <unk> together.
It's our new <unk> It's called <unk>
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> an amazing example how a state of a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And finally, at the <unk> I think it's obvious to us that we have <unk> --  in these <unk> places of the <unk>  So we realize that they are not <unk> at all.
They are <unk>
They <unk> the <unk> of human <unk> --  that come from the <unk> <unk> And for us the <unk> of these kids, like the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So what we've been trying to <unk> the end of the <unk> <unk>  is, we believe that <unk> are not going to do something.
We believe that <unk> --  --  — we believe that <unk> are not <unk> but we think that <unk> can change the world, and so we are probably <unk> out of the world that we <unk> <unk>
We have <unk> million <unk> on our <unk> <unk> every <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk>
Our <unk> are <unk> million people.
And what we're doing is a series of <unk>  in <unk> where we're going to take our <unk>  in places where we are going to get our <unk>  that they can't be <unk> by what they have <unk> and <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world are going to be in a <unk>  that we can <unk>
where all the <unk> of all <unk>  maybe <unk> to our <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk to you about some things from a book that I hope that will <unk> with other things that you have heard about <unk> and try to make me some <unk> in the case that I <unk>
I want to start with what I call <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> of all <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this <unk> <unk> sounds a little bit <unk>  if we are <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The reason for this is that <unk> is so <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk>
And because if people are <unk>  then each of us can <unk> <unk> and do things that are going to <unk> our <unk>  and no one need to <unk> in our <unk>
<unk> to <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk>
The more <unk> the more people have a lot of <unk> and the more <unk> they have a <unk>
<unk> I think, is that it's so well <unk> in our system --  that it doesn't <unk> the <unk> through the head to the <unk>
And it's our <unk> <unk> in our lives.
I'm going to show you a couple of examples of what <unk> did <unk> for us from the last <unk>
This is a <unk> It's not a very <unk>
I want to just say two words about <unk>
<unk> <unk> for <unk> in my <unk>  That if you don't <unk> and the 10 different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can <unk> your <unk>  <unk> you can make your own <unk> in a very <unk> <unk>  where no one of the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> don't <unk>
So this is the <unk>
And then you look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> a <unk> system --  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And in this <unk> <unk> <unk>  There's a lot of <unk> <unk>
We can <unk> six million and a half million <unk> <unk> <unk>  of the <unk> that are in the <unk> of a single <unk>
We have to <unk> that means a lot of <unk>
In other <unk> -- in the <unk> world.
There was a <unk> when I was a <unk>  where you could <unk> any kind of <unk> <unk> <unk>  as long as it was <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> Don't <unk> it.
<unk> one of the <unk> in the fact was that the cell never <unk>
And those days are <unk> <unk>
Now, we have a <unk> almost <unk> <unk> <unk>  especially in the <unk> world.
These are <unk> <unk>
My <unk> is the <unk> <unk> --  with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> for made <unk> <unk>
And if the <unk> you didn't see in the <unk>  You can stay <unk> because you have a <unk>
And the result of it is <unk> people to go into the <unk> and put this <unk>
And you know what's the <unk> <unk>
<unk> is <unk>  It's not possible to <unk> a cell that doesn't know very <unk>
And in other <unk> of the life that are much more important than the <unk> -- there is this <unk> growth of <unk>
The <unk> <unk> -- in the United States is not the case that you think about <unk> and it tells you what to <unk>
<unk> you look at the <unk> and this is telling you, <unk> we have <unk> and <unk> <unk>
It has these <unk> and these <unk>
<unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> What do you want to <unk>
And you <unk> <unk> what to <unk>  And the <unk> says, <unk> He has these <unk> and these <unk> and the <unk> <unk> this and the <unk> <unk>
What do you want to <unk>
And you say <unk> if you were in my <unk> <unk> <unk>  And the <unk> says, <unk> I'm not the <unk>  And the result is -- we call it <unk> <unk>  And the result is it that makes it <unk>
But what is actually <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> and <unk>  <unk> from someone who knows something --  -- in this case, <unk> --  someone who knows nothing and it's almost <unk>  And so not the best form of <unk> to make decisions --  and so not the best form to make decisions --  -- in this <unk>
There is a <unk> level of <unk> <unk> with <unk>  <unk> people like me and like you <unk>  <unk> what if you <unk> a <unk> has no <unk>  because we can't <unk> them.
Why are we <unk> our <unk> if we can't <unk> them.
The <unk> is that the people who do it <unk> so that we can <unk> our <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> them to change our <unk>
<unk> so important that our <unk> <unk> has become a <unk> <unk> <unk> and this <unk> is the role to show that.
<unk> we don't <unk> a <unk> but we have the ability to <unk> it.
And that we can <unk> our <unk> we often have <unk>
And that means that every day when you <unk>  You have to <unk> what kind of person you want to <unk>
With the whole <unk> for <unk> and family -- there was a <unk> where the <unk> <unk> almost anyone who was that you had to think about how <unk>  and then you start to have kids as <unk>
The <unk> <unk> was with <unk>  not when that <unk> and not what you're going to do after the <unk>
<unk> all of us is very <unk>
<unk> of <unk> incredibly <unk> and I give them to 20 percent more than I <unk>
And this is not because it would be less <unk> and not because it would be less <unk>
<unk> because I am <unk> with all kinds of <unk>  <unk> I should be <unk> or <unk> <unk> I should make it <unk>
And I should ask me more <unk> <unk> I should first kids, or a <unk>  All of these are the questions that are <unk>
And they will respond to these <unk>  <unk> if that means to <unk> make all the <unk> that I <unk> and don't take a good <unk> to my <unk>
And that also has to do that. They have to do <unk>
<unk> -- we are <unk> as we <unk> and <unk>  with the technology that allows us to <unk> to <unk> every <unk> of <unk> days from <unk> <unk>
<unk> there is a <unk> in a <unk>  that we've never <unk> the way that the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Let me tell you about it because I want to use it.
So what that means is that this <unk> <unk> to <unk> is that we have to do with <unk> is that we need to take a <unk>  <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>  And <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>  And <unk> if we should be <unk>
We can go to see how we <unk> our <unk> <unk> and we have <unk> in a <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and we probably <unk> on the <unk>
And even though all of them are <unk>  every <unk> in which we look at the <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>  We <unk> we need to <unk> this <unk>
And I should look at this <unk> <unk> I should write the <unk> of this <unk>  And even if the answer answer to the question is the <unk> <unk> of your <unk>  And I should be very different than that.
So <unk> we <unk>  things things that are <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> things that <unk> <unk> <unk>  life is a <unk> of <unk>
And the world that <unk> looked like this.
So to <unk> like this, I had some <unk> <unk> <unk>  but it wasn't all of a <unk>
And the world that we live now looks like this.
And the question is, is <unk> or <unk>
And the answer is <unk>
We all know the right right about it,  so I'm going to talk about what's <unk>
All of these <unk> have two <unk>  <unk> <unk> on people's <unk>
One of the <unk> <unk> is that <unk> rather than <unk>
So so many <unk> that I can <unk> people to be very difficult to <unk> for something.
<unk> a very <unk> example of <unk>  a study of <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>
A <unk> <unk> my <unk> had access to data <unk> from <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  that has almost a million <unk> and almost a <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> found out is that  for every 10 <unk> <unk> that we <unk> <unk>  the rate of <unk> <unk> with two <unk>
<unk> 50 <unk> <unk> -- they <unk> 10 percent more <unk> than you have only 10 percent more than you have only 10 percent <unk> Why?
Because with 50 percent of you who <unk> to <unk>  is the <unk> hard to think about what you're trying to <unk>  So you <unk> it <unk>
And then on the <unk> and then on the <unk> and then on the <unk> and the <unk> all over the <unk>  and <unk> that this <unk> never <unk>
I think that it doesn't just mean that those people are going to <unk> food for <unk> after they get to the <unk>  because they have no money to ask the <unk>  that means that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> that you give the <unk> <unk>
<unk> they give up to the <unk> to <unk> dollars a year from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So <unk> is a <unk> when you have too many <unk>
And I think that makes the world look like this.
You really want to take the good <unk> if it's for all <unk> right?
You don't want to <unk> <unk> <unk> or even <unk> for <unk> <unk>
So this is a <unk> <unk> the second is that and if you want to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and make a <unk>  <unk> we're going to be if we were <unk> if we were more <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>
And there are a few reasons for that.
One of them is that we have a lot of <unk> for the <unk> of which is to <unk> if you <unk> one and it's not the perfect -- and the <unk> which is <unk> for <unk> <unk>
It is easy to imagine that you could have been a different <unk>  that would have been better. And what happens is that <unk> is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> your <unk> <unk> <unk> that you have <unk>  And these <unk> <unk> of the <unk> that you <unk> from the <unk> that you <unk> from the <unk> that you <unk> from the <unk> that you <unk> from the <unk> that you have been a good <unk>
The more you have the more <unk> you have to <unk> something that is <unk> about the <unk> that you <unk>
<unk> what <unk> call <unk> call <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> has <unk> very clear in this <unk>  talking about how we <unk> things --  -- that <unk> <unk> on what they <unk>
Well, when I am a <unk> of <unk> <unk> to take <unk>  it's easy to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> that you <unk>  And that makes you less than the <unk> that you <unk>
So here's an example of the <unk> <unk> who are not New <unk>
But here's how we should we <unk>
We have this <unk> in <unk>
A very <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> A day <unk> They <unk>
What would you want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
All of my <unk> <unk> are <unk>
I could <unk> right in front of the <unk>  And that <unk> two weeks of the idea that the day of the day of having a great <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that we have from the <unk>  even though what <unk> is <unk>
And the more <unk> there are <unk> by <unk> to <unk>  the more <unk> <unk> of these <unk>  <unk> will be <unk> by us as <unk> <unk>
Here's another example.
This <unk> tells a lot of things.
It tells us that we should be living <unk> and probably we should make things more <unk>
But one of the <unk> that it tells is that <unk> <unk> <unk> something  <unk> not to do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of <unk> <unk>  and that is going to do what you do less <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This <unk> me when I wanted to <unk> my <unk>
<unk> <unk> almost all the time.
And there was a <unk> where the <unk> was a single way that <unk> were <unk> <unk> on you as a <unk> and they were incredibly <unk> and they were incredibly <unk>  and if you <unk> them for a long time and <unk> them <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So I went back to my <unk> after I <unk> my <unk> <unk> and I said, <unk> I want a <unk> <unk> this is <unk>  And the <unk> said, <unk> I want to be <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> with <unk> or <unk> you want to <unk> them or <unk> in the <unk>
You want to be <unk>
You want them to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> And you don't <unk>
I <unk> and my face after I thought, <unk>  <unk> to be the kind of <unk> who were the only <unk>   <unk> no <unk> <unk> <unk>   So I spent no idea <unk> <unk> <unk>  And I went out of my <unk> -- the <unk> <unk> the truth -- the <unk> the truth -- the truth -- the <unk> that I <unk>
We <unk> all of these <unk> have made it possible to make better <unk>
But I'm <unk>
Why? I wrote a book where I tried to <unk> that.
The reason that I felt <unk> is --  that I had all of these <unk>  My <unk> about how it should be a <unk> <unk> <unk>
I had very <unk> I didn't have a <unk> <unk> when I was one <unk>
Now when there are 100 <unk> his mother has to be <unk>
And what we <unk> was <unk> but not <unk>
So I <unk> what I <unk> with what I <unk> and the result is that I was <unk> in <unk> with what I <unk>
<unk> <unk> in the lives of people --  cannot do anything else to grow the <unk> that people have a <unk> about how well it has to be those <unk>
And so <unk> this is going to get <unk> <unk>  even though it <unk> good <unk>
<unk> the world doesn't know that.
Because if they <unk> I'll be <unk> I will have this idea of what I'm talking about.
<unk> is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was better when everything was <unk>  is that when everything was <unk>  -- it was actually possible for people to <unk> the <unk>
<unk> in the world that we live -- new <unk> <unk> and <unk>  that <unk> <unk> -- the best thing you can <unk> is that things are going to be as good as you <unk> to <unk>
You're never going to be <unk> <unk>  because your <unk> and my <unk> is <unk> to the <unk>
<unk> <unk> -- for that you all came --  <unk> <unk> is to have <unk> <unk>
I want to say -- just a short moment --  -- that we actually have a <unk> and it's really <unk>
I could have been able to find a better <unk> I never <unk>
But let's think about your home is not necessarily so <unk>
In <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> which is <unk>  when you can <unk> one kind of <unk>  is like when you don't get the <unk> and you <unk> why <unk> <unk> is <unk>
The world is <unk> I could have been able to <unk>
When there are hundreds of different <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> one that <unk> you <unk>  and <unk> one that <unk> you <unk> <unk>
It's as clear that the answer answer to the question of <unk>
You could have been able to get better.
<unk> a hundred different kinds of <unk> at the <unk>  You have no <unk> for <unk>
So when people get the <unk>  even though the results <unk> are <unk>  <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> in the <unk> world within the <unk> <unk>
I think a very important <unk> -- not <unk> but important to this <unk> of <unk> and also <unk>  is that people have <unk> who are <unk> and they have <unk> who are <unk> to be <unk> and because their <unk> are too <unk>
And when you have to <unk> these <unk>  I think they are <unk>
So the <unk> <unk> is that a better <unk> <unk> <unk>  and it <unk> us <unk>
So let me <unk> you.
This is the <unk> <unk> that we all <unk> a <unk> <unk> and it's not <unk>
<unk> <unk> that you have a couple of <unk> is better than <unk>  But here you don't know that many <unk> are better than <unk>
There's a <unk> <unk> I don't know that <unk>
But I am pretty sure that we have been so much from that point where we <unk> our <unk> of life.
Now, the idea -- we've just <unk> --  -- the idea of <unk> the thing to <unk> you is this.
Which allows all of these <unk> in <unk> <unk> is the <unk> <unk>
There's a lot of places in the world and we've heard about a few of them to be where they don't have a lot of <unk>
The problem is they have too <unk>
So what I'm talking about is a <unk> problem.  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And what is <unk> and <unk> is <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> talked about how  <unk> these <unk> for <unk> children and hard to <unk> They are <unk> <unk>
What I tell you is that these <unk> <unk> and <unk>  not just <unk>
They actually <unk> <unk>
They actually make us feel <unk>
If some of what it allows in our <unk> to make all the <unk> that we do --  would be <unk> in the <unk> where people have too <unk> <unk>  but our lives would be <unk>  but our lives would <unk>
This is what <unk> call <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is going to make us better all -- not just <unk> people --  because of the <unk> where this <unk> <unk>
In <unk> they thought I was <unk> this <unk> and being a <unk> <unk> <unk> you're going to say  <unk> What does the <unk> <unk>
I think nothing is possible in this <unk>  <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> of the world --  -- so I <unk> and my first <unk>
I was <unk> the more I thought about it --  the more I got to think that <unk> knows something.
Because the truth is that if you <unk> the <unk> so that everything to be <unk>  You don't have <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you <unk> the <unk> so that everything is <unk>  <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> needs a <unk>
This is almost too <unk> <unk> --  probably even for a <unk> <unk> <unk> for us.
But the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
