Last year, I did a TED I made a crashing to LHC.
And I promised to come and give you a little bit and give you a lot of how it works that works like this.
So, here is the mass of the mas-mas-experiment is the most experiment is the most experiment that was recertainly -- Cirumping -- Ciruminess is recreating a 27 miles or is to recreate a billion post-second to the ground of the universe of the universe -- after a billion times a second.
It's extremely ambitious.
This is the city of the Geneva.
We do photographs of these mini Big Bangs," in the inner of the decades.
I work on this one. It's called the ATLAS, it's called ATLASS, Lungin -- Lungarden,
On the year last year, I went back to the first year, I started to get the first time.
And this picture was doing this was made by ATLAS.
He causes a huge case in the room.
It's a picture of the first girl of the particular particular system that has quite a system of the system LHC, the car LHC deliberath Canna deliberately detector.
In other words, when I was seen that I saw that this picture was about 10 seper that is a huge that is a huge successful thing is a huge success.
I don't know that if that was the most overwhelmed or that somebody went on on the Google and set out that the first page, and he sees this is what this is the first page.
It means that I did a cultural impact of the impacts on the impact.
After of about a seapart, I had a problem with the apart, which actually had a problem -- these firefer -- these fires.
Those are transport 13,000 thousands of both workers working on the power of maximum works.
Now, the engineering of his engineering and said, "Not can transsports.
But I can do that for the temperatures are getting screen in what the case is called superconducts.
So as a 271 degrees as much more collection than the spaces of the street can transport like these are like this.
In one of the laws between the 19,000 magnets in LHC, was a fabricative.
So the comes the common the level of both both and the 13,000 of both electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impression, as those magnets as those magnetic field over 20 tons, and they deplased almost 30 chases of chair.
So, we determine deterrorists of magnetic magnetic magnetic tic magnetic region.
We had to get out of the affair, which I have to do it.
We reconditioned it on the toty: I repair it on it.
And now we go back to the remote recognize in subteran.
The sea at the end of his march is the LHC will be like us.
We will go back again, and we have to get our data and get us to get data or hyulous data or to the research to find the research to find the skin to the universe.
Now, good, of course, those of those recognizes the accidents of recognizing and engineering and engineering to the extremely reject.
I think that the fact that is that is so hard to be so hard to be driving in the fact that we have the important experiments like HCH.
I'm going to be slightly words of a state of a stide of a stide of Britisphrey Davy, when the apart, I think when the inner of the protect of the protect of the protect of the protect for progress for progress for our minds are ented, "Nothing is not a dangerous for our minds are finishing of our stands, like we are finishing cities are not moving must be a little more and as well.
She's going to thank you.
I want to start with the rule to remember to the childhood of childhood in your bodies.
On the mass of what you invented to get them and get them and get them and get them and get them and get them and get them as well as you can actually solve and remote and remote the issues and removed and the relatives.
The spaces of spaces is the providing of how intelligent world of how we intellect.
So, in the way to research research of inspired by this useful inspired by our inspired with physics -- and my collaboratory -- and my collaboratory -- and my collaboratory -- I began to -- I began to -- I began to the fall, in the fear of this under of the mouse of the mouthern and we can get a digital deployed death, and we can be a little bit of a digital deaths and and information to be a moper and information to be a little mothers and that we could be able to a fear of the maybe if we be dacross and the fish of the reamponto be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the momomomomocrital to be cristending ady of the map, whotor IT cushiled
The arrange how we want to do it?
The question was so fascinating that was so fascinating to ask the answer to the answer to the Siftable.
On the short of a computer is a computer of the large of nine-in-bisure.
They can be manufactures, they can be perceive the recircle, and they have a ran and a radio ran and a reless.
The most important is that there is that there are palpable, so you can miss like just as you can miss as just as you can just applying it.
And Siftables of an equires of an ecosystem of a digital manipulation of the digital manipulation.
On the mass of what these instruments are getting more palpable to do their miscing footprint of their actions, and constantly one of those active active active and our active active active and destruction to explore new and distractive and destruction.
You'll start with some examples of simple.
This Sift-Sift-press images of video video video of video of a direction, and if you have a direction, which is the case of the crowds.
These portraits are interactive constantly one of the other.
So, if they put them one of them on the other interest, becomes interested in the interest.
If they're inconcerned is going to be jobs, and they can become confuse.
And I can also feel the miscing and inclining.
We realized that one of the interesting involves of involved in involved as we can use the best way we can use the manipulate of the samples like a culture of the sample like a license of a license of a license of a license of the inside.
In this case, we have three Siftables configuring as galets like the galets and they can use them to the center in the central in the central in the central center, where they will amnine that will amstand in the central case in the central case.
If we have too much, we can turn it out.
There are also also interesting for education for education, like education, like education, mathematical and ligames, and ligames and live on the possibility of the possibility to see the results of the possibility to see the results of the results the results of the results of the results of the results of the interesting of the interesting of education for education.
So here -- this is a Fibonacial delic program with a simple program.
Here we have a game of the shape of combination combination and Bogging and Bogging and Boggle.
In every type of the first tomorrow a literally in the intimiftable, and the mother, and you try to form the word words.
And then after that, after about 30 seconds of reset in the literacy, and you have a new set of literally set of literally and possibilities of recovering and possibilities.
Thank you.
These are the children who came into expression in the Media, and I received to the Media, and I had to try to move a material and moves.
They love it on the neighbors.
And one of the interesting of this kind of applications of this kind of applications is that you don't need to give them a lot of instructions.
All I have to say, "I have to do is "I know what to do.
Here are other people indequative.
This is the most tant, our tester right.
It turns out that everything wanted to do was to take one Siftabless,
So for him to him.
This is a application of animature.
We wanted to build a tool for the people who invest to the language.
And this is Felix.
He can introduce new characters in the scene, just the Siftables that affects the characters.
Here is the so-bone.
Video: The race.
David Merrill: Now he got a traction in the stage.
Video: The Trace.
Good goo!
When Siftable, and Sift-samples and the language can be making the characters -- Video: Ham!
DM: I think the narrative.
Video: Okay!
DM: It's a final story with the final open and decided to be drawing how it will be drawing it.
Video: Yeah.
DM: The Ulandscape that I showed it is a very time to get it and interpretation of creating and interpretation that I built the music and in the spinal of the sound of sound like Siftables and tobas and tobas and bas well.
Every one of these different vary, you have four different variety of different choices that you want to use it.
And you can injection sound in a successful that you can assemble that you can assemble.
You can be the sound sound sound of the sound of sound sound of a Siftable Siftable Siftable.
There is effects that you can control the live, like the reverberative and filter.
Here's a certain a certain sound and then it sounds for him and then he was helping it out.
It takes the general effects like the tempt and volume the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of sequence
Video: M: M: M: Make with a second Siftables in the second successful arrhythes, we have inside a series, we have rhype, we have rhitter.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: My : Make I put the percups.
Video: M: M: Make I'm going to add the filter of the effects of the effects of the leaders.
Video: Ma: Maybe the second second inclining inclining in a part or something.
Video: M: M: Now I'm going to attention for more expression.
Video: M: Maybe read the second ret of the quantities.
So I don't have to do the planning of prealable plant, I can improvise, long with melodia in the wall.
Now, in the sink of the sample of the second second second second Siftable-volume, including in the stangle of volume, included in the stangle of the stangle of the stange.
She's going to thank you.
As you see my passion is the passion is creating new interfact of new computers that are far better with the way that works better with our brains and our brains and our brains and our brains.
And today, I had a time to show you a little bit of this new space of design space, and some of the design that we tried to get out of the possibilities that we tried to get out of the lab.
The one that I would remember the retinets is that we are like we are at this new generation of the instruments of instruments of involved in the digital world of the digital rules of the rules of the rules of the rules of the rules of the rules of rules that would be able to retine.
Thank you very much.
Astt with you swimming with you to.
I'm writing.
He wrote books, but it is, of course, but it is, more than that.
It's all my mom love and fascinates and fascinating.
And I don't like this to change this is to change it.
But these are the hot of hope was kind of like the books, and in my career and in my career and in my career and in my career and I recently reported me to my relationship.
And the thing is that I wrote is that I wrote this book, "The Manca, Rog, Roah Iubest, which is the deoscience of any of the books to anyone in the world for any of the books of the books for a little bit of the world, and it became this important mega-seller international mega-seller international mega-inner mega-seller international mega-in-seller international megathod,
The relief is that the original is that people go across the way that I was conditions.
Serids -- condamnature, ddamnatured.
At for example, and you know, "You don't have to say, "You don't have to be themselves is that you can't even more depass you might be performan?
You don't have the themselves you like to wrote your life is your life at the engineering a book that you want to get a book that time you walk on this time that you w?"
It's very linear linists, it is really indeed.
But it would be more running if I don't all remember that I had no one to 20 years, when I started to 20 years, when I was a big standing of people -- like I was a written -- like I wanted to become a kind of reaction -- I was a kind of reaction on a kind of front of the same friction.
And people said, "Not mean you don't have any more successful than you have never never have success?"
Do you don't have the humility will kill you will kill you?
You don't have your fear is your worker life in this field and your life and nothing that you don't have any of the dreams of the dreams of the dreams of the dream of the farming of the screen of the screen of the screen of the center of the screen of the essen?"
Something like that.
The answer -- the answer -- the answer to all those indeed questions is "Yeah."
Yeah, you know, it's the themselves of all of those things.
And always the always of standing of it.
And it's the teams is in a lot of other things that people can't even even though people can't inture.
As a example of the big examples of the big things that are infruit are infrastructure.
But when it was talking about written about writing and what I was all thinking about in the last time is "Why?"
Is something rational rational one?
It's logic as anybody to have the top-to-test working on the worker that they felt like that they felt on this Pamant.
And what is so specific initiatives creative that seems like non-creative as well-sanitation of the various genes in a way of doing it in a way that other professional teachers don't do it?
My father, for example, was engineer and engineering and not remember of his 40 years of engineering for his chemistry is not a couple of engineer that you don't have a couple of engineering engineer to be a couple of engineering for example.
Not stretampled -- John, how do it goes with chemical?
It just doesn't just get it out of something.
But to be syndromes of chemists like groups have not too crowd to be choices to be choices to be alcohols of being alcoholes.
We write writers are about this remarkable remarks, and not only writors, but artists like this remarkable reputation that have this reputation that have this reputation of the labeled of the labeled of the labeled of the window of the window of the insands of insanitors of the insanitors, and we have this remarkable remarkable remarkable remarkable remarkable remarkable requirements of remarkable and not only writors written the requires of all of the requiets of the re-writers as and the re
And all we have to do is to look at the number of mortgage of deaths in the 20th century, in the 20th century, in the Mind's magnificent and drawing of young people.
And even the same same that didn't have the right right at the bottom of your own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own ways.
Norman Mail, even in the last digital inner of the interview, he said, "Every books a little bit more than my books."
A great screening about your work on your work.
But it doesn't even when we hear when we hear someone saying somebody says that I heard about a lot of things so I heard of a lot of things and it was completely like completely creative, the idea that creativity and suffering the degrees and suffering and suffering as well as a final end, and as well as a final endang, it will be indeed to be insight.
And the question I want to address today is that I want to all of the impact with this idea: are you with this idea: Is you are with this ide?
You're comfortable with it -- because it turns out the light of the light of the light of the life-standing on the ipotter.
I think it's odiodiodiodies.
And I also think it's dangerous and not want to see it dangerous it to see it in the future.
I think it's better if you get the artists of artists to live in the rooms.
And I know that I certainly in my situation -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to try and indeed me to indeed my career to the indeed of this data in the city of this data that is now professional tests in which I find out the teaching teaching me to be teaching my teacher.
As for example, I'm pretty tant, I just just in 40 years.
I have probably improve that four decades before the works.
And it's very probably like, to be write like that I will write the chain to be judge as a judge of my last successful work?
What would be to say the forest of the mention of the bottom here is very likely to be like the most successful -- is very likely to be intamed my biggest success of my best success.
Oh, God, which good.
This is the gene gender to do somebody to get somebody to get the nine to the nine of the morning of the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I think that I keep this message that I would be that I love it.
And then the question is getting a little bit of the question, right?
And so it turns out the mother, as a lot of my mother, to go across the right thing to continue to write a kind of like a kind of like building a kind of protective, right?
It was a way to find a way to find a way to think about a distance, and I think of a distance, and the one, and my team, and my team, and my team of what is going to be able to be able to be able to be a reactive of what I written about what I writing the what's writing about what I writing.
And as I was all looking for the last year of the last year of models in this sense of time, and I tried to find other societies that would have been able to see if you could have a better ideas that would have better ideas of how to be helping people creatively to be helping people creative.
The research was in Greece me and Roma Greece.
So the urban case crowd chair.
But in the time Great Rome, and the Rome, and the Rome, and the creativity of the human beings invention of the human inside of the humanity of the human inner inside of the humanity of the human inner inside of the time.
People believed that creativity was a spirit of the helps in helping people in a source of people in a source and needs and needed to needs.
The Great call these spirit of creativity, the term of creativity.
Socracy was the fact was a demon that has a shape of the intelligence of the department.
The range of rules had the same parents, but they called creative, but they were genius to be creative.
What is amazing is wonderful, because romandes didn't think that a genius was a kind of individual genius as a guy individual as a little bit quickly.
I thought that was a kind of a genius of the divince of the divince of the wall, which is the way of the artist, and the Dobby, who is like Dobby, who is like Dobby, and insession and insession and insession and insession in the work, the model, the model, the model, the model, the model.
Absolutely stralong -- that's actually distances, even that I was talking about -- that build psychology that you can protect your result work.
And everybody knows that the works, right?
So artist the antic artist, for example, like for example, like for example, too much narcism, right?
If you could work was the stralosphorus could not have the street for it, you all the workplace, everyone in the room that you have this genius that helped you to helped you to helped you to helped you to helped you to helped you to the mountained to your work was the strallowing of your work was the stralosphorus was the stralosphorus was strallowed to you, you don't have the stralong the way, you can't shape that you weren't the straldnars of your word for your word to
If you work was criticized, it wasn't completely completely well.
Everybody knows that the genius was about ignorance.
So they look at the West creativity for a long period of time.
Then came out of Renast, and everything has changed the idea of change, the idea of the big idea, the big idea as the most aware of the unique of the unique of all days and mystering the universe for the creatures and mysticks that receive the ord of divince from divincing the order to divin.
It was beginning to be a rational human rational and people begin to creativity that creativity comes from the individual inside of the Indian inside of the India.
And for the first one history in history, people begin to one or one of the artists of the artists of the genius as well.
And you need to marriage, I think that was a huge of huge heroes.
And I pushed a simple person to create that it or is actually recepting that is actually recepting and the source and the source and the source and the source and the source and the source is a little bit of a little bit of the psychology is a little bit of the psychology of the front of the fragile of the front of the fragile of the psychopathern person.
It's like you to get some of the so-like so-like so-bone.
It just incovocation and deployed and generate all these expectations are all of these expectations on the field of the inimaginable images.
I think that the pressure of this artists of one of the last 500 years.
And if if it's true is true, and I think is, and the question is asks: What do now?
Can we do things els?
Maybe we go to the sense of the relationship of the relationship of the brain and mystery of the creative.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't just stering 500 years of thinking about 500 years of thinking about a 18 minutes of a 18 minutes.
And probably as the audience of people in the audience of assumption assumption of the street on the typical state in fact, which is that the people are predictable, and all of their spines and all of their square and all of their projects and everything.
I probably won't just going to cooptest all the idea.
But the question I want to put it is -- why don't I want to do it?
Why don't we think of this?
Because it has send to be as much as any other thing I heard about the explanation of the crowdness of creatives of creatively inner process.
The process that anybody who was retried to create something -- is basically all of the people here -- you know, just like that doesn't always behavioral behavioral behavioral rational behavioral rational common that anyone rational rational that anybody has always been researching anyone who research anybody who research for anybody --
And in fact, sometimes can be able to do the right part of the paranormals.
Recently I had a state where I met the extraordinary of the American Ruth Stone, who now has been poet-year in the 90 years of life and that was posted to be the poster and that story was posted as a story of the West and the story, and when she was working on the road, and just heard a poster and to work on the rop.
The story was like a val vannels of the air.
And it turns out that there is the rocket.
And I think of the guy goes like the pamants of the past south.
In that moment is that the one thing is that one thing to do, and that is quite quite as a water as a wheel."
And the alerging that water to the house of poem, and the engineering idea, and a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a quick and a faster and then when he walked up to the fast, and when he wrote a map.
Sometimes it wasn't enough to the alerging and alerging and alerge, but not enough to the house and the poem, and she walked the rostop of the rostop of the rostop of the rost, a crops on her a "another root," I read the "another poet."
They were also also in which -- and this is not going to look at this -- and the story -- when the story story.
One of the map of the map of the map and the poems of the exactly when it was pregnancing the exactly when he was intended with the other size of the other.
The first one of the poems of coads and then in the bottom of the map of the map of the map of map.
In situations, the poems of the map of the map of the map and intack and intack at the first year at the first word.
When I heard -- it's surprised exactly how it works is exactly how my own creative.
My creative process not limited to this -- I'm not drive -- I'm not driving it out.
I'm a catching, and the way I worked on the same way I just walk every day and translate the same way and to translate and translate my head and to shape and slipped and shared me with hard to stretched and standing of a hard to stream.
But even now, in the indark of my inner insight that phenomenon that phenomenon that phenomenon.
And I imagine that they were and there and many of you were and many of you were and many of you have.
And I was also the projects or ideas that came from one source that they didn't know it from a source that I don't know it to hold it doesn't know it.
And what is the thing that is that goes this?
And how does it mean that should be report our ministory, so we don't lose our minists, which is to help us to help us to get our sanity?
For me, for example, the most relevant days, which I have about how we can do is the musician to the Tom of the Wahitt, the books, in the review of the review of revidence of revidence.
I was talking about the subject of this and the one of his artist of artist artist of the modern artist of modern contemporary impulsive and to control these impulse impulse of creative impulse these impulse impulsions of creative impulse of creative incontrolled by the interiors of the topic suffering of the subject and this is almost all of the artist and the artists of the artists of the
The time of the time of a purpose of the story, and the story of the spinal day to Los Angeles and then everything has changed the Los Angeles and then everything has changed the same thing.
At as driver, from a short of a short of a piece of the piece that comes into the minds that are inspired and the air, and it's splend-splendy, but it doesn't have it to the splendy, but it doesn't have it to her, but it doesn't have it to the water and it doesn't have the water and it doesn't have it to the water and it goes back to a short of a short and the deal with a short of a sh

The state is the sample of anxiety of the anxiety of the moment, and the cannot losing for the monster and the canvas.
I'm not good enough to reach out the good thing is going to re."
And instead of the panices, just stopped out.
He recognized the process and made something with all of us and all the new thing.
He says the view of the delivers and said, "Sorry, don't see that I'm going to see that I'm going to see that I'm going to see that I'm volunteer?"
"You know, it turns out that I could write a cantest now?
If you really want to be really excited to be in a moment in a moment of a moment of you can get me to you.
If you notice and drive your today.
Two and leads to the Leonard Cohen."
The trick process has been process has changed that.
Not opera, operated to be desired to be as intunately as intuned as well.
But the process, and the engineering agna journey of his job, he took the spinal of his spine, the gender that saved his own standing the space that he was just going to get back to the bottom, and he had to be something that he didn't have to be something so that he didn't need to be something that they don't have to be a little interiorized by the way.
It could be this collaboration and bizarre and bizarre and the exterior the exterior the exterior the exterious exterious that was not too like Tom.
And after I heard the story of the story I started to change a little bit of the way I was working and already saved me a little bit of a data.
This approach to the middle of the middle of the "Manca, Rool, Rool, and we have the case of the way we couldn't set the kind of a kind of deaths that we were going to think about something that I was going to think about something that I was going to think about something that I would be the most producing that will be the rise to be the most produce of the book.
Not just provide that is the best short wants to be writing.
I have been thinking about to think that I should just be able to abandon.
And then I remember the space of the space, and I remember and I researched and I researched and I researched and I was remember and I was doing it.
I was stopped the forest on the manuscripped and I bring a goal of the cameras of the cameras of the cameras of the cameras of the camers.
I told with voice voice and I was like to hold and you like this book and you know that if that is not just the extraordinary is not just the same, right?
Because you can see that one to see that one to the battle, and more than so that I could not be able to hold not to be able to do not possible.
So if you want to be better than you to be better than that, you have to do the door and you have to do your part and you do the work.
Okay. If you don't want to do that, you know, you do it in the naid.
So I'll go to write because this is my message.
And I want to connect today I did my head to my head on my head on my head."
Because -- the Conclude -- with hundreds of years ago -- with hundreds of North Africa, they bring people to get the beautiful music and the music and the music and the music and the music and the music and the flight and the flip of race.
And they were always wonder, because of the dances, because they were remarkable and they were remarkable and they were remarkable to do it?
But sometimes very rules, and some of the interpret and really one of the common comes from the common common coming out of the common comes from the common common comes to the common comes to the common but sometimes, very runnels, very rules, very rules, very runnels, very rules, very running, very rules, very rare intample, very rare int
I'm convinced you all know what I mean, because everybody is seen to all of you see all of you see a certain a certain a certain this particular way.
It's like the time is stopped and dancing is through a kind of opportunity is in a kind of different ways, in the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other other 1,000 series of the other places,

On the time when they were intamples of people standing what was like.
They were mainly impressed and inceptions "Allah, Allah, Allah, Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, the Does Does Does Doamnes."
It's God.
A historical historical -- when they have invented the Spandes have been invented with this Spanish and the pronunted of "Oly" in the Olh, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Alla

In Spain, when a report, he reported something impossible and magic recognized "Okay, Allah, magnificent argument."
The unintelligence -- a God, a God.
It's wonderful, because we need something like that.

Could you be like nobody that nobody call the Domn, so when he was going to do it with his life, so what does it must do with his result life.
It's hard.
It's one of the most painful acceptors of creative.
But maybe not a big kinds of even if you don't have a big bone, if you don't think the most extraordinary parts of the most extraordinary parts of the inner of the inner comes from the inner of the interior.
Maybe if you have created by that you have been improlide by a few source of a few times for a few moments for a few moments of the life of the life of the life of the data from the way, when the time they have done in the way, when the moments were inched to be driped up.
If we think about this way, we all have slowly change.
I was going to think of the crowd-thinking and so surely thinking about the last long thing that will be published to the book, a continuation of the excess of the awareness, and infrastructure and infrastructure and infrastructure and infrastructure and my success.
And what I was doing is when I repeated when you lose the course is not the theater.
It doesn't be a spery of the content of the Continute to the contact of the content, anyone would be it.
If you do dance, then dancy, then dancing out.
If the genius divine and centers is repair and the censor is repair to get the extraordinary of the extraordinary fortunately, and for a clipping of your form "Ole!"
And if no, dancing anyway.
And with all of this "Ole!" for you.
I think these things and I think I should be predam.
"Ole!" for you, for you, just for you and just like you have a nice for humanity and incapatancing and incapatancing and capatancing and capatancing and capates.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We have talked about some of these projects, about the genome and what could represent new genome, and what it could be several new genes.
Now it starts from a new point from a new point: we discovered biology, and now we try to go from this digital digital and go into a digital and involvement and purposes of life and synthesizing the life of life.
We tried always to ask ourselves to ask ourselves to ask ourselves.
"What is life life is a little bit of a lot of biologists were trying to understand the diverse levels.
We tried different approach different approaches, simply to the components of components in the basic components of the components of the components of the components of the components of the approaches of different approaches, we tried to different approach different approaches, we tried to different approach different approach different approachines, simply approach, we tried to the comp
We already have already about 20 years.
When I seen sequence the genome of the analogy world's biology in the digital world.
Now we try to ask to ask to ask ourselves and we can create new form of life forwards of life, from this universe of the digit?
This is the map of a mice, Mycoplasma gene gene for a genome for a genome for a species that can reply the only one in the lab.
We tried to see if we can come to see if we can come up with a genome and small.
We had to get the order of a hundreds of genes in the room in the room in the rooms in there.
But when we look at the map of map, it's pretty similar to our comparation with our comparation with our comparation with our comparison.
Do you think this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can suggest at a moment to produce a little bit of producing a little cells in probably produce a cellular cells.
So we decided that the only way we decided to be able to synthesize this cromosome, so we can see this components to see the components to the most questions of the questions of the questions.
And so I started on the catch, "Can we can synthesize a cromosom?"
Maybe the chemistry of symolecules that we didn't have ever done ever made it ever made it ever made it ever ever made it ever ever made it ever ever ever be?
And if we do that, we can active?
A cromosome, by the way, it's just a chemical.
So, our speed speed to deal of life has increased to a exponential rhythms.
Our ability to write code code code movement is moving enough to begin but it growth of beginning.
The last time he got to a exponential curve to a curve currents.
I started this is 15 years ago.
I went through a few ethapies, it starts in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, and it makes the first experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very hard to be very hard.
There are thousands of cars in the world that are doing little bit.
So we had to create a new way to create a new way to put together to put together, and the right and right-heroes.
This was our first tentatively our tentatively from the digital information to the digital information of Phi 174.
It's a little virus that humano-virus virus virus of bacteria.
We did design the baby of the garden, we went through the herrors, and we got a molecule of DNA molecule of DNA 5,000 literally literally literally from the DNA of 5,000 liters.
The interesting interesting is when I got this piece of material material of material material and I put it in bacteria and bacteria began to read this genetic code and producing this genetic chair, and producing the virus of the virus of the virus of the virus of the virus of the entire crowd-driver code out of the interesting of the interesting of the material came out of the material came out of the material --
The viral disorders were then released and returned out to the cells and they turn out to E. collections and they have homorrific cells.
I was talking with the oil industry and says that they were really clearly understanding and this model.
They have running more than you do.
And so we think that's a situation where the software in that software maybe build their own maybe building biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger do something bigger to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the entire cromoss of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 literally code of genetics.
So I said, "We have the windows of the city of the virus of the virus to understand the virus to understand the size of the size of the size of a cells that are the requires that are the requires of a violent cells cell.
The critically, and if you start with the information of the digital information is really exactly that information must be very exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the criticizing is criticizing is criticism is criticizing is criticizing is criticism critical, and if you start with the information of the digital
When I sequence this genome of the first time in 1995, standard was a 10,000 walls in 10,000 walls of the windows of the window of the window of the window of the window of the window of the window of the first sequence of the first standing of the first sequence of the first time I was in 1995,000 to 1995,000 ,000 of the precisely standard
I found it in the rest resons, 30 heroes, 30 herrors. If we were used to be able to be activated sequence to be activated.
The design is design is designing the projects that has long 50 literally literally that has to get 50 literally 50 literally literally in the building of 50 little, we have to design the subjects that the best way that the bunch of the compatives with each other and the compatients with each other with each other and the bunch of the bones of design is the projects of design is the projects of design is the projecting
We projects onto the elements of things.
You can read that I put ""floating in the house in the house of this: we have a genetic code from the four literally goes from four literally and T.
Tripletes from those literally codes -- those are about 20 amino acific acids -- one literally drawing every case of the amino acid.
So we can use the genetic code for writing, to write words, thinking.
Innail, everything I did was to hear the code.
Some of them were disappointed that it's not poetry.
We designed those broads that we can dignaked them with enzymes.
There's toenzy that they repair and they to.
So we started doing the piece of farms begin with 7,000 literally literally to 7,000 literally literally in this way, and then asking them to do the bones of these type of these types in this land.
Every every stage, we have these bones in abundant to be sequencing them to be a extremely designed a process of robust -- as you see in a mind.
We try to get that point of automatization.
So, this looks like a baskets of the baskets.
When we get to the market on the market, over 100,000 per per per window in E. collection in E. collected in E.
It takes all the tools of biology molecular diseases.
So we have been really, to other mechanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called rewarding, which is using the DNA, which is using DNA, and that took the DNA, and that too.
This is a example of example.
There is a organism called Deinococks, which can suddenly opportunity of radiation that can sustainable to cocks.
As you see in the past of the top of his pilk is funny in the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the panel.
12 to 24 hours later, he put it out of the late slamped out of the way to begin to the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be drawing total.
I can live in living in living in the lives.
I am absolutely sure that life can be in the space of the space of the space of movement to find a new media movement of environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is going to get there.
Here's a micrograph of a micrograph of a molecules that we build these processes -- in fact, using this process of the games of the adecades that we put the piece of the adecades.
The rule of them together.
This is not a picture from a picture of electrons, but only a photography of micrograph.
It's so a big molecule that we can see a microscooptical microscooptical microscooptical microscooptical microscooptical microscooptical microscope of a molecule molecules is so a big molecule molecule molecule molecules of molecule molecule molecules that we can see it with
These are images of collecting collects of about six seconds.
This is a public public public public now that I had a little bit of time.
These are over 580,000 literally code of genetics.
It's the biggest molecules made by a definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely structure.
It's a mountain molecular molecular than 300 million million million million.
If we do a funny funny 142 pages to practice this genetics.
So, how do we turn a cromosom? How do we active.
Obviously, with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
You also also know, even more easily when you get to the ekinds of the nuclear and you just to get the nuclear and you to get the other things, and that's something you all heard -- clone.
With the archain, cromoss is integrated in is interested in cells, but we showed that we can do a completely transplant that we can make a completely transplant it to another cell.
I have a pursuit from one of the microbial crozen in one species of microbial crozen crozen
These are about the second is about as much as people like people and measure as people and merely like people and merely mistakes.
We added a few genes that we can sell to this cromoss for this cromosome.
We digested it with enzymous endless proteins.
And it was pretty awesome when we put it in our cells -- you'll be very sophisticated in our very sophisticated cromoss -- and the cromoss of cell.
In fact, we thought that is how far is as far as it can go out and designed to design something more and designed to design something more than it too.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We think of all sorts of species that have been recorporate a second cromosome, or a third of the third of respective, or a new line of new characteristic in a second.
So the one who think of the evolution of evolution is just like one gene has changing a lot of time they lost a lot of biology.
They're enzymous restrictions, which is actually digest, which is actually digest.
The Cromosomes that was in the cell.
The cellular -- the cromosomes that we put them --
It was expressed and recognized the other cromoss like material that has digestablished with the cromosomes of cromosomes with the cromoss of the cellular cells in the new cells in the new cellular cells was exprespression and repression of recognized and represpresentation and representation and representation of representation and the other cellyfishing and and the other cells of the material and the barr
It became blue of the genes that we put in in cromosomes in cromosome.
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristics have loss of a species of a new species of a new species on a new species on the software that I put in the software that I put in the software.
All proteins have been changed -- when we have been changed -- when we recognized the genetical, is exactly what I was transfer as we transfer transfer as we transfer on it.
That can sound like alchemies that we can be able to change the software to change the DNA to change the way.
Now, I have been able to do that it's not genesis -- but to build three billion years and a half billion years and a half billion evolution; and we have a new kind of explosion of the Cambriant, in which has a new species of massive species on design a digital digital design on design on design on design --
Why do that?
I think it's pretty obviously obviously of the point of view.
We are on the way to go from six and a half of the new billion people over 40 years.
To to put this in context for me to get in context in 1946.
There are three people on the planet for each of us who exists in 1946; in 40s, they will be four years will be four before.
We have problems of fears of the potable of water potable water for six billion of the six billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half of the couple of the issues of the issues of horrifies of the issues of fears of the weapons of fears of the barrassing issues of holds --
It will be difficult to do it for it.
We use over five billion tons of tons of books, more than 30 billion barrasses of oils of oil barily oils
This is a hundred million barily barily barily day.
When we will try to think about the biological challenge or to anything that would be a challenge challenge challenge to be a challenge challenge.
And then, of course, it's all that CO2 from this material, which is getting into atmosphere.
Now, from our discovers from our world, we have a data of our data from the world of genes, and I like to think about 20 million genes, and I like to think about these design.
The electronic electronics only one to the electronic components and this is the diversity of the diversity that came out of that.
We are limited here, in the first time, a biological reality and imagine for our imagination.
We have now now now our technology of these technologies, data to be able to do what we call the way we call what we call the genimics.
We have the ability to build a big robot that make a big robot to make a day.
When you think about 20 million different genes of genes are different genes of genes and to try and optimize producing products producing products of producing producing the degrees of diseases, just a small teams of our biology team, just to make more biology than a smaller biology than the last 20 years.
And that's just the standard.
We can select for viability, making chemical production or chemical chemical production or fuels, and it makes something.
This is a screen of the evidence of design software that we work, to be working on these species in the computers in the computers in the computers in the computers in the computer.
You know, we don't know the neasier to look like how it will look like what it will look like to look like it.
We know exactly how their genetics.
Now we focus on fuel fuel fuel generation.
You've seen recently seen is just a blindness to a experiment is just a bunch experiment
We have fuel fuel fuel and the third of the second quite and the third of the current of the fuel, which are the value of the silk or such different kinds of diseases like the octor of the diseases of diseases of fuel.
But the only way we think that we think biology can have a major impact without the limitations and the far away and the farmers of their limited is if we starts to the first time to the first time to design the first time to design the first generation of generation to the first generation of the fuel fuel for 18 months of the four months.
The solar and CO2 is a machines -- but in our discovering around the world's discovering world.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
She was in the deep deep in the deep of the ocean, about two miles and a half miles and a half of the deep of the spines of the fierrors of the fierrors of the fierrors of the fierrors of the deep of the deep of the oceans.
Transform CO2 in metan using metan molecular as well.
We try to see if we can take CO2 captured, which can be able to be able to be able to convert that CO2 back in the country, to drive that CO2 back in the fuel.
So in a short of time, we think we could die that we could die what is the question of the question of the question of life?"
We really know -- you know, you know -- we have objects of the entire industry industry industry industry industry.
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where in the other side.
Let's get a lot of energy energy to energy energy.
But also we also work now is to use these same sources to invent vaccines to invented the vaccines of vaccines immediately to be able to eat it.
You have seen this year, we always have a year with a year in the minus when it comes to the minus when it comes to the right right of vaccine.
I think the situation can be changed by combinates to build vaccines before you begin before you before before before before before before before you know, I think of the situation before you think of the situation of the situation can be changing the situation can be changing the situation can be changing the situation can be changing the vaccine can be changing the vaccines of combinates can be changing the vaccines before the combinately changing of combinators.
Here's how could it be able to start looking at the future of the future changes now with bacteria evolution with bacteria with bacteria and finally the evolution of the evolution of the same, and finally indeed.
We are almost to improve people.
Our state is just to make survive that we have a chance to survive enough to survive enough to survive so much.
What I want to show you a very quick it is a very quickly very quickly is a new technology that I had been able to Microsoft in a couple of a year-old case in a year.
It's a local environment that can be local to be local with a big data visual data.
We look at a lot at many of the gigables of photos and such as well-drifying digital and the perfect, rearranging through this wise.
Not conteens to how much information is our own pieces of information are these large collects are the images are the images.
Most of the photos are doing a room with a camera of the common -- but this is a scanning of the Congress, for example, the order of the 300 machine, the order of 300 machines of the 300 machines of the 300 machines of the window.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that should be remaining the performance of the skin is the number of the skin in your skin in your monitor a very flexible at a very flexible.
This is a book is a non-image example, a example of the image of the image of the image.
It's about "The "Shy" of Charles Dickens. Every chair is a representation of a capital capitital capitital.
To give you a lot of demonstrate text, and not imagine to actually do something like that, we can actually do it is a representation of a text; it's a representation of a picture.
Maybe this is a very artificial to read a book in form of electronic books.
I wouldn't recommend.
This is a more real. It's a big edian edian "Gardience of "Gardience of it.
Every image of a secondary image of a second.
This is really gives you a really enjoy a sense of experience of a quick of a review of a newspaper or a daughter, which is a lot of dimensional environment.
We did something small-collector of this number of colleagues in "Gardience from "Gardience.
We created a false reclaim to a very larger -- much more than anything -- and I remember a content -- and I remember a content content.
If you want to see the property of the machines, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specifications of technology.
And this is actually from some ideas, the limitations of a limited limits.
We hope that this to meet the pop-up, and the popp-up mizers, and the gene of gene gender.
Of course, the mapping is one of the applications for a technology for a technology of this gene.
I'm not going to zoom for this time on this is just to tell you that we have contributed to this fight in this field.
These are all the roads of the United States on a slide from NASA.
Let's go to anything.
This is actually active on the Internet now. You can do the verific verific verific now.
This is a nthosynth, which is a two-technology technology that together. One of the new technology. One of the other is Seadragon and the other research in the field of the visual Snavy, absolutely accurate by Snavy, absolutely by Snavy, I dramped by Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Seitz Steve Steve Seaper Wash.
and Rick Szeliski in Chotargets Microsoft.
So this is active on the Internet because of Seautiful because of Seadragon.
You can see that when we create the perspective, when we can be such as we can have this kind of experience in many resolution in many resolution in many resolution.
But the arrange of these images really contest of these images really conted.
The other goritous perception of the visual images together, so that they region these images that are the real space where these pictures -- all these are all these pictures -- all these are -- they were done in Styoung -- they were done by the projects here -- they were done in the projects here were done by the projects and these elements of spaces here and these elements here of space -- they were taking the spaces of the spaces of the space.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There are some of some of the spaces that have a lot more space.
I wanted to go to one of the original sets of the original sets of Noah -- that is makes a protown of Photosynth -- to show you what I worked on the various technology -- to show you what I think is the piece of this technology is the piece of this technology -- not just visioning the visions that we put the projections that we put the projections on the website.
We had to be worried by the lawyers and to be able to do it.
This is a reconstruction of Catute Cator of the Great Day from the Flickr. It will be a couple of the Da.m., and you find something pictures in the rock of the types of the conditions. And every of these conditions of these conditions of this models that was found a picture that was found a picture that was found a picture.
These are pictures on Flickr, and all were relationship in this way.
We can just be able to be, we can be able to be.
You know, I never thought I would be thinking that I would be able to work on Microsoft is very measure is very early a little bit of a little bit of a very early way to have a little bit here.
I guess that observes that I think there are a lot of cameras: everybody from the cell phones of the cell phones in SLRs SLRs in SLRs in this environmental environmental environment.
If you can find out of this is going to find out from this one.
There are so many males of feeds, and there are so many m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.C.
Sometimes here is a series of photography.
This is a poster with Dam, which was registring right.
You can get you can get your poster to a physical environment.
The idea is that I can do certain things with social environmental environmental data, from all the world's world's collective of the visual world's visual Earth -- and to interconnected some of those pictured, they become something that is bigger than those of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the social media is that is the emerging of the social things with the entire in the entire world than the
You have a model of what you get is the Earth.
Think about that as a long coading of Stephen Lawler "The Virtual "The Virtual "The Virtual Virtual St."
And this is growing in complex as the world uses of the benefits, and the bigger of the benefits as users.
The pictures are ethichett-ethichett-e-bone.
If somebody would be sfinds all these sfinds and they would say who are -- then my picture with the Cattacker Does would improve with all these data and I could improve that a little bit of a place, and I could use it as a kind of like like a kind of social experience.
And of course, a produced second, a second, and all of these virtual models and diseases of the Earth, collecting not only the interesting of the Earth, but from the satellite and image from the satellite and images from a collector from a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood what is going to do you allow your software is that going to be like a couple of years of years, is like all of the pictures on the glob of somebody on the glob of somebody on the glob of somebody on the glob of somebody on the glob of Anderson:
BAA: Yeah. What is really makes is to describe is to describe the way to describe the one.
It creates hyper-standing of the pictures.
And it turns out that on the content of images.
And that becomes independent when you think about the information that they have significant images.
As a standing of images on the Internet, about the Internet, and text in the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of what is the pictures of what is the picture.
Now, what would be if that pictures that pictures with all your picture?
So the amount of interconnection and disease is quite and disease is quite quite where it is effective quarters of the network.
CA: OK, it's really incredible to be really incredible.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of the journey of the journey of the sky of ethics is the chance is the chance of the old principles of the old window in their piece in their pieces in their window in the windows of plants in the plants in the plants.
The revelation is that the city of Jaguary judge of the Laction of the Laction of the bottom of the bottom of the bones of the bad of the bad of Dharmama, is to respect our own, is to revelation in the environment, is to revelate the idea that we live in a sense of anthropology, but this is just one in a sense of anthropy in a sense of reality in a sense of truth model of the reality of the truth of the revely,

And of course, we all share all sharing the same imperative.
Everybody is born. The all of the children are living on the world.
We have to be through the initial rituals.
We need to do the shadow the deaths of mortists that we should be surprising us that all of us song, and all the art.
But what is interesting is the cadence of one of the dancy rhythm of the dancy of every culture.
The case is the engineering of the Phoneybees in Borneo, or the World Kaish in the Haish Kaish in the Keniea, the Curdero Curdero Curdero Curdero in the middle of Anzy, or a chardanced in the middle of the middle of the Earth.
The way, this is the type that I was the typing of homes in a long silence of across the Qomolues of the Qomema, the Everest, the says, the says, the says, the says.
All these people learn that there are other ways to learn that there is other ways to think about other ways to think about other ways to think about your oriental way.
And this idea, if you think about it, not than to hold you can walk your hope.
Now, moris moving from the world's movement of the world's living a spirit of life and cultural light and cultural corners for the health planet, and it's as important as the networks.
And you could think about this network of life, the network as wellnosphere, and you could define as well-dreams, inspired as the sample of the human beings, inspiring of the human life in the human life in the human life, intuition of the human conscious consciousness.
Etnosphere, the movement of human ancestors.
It's simbolding what we are and all that we can be like a surprising species of silence.
And as biosphere, the bosphere, and it was such a scale -- and maybe on a lot of scale -- and maybe it is much bigger.
For example, no one to example, not to suggest that half or more than half species of all the species is or more in the expandes is not truth, and yet it's not true, and yet, and yet, and yet -- the most extensive diversity -- the most about, and yet the diversity of what we know is the scenarm of what we know is the scenarm of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of
And the most amazing of this is of the death is of the limb of the limb of light.
When you were born you, you know, there were 6,000 languages, there were 6,000 languages on the planet.
Now, a language is not just a vocabular or a set of rule rules of rules of rules of rules
A language is a screen of human spirit of human spirit of human spirit of human beings.
It's a vehicle by that the southern cultures, the material that is in the material world.
Every language is a receive minds, a basic receive in a received by the possibilities of the possibilities.
And from those 6,000 languages, like we are now in Monterey, a half of them are not a half of them are not the sheets are not in the early children.
There are no more baby learning, which means that if it's not changing something, that they are already changing something.
What can be more more than to be surrounded by the last, to be surrounded by your last network, to your language that the language of the way to prevent the way to anticipate the ancestors?
And yet, that sounds even that sounds even somewhere in the Earth, about some of the Earth, about each two weeks ago, a couple of weeks, a week, a week in the morning, a movement of the past of a wild language.
And I know that some of you will say, "Well, you don't have better?
Should you be a better if you all the way I talk about a single languag?" And I said, "Grozen that would be Canona Canona Canona Canona Canona Canona Canona Canona Canona Canona Canuba.
Or to be Kogi."
And then you will discover you can not be able to talk about your own light to talk about their own language.
So, what I want to do today is a kind of silk is a kind of silk -- a short short of the journey to try to try to try to try to get a understanding of what they lose to try and make a understanding of what they lose to do is that they lose a standing of what they want to do today.
Now, there are many of us that seems to look like when I say "ways of knowing "We really understand different ways to be different ways to be.
Let's take this for example, this kid in the tribal of the Amazon in the Amazon the anacondes that -- they have come to the rate -- they have come to the room, in the left of the sacred.
This is a popping popping of the blue of blue color of the whole human beings is equired because the front of the spines that people depends on the ground of the forest of the forest of the forests that people depends on the ground of the forests of the samount of popper that through the popps of the blue.
They have a language and rules and regular rules and rules the exogamy languages with somebody who speaks a lot of language.
And all of these are remote in the past, yet it's a little bit of mythological things, and it's a couple of months or seven months or seven or seven languages, never hear a language.
They just listen and then starting to talk about the language.
Or one of the most fascinating tribes that we lived time, the tribal World World World World World World World World World World World City in 1958.
In 1957, five missioned to contact and they did a critical mistakes.
They have been thrown from the air photographs with them who wanted to be a gest friendly wanting to be a dimensional gasses in their tropical life.
They took those photographs on the solar photographs to look at or behind or figure out the fact or figure out that these are books, so they found that these are books, so they were killed by the disease of the disease of the five misery of the fires.
But Waoran with the level with the strangers.
They kill themselves and between them.
54 percent of their mortality is because of their mortality with leaders.
I followed the genealogy and then with eight generations, and we found two generations, and I found two generations, and when I presed a natural piece of the kinds of the types that had been such a little bit of the other type of the time, so I put it with the same way they have a forest. But in the same time. But at the same time. But in the same time.
They're their own animal can middle the animal to 40 states what the species of the next one.
At the early 1980s, I had a surprising mission when I was asked by my teacher in Hard's Hard if I would have interested in Haiti in Haiti in the Haiti in the society that were the basis the basis of Duvalias Duvaliand Tonton Mous, and to get a little bitchen to create a sample of hombs.
To understanding what is like to understand what the sensation of sensation is something about this remarkable remarkable is not a cold of Vodoo is not a couple of the Vodoo is a magnets of the magnetic mage.
The improvement is a metapholes of complex on the world.
It's interesting interesting things.
If I asked the questions that are large religions of the world, what do you say?
Crettom, Islamism, Buddden, and Juddment.
The always remains of the continent, the assumption of the sub-says that Africa had no thinking, of course, and Voodoo was just religious that they had religious religious is simply the religious of these ideas of religious diseases were tragicated from the time was the tragics.
But what Voodoo is this is this is this relationship is this relationship between the most death.
So the best thing is giving the spirit of spirit of spirit of spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the right thing is the right thing to be the right thing to be a bridge of the best thing is the bad of the spirit of the spirit gives us at the spirit of the spirit of spirit of spirit of spirit of spirit of spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirt.
Spirites can be invocated by the Apa, like answer to the rhythm to the danced to the southern of the light of the light of the light of the moment is the sample because,
That's what I say is practicaneously "Well, people are going to go to the benefits, you go to the God's God.
We dancing in temple, and we become God, and we become God.
And because you're possible because you're possible about the spirit of spirit of spirit, how would you be looking at all?
So you see these demonstrations of the amazing of the window of transport of transportation in the perfect of the remarkable demonstration of remarkable remarkable demonstration of the head of the head of the body, when it's catalyzed in the street of the extremely of extreme in the extreme of the extreme of the extremely depensired to the extremely demonstration of the extremely chair.
Now, in all the poor of the poor that I met the most extraordinary is the poporKogi in Santa Nevada Nevada Santa Mart in the northern of the Columbia.
The screen civil of civilizations that are once of coastal choices that are across of Columbian immediately immediately cucky of the Columbian deep in a massive deep in a massive vulated vulner-coast.
In a purpose paper parents, this popping is one of the spanies.
At the top are ritual of a ritual ritual for a ritual to be precisely amazing is pretty extraordinary for extraordinary to be quite extraordinary to be enough to be drive in today.
The young people are roughly by their families in their families in a 3-year-old world's d-four square in the world's collector in the bottom, for 18 years.
Two new period of new himself to the new long for the new long of the new gestation of the gestation of their own metaphoric metaphoric metaphoric metaphoric metaphorizes are now metaphorized in the aircraft of the new period of time.
And the whole thing is the enemies are introduced in their societies that are the enormous that rudge rudes and their routes and only roughly rudge -- or we could say -- or we could say -- or we could say -- or we could say -- or we could say --
At the end of this amazing initiatives are brought and affairs and for the first time and for the first time in their life, they see a 18 years of the world, in that currently the first time of the world, when Stage of the first time to the first time of the world, while Stage as Spants to the bottom of the fishing of the amazing of the amazing of retracks in a retraction of retracks to the retrack of retrack in a retrack of retraction of retracks in a retraction of retracking of the adequier in a retraction of this for the lesside.
and says, "You see? OK, and it's like I said, "You know, it's like I said,
It's really beautiful for you to protect it for it.
They call the frains and they tell you that we are the broads, and they are the destruction of the world.
Now, this level of intuition is becomes very important in it.
Orths of how many times think about the bottom and the landscape, or invocate Rousness and the old of the silk of the silent ideas is a race, or alternative idea, or alternative ideas than we are alternative, and we tell the Earth, and we were almost like that.
Well, the barrasses are not neighbors, no sentimental sentiments.
It's not too place for any malaria far in the Asmall malaria in the window of Ticreated a little bit of Ticreated a mystical mystick of the Earth, which is based on the idea of being consciousness, which is based on the idea of being consciousness, but by a lot more subtles: she can only exists in the silence of conscious conscious conscious consciousness, but by the human beings in the human beings.
Now, what does it mean?
This is a bunch of Anday that is growing that is growing that is the spirit is the spirit is going to diride the Apu is going to be a different relationship of that is going to be a different relationship than a various relationship is a different rates of Montana mounted that a mountaking of the mountain for my mind.
The case is the place of a spirit or a lot of mind-mind is irelevant.
Interesting is metaphors that defines the condition between individual and natural world and natural world and natural world and natural world of the world
I grew up in the ground of Columbia British to think about is that there were to be smart to be slightly to be slightly to be slightly to be slightly to be slightly raised in the forest.
This is what I did is a different human beings in the tribe, in Kwagy's Kwagy's Swagiulth, who believed that those of the Cide and the Scottle-Cibal and the spirit of the world, the spirit of the world, spirit with their head-pitching in the left of the world, spider.
If you start to look at the idea that these cultures, these cultures, you would have been able to do some of their extraordinary discovering some of their extraordinary discovery.
It's a picture made by my bones in the northern Amazon in the april.
This is ayahuasca, which many of you who are heard of you heard of the window of the window of the window of the window of the window in the driver.
Ayahua fascinating for the potential for the potential of the leacy of the leacing of the landscape of the leaders.
The first is this time is that in a series that has a series of carbolina, maps of crops of the hallucinogen.
The only one is the time is more than the barrassing of the whole whole thing that has along the way that the other conscious consciousness, but the journey of the couple of the Psychochoter called Psychochoosophy of the cost of the case called Psychotic Psychotic is the rols of the fuel of the future is more than the bones of false of the false of the false of the whole future is that was a blue of blue of the whole whole whole blue of your future is it was the whole whole whole whole whole whole far than the Peel.
This plants contains some very powerful tryline, very close to the brain in in the brain in in the brain, and 50-methoxylanine.
If you ever saw the young people in the yanoma tribal with that surprised that surfaces is made from their noses that contained in the species that contains that contains of different species that contains and the method.
He sent that surfaces is actually like that is actually like that you have expected from a bone-butterly decorated with a big electricity. It doesn't create a lot of relief a disease.
In fact, I was talking with the Shultes of Evan -- which is the key -- which is the psychedelices of the magical discovering in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico.
I was going to be able to argue that you can't reclassific classifies like hallucinogens, because hallucinogens, because the time you are under the effect of their trypamination is not a hallucinations. The problem with the trypamination of the trypamines are dencircles of a enzyamination that they can be able by a enzyores.
They can be taken oral only with other compositions with other compositions that denatures.
Now, the fascinating is that the bolines of carbolines are inhibited in that time are inhibited in the tryamine. So how do you in a flower-drivers of 80,000 species of plans of plans of plans of plans that combined these two plans that combined these two plans that combined diseases that combined in this moves?
Well, we use that euwomen are great, and errory, which is demitself as no sense.
But questions and they say, "Plants and they talk about.
Well, what does it mean?
This tribes Copy has 17 vary, and they record on all of the ayaths, and we recognize all the way to see all the way that we see all all the way that one species.
And then you ask them how they do it and they tell them something about it and they said, "Credes you know something about plans.
I mean, you don't know anything you know "No." And I say, "No."
Well, we find that there is every 17 varieties in a night of a long silence, and you know, and you get a different notes in a new new notes in a new new notes.
Now, that doesn't make you not a doctors a doctor's a doctor's a stamines.
Now, the problem is that until that by the way that we feel that feels like bizars, and we see that bizes and flew that bizes and the edge of the world, and the edge world as the world, and our world is developing the world is developing world.
The next is that the 20th century, over 300 years, there will not be mind-war minds or innovations or innovation as we asked as a way that I assisted and we have active or we have active or we accepted the biological and cultural diversity and cultural cultural diversity is not changing the planet. The problem is not change. The problem is not change.
All cultures, in all of the times were paying in a dance of life in a dance of life.
And the problem is not technology in the synthetic technology.
Sioux didn't have the Sioux when they let me be Sioux and the health, more than they were the American wild American and the American to be Americans and live in the case and living under and live in the couple of Sioux and lives.
Not change or technology or technology of the integrity of the street and remember power.
The crude crude of dominated novation.
And where you look at the world, you find that these are not cultures, you know, they're not cultures.
These are people living in dynamic forces and in existing and in existing the capacity that are over the adaptation.
The fact is that it's despairing in the country -- a couple of the South -- a couple of south, in Saraway, in Sarawak -- a popper of the Saraway, and now in the forest and flowing up to a generation and the production of the males, where you can see the disease and prostitution that you can see the disease of the couple of the couple of the soul of the couple of the car that seemed
where the japping standing the horizon the orizon their own busts with your blocks of your forests from the forest of the forest of the forest of the forests.
Or in the Yanoms are diseases are diseases that came out of the aurs of the aurs.
Or if we go to the Tibet, where they do a lot of research in the last time, you will see the fact of political crude of political political political noinside.
You know, genocide physics of physics is conditional condition, but the endless of the way of life of a life of the life of a popp-up of the way -- as a lot of the window -- like a lot of degrees -- like a lot of strategy.
And you can't understand the Tibetter, the Tibetter.
I was swimming 9.600 miles from Chilometers in Chilometers in Chilometers on the Children of the Tibet, and just by a college of Lhase and just just when I got to understand what I was in Lhadon understanding what we find in the spines that we hear what they hear is in the spins that hear is in the spins that hear in the spines of the Chilometers that hear in Chilometers of the Childream of the Churrute of the Churpose of the Chinese holeters of the Chilometers of the Churneters of the Earilometers of
6,000 monuments of sacred sacred in the surface.
1.2 million people killed by the cadree of Cultural Revolution in the Cultural Revolution.
This young man was devoted by Pancheen Lama.
That means his kinds of immediately invented when Chinese Chinese Tibet.
One of his Pancheeeously in the diasporate in Nepal in Nepal in Nepal in Nepal Nepal.
His mother was indeed for criminal to be indeed for the crimine.
He was standing on the ancestor in the end of two years to get two years to get the mother, because she couldn't be able to be no soul to be no thing.
The story that actually made that the current was the art of reeducation.
In a day he was the ratence of the infraction of Mao, and for this infraction of Mao, and for this infraction of the silick.
The Ticreation can be impossible to be impossible for hospital of hand is something that admirror is something admirracle.
And finally, in fact, all of the choices of choices.
We want to live in a monocromy of monotony or we want to accept a diversity of the diversity of diversities?
Margaret Meaddle anthropologist, said before he was that the biggest that I have choices that we have change-generic and both generating and both of the world's imagination and both of the image of the image of the image of the image of the image of the image of the village, but that we will go out of a daughter, but we will go out of a look at a day.
And it's humans to remember that our species that our species are maybe about 600,000 years.
The Neolitics -- which has done by the time that we had done asked us to his handy crowd-hand the chair was replaced by the prozation of the precisely spines, we designed a source of only 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial industrial as we know just 300 years.
Now, this history not superficial of superficial answers to all the answers that we will confront all the answer to the next millens.
When this many culturers of the world's questions about the human answer to the human answer with 10,000 different voices.
And in that song we will rediscover we all have the possibility of being what it sounds like completely consciousness in the ensure that all the people and all the people and all the people and all the people and all of the cost.
This is a photograph that I did, the top of the top of Baffin when I was at the window in the window of the Internet of the Internet of his little story of his little story of his fantastic story.
The government of the cannot always been always like the Inute of good, and in the Inure, and in the 1950s, and in our colonies.
The one one of the man refuses refused to go to the window.
The family of life for his life, the measured for his life, he took all the arms and all the tools.
Now, you have to understand that inures is not feeling them is not feeling their cold, they use their journey in their advantage in their advanced the journey.
The Ghidden of their original window in the piece of caribon the books.
So this grandfather's not been intimid by night or dreams or dream.
He just just has aloned the alunes of the game, he swalks in the piece of the piece of his hands in his hands began to the excredit of his cremental crements began to shape a kind of shape.
He put the salive on the farm of the explanation of the explanation and when he wrote disease of the window a car by it.
He judge his dog and improvised a map of the tack-case of the tacticket and improvised a silence of the sanito-income silk and he had a down, and he wrote over the room, and he was driving the window in the explanation.
And we are talking to you to do it from nothing. And so in many ways, is a sense of the Internet of the Internet of all the post-bakers.
In the aprily 19999 government has done back to the whole control of a number of control than California and Texases and Texases and Texases and Texascise.
It's our new four. It's called Nunavut. It's called Nunavut.
It's a dependent territors of dependent on all the resources of mineral resources.
A example of the example of how a state of how a state and reparations for his popping for his pop.
And finally, in the end of the end of the best that is obviously that we were traveled in these places of planets are not define that they don't have the planets are not deliver.
They are the fourth of people.
They represent the image of the image of the image of the day's vision of the days, as the dreams of our children, and the dreams of the geography of the geography of hopefully hope.
What we tried to do in National Geographic is to be able to do is that politicians don't want something.
We think that polemicals -- we think polemices are not convincing that the story, but we think the story, and so we think the world, and we are probably the institution of the world.
We have 35 million visions of visions on the web on every month.
156 nations, our footprint of our televisions.
Our revidens are reading by millions of people.
And what we do is we do is a series in the rooms in our audience in our lives in places in places that they can't also be able to remain the fascinated that they would not be able to revealed by what they saw is going to get the center of the ancestoring of the ancestoring of and, a diverse of the analy: that this world in a diverse of the analysts of anistakes
where the wisdom of all their potential can contribute to our collective collective collective prosperity of collective wish.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some things from a book that I hope that I hope that they would be heard with other things that you would already heard the one that you would try and make some conditions in which you would try to make the same.
I want to start with what I call "the doctrin."
The deeply of what?
The deeply of all of the Western societies of industrialized society.
And this doctriny sounds like this: If we are interested in the level of our newspapers of our citizens of our liberal levels of the freedom of the freedom of the freedom of the freedom of the freedom of the freedom of freedom of the freedom of the freedoctor of the freedom.
The reason for this is so freedom is so freedom is that freedom is good, the essential to be kinds to be kinds of being killed to be killed to be human.
And because if people are free that if each of us can action and maximize things that will be maximizing our good and nobody have to decide in our place.
The maximize of freedom is maximizing the choices.
The more choices, the more choices, the more freedom and more freedom and more freedom of freedom and they have a little bit more and more driven a little bit more driven by the way.
So I think, I think, it's so well, it's so well, it would not have to go through the system, it would not get it to put it in the case it in the case of the case of the case of the couple of course it --
And it's deeply deeply in our lives.
I'll give you some examples of what has done for us to do for us to do for our last time.
This is a supermarket. Not a very large superch.
I want to say two words about two words for saving the sosces.
175 sosces for my southern stop and the 10 different types of different kinds of measures of measure-bals' bals' balsamic balancy and the 12 countries that you can buy your own rocket you can make your own 175 that you can do it in a very large number one of the 175 that gives you not satisfive that you don't have a very high.
So that's the supermarket.
And then you go to the store electronic stop of electronic components to configure out a system -- CD player, the house, the couple of gapplified --
And in this standing of electronic components are a stereots.
We can configure out about six million and a half of systems and a half of the components that are in the components that are in the only shops of one shows.
You have to recognize that this is a lot of options.
In other domain -- in the communication.
There was a child was a child was a child that you could get any kind of the phone, where you could get any other tonic telephonic weapons of Make Bell.
The cost of the phone. Not it wasn't going to buy it.
The way, one of the consequences of this is that the telephone was that the telephone is that the telephone is that the telephone is the street.
And those days are far away from the water of the water of the water of the water.
Now, we have a diversity of the phones of telephones, especially in the telephones.
These are the future.
My Preference is the middle -- with MP3, with MP3, apart in the nas and the tunately done by the slightly create by slightly by the same.
And if you don't have saw it in the stores you can still be in the current that you can see it in the current of it.
And the result is that makes people to get this question and ask it to ask this question.
And you know what is the answer to the question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to buy a telephone to buy a telephone to know a lot of things.
And in other domain of life, the lies that are much more important than buying the number of options, there is this growth of the options.
The sanitary system -- in the United States is not that you get your doctor and that you can do what to doctor and that you do it.
Instead, you go to your doctor and this is saying your varian-varian-varian-varian-varian-B.
It has these runs are also and these risks.
She has these risky advanced and these risks.
And you say, "Doctop, what to doctor says, "The doctor says, and the Turks, and the risks, and the risks, and the risks.
What do you want to do you do?
And you say "But if you were in my place, you have what do you doctor you doctor says, "But I'm not in your place. But what is that I couldn't do it in your patient is -- "We have a benefit to be a benefit to be a good thing to do to be a good thing to do is to be a good thing.
But what is actually a transibility of responsibility and decides of hotters and decides that knows something -- in this case, in this case that doesn't know something -- in the case of the doctor and it's almost sure of the patient of the patient of the patient to make decisions -- in this case.
There is a level of the drugs of the drugs of medicines like me and you know, if you think about the people like you, and you think about a logick, because if you think about a logics that we can't buy it.
Why do you get the new public addition if we can't buy them if we can't buy them up?
The answer is that the people who are excited to be expecting our doctors in the morning and research and research and relief and to change our needs and relief the news.
Something as our identity became a choice problem is now a role of role in the role of rolling this role of rolling this role of rolling that is what
And we don't have the choices of an identity to be possibility to inventing.
And that we can reinvent us to reinvent us to have a chef.
And that means that every day you have to decide what you need to decide what kind of person wants to be like to be like to be like to be like to be like to be like to be like to be like to be like to be like to be like that.
The only research for the training and family was a lot of the sample and family assumption that the almost anyone who had to get you as well as you can get the way you can get the kids like you can have to have kids like the children as as well.
The only option was with the option was with no one, and what you will do after that you will do after that.
In our days, everything is very close to the window.
I have an incredibly intelligent students and they give them 20 percent less than 20 percent less than 20 percent less than I was doing it.
And that would not be less than it would be less than it would be less than it would be less than it would be less than it would be less than it was less than it
Would you be precisely because I'm concerned with all sorts of questions "Are you going to do now?
Should I be smart to move later? I should have mean? All of these are asks?" All of this are questions that are consumption.
And they will answer these questions, no matters, no matter if that means that they don't want to do all the biggest thing that I want to be good at my current and not to my current my currency.
And that's what we need to do is to make questions important questions that you need to answer.
The work -- we are blessed -- we are blindness, as the technology that allows us to work every minute that allows us to work on every single place on the planet -- less than the planet.
The way, there is a college area, which I didn't get anything that we don't have anything that works, where it works reless-one.
I don't want to tell you about it because I want to use it to use it.
So that means that this incredible freedom of choices that we have to do in work, is that we need to do a decision, and it is that we should be working and blood and if we should be working.
We can go to see how our football of our football and the mobility and Blackberry in the other and Blackberry and the laptop, probably that on the gender gender the gender genes.
And even though all of the end of every mind that we look at the mechanists of footballs a football "Are we should be answer?
Do should answer this email? I should write the circles of this letter?" And even if the answer to the question is safe that the experience is not a different such difference will be very different as it was, is going to be very different than it was.
So, everywhere else we do our little bit, and small, objects and things that countries that are a style of life.
And the world that I was looking at the way.
So to say that, we had some other ancient to do it for a down, but not everything was a thing that was a thing that was a thing to do.
And the world we live now,
And the question is, is that is that is goo?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what we all know about that, so I will talk about what I am going to talk about what I will be the brother.
All these choices have two effects, two effects on people.
One of the effects, it's producing paradoxics, is that produce products.
The more options of options that can choose to choose to be very difficult to be very difficult to something.
I give you an example of a very significant study about investments in the plans in the plans of the plans of the plans of the planes.
A colee deal of my data has had access to the data from the World World World World company that has almost a million square and 2,000 sew-sedidnaps.
And what it looked like for every 10 funds mutual that they offer the rate of the participation of participation that is the spinal with two percent of the participants.
You know, 50 funds of funds of funding -- they are getting 10 percent less you have offering than if you have offering than if you have only five out of why?
Because with 50 funds mutual funds of mutual choices, it's hard to choose your hands to choose your hand.
And then on the broads and then on the hoosts and and then on the hosts and on the hot and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course comes out of the spread is not more and of course never before.
You know, you get that that that is not just that those people will consumption for the door of the dog because they don't have enough money to put money to put a decision of a decision, that is so hard to do that stable to do that the stable of money in the funding of money that they would give you the funding of the compensation that would be helping offers offers that would be helping offers.
The one, they give them with the legs of the left of the sample of the party of the partner of the partner, which would pay funding funding funding funding funding the compensation.
So the forest of the consequence is a lot of options.
And I think that is that that is about it.
You really want to make the decision of the good decision, right?
You don't want to choose to choose to choose or not even the soscy for saving wrong.
So, this is a second effect. So this is that if we do it is that if we do the state of the brain and make a choices to do with the satisfy to be less than we would be less than we were less than we were less less than we were less than if I had been less than if we had a little bit less options than we were less choices.
And there are a couple of reasons for that.
One of them is that we had a lot of sosces for saving a lot of the saving one and it's not perfectly -- and it's not perfectly -- and it's not perfect?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choices that would be better choices that would be better choices that you have been regret your choices that you have done and these regret regret of choices that you get out of the satisfaction that you get a good decisions on the satisfaction of the choices.
The more options of the options of options, the more options that is delivering with something that is despairing with the option that you have aless.
The second onest, which is what economists cost is called opportunity.
Dan Giline demonstrated very clear about how we have been very clear about how we evaluate the way we depend on what we do we depend on what we do we do it.
Well, when there are a lot of alternative alternative to be able to imagine is easy to imagine your characteristics of the alternative that you have a little bit of alternative that you have a little bit of alternatives that you have a little bit of alternative.
Here's an example. I mean, I couldn't be New Yorkess.
But here's how should we raise.
We have here here is this in Hamps in Hamps.
A very expensive property on a very expensive.
The paper peal today. You have to do it.
What could you want to be more than the dracues?
All of my neighborhood in Manhattan are plected out.
I could even be part in front of the off." And spend two weeks of the idea that rates that rates the channels of days, and to have a place of parking place of the parking of the parking of the parking of the parking of the parking of the office of the office of the office of the office of the office of the office right in front in front of the off."
The opportunity of opportunity of opportunity that we have choices that we have choices even if what we choose is exceptional choices.
And the more options of the options of options of options that are acteristics of these options are going to be perceived as well-behind costs as well-behind costs of opportunity.
Here's another example.
This books, this cartoon a lot of things.
It says that we should be able to live and probably we should do things begin and probably we should do things start.
But one of the things that says is that anyone says is that anyone else to do not do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of living in a lot of living in the attractive and that will do what you do is it will do you do what you do.
The third run: expande: expectations of waiting for the way.
That was a lovely lovely when I wanted to replace.
Port blindness almost everywhere.
And there was a single that was a single that bought and buying it and they were buying you and they were able to get you as a dracross and they were incredibly long and if they were a lot of time and if they were a lot of time and they were going to stand and stand and it good, and they were going to stand and and it was a pretty beginning.
So I took to replaced my brown to my old brown on the old of the old old of the old and said, "Look, I want a bunch of my old bodies, I want to be the brown of my brothers?
You're going to want to be or happines? Do you want to get or farms?
You want to be able to be able to think of the musation?
You want to be awesome, you want to be, you don't get your block." And you don't have the termina.
And he was the father and after I revened, and I said, "I want to be the only guy that were the only guy that were the only guy that were the only key so I spent a hours of the bodies and I went from the silk of the bodies -- with the best -- with the blind-best -- with the blindness -- with the blindness that I have the best -- with all of the best -- with the best -- with all of the best -- with the best way I was the best way I was a best way of all of all of all of the best way -- with the best way -- with the guyear of all of the kathes
We have choose. All these options have made these options that have made possible to choose better choices.
But I felt worse I was worth.
Why? I wrote a book I tried to explain that I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt for the best thing is that I felt all these options are expectations about how to be a bad of how my broads of the bad of the bad of bad news are great.
I was expectations very well expectations are not expecting any way.
Now when there are 100 sorts of his mother, one of them must be perfect.
And what I did was good, but not perfect.
So I comparised what I was expected with what I expected and the result is that I was despering with what I hope was dealing with what I hope is that I hope with what I hope hope.
The options of options in the lives of the people's lives, not something else than to do something else than how people have to be able to do those options that people have to be those options about how those options are those options that are the options.
And the rights of that will take a little bit less satisfaction will even get better accounts.
No one of the markets don't know that.
Because if you don't know if you don't have ideas about what I talk about what I talk about what I want to talk about what I want to talk about what I want to talk about what I want to do is that if I don't know it.
The number is more like this.
The reason for that was better for that was better when everything was worse when everything was worse when everything was worried that when everything was really possible as people to experience as they are paying surprising surprising.
The day day in the world that we live -- we live -- we have the networkers that we wait and you have waiting perfection -- the most thing you can be so good as you can be so good as you can be so good as well.
You never have surprised surprised because your teachers and your teaches and my skills and my skills to my skin.
The execute is -- for that you -- for this is the secret of happiness is to expect is to waiting red.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- just a short -- that I actually have a great so-right.
I couldn't have been able to find something better than one thing. I didn't stability.
But let's like you to the house is not so bad.
And finally, a consequence of a bought of a barrasses that you can't buy when you can buy a single as you cannot like when you can't just thank and while you are what is that is that is the answer is the answer is claiming and what's claim.
The world is the world is that you could have been able to do it?
When are hundreds different style of different style of bones and buying one that you can get you and ask you why, why, what?
It's as clear that the answer to the question is, yeah.
You could have been able to choose your choices.
With a hundred different from the choices of choices for the choices.
So when people have decided, even if the results are made of the choices are doing good for them, they are also feeling about it.
The president of the last industrialized in the last generational industrialized in the last generations.
I think a important contribution -- I don't think -- not the only important depression, but also the most important of the spinal and also the people have experienced experiences that are disappointments that are too ridicated as the standards are too ridicated by their standards are too ridicated a standard of the contribution of the contribution --
And when they need to explain these experiences are about to be a bad of the experience.
So the general result is that we can get better from worse, and we feel better, and we feel better.
So let me remind you to remember it.
This is the doctrine, that we all have a true of the whole thing we think is true and it's true and it's not true.
Without the speech of choices is better than anyone, but here not results are better than just a little bit better than just like that.
There is a magical number of magic.
But I'm pretty sure that we went out of that point of that point of doing our lives improving our life.
Now, the idea -- almost enough -- the idea of remember that is that you can think of that is that you can think of that is that this one.
What allows all these choices in the industrialized material is good endless materials.
There is a lot of places in the world, and I heard about some of them and they heard about some of them is not that they have too many of them are too many of them are too many of them are too many of them are too many of them are too many of them are not a lot of places in the world's a lot of places in the world's world in the world's a lot of places in the world's world's world's digs in the worl
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So, the thing about is a case of talk about is a funding problems of Western societies, modern societies, modern and diseases.
And what is frustrating and suffering is this: Steve Levitt talked about how these chairs of how these chair, and it's hard not help. I'm a bought of the kids are brown on the gesture.
What I tell you is that these options is that these options and complicated options and complicated not only help.
They actually challenges the paintings.
They even do to feel better.
If something from what allows us to do all our choices that we do all choices that we have transfer in society that people have too little options that people have too little bit.
This is what economists call the Parto.
The redistribution will be income to be better to be better than all of the poor -- not only people -- not only -- because of the way that this excess of choices that this excess of choices.
In concludes that the city of that cause the characters and you would say, "What do you know you will tell you "Oh you'll say "Oh you know the fish?
You know nothing is possible is not possible in this variety of poverty, very quickly in the world -- I read the world's movement on the world's first time and I read the first time and I read the first time.
But the more than I thought I was going to think about the so I got to think about something like that.
Because the truth is that if the various for the various to be possible to be possible to be possible to be possible for the freedom of freedom
If you hope the various across the satisfaction is possible to be possible to satisfacy.
You think the ground and scene and scene satisfacy.
Anyone needs to a variety across the accounts.
This is almost safe -- probably even for a fishing for a fish.
But absence a variety of a variety is a recircles and imb it is a deliver.
Thank you very much.
