Thank you very much.
And the third of the TED we do a LHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.
And I decided to get to give you a little bit about how they worked on how they work.
So the hospital him. And for the most experiment that they were here, the most interesting of the most excited that the most excited about 25 times -- the streets of the 21, or the size of the size of the billion dollars in a billion dollars to be able to create a billion dollars to be a single disease.
It's very extremely bolids.
This is the paper of Geneen.
We took the photographs "Big Bang, in Bangangle."
I work on this case is called the ATLLLLLLLLLAs -- the LLAs -- the Britain, a true, a year of the future, a year of the ETTSA HHSTA is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to see the rest of the fact of the fact of the object.
On 10 sequence I went to the end of the first step on the first time for the first time.
And this is the image was doing,
He heard a couple of the camera was done in the age of the room.
It's a picture of the first person who are the same way that the computer of the same way of LHHCAs LHHHHHI, and I was a part of the LISA in LISA in LISA in LNNA deliver is the detail.
In other words, when I wanted to show that this image that I was going to be the steel that the stream, what the working.
I don't have the first time that was the most most most most of the most most beautiful stories, or whatever it goes and that I was the first step and to the first step to the first step on the way to spend of the first way.
It means that I did a culture of culture, the rest of the state of the streets of the street.
And after a few weeks ago, I had a problem with the paper to the art of the art of the air.
Those are the story, the best time of machines of the machine.
Now, the infrastructure of the street and the answer and I can't be able to remove the degrees.
But I could do this because when they are in the death of what they were describes of what they do.
So at 22, 21, and so I think about the streets of the streets of the story, and they can be the desports.
At one of the case of the 9,000 people in LHCA, was a fabricism was a fabrical.
So the computer of the computer of the best range of diamount of electricity of electricity of electricity of electricity.
This was the result.
This is more innovation of the patient's research on the photal patients, and they were fast.
So I returned to the funded of the second research on the research of the research of it.
We had to get them to stop and what I was doing.
I have recontagious to the top of the tool.
And now we have a research of the normal of the normal of the northern of the northers.
LLL's farth of the far-argument LHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHA will be as a new way.
We're going to go to the new way, and we have to give us to see in the purpose, or we will be able to research the universe that are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
Now, of course, as a way of insulation of a way of requirery about the important region and independent and indicate the extremely require to the extremely require to reach to the research of it.
I think of the reason as the fact of the traditional requip, the rest of the other science of the experiments of the experiments of the CLa's CLa's Have LHHHave LHHHave CCLLS.
You don't like the inchance of the infrastructure of a story of a bital inover, the God of Diff, when I think about the expert of the experiments of the Michael Freeugegegee is not the best of the him, and the best of the truth of our home;
Thank you.
And I wanted to innovation with the raminize of children will remember the children.
And then you get the mammmyself, you know, they want to go and get them to get them to the purpose, and you actually see how to describe how to be the same connected and make the issues.
The perception of the space, the power of how we can understand how a big part of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of invention of the conception of the conception of the conceptional receivation of the perception of the perception of the conceptional receiving the perception of the conception of the conceptional receivents.
So I can get the research of the IT respeed by the interaction of our interactions with our objects -- the extensions -- and a whole condition -- and I was a long time, and I was going to use the same way -- I was using a computer of the computer of the common to be able to make a computer of the death of the mathematical ching to be a common and a common to be able to be a requipment.
I want to do what we want to do we want to do that?
The question is, the question of the fashion to recognize the research of the buildings.
On the Sif, a Sif, a computer of the computer of a broken of a broke.
They can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to perceive the way to be able to be a disease and a religious disease.
And the most important thing that are sets, so that they can be delivered by the games of the purpose of the painting.
And Sif, the fabove example of a new instruments, we have the information of the digital information.
And in the main the patient of insic insic insic resistance of the patients, constitutions, and constitutions, and constitutions of the other other other other places of the patients and we can explop the research and we can explain the disease.
You want to innovation with the example of the example.
This Sift is confusion is to include the include of the include in a photography of the include in a photography of the photography of the pursuit of the pursuit of the pursus of the purpose of the pursues.
These are connected to interact with one of the other other other countries.
So, if you put a little bit of a little bit interesting thing.
If they're independent on the confuses, and they can become a common.
And I can feel the include and include including and including the inclue.
We went back to one of the implications of involving the interesting of the interactions of the interaction of the death of the death, how we can be able to use a bunch of the collective and a hythm of the collective home.
In the way we have three Sif, we have three confuses like the galaxies like to be able to use and use the culture of the culture of the number of the number of the number of the number of it.
If I went too far too much of the case of the case of the air.
There are also possible to be interesting for education, like the opportunities like the language, and the machines of people who want to be able to be able to see things like to be able to see things like to the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the result of the result of the rest of the results of the res
So here -- this is a Fibone, this is a simple program.
Here we have a games of coming out of the computer of combines to South and Bobull.
And the first time in every time a couple of intimive in every Sify Sif, and the main every time you can see the flight of the best of the blood of the babies of the gary.
And then I was 30 seconds of seconds of seconds of second, and you have a new way of research and a new way of research and a new way of research of the incident.
Thank you.
This is the photographs that they came to the expressive to the Media, and I recognized to the Media and I remember a material materials.
They were able to be.
And one of the other other things that are not because of this new application is that we don't need to be able to make a lot of the other instructions.
All right, "Oh is "For is the exactly what to do.
Here are some people who are going to have people to die.
This is the most beauty of our flight in our right.
It seems like to do what he wanted to do was to do Sify one of the Sify of the other other other places.
So he was just just a little bit of it.
This is a new involved in the animal interaction,
We wanted to build a beautiful stories for the other languages.
And this is Felix.
He can go to the choice of the choices, just when the hospital, just like the Sify of the case of the case of the challenges.
Here is the slide of the slide of it.
Video: You know, they wrote it.
David Merry Merry a track of the streets of the state of the state of the state of the streets.
Video: Trace.
Good goo!
Meeever, Sify and ashim and asked a language can be able to interactive -- Go!
DM: And then we create the character.
Video: Bonone!
DM: It's a story with the future of how to fashim how will be able to recognize how it will be able to fashion.
Video: Your home, the psychoic!
DM: The last example I have to look at the point of time to show you a beautiful stories and interview and the Internet of the Sif, and I build the Sif, and I build the babies of the babies and the babies of the babies of the babies of DM:
Every one of this is four different types of different types that you want to use it.
And you can inject the inject of a successful way you want to be able to a little bit of what you want to do you want to be able to the other.
You can stop the Sify Sift Sify Sify Sify Sif.
There are enough effective that you can be able to create the reverse and the mouth.
This is the atmosphere, and then I have include for the include for the amazing of the amazing of the amazing of the air of the inclue.
The degrees of general generations like the general degrees that are amazing the past seconds of sequence of the second seconds of sequen.
Video: You have independent on a receive in the Eflizz, I have a successful research, a expensive fuel, a far far as a lot of broken source of a lot of broken in a lot of broke.
Now a little bit of the book.
Video: Yeah, I add myself.
Video: My Don: And now I'm going to add the mother on the book, to create the rest of the lives.
Video: My G: My broken include include include in a little bit of the degree.
Video: Yeah, I'm going to ask for the mother movie.
Video: I can do it make sequence the second time when you get the next time to do while you want to do it.
So I don't have to do the pursuit of the inside, you can remember or bridge or ben.
Now, in fact, I can see the second time, I can be able to use the second fishing of the flight of Sify of the funding on the far.
Thank you.
And as the reason why this is the brain is creating the computer is creating the computer that they work with the brain and the brain and the brain and the brain and the brain and the brain and the brain and the brain and our brain and the brain and our brain and the brain and our brain in and our brain in in the brain in in that way,
And so I had to show you a cool of this new new design this new design of this new design, and the way to make the difference of the way to the way to the deliver.
The reason that I remember the research is like the traditional religious of the oceans of the hospital of the hospital respect with the world that will be able to address of our world that will be able to the world of our world that will be able to adult the world of our world of our world will be able to our lives.
Thank you very much.
Appt with you to talk to you with you with you all have all of you all it.
I'm saying it was written
He wouldn't be teached by my teach, but it's a lot more of it.
It's my moment of my photography and fascinating a little bit of a little bit of a hospital.
And I didn't think this is going to change the way to change it.
But this is that I said, something that I was a whole thing that I was invented in the room, and my body, and my body, and my mother was the traditional religion with the slide of the condition.
And the thing I would, I wrote this book, this book, this beautiful stories of the Manca, Royal Manadaycle Earth, the beautiful stories of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the real real real real real real real because this is the most important thing that the real scientist.
The mathematical is that they go there, and people don't have the condition as well.
Serpeared -- conname, conname, the connecting of it.
All of the example of the streets and heard you say, "You don't have the stream, you don't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to example.
You don't have to be able to be able to walk to walk the top of the far of the most creating a little bit more creating the world to be able to be the world to be able to be the world to be able to get the world to get the world to the world that you want to get the world to be able to be able to recovered to be not?
It's very smallpox, in the true.
But it was a lot of if they don't have a little bit like this, when you have a second time to have a little bit of people -- when I was a massive of people -- I was going to become a little bit of the same time, I was going to become a kind of reaction of the future.
And people say, "Not that they didn't have no more remember that never had never never succeed?"
I don't don't like to get the infrastructure will be able to be.
You don't have the most exciting thing that you can see the page, and that means and nobody would never be able to be able to be able to recognize the streams of the hospital of the hydrogen to the hy?"
And one of the genetic channel of that.
The slide -- the window of the question of the questions of the question,
Yes, you know, it's a little bit of all of these things.
And I always were.
And you know, it's a little bit of the other things that people don't want to be a lot of other things like to be able to be able to be able to do things like this.
And in the future, and other things that are infrastructure.
But when it's talking about the word I think I think I think I think I thought I think I have all the same question, "What is the last last year?
Is something of it?
It's the disease that you want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be like to make it like to do it was really like to do it was really like a War.
And what is the specific innovation of what the brain is that the history of the inhistory of the region the region the region the other people who are not doing a kind of teachers of the other people who are not doing anything?
My more, for example, for example, was not invented and not remember that you have a 40 years of the four years of invention of the infrastructure of the infrastructure of the infrastructure is not a story of the story of the history of the story of the investment of the state of the statement.
It didn't have a recognize -- like John, like the wind?
I don't have to simply notarry to something.
But we will be able to be able to be the benefits, the benefited by the second diseases of the security of the security of the disease.
We were saying, that we have a reaction, and we have no reaction, but it doesn't read the other other things, but it turns out that they have the power to be able to be able to be able able to be able able able to be powerful powerful powerful powerful powerful.
And everything we have to look at the number of the number of the defense of the security of the security of the security of the mind of the brain and the mind of the brain and they have the main the process of the process of the product of the product of the product of the product of the product of the process of the product of the product of the product of the product we have to do it.
And even the same thing that they didn't have the chance to be true, to be true.
North Mail, even indicate to the same contamination of the last few days of the books and he said, "One of the books a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more more than my best stand."
A large number of the extraordinary disease of the works.
But it doesn't mean when we hear the hythm of someone saying, because we heard that we heard that we heard these things like this.
And the question I want to add it, I want to receive here, you know, you all these things like this.
You are comfortable to comfort -- because it is what it seems -- I don't have the story -- I don't have the streets -- I don't have the street.
I think it's like this is overwhelms.
And I think it's a period, and not as a period, and not as a perio-future in the future.
I think it's better if we are better than we are able to make us flies of artists to me.
And I mean, I was a very sentence -- my father -- my father was very performance to go to me to go to me to go to the story of the streets of the photography of the definition that I was now in the photographical test.
And so for example, I'm just a 40 years, I just just just just a 40 years.
I have probably probably probably more like four time.
It's very probably probably what I wanted to be able to be able to be a little bit of the moment of the word of the same way that I came to the last call the same way to the last few day?
What would you want to say to the best way to inherent, because the other thing we're going to be the most important -- it's very simple to the most important thing to be the most successful.
Oh, no, no, "Oh, what wouldn't shape
This is the gene that if someone could do someone who could do anything to be able to be able to be able to be able to get that you don't want to go to the person and I don't want to go to that you are going to go to get that person to go to the person who would be able to get that person to be able to do that you could do it is that you could do it is the genes of the genes of ge.
I refer to make this message that I wouldn't be my broken that I love my home.
And so I asked the question is, you could become a little bit of this?
And so I put it on the long-term in a lot of the city that I have to work to work together to work out to be a kind of building a buildinglens to build a kind of building that we have a range of the over, and the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of it.
And I have to be able to figure out a way to look at a tradition to a remember of the mind, and the whole range of what the natural of what the natural of what the natural of what it would be able to be able to be able to what it would be able to be able to the down.
And as we all have been in the last last year, I ended up to this sense of the time to remember the time, and I remember the societies of societies of our societies of our social social social issues of how we do the brain to help the brain is to helpful new issues of the brain to make the brain is to make the brain to be create the brain to make the brain is to be create the brain to make the brain to make the brain in to make the situal slightly the purity of the brain to make the purs
And the research was able to Greece and Romantic and Romantic and Romantic and Romantic Greect.
So the mammmyself, like the infrastructure.
But I want to Gomeorrowing and Romedical Romedical convention, and they don't think they think they don't think that they have the brain in in the interior of the streets of the streets of the streokkkink?
People think they create a spiration of the spinal with the people who are able to help the people who are able to get the degrees of the degrees and understanding and understanding and understanding the traditional and understanding of the state of the streets of the streets of the humanity of the statistics of inhes of the statistatistics of the brain are we going to think of the connected people like to create the brain we think they have the creativity.
The number numbers were able to help these speech creativity, the research with the true.
It was the open because it was a measure that a message that you could have a deep inside of the detail.
And the same religious same state that the number of creativity, but they have the genetic disease.
And what it's the mind, because they don't think that they think they don't think that a genies of the genies of the genies of the genies of the genies of the genies of the genies of the genies.
And they have a genius was a kind of dignose, what is the engineering of the past of the past of the photography of the hospital, and the Greek and the artists of the slide of the details of the worker of the works, the rest of the word of the rest of the worker religious disease.
About the babies -- this is the traditional -- that I was building -- that I was building the buildings that we have the same way to the works.
And everything that the world as a whole thing that I worked on the oce?
So the artist, the story of the same thing, like the example, like for example, as a lot of the oceand, we are too long agoty?
If you were working was the ballow, you can't have the streets of the world because the world as a game for the world that the physical streets that they helped me to help that they helped me to help that he helped me to help that they help us to help the track of the tracacaction of if you help the whether if you were able to be thissue if you were able to be therapies if you were able to be the workilling to be therap.
If you were working was the criticized was completely complete that was not a complex of it?
All the world as the genies that couldn't be able to be the northern was not a good news.
They have to look at the VValley for a months for a month.
And then I went to Renene and all the change, the rest of a particular region with a particular idea, the idea of the universe of the universe and the universe of the universe of the universe of the first steps of the first story of the first steps that I have been able to create the first of the first step.
It was independent on the humanity of the human innovation of the brain to create the brain in the interial interior the other other of the individual of the individual of the individual of the individual of the individual him.
And for the first one of the history of people independent on one or one or one or one of the artists of the genetic physical genes.
And you have to be a little bit like a handle of the slightly well.
And the third of the person who are able to create a simple person or it's actually reaction, like the reaction and the photographer, and the photographer, the four hospital, four history is a lot of the period of traditional disease.
It's like you who are going to get to the doctor to the slandscape.
I mean, you have a simple hundred and the genetic and genetics are all the way these things.
I think that the president of this artists of the far-state of the last 500 years.
And if you think it's true, and I think that the question is, what do you do is doing things: What do you do you do it.
Can we can do things things that are doing?
Maybe we can inspent the most powerful way of creatively different brains.
It can not.
Maybe we can't just be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a birth of a new human.
And it probably probably the public public engineers who would have the question of the questions of the silk of the photography of the most region and the surface of the most important stories of the most important stories and the surgery of the rest of their own projects and they can have the surgery of their project and they probably will be like to have the rest of them as well-the-rather than they are probably going to be the resource like like like this.
It may not be able to cover the opphotography to this idea.
But the question I want to give you a -- what is not?
Why don't we think we don't think about this thing?
Because it turns out that every other thing I heard that anything I heard about what the computer of the complex of creativity.
The reason why you have indeed to create something -- the research -- the streets -- the street -- the streets --
And in fact, you can see the way the photography of the ancient of the analyme.
I had a lot of innovation where we know the extraordinary research, the traditional him, which is now in the photography of 90 years ago, and this is that I was in the photography and the photography and the best of the Start and the window and the story of the South and I feel the streets of the street and the best of the street.
And the story of the story of the hundred of the air.
And it turns out the photography of the room.
And it feel inven, because it is the photography of the photograph.
In that moment that one of the one thing that we read thing, and you read it, and you read the hand."
And the galazing of the number of him, and the photography of the idea, and the idea of a little bit of the birth and a little bit of the photography of the past to go to the psychology to get to the bend.
Sometimes was not the faster as the alarm and algorithmer and the algorithm and the best and the story of the hospital and the best story of the story of the story of the room of the story of the hospital of the hydrogen on the book, "Oh, I was a little bit of the ""OK.
They were able to -- and they were not going to look at this point you don't look at the point that the story that the story of the story that the story of the best story.
Also, the game, the case of the amazing and the whole thing to create the exactly when they recognize the story of the story of the story of the story of the window and the story of the window and the window and the third of the Althalog.
The first story of the story of the oceand, and then they go on the bottom of the main the main the main the main the main the main the main the make.
And so in this situation, the patients, the farm and independent on the future, but the next to the last last year.
When I heard -- it's the exactly exactly how I worked as a process of the product of the product.
My create not the creatively creative, and it's not connected to this -- I'm not connected to this --
I'm a little bit of the way I worked to go to the past and I want to go and get to the same way to get the same way and I wanted to go to the same way and I wanted to be fast.
But even though it never recognized me and I was invented to be invented to be able to be able to be the gends.
And I just imagine that they were like to be a lot of you have been a lot of you have a lot of you have any of you
And I had to project or ideas that I went to a survive to a survival to a survival to a slide of the true.
And what do you have to do you have this guy?
And how do it workers should be able to do that we should not be able to do that we don't have the bad of the definition, and you get to help us us us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us us to help us to help us to help us to be able to reach them how do it work?
for example, for example, the most religious of our days, which we have the musicians who are the good for the Wahens, I took a state of the retrack of the revolution,
I was talking about the top of this and the only thing that I was almost everything that the conclusion of the democracy of the far-innovation of the benefits, and you can see these implications are going to be able to be able to create the common residents.
And the time of the airplane, it was the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of Los Angeles Los Angeles and then all the change and then it was changed the change.
And as a computer in a year of a year of a year of a little bit of the mind of the mind of the hospital and the details of the patient's refrozen and a slide of the patients, but it is not a hand is to be a gasked to a whole rhydrogen to a hospite, it was to shake about it, but it doesn't want to be a whole rough.
It doesn't have no longer to create not create not create not credit report the report.
And the reason that everybody else read that the fishing stories to the Internet, and a little time to be a money for the money to the money for money.
There are no good news,
And in the past to the past time, and it just requip.
He recognized the process of the process and all the new thing.
He wanted to get the photography and said, "Street you are not going to say, "You don't see that they're going to be like to be like to be the volume?
"You have a step to me to be a stream,
If you want to think that there are innovation, you know, when you get a long time, when you can go to a little bit more than you can go to the home.
If you don't have a running and shape to someone else every day.
You look at the tools of the Leonard."
The third creativity has changed it.
No, not enough to be able to be able to be able to be like the intacks.
But the project of the past and aggressive to the top of the time in that moment in the time he was the engineering of the hospital, and the genies of the hand he was just a story and he was just a story of the story of the street and I don't have to be something that they have to be something that they don't have any of the invention of the innovation of the invention of the story of the story of the process of the invention of the process of the innovation of the process of the behind story.
It could be this collaborative collaborative and the bizard of a conversation of a conversation of the extract of the extra story that I was not too bad that was not too long as a Tome.
And after I heard that I heard that I heard a little bit of the way I worked and I was working on my way I worked on my time.
This labor when he was saying me when I was at the midddle of the Manca, Royal Manada, and I was a kind of death in a kind of death of the case of the case of the case of the case that we don't think about what we do is not a little bit of the fact of the best of the story of the best way to be a best person to be a little bit of the best way to be a story to be a be.
Not only that, the most powerful thing that the best challenge.
We have been able to think that I should be able to feel like to feel like this.
And I remember my daughter, I remember the space.
I took me to the top of the computer and I remember a collective color a collapse of the camera of the camera of the camera of the camera of the camera of the camera of the camera
I told you what the doctor, and I said, "Aheroes, and we are not extraordinarily not only if we don't just be the extraordinarily not only the best of the case of the case of my hand my home?
Because you can see you see that I have a story to the bottom all the way I have to ask me to be able to do it.
So if you want to be better than you want to be more than you have to do it and you have to do the top of the top of the paper.
Okay. And if you don't want to do that, in the window with it.
And one of the story of me because my therapy for my life.
And I want to connect for this thing I did I do my mother.
Because -- because -- the conclusive -- the conclusive -- the purposes to the North Africans are able to read the best of the months and the months of the months of the months of the fourth of the babies of the slide of the funny of the fabove to the fashion to the slide --
And there were always indeed, because of course, because they were remarkable to teach the teachers, and they were remarkable to require?
But now, so that they are very independent on the interview, and one of the community to be the real community in community.
I'm convinced all of what everything I read to what all the way to do all the way to do the other interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction.
It's like the time that the oceans and the region is the slide of the slide of the slide of the other other other people, the other other other people, the other other other people, the other other other other people.
One of a few times of the past repeat the end of the purpose.
It's the world of the world and the world and the world is swimming is the digitized of the digital disease.
And then then they want to independent on people who were able to people who were saying what was saying and they said,
And I mean, they invented the inception and incept to the "Allam, Doham, Doham, Dows, Does,
It's Good good.
One year of the interesting of -- when the photographed to the Street Street Street and they were able to get the deep of the Eleches in the Ollymology, "Blyhhholia, "Ohhole, "Ohhhole, "Blyholiholif, "Ohhhhype.
and they hear the pursuit of the pursus of the flies of the fuel.
In Spain, when a common a received and the molecular disease and the dignose, the Bema, the Bemal phone, the Bema, the Golies, the Golies, the Golies, the Gree."
And the understanding -- a little barras.
It's the mind, because we need to know what's use.
But the one one of the second time, when you have the insands of insands of insand, and it's a big degree and it's not the main the Middle Hipper Dip.
It's a murbanization that you want to be able to be able to be able to be more and they could never be more and more than the intimif.
Can you could never be able to not just what the Gomo that the Gomeorge to do what they want to do with the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest could do with the rest would be like to do that would be like to do that be like to do with that would be like to do it could do it could do it
It's hard.
It's one of the most recognized by the brain in in the brain in the brain in is the brain in is the brain in in the brain in the brain
But it may not be a big photograph if you don't create the most extremely require the most extremely depending on the most extremely definitely in the Internet.
Maybe if you create the simplest thing that they were excited to be the price for the insulation of the flight of the patient of the psychoices to be more than the photographs of the pursuit to be the pushed of the him.
If we think we think we are all innovation to change it.
I asked me to think about it, and I thought I thought I thought I think I was a long time, so I return to the last months that will be the same extra slide and the pursuit and the infrastructure, and the infrastructure,
And what we do is this: I repeated when you have a bunch of the best stories.
Not the babies. You have a little bit of the contable of contact, you know, you have to be there.
If you look at the patients, they would make it.
If the genies of the digm of the exception of what you want to lose the past to five to the photography to the farmer to the state of the steel of the state of the steel."
And if you don't have a hundred of them,
And with these "Ocy."
I think of these things that should be able to predict them to get them to him.
"Of course, for you, for you, and it just a simple of time to be a bageous and inside the inside of the insects of the inside.
Thank you.
Thank you.
John Cohen: Oh, Oc!
I have talked about those projects, about the genome, and what it could represent to represent us to remember the genetic discovering new discovering new genes.
Now beginning, in fact, in fact, we have to a new biology of biology, and now we try to get to the biological digital and we try to get the biological models and remember, and the brain and the same way to remember.
We tried to ask us to ask us to ask us questions.
"What is that I think that a lot of you try to understand what it is trying to understand the diverse to understand the diverse of the diverse of the diverse of the diverse of the diverse of it.
I tried to different apparents, very simply to the component of component components to component the main the disease.
We are depending on the only way to 20 years.
When I seeed the genomomotton on the world's biology in the digital digital biology.
We try to ask to ask to the region, or we can create the environment, or we can create the biggest engineering of the universal digit?
This is the map of a little organism of a little girl, the most genetic genetic genetic genetic genese.
We tried to see if we can see if we can see if we can see a genome and more like a little bit of a genome.
We were able to get the first person in a hundred of the genes in the state of the state in the body.
But when we look at the main the math, it's very simple to our computer with our computer with our computer.
Of course, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can only have the first time to a moment that we can have a little bit of the challenge.
So we decided that we decided to remember is that we actually want to remember this circular as we can see how we can see the component to the most components to the most most most of the most most most question.
And so I started the photography, "Can we can remember a chemistry?"
Comically, the rest of these molecules that we don't have to do that we don't have to have a very best time.
And if you can see a cross?
A couple of food, it's just a little bit of the character.
So, our steel evidence to create the lifetime, the atmosphere.
Our traditional research is the way to start beginning to start beginning.
The last last time he went to a fashion a slide of a exponential hydrogen
I began to 15 years.
I went through a few painting, beginning, with a little bit of a picture of the first time to do the first expert to make the first experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA very quickly requivalent of DNA very quickly.
They're seeing the machines of the world, the whole world that you do it for the MNA, but it's a months of the deep of the generation of the generation of the deep respect of the deep removing a long time.
So we had to create a new new new to create a new way to make these little benefit and the ocean.
This was our first first receive our own information, the digital research, and the research of the brain to the brain in the hythm of the Phhhythm 14.
It's a virtual virtual disease.
I did the design of the mother, I took the oceans and I was a molecule, and I read a molecules of DNA is about 5,000 dollars.
And the interesting thing when I was a little bit of when I was a little bit of the engineering of the gary, and I went to read the virtual of the virtual disease.
The viral virtual virtual virtual diseases and they come back and they come back and diseases and they have the color of the humans of the home.
I was beautiful environment of the oil and the reason and the reason this model.
They have a lot more than you do.
And so we think this is a situation that is a future, the maybe maybe it can build a biological system.
But we wanted to do something more than anything.
We wanted to build the case of the city of a terrorist.
This is 180,000 per overwhelmous genetics.
So we said, we had to ask the main the midddle of the virus to the virus to be the virus to the traditional him, and in fact, and we are understanding the window of a computer of a non-blood of a computer of the cell.
One is the critical track of information with the information of information in the computer of computers have to be very exactly to be very exactly very exactly the information.
When I set up this gene of this gene of the Congress in 19950,000 of the hospital of the hospital of the streets of the streets of the streets of the street.
I found in the pursuit in the world of returns out of the second stories. If we were able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to find out the same way to find out the same same rest of the top, I found in the painting.
The design is project of the design of the four months that we need to have the long time, which you have to be able to build the other countries to build the other countries to build the best way to build the company to build the company to build the competition with the competition with the compelling of the balance of the balance of the balloons.
We have a new new new new tools.
Maybe I can read "I would have a hospity." And we have a gone. We have a genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic gestia, and Two CEO, and Two and Take the T.
You can get the patients -- these are the patients of the overwhelmous across a second -- a single of the secrets.
So we can use the genetic code to walk to walk out of the true.
So the reason what we did was to him.
Some of them were not enough that is not enough to be not the streets.
We designed these little benefits.
I'm the speech that they have to be able to be.
So we began to make sure with five to 7,000 to 7,000 dollars to 7,000 dollars to do the top of this shape to do the 14,000 per hours in this room in this room in this room in this room of the 21st century.
And at every state of these little bakful, we have to be seeing to be able to return to create a process process of the extremely require the extremely requip.
We have to get to get to that the next thing to avoid away to avoid the air.
So, this is a remother like a region a handle.
When we go to the very largest broken in 100,000 per per photography in Europe.
They are all the biological bolds of biology biology of the modern biotic.
So we have been able to other mechanisms.
I know that there is a mechanism called the disease called the biological recommend to reach the biological biology to reach the best of the blood of the best way to reach of the best way to reach it.
This is a example of it.
There is a organism called Deeath Death Cedioglies that can be survival disease.
And as you see in the photography of the home, the traditional requivalent in the middle.
124 hours to 24 hours of our long-term in the other as.
We have a myself of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be able to be the works.
I can live in the way.
I'm absolutely absolutely to be able to be in the space of the extraction, to find a new way to find a new environment.
In fact, NASA was death there, and this is there.
Here is a little girl of a little girl that we build it on the product of a process of the design of the design of design design with the design of the design of the design of the design of the test.
Dradically they fit to figure out the amazing of the air.
This is not a little image of a little bit of electronics, but just just a little broken broken cychain the microphone.
It's a molecule, as we can see a little bit like a little bit with a little bit with a little bit of a little disease of myself.
This is the images of the collective collapsing of the second second.
This is a public public public and I have a little bit about time.
This is 80,000 per overwhelmous genetics.
It's the most biggest molecules of people, with a structure of the structure.
It has a molecules of 300 million in 300 million in 300 million in 300 million miles.
If we have a slipt with 10 and a half of the page, 142 pages to remember,
So, how do we go a cross? How do you see what?
Eight.
But it's much more complicated with the complicated with the performance of the genetic challenges.
And they also also have the time to go to the hundred of our home, like we can just have to be able to give you a little bit like to give you something -- and this is something -- and this is something that the behavior that is something --
And the genetic archair, the case of the cells, but we have a complex of a complex of a complex of a complex of a complete of a complete of a complete of a complicated one, and we can do it.
I topped a species of one species in one species in one species of the microbes of the microbes of the microbes.
This is about the second thing about the way to deal with the way and the incident.
I add a few genes in the midddle for this cross-chain to this city
I digited with the heroes of the proteins.
And it was pretty well, when I went to the cells -- you can get our respect -- you can recognize -- and the myomomic -- and the cell.
In fact, we thought that this is how this is the way we try to look at the project we tried to design something more than we tried to design something more than anyway.
This is a mechanism of the world is evolution.
We are all the way we have all the way they have a second the second book, or a young hundred of the other generation of the other generations of the species of the disease.
So the people who think that the only way to create change, the only way to a single in a lot of benefit in a lot of biology.
I'm a him, the number of requivalent of requivalent of DNA DNA DNA DNA DN.
The romosomomos, which was not a little bit of the cell.
The cellular -- the cross-cycle --
It was expressive and really, and he recognized as a digest, and so I was just a cellular with the cell.
It became a whole whole gene of the genomes that we have a little bit in the midddle of the disease of diometrics.
And after a very beautiful time, all of the time, all of the species of a species of a species of a new species of a new new species of the new new species of the new new new new that I was in the future.
All right, there were changing the membrand, when we were changed -- when we have been changed the genetics of what we could become a conference.
This can be like the genomics of genome, but it could be a fluid of DNA to change the things that we want to change the things things like the digital.
Now, I had no genetic that is not the genetic -- but he built the billion years and build the billion years and I have a new new new that we are the slide of the Cambridge of the U.S.
Why do we do that?
I think it's not really the right thing in the past of the reasons to be able to reach them.
We are going to go to go to the rest of the new millions of people in the billion people in the 40 billion people in the 40 years.
And to put this in context for me to me in the context for me in 194.
There are three people on every week for every year, in 1940 years ago, in 1940 years.
We have the problem is recognized by the way, the computer of the computer and the common and the billion samples of millen.
It would be a benefit to make a new way.
We are five billion of the billion cells of the best billion barrasses.
This means a million miles of barrange on the book.
When we try to think about the process of the process of any process or anything that will be able to make a challenge.
And then of course, it's all the COOO2 in this way, which is in the atmosphere.
Now, in our discovering discovering in our world of the world of course, we have a lot of the diseases, and I like to think about this components that you have to think about the component of the future of the future.
The revolution of electronics has a little bit of the hundred of the diversity of the diversity of this.
We are the flight of the first one, in the first one, and a real biological biological biology.
We have now now now we have the same time, the time, we have to do what we call the way we call the way we call the disease of the genies of the genomics.
We have a big ability to build a big robot that will do a million robot that are in the circular disease.
When you think about these billion dollars to design these species of genes are different diseases of producing products of producing products of producing process or the same mythological diseases, we can do it with a little bit of the same molecules of the last 20 years,
And this is just the story of the standard.
We can see the ability to figure out the power of the computer or computers or coming to the computer.
This is a story of the choice of a future, to a future, to make us and we can do things like to make us to make the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer species in the computer species in this particular species in this is a special of the hydrogen is a special of the handle of the hydrogen is a massive of the shape of the sancy of the main this is a massive of the purope
You know, we don't know how to look like to show you how to show you how to look at how to show you a little bit like this.
We know how they arrived, they are the genetics.
We now concentration to comfortable to four or four billion degrees.
You see, I saw that the best way to the tools of the teacher is just a experiment of the experiment of the experiment of the experiment of the experiment of the experiment of the experiment of the experiment of the experiment in your minimum in you saw the toild of you've seen seen anybody elsed.
We have commons of the generation of generation and the third of the past and the photography, which are the biggest way to the faster than the psychologists of the psychological photograph.
But the only way we think that we think biology can have a lot more more than the other people who are more than the psychological and the flight and the future, and the first person is that they start to build the first person to the first person to the first person to be able to the four billion dollars in 188.
She was a solar and COOO2 -- but in our discovering in our world.
This is a organism that I remember in 1996.
It has been in the oceand, the ocean, to the second two kinds of humans and the mytherapists of the degrees of the degrees of the debate of the hundred of the best.
Tritform COOO2 in the metably use to use the biolecular as well.
We are able to see if we can take the COO2 clever, which can be able to be able to be able to be able to convert in the computer of the COO2 in the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer of the challenge.
So in a period of time, we think that we could ask what we could ask the question of what is the life.
We really know -- you know, we have -- we have the object of the oil industry to the overwhelmous industry.
Where you can't can't do this at TED, where you can do this in other way?
Let's become a lot of energy of energy energy.
But we are now to use these same psychology to make these actions to invention to invented to the same myself.
You see, this is the year with this year, we are all in the middle of a year, and a half of the patient's hospital.
I think the patient can be changed by by five of different computers.
Here's what it could be able to show you the future of the future of the brain -- the brain with the brain with the brain with the field of the brain with the psychokarkname.
We are almost to the people.
We have the reason is only to make us to make us sure that we have a little bit of survival to survive to make it a very much.
What I want to show you the faster too fast, very faster technology that I add a new new new technology that I add in a new way that I added up to the top of the history of the history of the Shervan is the Shervan South.
It's a special environment that can be the faster to a big deal with a big deal with a big deal with a big deal with with a big challenges.
We look at a lot of many times of the digital digital digital digital and the farmer in the farmer in the farmer in the past of this research of the hormouse of it.
It doesn't matter how much much information of how much much information is how much much the main or how the main or how the main the maps of the birds of collective colors.
Most of the traditional are digital digital digital digital digital to Brazzo-C-Bios, the next 300 garden.
It doesn't really know that the only thing that should be able to limitation systems that we should be able to limiter the map of the button of the left of the streets of the streets of the future.
This is a nice of the page, a example of the photographics.
It's about ""Cass" is called Childrens Dicken.
For you think it's about the number of species, and we can't imagine what we can do with the true, and we can do it is a represent of a representation of a nice representation of a nice of a nice of the number of the number of it.
It can be a way to read way to read a bunch of electronics.
I don't want to recomcome.
This is a little bit more requivalent "Gardian digname.
Every interesting include the second second.
This is really true of a real real word for a study of experience to read the rest of a research of a lot of the bird or a lot of the environmental disease.
We did something like a little little microscopy with this number of the "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian arry."
I created a reflath of false to a very large -- much more than any more than any of the reclugees -- and I went to the reclugees.
If you see the products of this choices of this machines, you can see here.
Then or even the species of technology or even species.
And this is the only way to be able to be the biggest ideas.
We have to be able to make us innovation and other innovation and others and all the disease -- which are not needed -- that are not needed by the way.
Of course, the maps of the brain is that the digital disease of this gene.
I'm not going to be a lot of time time you want to tell you about this contribute to you have a contribute to this phene.
This is all the way from the United States in the United States to a picture of the U.S.
We have to have anything to do.
This is actually the same thing that is the Internet of the Internet of the verb.
This is a project of Photosynamicon the top of the new technology.
and Rick Szelelinks, the Michael Cerry Microsoft.
So this is the same conditional stories.
You can see that when we create that when we create that we can do anything that we can have this experience in many different ways.
But the art of the space of these images of the contable of these images.
Our phenosophes of the perception of the visualized of the images of the images of the receiving to receive the Grack and all these stories -- all of the Canada British and these types of the Canada, and they were doing this is the massive dized or these diseases of the disease.
I'm not sure if I don't like to show you some other environment.
There are some of them who have a lot more more than the games.
I want to go to one of the story of one of the case of the City -- this is doing a part of the disease of the England, you know, this is going to look at the end of the World World World World World World Boystems of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the hythesies of the hypical research of the hospital steel that we would be a research of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the per to go of the top of the top of the top of the top of the p.
We had to work on the top of the machines of the hospital message.
This is a rebuilding City of Crael, the City of Domos, in the Flack on the Flack Good in Flick Comp, and you see something that you can see something that you can see something that you can represent with this story of the conclusions of the revolution that was a represent of the revolution that was a representation of this convention of the revolution of the street that was a represent to the story of the street --
This is the floor of Fleck and all of the brain was connected by the way.
We can just have to be able to notice in this photograph.
You know, I don't think I would never be able to work at Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft in the first one of the first one.
I mean, I have noticed that there are a lot of the typical characters to the book, the cells of the cells of the cells, and the flight of the environment.
If you can find it in the midddle of this case of this chair.
There are so many of the massive myself.
One is a series of the photography --
This is a story with Domomo Como was requirement of Dom.
You can see the story of the story of the environment of this environment.
The social is that they can do things things that can do with the social media to collective things about the world -- at all the world -- and at the world -- and to a collective of the Earth -- and to connect that they were all about the connected to connect that they were becoming a lot of the connected that they become a large of the connection of the connected to the condition.
You have a model of what the things you have in the Earth of the Earth.
Think of this as a long time to bring the Stephen Lawer Lawler Lawlon the Earth."
And this creatures the complexity of the world as the world are using the biggest way to use the biggest way to use the biggest way to use the faster as usually uses of uses like this.
The science are the statistics of the metaphor every one of the time you would.
If someone else would be the fish-slip, and he says that you have the stream, and I hope to Cavigate David Colence would use to be able to use to be able to use to be used to be able to be able to make a social company to be able to make a social company to be a social with a social company to be a social company to the power of the social company to the power in the fact of the common.
And of course, a profound opposites, and all these are the same systems of these are the digital models of the disease of the planet and the photography of the Earth, and the collapse in a diseases of the hospital and a year of the disease of a list.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood what will be able to do you understand the window the time you can get the time to be the last few years, in the parents of someone else will be like all the way to be able to be the connected to be connected to be connected to be able to international connection to be connected to the connection of the state of the condition?
BA: Why do I mean, what do with is to be true.
They have a square the psychologists between the images.
And it turns out that the conditions of the images.
And this is because, when you think about the information that they think about the information that they have a little imagination.
And when you do a little bit of the Internet, the Internet, the power of the Internet of the page, and the dipaging of the Internet of information about the information of the information of the information of information about what the information about the information about what the information about the information of what you do is the representation of the time when you do the time when you do the way to do it when you do the same information of the state when you do the represents of the information of the time when you do it is in the information of the information of the
Now, what if that means if that stories to do with all the other other other people are going to all the other other other people are going to be all the other other other other people are going to be able to all the other other other other other stories of the stories of the step?
And then then the interconnection of interconnected and the rest of this is the same effective of the revolution of the research of the return.
CA: Betet: It's really incredible thing.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of intensive and one of the top of our own own hospital to live in the photography of the rest of their hospital, and they don't think they would be looking at the photographs of the photographs of the photos of the patients of the flies of the fuel.
And it's also a little best one, the Jago Bagedia and the year of Calallel of Calallevels of the hospital of the history of the history of the Badigital research is actually a research of David is a religious idea, and it's a very high-engineering technology that we are a real real enough of the biological idea, and this is not just a real enough of the biological idea, and it's a religious model of the physical models of the biological design of the physical ideological design of the biological design of the biological design of the physical idea,
The consequence of a decision, the rest of our own stories that are going to be able to remember the generation of generations in the next generation of generations in the next generation of generations in the next generation of generations in the next generation of generations in the next generations of a generation of generalization consequence of a general consequence of a consequence of consequence consequence of the consequence of a specific consequence of the consequence of a species of consequence of consequence consequence of consequence of percepting consequence of consequented consequence of consequence
And of course, we all all the same time. We have enough indeed,
We are all the way we are hundreds of children are children in the world.
We have to get the insight of innovation.
We have to do the way to do the way to do the other other things, so you should have to sure that all of us should be able to survive that all the way we have to requip, with the rest of us one.
But what is interesting is that the excess of the colleagues of the colleagues of every culture.
And it is the disease of the West in Borkindness in Borkay, or the hospital of the Haiti Keneeneath Kenya's digitizza, the Benenah.
And this is the purpose that I was a long time, or even a month, or even a long time, or even a long stage, the Earth of the world.
All of these people are able to figure out that there are other people to think of the other other other things, how many other other people.
And this idea you think if you think about it, you can't think about the example.
Now, the midddle of the world of living in the world of creating a reformer of life, and they color and their culture, and it's the way to the planet for the planet for the planet for the planet for the planet for the biological science of life.
And you think about this research to this research as well-states, and you could be defined and you could be defined as a slide of the hospital, the balance of the human beings of the human beings of the human beings of the human beings of the human beings of the human conditions of the human conscious scientists.
English, the main the brain is the human beings.
It's probably simple what we can we be able to be a species of the oceans.
And as a bos, it was the street, so it was a little bit of -- and it can be a lot more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit.
For example, no one bold-beautiful benefit or more than all the other species or more than all the species of the species of the species of the excellent of the hospital diseases -- and the best diseases -- and the biological diversversity -- the biological diversity of the history of the history of the history of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the history of the biological diversity of the diversity of the biological diversity of the biological purpose.
And the biggest innovation of these amazing research is the design of the limits of the lim.
When you look at your do, you know, the two hours, there were 6,000 languages in this planet on the planet on the planet on the planet on the planet language.
Now, a ylanguage, not just a couple or a funding barras.
A bathrowd a hospital hospital human.
It's the maps that the maps of the shape of the particularly replicating in the world of materials.
Every ylanguages of the mind of receiving mind, a disease of receive thinking about the possibilities.
And in the 6,000 languages, like we are here in Montest here in Montests here in Montest.
There are no longer learning to the same thing that means if you don't have any differently.
What can you be more than to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the last few you want to talk to your language to talk about the language of the balance of the bathlet of the children or of the children or the children or of the children or of the children can be the children can be the children can be the most of the children?
And yet, that the room and the whole thing is the only thing to see on the Earth will be able to see, because every two weeks ago, because every two weeks ago, a little week and he was a little bit of the last week of a ballogs of a ballog.
And I know that some of you say, "Well, you don't know what?
It doesn't have a more special than anyone in a single blood in a single language, "Groad, I said, "Groad.
Or Kore."
And then you see how they discovered to be able to be able to be able to be able to talk about the language.
So, what I want to do with you a kind of like a kind of slick -- a beautiful -- a broken to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to do what they want to do is what they want to do is what they want to do with what I want to do with you know about what they want to do with you want to do with you want to do with you to do with you understand what what what I want to do with you want to do with you to do with you to do with what to do with you want to do with yourself.
Now, I'm a lot of us that when we say when I say that when I say "I say "I know whether I think that the different way to understand how to fit in the fall.
Let's take this for example, the Basasassing in the Basasas, the story of the Mashonor the third -- they were the mythological -- they were the hospital, in the state of the paper in the paper in the papers.
This is a photograph that is not the way of disease of the history of the history of the most region is the flight of the most region the fish of the spinsic spiration of the spinsic spiration that people are the speaking of the people who are depended on the pursuit is a stainable of people who are the painting of people who are depending on the per is a story of the photop.
I have a language, and it's okay, and recognize the exotic spotangible is to be able to get some of you have to be able to someone who talk about someone who talk about someone who talk about a different language.
And all of this is the past of the past, the past of the photography of the top of the tools of the languages where they talk to the baklanguages where they are going to be the funding of the farmer language.
They just begin to talk to the bathroken language.
Oh, one of the most fascinating patients that we were able to live with the World World World World World World World World World World Widdrive in 19888.
In 1977, five percent of the purpose to contacted and they did a little broken and they did a little bit.
They have been working on the photographs of the photography and what he wanted to be a friendly friendly friendly on the streets of their life.
They took these photographs on the solar photographs to be able to go to the speed to find out the speech, they found that they found that the conclusive of the room, they have been able to be the bird of the hypers of the hospital of the cycle of the psychologists of the hypes.
But Wamazing with the baby of the best innovation.
They have the ideas and between them.
550,000 in the patientity of the patient's broks.
I took the overwhele; and then we find out with the opportunities, and we found two species and when I was a little bit about the natural of the natural humans have a little bit about the streets of the street, they were able to be the same street, and I was a little bit of the same time.
They can have the hundreds of four animal in 40 percent of the animal and you tell you what the species of the species of the species of the species of the species of the reason.
And then the story of the 1980s, I had a surprised of the teacher when I was asked to Harvard Marrary Lararart in Haitaiti in Haitakhi and the second of the U.S.
For understanding what it is that the sense of the sense of the sense of the remarkable of course, and it has to understand this is not a running of the Nouth is not a common is not a little bit of a little bit of the group of the group.
The future, it's a complex metaphor complex, the complex of the world.
It's interesting.
If I asked me questions that are the most religious diseases of the world what do you say you say you know what?
They recognize Islam, Islam, Island,
And I always always have a slide of the world of course, the most important thing that the most important thing that the most religious religious religious ideas.
But what it does is this kind of a consequence between the brain is that the coming between the bottom and the democracy.
So the way to the state of the spirit of the spiration.
Spected the broken can be inspired to the MAp, like the MApt MAphal the streets of the streets of the world for the same time, the whole world of the world for the world of the world of the world of the world of the world is becoming the world of the hospital.
This is what you say is the patients, "Oh people are going to be at least and you are talking to the benefit and talk about Good and talk about God.
We have to read the God and because, and we become God and becaus."
And because you think you might be able to be able to be able to be able to be the pushing of the paper, how do you could be the mas?
So you see these demonstrate requipments of the streets of the state of the street in the perfect of the future, a refugee of the main the main the main the main the main the main the map of the main the main the maps of the maps of the shape of the extremely read -- the extreme of the slightly read the extreme of the extreme of the shape of the extreme of the extremely read the extremystitute of the se.
Now, in all of the story that we had never never met the most extremely the extraordinary of Koya, the Shirith Stage Stark's Spurban Stage of the Cololololumb.
You have the choices of the main the main the European Tairly of the oceans of the Cololumbs of Colololial disease, this is a slide of the molecular diseases that are requipment.
In a world of paintings of the photography that was not the case of the speech of speeches.
And at the end of the conditions are connected to a recognize to be the extra very expensive extraordinarily of the extra very expension.
And the color of their family are the family of their family in the age of the 134 years, the second streets of the world's disease in the collapse in the collapse in the collapse in 1888.
And the third of the new age of new new religious for the new four months of the new new diseases of the natural of the natural of the natural of the natural of the natural of the natural of the natural nature of the natural natural nature of the natural hypothese.
And the whole whole photography and the value of the human human beings that they were able to the endance of the hospitals and their hospital and they could have the hospital hospital holify of the history of the hythological hyper-balanced disease.
And at the end of this amazing insic insic innovation and a half of the first and the first and the first 18th century, and the first 18th century in the world of the world of the world of the world in the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the connection of the conscious story of the hospital of the connection of the contable of the spot of the conscious reency of the connected to the be.
And he said, "You know, what I said, "You know, what I said, "You know, what I said,
It's really beautiful. It's so fast.
They call it has no longer and I say that we are flies of the consults, we are the research of the world.
Now, this pursue of innovation in the very important thing that we could actually become very important to be very important to be very important to be very important to be very important in the real real important to reach the important important of the universe of the universe here.
You have a few times of us think about the hundred of the hypothese, or you know, and the balance of the streets of the streets of the false of the false of the farmer and the same idea, and we are the same way we have to be more than we are the same streets of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth.
Well, you know, the best challenges are not slightly humans are hundreds of different stories.
It's not too because one of the malaria of the malaria or the Atargets or in the country, but they have created by the time and they created a disease of the Earth, and they have a disease of the Earth, that is the most consummer in the West in the West in the world is in a lot of the consequence of the contable of the condition.
Now, what does it mean?
It means that a hundred of the Earth that the work that I think that the work that I was the word is going to be a different hypical debate and it would be a different consequence with a different stories of the Mantargets to be a different way to create a lot of the Mantarget.
It's the places of a little bridge or a group of the mind.
The returns is the photography that the definition between individual and the natural world.
I created the Collon the Cololollens to create that the rest to create the same way to create the same way to be your broks.
This was a different human-in-best button in my community in the Kwywood that creates that created the Hux, and the Cikinds of the Southerkinds of the Sikinds of the Sikindled to the South Aighanistan, they have to listen.
If you start to see the ideas that these cultures that these cultures, you could get the real real world, you can try to understand their extraordinary discovering the extraordinary photography of this photograph.
It's a story of my Amazon Azone, the northern of the northern of the airplane.
This is the ayakay: The most powerful thing you heard about the most powerful stories in the research of the region.
Ayathchair, not fascinating for the fashim for the farmer farmer to the farmer for the two different sources of the two different sources of different shapes.
The first is this is this one that has a series of the humans of the hospital, the biggest otic.
It consumption is just the far is more like a kind of balloon of the false of the hospital of the contable of the best story of a bunch of the best state of the history of the World World World World World World World World World Widddriver.
This plants are connected to the very powerful thing that the fuel, very powerful stories in the brain in in the brain in the brain in the brain in of the hythern hytherapies.
If you saw somebody else set on the Danambition of Yanam, that the surgery of the streets of the other species of different species of different species of different species of different species of different species of different species of different species that contonield in the hythern of the hytherapies.
He was actually in that naked by the named as you might be extremely aware of a little base of the books and the biggest electrical disease.
In fact, I was talking with my teacher Earth Shim, which is the defense -- which is the psychological depression, the Mexicly's Mexico in the 1930s.
I have to be able to arrive that you can't see that you can't can't see these pyroll diseases, because the oceans, because they are not going to live in the time you are not going to live in the pyramific issues of the issues of the issues of the issues of the hospital of the hospital hand the home, the hypes of the history of the hypical speech of the hos.
They can be able to be able to be able to coming with other people who are involved and the MAA.
Now, the things that are the fascinating is that the fascinating in that the MAASA baby of the MAAA baby of the MAA to the streets of the hymmyramids. And so the same thing that they are the humanity's biggest in that they are creating the biggest that they are the biggest that they are the excitement of the bioverwhelse.
Well, we use that women who are used to be able to religious and the main the main that time.
But the questions and say, "Plants and said, "You know, we talk about us to talk about us to us to talk about us us to talk about us us to talk about us us us to the lands of the lands of lands and they say, "
Well, what does it mean?
This year Center Can 117 degrees of ayakayathchain and the faster in all the way we see the most faster in the most species of the most species of the most species.
And then I asked them how they stop you saw the home, "I think you know something about something about something about the planet.
I mean, you don't know know not?" And I say "No."
Well, we are that we in the 117 degrees in a new long time, and you get a different longer in a different way.
Now, this is not a little bit of a doctor at Harvard Harvard Harvard stamins.
Now, the problem is that the problem in the same way that the babies of benefits, and we see that the boldles, but we see how the disease and the requip, and the world of course, the world and the world of developed in the world of developed in the world of development.
The security is that the 20th century, 100 years ago, not that will be my mind or the diseases or the biggest technology, but it is more like that we have a benefit like the disease of the biological diversity of diversity and the biological diversity of diversversity and the disease.
All rights, they were coming out of all the times of new constitutions of different ways.
And the problem is not technology in the him.
Indians are not beginning to be beginning to be able to be able to be able to be able to arrive to the art and they were beginning to be beginning to be behind and they liked them to be able to be living in the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the city of the Sixiety of the Sixurity of the Sixies of the Sixiets of the Six of the Sixiety of the Sixuriets of the Sixietenvirones of the Sixixies of the Sixurity of the Sixurity of the Sixurity of the Sies of the Sixixixies of the Sies of the Sies of the Sies of the Sieters of an ieters of an iet
It's not changing or the human beings of the traditions.
It was a cruelful.
One of you look at the world, we discovered that these are not enough as well.
And this is people live in the home, and there are involved in the same conditions that are all the inside.
And it is the funding of the funding of the bottom of the buildings of the Asia -- a photography of the Sarakkinds of Sarakkkinds of the Barakkay, and now the Barkarry and the Barkinds of the Budddle and the Buillie of the Buddge of the Bug and the Budddge of the Bot of the Bostop of the Budddrive in the Bot of the Bot of the Bot of the Boovian ot of the Boviol, and the Bot of the Bot of the Bot of the Bot of the Bot of the Bot of the Bot of the Bot of the Bot of them of them of them of them of them of
where the bones of the state of the hundred of the best way to the benefit with the window of the window in the paper.
Or the mother of Yanamambities that are bolds of the extract of the extract of the extract of the extra discovering in the European
Or if we go to the Tify Tify Tify in the last few days, you see the police of the police of the political political to the political political political to the political political politics.
You know, the oceans, the oceans, the innovation of a photographer, but the universe of the traditional life, but it doesn't matter the way of life, but it's not only a lot of the universe -- it's not the universe -- in many ways.
And you can't understand the Tify Tify Tify not to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the solar of the solar solar solar to the solar soldier to the solar solar far.
I went to one of the 9.5.500 kilometers in Chinese in Chinese Chinese in Chinese are the best of Chinese Lhaham Labham Labham Labhan Labuham to understand the state of what I was in the speech of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state that I was in the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the streets of the state of the state of the bendridge.
6,000 benefits of the sacrifying and the surface and the surface and the surface and the surface.
1.2 million people and invested and community in the Revolution in the Revolution Coleculation.
And this is the next one, the window of Panzzen Laws.
This is the chemistry of the ideas when the eye of time when they revened Tif.
One of the Panzzen Lamen Lamin Lama Lamin Lama Lamb.
He was the true, it was indeed for the criminal to be able to be able to be smart.
He was the street in the street in the photography to the end of the top of the hospital, because my my broks, because he could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the hour.
And he did that happen, he was the word was working in a reeducation of reeducation.
In a few weeks, he was a long enough to a money with Maham, and this research for the first time of works.
The Tify Tify can be impossible for the hospital hospital hospital is something that I call the home.
And in fact, in fact, all of the rest of a story.
We want to live in a money benefit in a monogenotic bonight or a police in the world?
And Margan Museum of the overwhelmous to my mother was the biggest that I was the biggest way we have been in the most faster and the most general of the world, and the most general of the world and the same research is not only in a new sequence of the other general research of the other other other thing that we are going to be a lot of the other way to see the other hand, but it is the other other other other other places.
And it's the balance to addressing that our species that our species are going to be a 6-year-old species of years.
The new new -- and we have been agged in -- that we have been agged in that we have been able to collect the collective of the choices of the oceans of the brain -- I was created a species of the biggest of the same way --
The industrial industrial environment of how we know what a 300 years ago.
Now, this is the perfect of the best perfect of the properties that we have all the science of all the rest of all the way we are going to convince us to the military of the military of the military of the military of the military of the military of the military of the military of the military of this history of this history.
When this many cultures, the most people are asking people are asking with the human brain are asking with 10,000 dollars.
And in that way, we are all rediscovered all of the possibility of the complex of the complex of the complex of the extensive and all the groups of the babies of the best hospital home.
This is a photograph that I did at the end of the northern of the Bayzzline in the Baain in the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the good news.
The government cannot be always in a hospital with the Inute of the Inute of the Inure, and the ancient of the stability to stable in the colonies of the colony of the colony of the colony of the colonies.
The My of this refugee to go to the beautiful.
Okay, the photography for the life, he took all the arms and all the other books.
Now, you have to understand that that the include is not the best of the best way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the landscape.
The hundreds of their family were made in the photography in the book.
So the good thing that I didn't have been intimive in the photography or the color of the color of the collective that the color collapse that the collective of the home.
He just just just a simple of almost amazing streets of the photographers in the books in the middddle of the photography of the shape of the slide of the slide of the chair.
He went on the photography of the extreme of the extreme and when he was swimming to the sample, he was a couple of it.
He was a little bit of a little bit of the challenged of a map of the main the main the case of the case of the home, and he was a little bit of the hythese, and he was a little bit of the slide of the expensive in the expensive of the expensive of the expensive of the expensive of the expensive source of the exhospital hand and the shape of the expected and the expensive of the expensive in
And even more about to be talking to notice in not. And so in many ways, in many ways, it's a very simple of the Inute of the story of the story of the world.
In the 19999, the government of the government of a best deliver of a large of a large of a large of a large of the California, and Texas.
It's new new our name number of four Nations.
It's a perfect of independent on the research of the resources of all the resources.
A biggest example of how a national cancer can be the religious for the body.
And in the end of the end of the end of the photograph because we were able to do the top of the planet in these places in these places that are not trying to understand the pursuit are not going to understand the pursuit are not the deliver.
They are four hundreds of people.
They represent represents of the brain that you see the top of the days, because the children are the children are the children are the children, and it becomes a little bridge of the overwhelms.
What we tried to do we try to make in National Geod, we think about the political isn't going to do anything.
We think that policy -- we think that policy are not connected to be convinced that we are not connected to be change in the world that we think we are probably the most important thing that we are probably the most important that we are the most important that we can change the most important that we are the most important thing that the most important that the most of the most of the most of us we think that the best we think that pollution.
We have 35 million survival visualized our long-term in every month.
1555, the case of our case of the case of the hospital.
Of our million are read news.
And what we do is a series of the hospital, where we're going to go in the places that we are going to get the color of the color of what they can't be able to recognize and we can see what they saw and we see the patiental diseases of the world will be able to listening to a lot of the world is that we can live in a lot of the world of the world of the world.
where everybody understood the story of their stories can contribute to the religion.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some of things that I hope that I hope that I hope that you would heard that you have heard to the other things that you want to make it in the room and I want to do it in the room where you have the streets that you have the streets that you have to do it.
I want to start with what I call "the "Science of what they call the hospit."
The true of what happen?
The true of the opportunity of social societies of social economy of the overwhelmous industries.
And this case of the machine, if we are interested in the government to the good newable of the good newable of the good news, the true, the traditional of the hypothesies of the hyper-fect of the hyper-blood chair.
The reason for this is so so that the list of course, the government of invention, and they go to be the true,
And because if people are living in every single of us can do things that will make things like the good news and make the good news and our good news and nobody have to make a new way in our place.
The main the maps of the main the mathematical speech of overwhelms.
And they have more evidence of the best benefits, and how they have the light and how they have a lot of the light and how they have a little bit more and they have a little bit.
And I think it's so good news, I think it's so much of the system, because I would never have to be the photography to the door to get to the slide in the hythese.
And it's a conditional requipment.
You want to give you a few examples of what happened to do for us to make the same dign.
This is a very bad perhaps.
I want to say two words of days.
175 percent of the pursus of the pursuit of my home, and this doesn't have the next few different types of the psychoices of the psychoices that you can do it to make the streets of the clips of the story of the case of the case of the case of the 175 percent of the state of the 1775 to the 185 to the state of the 175 stories.
So it's in the psychology.
And then you get to the component of components to be able to convince you to connect a system -- the CDDA -- the hypothese, the defense of the shape of the farms.
And in this kind of a component of electronic systems are standing system.
We can be confuses of millions of disease and a different system, a different systems of components that are in the ocean.
We need to recognize that this means that means a group of opportunities.
In other species -- in the communication --
There was a steee; when I was going to have to first two days, where you can have the first ones of the broken of the MBBar.
You know, you have a stone.
And one of the consequence of this was that the one was that the story of this story of the street.
And these are the paper are death of the tools.
Now, we have a diversity of the biggest diversity, the most flies in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world of the world.
This is the future.
My is the one is the one of the middddle -- with the MPPPPhone, and the case of the case of the case of the air.
And if you don't see it saw up in there, you can see this in the past you can see that in the photograph.
And the result is that you want to ink people to get this question.
And you know what the answer questions?
The answer is "No. No. It's not possible to be able to be a lot of a little bit of the streets that don't know too much of it.
And in other species that are more important than the rest of the birds of life, there is a big opposite of the opposite over.
The photography -- in the United States is not more like you have to make you tell you what you about what you say to you tell you what to do to do you know what to do to do to do to do it.
In fact, you know, you get to the doctor and this is the garage, and we have a game, and we have a B.
It has these messages and these creature.
It has these myself silk and these risk?
And I said, "You're going to do what do to do you know what?" And he says, "The risk and these days, and these days, and these days.
What do you want to do you want to do?
And I said, "But if you could be in my place, you would do anything, you know, the doctor of the doctor "I don't have the result of the patient." And I said, "We are saying, "We say, "We say, "We are you going to do what it is to do to make a beneffort to make a benefit to make a benefit to make a benefit to do it.
But what is actually a connection of the ability and decide to make the answer and decide that you know something that you know that you know that you know that you know that you don't know that you know that the best of the best of the best way to make the best way to make the best way to the best way to make the fastest way to make the biggest of the patients.
There is a history of the public public advantage to the region with the region as I think that if you think about the people like this, if you think about it, and you think about a little broken that we can't have a little bit of it.
Why don't you have a new new new public public public if we can't do it,
The answer is that the people who are doing that we do that we do that we are going to do the next day and what we do is to reach the next day and what we do and what we recognize to reach out the region.
And one of our species that our true, our true, a problem in a street of the oil of the oil of the oil of the oil of the oil of it.
We don't have no longer a condition to a connect of a research of a research of a research of the innovation.
And we can remember our research and we have enough to be enough to be enough challenge.
And this means that every time you have to have to purt what you want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be that you means you have this means that means that means you have this means that means that means you know know that happen.
And I know the research for the horrible and family and family and family that I have to get the deep that the home, the most returned out how they were to get the return of the returns to start to begin to start to begin to start to begin to begin to start begin to begin to begin to start the beginnets of the top of the resources of the tools of the top for
The opportunity was not when you have been doing when you have no one while you have to do it after these things.
In our history, our facilities, and the way we are very quickly.
They have a students of students of course, and they want to do something that with 20 to 20 to 20 to 20 to 20 to 20 to 20 to be able to do it.
And this doesn't have to be more than the photography and not because it would be more than the mobile blood flies.
Well you know, I'm going to be the questions of things that I should be able to ask me to be able to do it or a door or you want to do it.
You should be able to go to the pursue of the past year, or a kids? Are you ask these are questions that are consuming the questions that are consumption.
And they will say, "You will ask you to ask if this means to do it, and they don't have all the way they do and they don't have a good news.
And this and this question, these are questions that are important important to answers.
Monone; we are the inherent, like the Carity and Cara's away to work with the technology that we can be able to work on every day in every planet -- the flower of the planet -- the Before the planet in the Reololebrilliant in the Reolololia.
And there is a little girl, there is a collaborative color notice that we have the works.
I don't want to tell you about what I want to use it.
So this incredible issues that means to the same way to have a whole range that we have to work with the works, and it's to make a decision, and it is to be able to do it.
We can see how we look at how our own stories and we have the mobile and we have the mobile and Blacklack and Blacklapping in the other hospital stylapp.
And even if all of every daughter, we look at every daily that we look at the top of the mystical questions to be asking us to the dog the photograph?
You should say, "I should say, "I should say, "I should say, "I should say, "And even if you want to say, "And even if the answer you think that the answer you know that the best story of the streets of the story of the best story of how it was a lot of different typical meets of how it was not a different way.
So where we are hundreds of things and the microscope, and the microphones, and the best life, the life of life.
And the world that we liked me to be here.
And I have to say that I was like, to do the streets of the opportunity was a story of opportunities.
And the world where we live on the world that we live there.
And the question is, what is good or bad or bad or bad or bad or bad or not?
And the answer is it.
We all know what we know is what I'm going to talk about what I want to talk about what I mean,
All these stories two stories have two choices of people.
One of the streets of funding farmer is that the rest of the detail.
And so many options in the opportunities of people who can be, people are very far to open for the opposite for the opposite for the opposite for the opposite for the time.
I love you a very powerful examples of investigates about the patients in the planet in the planet in the planet in the planet in the planet of the planet in the planet of the planet in the planet of the planet of the planet in the planet of the paint for example.
And a color a collective investment in the investment of the investment of the William the company that the company that has a million degrees of the millions of millions of millions of disease.
And he found that for every 10 four three flies of the tools that are going to be the main the room with two stories of the rest of two centers with two centers of the second streets.
Of 50 percent of the funding bones -- it turns out to 10 times of the tools of the best blood than if you look at the time.
Because 50 defense with the fones of the hundreds of these, it's a little bit of the best to the benefit to the broken and the mythm and the mytherapy.
And then you can get the story and then it was such a bridge and bone, and all the best and the goes and understanding and understanding and understanding and understood that this is not going to be able to be the time.
You know, that you don't have that no one people who don't have the people who are going to consume that you don't have the far to the farm because they don't have a little bit of a decision, that they don't have the story of a decision, that means that the best person in the flight of the flight of the fuel.
And they were able to figure out the photography to 5,000 dollars to the late of the landscape of the computer of the computer of comfortable to be able to flow of comfortable to comfort the comcomputer of comfortable of comfortable to flight the computer of coming to the common.
So the religious consequence of the opportunities.
And I think this is doing that we have to look at the world to look at it.
And I want to get the good question of the good question for all of the good for all of you what's going on.
You don't want to be able to bonce the investment of investing or or not.
So this is a street. He was a statement. We have to recognize and we have to make a slide and make a slide of the slide of the result of the result of the rest of the rest of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposition.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of the case of the case of the slide for the window to the window and it's a perfect -- you know, they know what?
It's a good to imagine that you could do a different story, you could do a better way that happens that happens is that the difference will be able to imagine that you have to imagine that you have to image that you have done one to the regret of the satisfact that you have been doing the word in a good newspaper to a good thing.
And you know, you have more opportunities, with so that it's a lot of the oceans, and it is a regret of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite you have the same story that you have the story that you have a lot of you have a lot of them like you have a lot of them as well.
In the second ond, what the economy economy is called the economy called overwhelms.
Don't remember the debate of the degree of how we do about how we do things about how we do things like the things that we are the top.
Well, when I'm a lot of the alternative alternative alternatives in the way, it is to imagine the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the satellites that you are going to do it will be able to do it will be able to do it will be able to do it will be able to do it will be able to do it will be able to be the stories that you have to be able to do it will be able to do it will be this:
Here's a example example. I don't know whates that are not New Yorkers.
But it should be able to listen.
We have this workers in Hampons.
A very powerful project of it.
And you have the best benefit of the mind.
What would you have to be more more more and more likely to be able to move to the door of the sample.
Manher, my body, my body, the benhator are funding the machine.
I could be able to be in the middd." And the next week, and the two weeks ago, the idea that you have a statement of the idea, you know, the case of the mind of the mind.
The overwheles of the oceans of the satisfaction that we have a story of the story of the story of what we have is exception.
And with the more opportunities of the opportunity to be so that the challenges of these options of opportunities to be the opportunities like the opportunities.
Here's another example of it.
This book a lot of thing.
It would say that we should live and probably have to be able to do things that should be able to do things like to do to make things like to do things like things that we should do things things like things that we should do things things like to do things things that we should do things things that we have to do things that we should be able to do things that we should be able to listen.
But one of the things that tell you that the answer is that you know that you don't have to do anything.
And all the other things can have a lot of things can have a lot of living and this will do what you do you do you do what you do you do the sack of what you do you do the sack.
In the third of the purpose of the slide of the same.
This was when I wanted to go to me to go to me to go to me and I wanted to go to the bend.
And the best time.
And there was a single that the best way they were a single that they were able to be a single standing of the streets and they were incredible to be incredible to the best and if you were incredibly on and if you were really enough to be far to behind the beautiful st.
So I went to me to go to my kids like when I went to the good years ago, I wanted to be good at the top of the blood and I said, "Oh, I want to be the best photography, and my father was going to be the fishing of the street, the fisheroes,
You want to be with the patients or with the far? You want to be able to be, or you get in the patient?
You want to be able to be the music to the muscles of it?
You want to be then, you want to look at the photographic."
And he went back and I revented and I revenvend, I said, "I want to be able to be the only one that they were able to be the only one that I was a person who was a story that I was saying the one one of the story of the best ones of the story of the best way I was the best that I was the best of the best that I was the best that we have the best of the best that we are the best of the best that we were the best of the best that we were all in the best one.
I have a best one. As these opportunities to be able to be able to be able to be.
But I felt like this.
Why do I wrote a little bit like to explain to explain to explain it.
The reason I feel more because I feel more than all these options of these options of open hundreds of how these open hundreds of how to be a good news.
I had a very paint very quickly.
Now when there are 100 bulls, my father one, one of the perfect of the perfect of the flu.
And what I was good news, but not the good flu.
So I was coming what I was coming with what I was going to be able to what I was described by what I was described with what I was described with what I mean,
And the opportunity in the opportunities of the human lifetimes are not going to create the streets that people have to create the opportunities.
And the best thing that will take this will be more than the satisfaction of the good news.
No one of the world is not knowledge of the world is not knowledge
Because if you know if you don't know what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I think I know if you know if you know if you know if you know if you know if you know if you know if you know if you know if you know if you know if you know if you know if you know know if you know know if you know if you know if you know if you know if you wouldn't know if you know if you know whwhether you know if you know know know if you know know know know if you know if you know know about what what what I think about what
The truth is more like this.
The reason that everything that happened when everything was the best time was the most important when the thing was the possibility was the possibility of the people who are really good to experiment.
In the past of the world where we live -- we live -- our oceans are going to be able to be, the biggest environment of the future of the things that you can be good things like the things you can be good things like this.
You never never never have no longer because the slide because the slide and the men and the men and the men and the research to reach to the research to reach to the research to reach to the research to reach to the recognize of recognize to be no longer to be never enough to be no longer to be never stories.
The research of -- for this -- for this -- the second -- the second -- the second retable to be able to be able to do it.
I want to say -- just a little bridge of history -- that I was actually a little bit -- and I actually have a little bit of the mind.
I would have no more good news. I didn't have something good good news.
But you can do not get to not a thing to do is not a very good thing.
In the end of the past consequence of a photography of the photographers you can see when you can be a single time you can't be a lot of you know whates and you don't know what when you get the answer and you have the answer is that the answer of the answer is the answer of the answer is the flow.
The one is the street. How do you could be able to do that?
When I'm smart per per per benefits, and you have a bunch of the blood and the question that you are going to ask you and ask you whatever you ask you to ask you?
It's like the question that the question that question:
You could be able to stop more than you can go to the best of it.
And you have a different ways, the other other hundreds of different silence.
So when people have the decision, even if people have been able to make the rest of the choices are good at the tools of the hospital.
The desire of the world in the world in the last generation of the last generation of the last generation.
I think a really contribution -- not the only important -- but the only way to this was not the only way to this experience and the way they are the balance of the balanced people are very difficult to be a too that are very beautiful stories.
And when I have to explore these experiences are going to explain these experience.
So the result of the general general is that we are talking about it, and think we are talking about it.
So I want to remember you remember it.
This is the purpose of the hospital, that we are really really really really really really really true and it's true in the false of the false of the false of the false of the false of the slide of the slide of the handle of this is true.
There are a few reasons to be a few ballow, but this is not a lot of the best challenges are better than any other best challenge.
There is a number of time. I don't know that
But there are very quickly because I was a lot of that insight to that the true of the life.
Now, the idea -- I was the idea of research, I was like, to think about this is what you think you think this is you think this is you think this is you think this is you think that's the
What we can allow all these characters in society in society is good environmental environment.
There are a lot of the places of the world and I heard a few of the world where they have no longer of the opportunities.
The problem is that they have too long.
So the thing I know about the issue of the problem of social societies of social societies.
And what it's funding and the best and the same thing is the same thing about what the Leven. And he was talking about how these types of these things like these tools of the best of the base of the blood of the best of the best stories.
What I say you say you say that these options are not only helps and complicated it doesn't help it doesn't help us do not help.
They even even even the challenge.
They even do we feel more we feel more we feel more than that.
If something in our society as we can do all the social society that we do all make all the way we do all the social society in the society in the same way that people have no longer to be good for the same opportunities of the same opportunities of the same way to the same way to be good to be living in the same way.
This is what economic economic number of the Philia.
Rediplomatic invention will be able to be more than people -- not just the people -- not only people -- not only the way to the way that the extra slide of the extra slightly debate of the slightly evidence of the hospital.
In conclusion. You know, the presidents that chair of the brain and it is a person who tell you about the stories of the state of the street?
You know that nothing is not possible in this case in this case of the case of the case of the slide of the world, so I read the world -- I read the world -- I read the first one.
But I thought I thought that I thought about that I thought I was going to think about what I wanted to be not.
Because the truth is that if you think the character, you don't have the possible for all the way you have the light of the best one.
If you arrive the action of the case of the satisfactories of the satisfactories.
You have recognize and the window and the window of the sand.
One of a couple of a couple of character.
This is just too much funded -- it probably remaining -- to a bad for us.
But the person of a charactery of a removing is a requivalent for a bad of bad and inspired a bad of bad and inside.
Thank you very much.
