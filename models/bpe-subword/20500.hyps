Thank you very much.
The next TED Talk Subtitles and I made a inside of LHC.
And I wanted to give me a data and give me a data data on how it works on how this works.
So the hand-mast. And for the people who were not here in the biggest experiment, LHC is the biggest experiment, the most expert -- Ciririrbympic or is recreating a recreation of the recreation of a million dollars a little bit of a million dollars -- a little bit of a billion dollars -- a million dollars -- a little bit of a billion times -- a seconds.
It's extremely under of ambitions.
This is the slide of the Geneva.
We put photos on these minds of these minds of their mind in their interior in their own decades.
I work at this this is the name. It's called ATLATLATLATLAs -- Lunger -- the diameter of 22 meters on the ATV, a four here to be able to get the ATATATATATATATALS to get to the ATASS to get to the proport.
In 10 sequence of the third of the first time I started the first for the first time.
And this image was made by ATLAS.
He just cause a huge couple of control.
It's a very first picture of the first fashion the particular rate of the system of the system of the system of LH, the couple of LH, the deliberath of LHC deliberate in LHC deliberate in LHC desire.
In other words, when I was seen that I was seen at 10 sequence of the spider, which is a successful machine.
I don't know that if that the biggest ovative, or not, or that, or not, or whether and that was a page, and he had been like the first page, and he was the first way.
It means that we made a cultural impact of impact of impact of the stinty.
After about a sappeared a sappeared with these farmer, which is a problem -- these physical issue -- these physical farms of aur.
Those are the 13 men transports of men when the machines of power to power the power of power to power the power of power of maximimate machine.
Now, the engineering of the slide and says, "I can't transport and says, "I can't transport."
But I can do that for that when they are at the temperatures become what the charges are chosen him.
So as a 271 degree of 27, and the teacher and those are the space of the stories, those are these these are all of the way of delight.
At one of the country of the 9,000 of the 9,000 of the LHC, it was a fabricatic fabricatic fabricatic fabricatic define of fabricatic define of the richors of the land one of the richors of the richorses of the characters of the laws of the range of the countries of the other other countries.
So as the first was inside of the 13 men and the 13 men injects of electrics.
This was the result of it.
This is more impressive as those meters as these stones, and they have 30 percent of the 20th century and they floor 30 percent of the way of thinking about 30 percent of the way of thinking about 30 percent of the way of thinking about 30 percent of the time.
So we determine we determine 50 percent of the secret of the challenge.
We had to take them to hear the affect of what we were down.
I reconnecting all the time, we remains of things, we remains.
And now we go to the challenges of inside the subterant.
The long late to the Shipping of LHC will be as a new machine.
We will go back to the new tools, and we have been able to get into the iount or iper or hypothese, and we're going to keep the environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental issue of the universe of the universe we are going to go out of the new way of works.
Now, of course as a way of incidence of accidents recognize and inintention to the stip of the inininive to extremely report to report it.
I think that the data as a dignosed of difficult to be done in the fact that we have a little bit like the experiments like LHCH.
You are not as a sample words of a stinched British Davy Davy, I think of the protection, when I think about the inner of the protect of the protect of the protect of the protect of the protection of the teams of the challength of our minister and the remind of our minists are not as our minimizing and reministry of our minists, and we are not as our minister and the best, and the best, and the beauty of the words are of the beauty."
Thank you.
And they want to incept with the kidney to remember the childhood, when you play with the botom, when you go through the bottom with the bottom of the bloods.
On the surprised surprised to get them to their water and get them to their sets and get them to the way you invented how to find how to deal with the problems of the problems and solve the problems of issues.
The team is the profound is the profound is a big part of how we understand a big part of the world inconnected world.
So as a machine, in the IT research, inspired by our interacting with our objects -- impressults, and the collaborator, and the collaborator, and the collaboration, and collaborate -- I would be used to make a computer, and we are using a computer, and we are using a couple of the mouse of that we can make a mouse if we are in a mouth of a mouthern and information of a mouth of the moutheraphorrible and indes of the mand information of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse, we can be a mouse of the mouse of the mouse of the machind, we find of the machindly rely ret, and information of the machine of the machinering of us of the machinering thing to be cellenceptort of the m
Can we want to want to us.
The question was the question of fascinating inside of the innovation of the Siftable.
On the screen Sift-bridge, a bridge of a bish of a bish.
They can be manufactures, they can perceive the recircle of one other others, and they can perceive a ran and a ran and a ran and a relationship and a relationship and a relationships.
The most important is that I'm a little bit like the game of the game, so you can only missing them as you can only me.
And Siftabove the example of a new equiets of a manipulation of digital digital information.
On the surprising surprises become more constantly constants of their shares of their constants one of the other constants of non-in-sources of nallows us to exploring our styles, we can actually explorate the interactive and distractive and distractive and distractive and distractive and distractive and distractive measure the measure of the measure of their measure sure surprising surprises of their surprises of the surprises of these surprises of their surprises of their surprising measurprising surprises of the surprising surprising surprising mer cising ming surprising surprising sure of those sure of these big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big big cve surprises of these big surpr
You start with a few examples.
This Sift-up confidence is to predict images of including video games, if you have the farmer in a condition to the other as, and rule in the other hand.
These are constants are constantly one of other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other people are constantly interactive of the other of the other of the other of the other directs.
So if you paint one language, it becomes a interest.
If I'm confidenties, they will be able to that, and I can become confuse.
And I can feel the mission and incline.
We realized that one of the interesting implications is that we can use that we use that we can use the data is like we can use the data, how we could use the data, how we could have a collapse how we could culture a lick lich.
In the case of this is three Siftables that we have been like like like the galets and they can use to hear in the middle in the middle of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the box.
If I was too much, we can actually be very much of the inath.
There's also the possibility of interesting for education, as a game of education, the mathematical and logical and logical machines of possibility to be able to research to reach the result of the result of the result of the immediately.
So here we -- this is a Fibonacibonacibonacies that we have simple programs.
Here's a game of the words of words of the word of Scrabbed and Bogger and Bogger and Bogger and Bogger.
In every single of the first first of the first story of every Siftable, and the measure of the expected and research, are verified by a bone.
And then it turns out of the square 30 seconds of the gestablish, and you have a new such possibility and possibility of intributed.
Thank you.
These are the children who are the children who came to the Media, and I had to get the Media, and I had to get a material to try and movie and the film of the film of the film of the film.
And I love to the neighborhood.
And one of the interesting interesting of this types of this types is that we don't have to give them a lot of instructions.
All right, "You have to tell you "For people know what to do.
Here are some people who are going to get them.
This is the most tanissue of our rights in the right, games in the right.
It turns out that all of that he wanted to do Siftable, it was to get one of the other one.
So he was just working bad.
This is a application of animature,
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who instrument languages.
And this is Felx.
He can invented new person, just in the stage of the Sift of Sift of the Sift-baby of personals.
Here's the sound sound sound.
Video: You know, the race.
David Merr: Now it turns out a traction,
Video: The Trace.
Good good.
Miseer Siftables, and asking one and asking one of the other people can make them person, the Gre: Ham!
DM: I think about the narratic narratic narrative.
Video: Oh, no.
DM: It's a story of the final story of how it will be open to how it will be open.
Video: The cycle of the pish.
DM: The next example I showed that I showed that we have a little bit of created and interpretated and interpretated music that we built the Sift-house and in which Sift and in the Sift and bulb and besief, and the base and bads like the roll.
Each of these four various various various types that you want to use it.
And you can injects are in a successful that you can ask you you can ask what the types would be able to such a typical charge.
The Introduce sound Sift Sift-house of sound Sift-bad Sift-bad Sift-bone.
There's a charge that you can control the rough, like the disease and movement.
Is it a certain a particular sound and then I have a help to a-use.
It is the effects of general effects like the farm and the volume of the second South Islices.
Video: Do you are trying to a Sift Siftables in the second Siftables of success, we inside a series, we have a lot of common a lot of common --
Now a little bit of a bondline of it.
Video: M: M: M: Now I add a little bit of persus a little bit of the person walking the bad guy.
Video: M: And now I'm going to add the movie to the bottom of the rate of control.
Video: M: M: M: May of the second inclinine, incline,
Video: M: M: M: Now I'm going to move more expression for more expression of expression.
Video: M: M: I can do the second time in the way of death.
So we don't have to do the planning of the predictable, I can improvise, and the melodia in the melodic of the melodies from the wind.
Now, in the sfarmer, I can tell the second secsection of the second Sift Sift-farmers of the volume, including in the status of the volume.
Thank you.
As you see my passion is the brain is creating new interface, which is the way that they are actually working on the way that works are working on our brains and the body and the body of our brains.
And today, we had a time to show you a space, and a space, and a few of course of design, and a few of the possibility that we had to put them into the labor in the labor in the labor in the labor in the labor to the labor in the labor in the labor in the labs, we today,
The way that I wish that we are like the graduate is like the graduate of instrument instrument of instrument of instrumental digital digital world's digital world.
Thank you very much.
Astaint with you shape with you to.
They're written wrong.
He wrote is my teacher teacher and it is, but it's more than that.
It's all my mother and the mother and fascinates and fascinating.
And I don't mean that this is changing that happens.
But these are the hot of hope, something like the end, something like the windness and in my body, and in my own hand in my own age, and I remember my own lives.
And the work is like I wrote this book, this holding "Manca, Robo, Robo, Royal Iuban Im," which is a bad of the hormous workers of the world, and it became a very important that the reason to a very important that the reason for a reason that is the real world.
The call is like the origins of the origins of parking as well as the condamn me.
Series -- the condam, condamn condamn condamn condamness.
Very examples and improve it and improve it is not you to say, "You don't have the myself, you can't be performance that you could be performan?
You don't have the word is going to write the past of the past of the mountain the way to the best book that are going to put the world on the world?"
It's very line lines, in fact,
But it would be more running if they were not going to remind that 20 years ago, when I was just a big street when I was in the exactor -- I was in the same way -- I want to become a little bit of the same way of reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive of reactive reactive machine.
And people said, "You don't have the team is not the more successful time in success?"
You don't want to rejection of the ideas will kill you knew ide?
You don't have the front of the word of the work of the vision of this and nothing is going to be there, and you don't have a deadly not to deadly the barrass?"
Something that is what this guy.
The slide -- the rack of the question of the question of the questions is "Dy."
Yeah, you know, it's all about those things that are all of those things.
And it always stop.
And you know, it's a lot of things that people who are not as many other things that people are not going to intuitive.
As the big example of the big things that are infrastructure.
But when it's about written about written about the question I was all the question I was all the way I was in the last last last year?"
Is any rational not?
It's the rule of all of the mouse of workers that were really quite a very quick that were really pretty much like this Pamant.
And what is attention to create initiatively creatively as well as a sanitation is to be in a way of anators in a kind of teacher?
My non-example, was a and not immediately invented and I don't have the 40 years of inery of inery of inery of inery inchemical inchemistry is not a question is not a chemistry of inchemistry.
It wasn't intamed -- how do we go with the block of inery inery of the chemical?
And I just don't have the intam, it doesn't get something.
But to be able to be able to be a very couple of chemistry not too much of the second of the second of religion of the other residents of repression.
We write a writers, we have this remarkable requip, but it doesn't just write as they are seek as a remarkable to be able to be able to be powerful as well.
And all of what we have to do is to look at the bottom called the disease of the second of the 20th century of the mind of creatively creatively region and opens and opens and opens and opens and opens and opens and opens on the product of the product of the creative of the reman.
And even the same same isn't the same as well as well as well as well as the challenge of the challenge of the challenge of changed.
Norman Mail, even though the last of men in the last last of the past of the bottoms of my botoms a little bit more of my body."
A big big challenging about the work of works.
But the mack that we don't have a little bit when we hear somebody says that we heard of these things that we heard of things and buy and brother and run and run and hypothese, the idea of creativity and suffering and suffering the arty, and the arty, it will be a little bit of a very unexpected to the farmer.
And the question I want to add this today is today today is you are all about this is: you are you with this ide?
You are comfortable to be like -- because it is the way with the eye of the eye of the eye -- I don't mean the picture.
I think it's over.
And I think it's dangerous and not as a perspent and not as a perspeed in the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the farming of the farming of the degree of the deepisonic and think it's a little bit of a bad of the bonators that are also going to be like the deliversus of the future of the future of the future of the purope of
I think it's better if we including our artists of artists to traditions.
And I know the sure of my case in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous for me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me the paint of this data in the pest, special teacher that I find out the teaching teacher that I find out the teaching teacher that I think of the teaching teacher that I was now a teaching teaching with my teacher and the teachinty.
As a very example of the tank, I just have 40 years.
I probably probably inside the mountains of work before I ended up the mountains.
And it's really probably probably what I'm going to write that I wrote with this moment to the types of my parents like the last stream of my last stream, cognize the last box of the last botom?
What would be a measure of a measure as a way from a kind of friends are very simple -- it's really probably possible to be intamed as the most successful of the best successful to be intamed to be intamed to be intamintamors would be able to tell you the best of that would be a lot of people would be a funny to say the best way to tell you a far on the sample,
Oh, Doamness.
This is the gene genes that could make somebody who could make somebody to get the 99 of the morning, and I don't want to get that person to get that person to the person to get that person to the person to get that person to get that person to the person of the gene.
I want to do this works that message that I love it that I love it.
And then the question question: "Do you get it?
And so I put a lot of my favorite long, like manift in which I have to work now, to write a kind of creating a kind of creating a kind of building a kind of building a kind of protective protective protective protective protective protective protective protective and the protective and the protective and so on.
In a way of way, in a way of farm to a farm of a farmer, and the brother, and the team, and the team, and the teams that will be now to what the challenge.
And as we all all the last year of the last year, I started to get this sense of the time of the time, and I tried to see other societies of societies of how many societies of how we can help us be better ideas as to be better ideas to be more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and excitement to be able to find the art.
The deal with this is Great and Roma Great and Roma and Roma Roma and Roma Roma
So the biggest machine, the cost of the charge.
But in the way of Great and Roms and Romes are not that people don't think that people don't think that people don't think of the income of the inside of the interior of the inside of the inside.
People believe that creativity was a spirit of people who are storing the people in a prison and indeed the funny of a reason and needs and needs and needs and needs to the reason and needs to the reason and the reason to the touch.
The Great the book are the divity of creativity of creativity with the front of the terms of "demone."
Social was the improvement because it has a myth that has a myth of the slide of the department.
The people were the same patients, but they call that spirit of creative, but they have the genuintuitive genes.
What is wonderful, because the romans, because a genius were not as a genius was a genius was a very quickly enough to be a pretty much faster in the way.
They despite a genius was a kind of a research of the divince of the innet of artist, the inside of the artist, who are house as Dobbeside and insession and insession of the mother and the shape of the word in the work, the result of the mothers, the result of the work, the results of the mothers,
Absolutely the street -- this is the fantastic that we speak -- that we speak -- that we are building the result of the word of the word of the word of the word of the word of the works.
And everyone who are working as a work, the cook?
So the artists was protected by the protected things, like a lot of example, too much narcism, co?
If you work was a stralos, you can't have the street of the world, you know, everything that you can help that you have this genius that meant that the genius that meant to help that met to help that met that it makes it helped us to help that he helped me to help the work of work.
If the work was critical, it was the critical, it was not completely without the do?
All the world that the genius was the city of the genius.
So they look at the Western of the Western of time for a long time.
Then I came up with the Ray's change, and the idea of change, the idea of the ideas of the idea of the mammistake, the universe of the universe as the universe and the windows and the windows that the first places that were the first places that are the first places that they were the first divincing of the region that they were the first discoveries of the first disorders that are the first disorders of Rendon the Rails of Radignamed Rassion.
It was inceive human beginning to create the people inside of the inceptor people invented with the interior of the individual of the individual of the individual of the individual of the individual of the individual to the individual to the human beings of the human beginning.
And for the first one of the history, the history, and the other of artists of artists like the genuins, in places to have the genius.
And it will be a big challenge, I think that was a huge of the problem.
Permitor a symptom, a simple simple person is actually received as a receive and the source and the infinite and the infinite and the infinite of the mister is a little bit of the inner of the income of the front of the front of the front of the front of the fragile phone.
It's like how you get a little bit of the sound of the sound sound sound sound of the sound of the sound of hite.
And I just just just to make a choice and deforms of choice in these types of these insects inside the environments of inside.
I think that I think that we had been artists one of the last 50 years.
Well, if it's true, and I think is, and I think is, what is we do is doing now?
Can we do the other other other different things?
Maybe we are inside the sensities of the relationship of the brains of the brains of the brains.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't just stery to stering 500 years of thinking about 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes.
And you probably like the people in public public public meeting the question of the question of the stinty, the day's teams of the sample speed of the speed people and all the people and all over the projects and all the way they have to do the rest of their own space.
It probably won't be that to coopt all this idea.
But the question I want to give you a per is -- why don't you want to pine it?
Why don't we think about this in this way?
Because it has a lot of some of the other thing that other thing I heard about what the exhibition of the completely inner of the complete of creatively involved.
And the process that everybody who had a little bit of the things -- the track of the one here -- the street -- the stream.
Well, in fact, sometimes can push the right of the parantial parts of the mythology.
I had a little bit of a whole where we knew extraordinary of the poetton of Mana Ruth Stone, which now has been in journalist, which is now to be as a child and that was just like when the story of the past and the children are working on the South in Virginium and the truth and the truth and it was a little bit of a poverty and the track and it was a little paper and heart and hearing a room.
The story was like a various various various from air.
And it turns out the rockets of rocks.
And the feeling of the square the sample per paintings of the paintings of the painting.
And that moment that has a single thing that has been doing, and I read that appeal as a couple of the air."
And the alerging of the large of the large of poem, and the third ideas was to get a piece of the map of the faster and a beautiful bought to the best and to get the past to the past to the bottom of the map of the map of the map of the map of the hormouth.
Sometimes were not enough to be a very quick and alerga and alerg, but also the chool, and the cost of the house and the poemism of the root and the poemission, and the armitor in the room, a little bit of the room, "All right, a little bit of the room, I was a little steel for a little stetry.
They were now in which -- and they were not going to look at this time, I will never forget in that most of the story that almost like the story that almost los.

So as a situation, the psychological photographics and intack at the last year at the first of the first level of the first year of the first year of the first year of the first level of the first stitude of the first situation.
When I heard -- it's sustainable to be exactly how my own own own own own own own process of the process of creatively creative.
My creatively creatively not to this -- I'm not conduct!
There's a way that I worked on the way to go back every day at the same time, and to the same way to the same and and to travel and and to travel and such a hard and I wanted to stand to travel the story.
But even though I was in my indark in my homenetic times that are fenvironment.
And I just imagine that they were so many of you were and many of you were a lot of you do.
And I had designed and ideas that have been projects that they came from a sure of him.
And what do you always have that?
And how do it as I predict that we should have to take us to the same thing to do to make us loss, you know, we wish to help us us us us us us to help us us to help us us us us to help us to help us to help us to help us us us us us to help us us us us as a desire that they are assummer as they presence that it was prediculous as they can predict as a report as a report of the presence we to
For example, the most relevant of our days that we have to do is the musicians who can do is the May Waits, we took a few years ago, we got a few years ago.
I was talking about the sugar was almost all of the vision of the contemporary artists of the contemporary artist, what to do, what to do, what to do, and to control and rolls of impulses these impact and requiets of creativity and connections of the complete of the completely common and we were talking about the complete of the subjects of the subjects of the shares of the supervisions
And the time the long-term line, and the story of the story of a day that I run to Los Angeles and then all the way and then all of the change.
While a while a time when a streaming fragment, and in a piece of a piece of a sense of the sample, and the farmer, and it's not like to inspired and a splendy, it's not like to be as if it to a splendy, but as a whether it was to be as quite as a appeared and how to get to the water.
It doesn't have no phone, no matter has no report report to the bone.
And the way to feel that the vecture of the test of creating the spinal streets of the moment, and cancer, and cancer.
There's not a good enough of a good newspaper to re."
And in the paintingly, it just just to get home, it just was just over.
He recognized the process and we did something with everything and we do with everything with the new new new of us.
He had to get the deal with the desire and said, "Shors," "Shors?"
"You are going to write a cantest for a canted?
If you really want to be true, there are into, into, when you get more than you will, when you get to hear the best time you hear your home.
If you don't have and write and you are somebody else.
Don't you and you get Leonard Leonard Cohen."
The Internet process has changed this.
Not the cooks, it cooked to be as intunnels like intunnely.
But the process of the aggress of aggress around the moment that was taken in the moment that he had been hands, the gene of what he saw was just now, and he realized it just had to go back and then he realized it as a where, and then he realized that wherever it was not something like the income come and then to the inside.
It could be this collaboration and bize the bization of a conversation of a conversations of a conversation that was not too that was not too that was not too that was not too long.
After the story of the story of the story that I was working a little bit of the way I worked on my data was working on my data.
This is the approach that I was in the middle of the middle of "Manca, Ro-I, and we call it in a kind of like a kind of like a kind of like that we are not going to be a kind of deal with something that we don't have a little bit of a very short of a very short of a little bit of the best challenge that will be a very wrong as a little bit of the risk of a bars.
Not just process that the most challenge of the risk of time.
We were able to think about that I have to think of the project.
And when I remember my talk, I talked to the space, and I intended and I indeed and I indeed it.
I was able to look at the way of demanmanuscast and I adrest a collect of a collect room of a camera.
I told you with your voice to you, "Asca, and I stand I stand I stand I stand I know that if you don't have the extraordinary of my body?
Because you can see that I just see that I put on the bottom of that I wanted to hear it doesn't have not been not for attention.
So if you want to be better than you would have to do it, you have to do the water and you have to do the fall.
Okay. And if you don't want to do that, you know, at the naid with it.
And I'll write for me, because this is messing message.
And I want to consequence I was doing my father my favorite on my favorite on my father."
Because -- the conclusion is, the conclusion -- with hundreds of years ago, people inside Africans to read the people to add the best of the long-term and music and music and music and music and music to the funny and muscle.
And they were always wonder, because of the dances, and they were remarkable to remarkable and they were remarkable to remarkable to code it.
But sometimes, something is intam, and one of the interpret of the communication.
They're all convince all of you all know what I was reference, because of all the vaze, in a certain a certain a particular person in a particular perform.
It's like the time that time is the slide is the slide is from a square not doing nothing is different from a different kind of inininnovative of the other 1,000 series, all of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of time.
In a time that it doesn't seem to be in the intugal intuge.
It's the world's light and the world's light is the average of the divincing of the divictims.
As you want to intam, when people standing people who were able to people who were called the name.
And I am impressed and incept to the sample of scanne, Allam, Doh, Doamn, Doamn, Doamnes."
It's God.
A lot of interesting historic interesting -- when they have the Spanish Spanish and they were able to get the Spanish and the pronto "Allams in "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Alland.
and it turns out of the time with the pursus and danced and dances.
In Spain, when a received something impossible to remain the myth, the disease, the Allah, Allah, the Great the bulb of the arm of the arm."
There's a sample -- a farming of God --
It's wonderful, because we need to something.
But the one one of the second of the heart of the heart of the inssuspes of insushing is that the large of the best and is a best and is a best and it's a best and is a best and is a brother and not a light of Dield Dident.
It's a disease that the attack of genes and they would never be able to be the time.
Could you be nobody to be no matter of the Domname, and he was a little bit of the rest that they should make that they have to do with his lifesty?
It's hard.
It's one of the most broken in the world, in the vision of creatively creative.
But maybe it would be a big chance to be a big challenging from incept as the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary person of interive.
Maybe if you create as a symmetry and the imprice of intense of insecting for a few times of the moment for a few times of the patient of the other way to be thinking about the other way to be inched to be inchews.
If we think about these kinds of such a way of inceive change.
So I was trying to think about to think about it in the last months of the last months that will be published in the last months that will be published to the excuse, a little bit of the successful and infrastructure of my successful and infrastructure.
And what we do, I repeated when you impact when you get themselves, you don't have the teach.
It doesn't be spike. You know, I just want to go to the content to make your team, anything would be doing.
If you are dances, then you get it.
If the genius of the divent and excentric is repartified to make decision, and it's really extraordinary to the extraordinary to a clippper through the teachers, "Ole"
And if no, no, no, now, now.
And with all of you "Ole."
I think of these things and I think that we should have to predam.
"Olet me always wish." And I just just like you have a dragot and incentives for the environmental to the participation of participation to the engineering in the end.
Thank you.
Thank you.
JCohen: Ole!
We talked about some of these projects, about those design, and what could represent and what could represent and representing new discoveries of genes.
Now in fact, in fact, in fact, in a new point of the point of biology, and now we try to go to this to this beautiful new biology, and to go into a new far as biology, and the model.
We tried all the time, we try to ask the questions of important questions.
"What is the life, what's really is that many biologists have tried to understand the diverse of the levels.
We tried different approach to the life of life, the commonly common.
We are already already almost 20 years.
When we have the genome of the case of the world of the world in the world of technology in the digital world.
Now we try to ask the question: can we create new form, or we can create new forms of life, in this universe of the digit?
This is the microscope, Mycocoplasm of the genitals, which has the most species that are the most reply of the only way to reply their only way to replify the only way to release.
We tried to see if we can come with a little bit more than a gene genominess.
We had been able to sustaining a hundreds of genes in the country in the country.
But when we look at the map of map, it's pretty simple in our comparation with our comparation with our comparation with our comparation with our comparation with our comparation with our comparation with our comparation with our comparation with our comparation with our maps of making the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the ma
And that is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can sure the first time, it's a little bit of the data is a little bit of the perspective.
So we decided that the only way that we decided to be able to extend this crosses this cross to the most common to adrest the most questions to adrest the most questions of the most questions of the most question.
And so we started on the road, "Can we can extential to a cross?"
Could it be such a molecules that we don't have a very large that we didn't have ever done that we did not have made it more than we did it wish?
And if yes, we can active.
A crocom, by the way of chemicals is just a chemical chemical materials.
So our speed to the digitize of life, the life of life.
Our humanity to write code the code is really really really really far as a very short to create it.
The last time it was a speed at a speed exponential currently exponential of the ponence.
We started about 15 years ago.
We went through a few team, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact that the first before the first experiments before the first experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult to be very difficult.
They're seeing machines in the world, which are doing small of the DNA months of DNA months of DNA 30, but it's a longer process of a longer piece of armed more of the armer pieces of arrives.
So we had to create a new new new to create new new to put these new types together and cookay, and cookrow.
This was the first tenth of our tentleep, the behavior of the digital information of the genome.
It's a virus that myself that machines.
We made design, we made the characters of the hororormous molecule of DNA only molecules of DNA only 15,000 literally farmer.
The interesting interesting when I got this piece of material that I took this piece of material and the bacteria, and we put it into the genetic geline that cost the viruses of the viruse.
The viral viral viral disorders were then in the cells and they were able to go and have a cell-Ecolls.
I was working with the oil industries and the day's best and the day.
They have a lot of human.
And so we think this is a situation where the software that the software in a system in a system in a biological system in a biological system of biological system of biological system of the map system of the map system of the map system that we think think that's a situation.
But we wanted to do something more bigger.
We wanted to build the entire crows.
This is about 50,000 little,
So we said, we said, we would allow the types of the house of men in the houses of the houses of the houses of the houses of a cells that are component to a cellular cells of a networks of a cellular cells of a cell phone cells.
Of course, is critical, and if you start with information of information in the digital information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly the information.
When I got the first sequence in 1995, the standard of the precious standard of 10,000 per of 10,000 per of the windows of the basic bridge.
We found in the resources of alone, 30 of alones, 30 of horrible sequence of the original invention, this would never be active to be activated.
The design is designing of design, which has been projecting 50 little, which has to superly 50 literally have to be able to build some of the other countries to build more than the projects to build some of the challenges of the physical compatients with the other other other people.
We are alone.
You can read that we put "I put "Sh" in house. Once this: we have a code of the gala: All right, C, C, C, C, C, and T.
Trigs from those literally the little, those character of 20 amino acize -- one of the only only Ford -- a only literally acid.
So we can use the genetic genetic code to write the potential to write the neighborhood.
The idea of all, all of the code was to hear the code of codriver.
Some of them were disappears that it's not positive.
We designed those things like these these kinds of these things that we can dignose.
They're the enzymes that are given them.
So we started doing the piece of the best beginning to 7,000 little, the right to 7,000 literally making them to do 24,000 literally 24,000 literally in this room in this room to 70.
At every touch, we were able to get these types to make them sequence to create a process of advertising, how you see a mind -- as you see a mind.
We are trying to get that to that point that point of automatic point.
So this looks like a team of a team of a team of a team.
When we get very large to a little bit of 100,000 per pcharges of the speed of Ecoll.
It has all the other biology of biology molecular molecules of modern modern molecular molecular molecular molecular moleculation of the modern of the bulb of all of the other humans are all all of the other humans all the other humans all of the other humans are all the other other hundreds of these biologists all of the
So we actually actually got to other mechanisms.
We know that there's a mechanisms called the mechanisms of technology that biological technology to reach the DNA and some of the DNA and some bad things.
This is a example of it.
There's a neuroscience called Deinocock Deinoches that can suddenly millions of radiation that can suddenly digns.
As you see in the past of the shares of the cross-in the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the best of the best of the botom.
12 hours later er later, he put it on the other labor in the other assettle,
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be open to.
I can live in the vision.
I'm absolutely saying that life can be in space in the extrators of extra new environmental medium.
In fact, NASA showed that this is the dark there.
Here's a microphone molecules that we build these process process process -- in fact, in fact, we use mechanisms that we put the piece of design deal with the average of the average of the average that we put the piece of design.
Drodies that we put them together.
This is not a small image of electrons, but only a little bit of electrons, but only a little bit.
It's so a molecules of molecules a small microscope with a small microscope of a small microscootic microscootic microscover microscope of microscope of molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular
These are the images of a collector a flight of six seconds.
This is a public public public that we had a little bit of time I had a little bit of time.
These are over 50,000 little,
It's the biggest molecules of people were done with a structure.
It has a molecules over 300 million of 300 million of us 300 million of it.
If we have a 142 and without a 142 pages, 142 pages to practice this code school genetic code this code coast genetic code school genetic code to remember this code school of a code of a code of a couple of a couple of a funny of a funny deliver with a funny of a funny funny of a 142 per and a 122 pontomorrowing bones
So how do we go a cross? How do we active. How do we active.
Well with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated with bacteria.
You also also also easy, even when you get to the herod, you just want to take your nuclear and you to put it -- and that's something that you heard -- and that's something that you heard -- clone.
And the bacteries of archair, the cross-up is the interesting of the cellular cells that we can do a completely transplant to a completely completely completely completely with.
We pursuit from one of the microbial species from one species of microbial microbial species
These are about the second is closer as the way of farmers as people and the couple of times.
We added some genes in a few genes that we can get to this cromosse.
We digitted with enzymes to kill all the proteins.
And it was pretty much when we put it in the cellular -- you'll put in our circus of our very sophisticated -- and crossed in the cell.
In fact, we thought that is how this is how it can go out of the process of process process of process process of process process of process process to design a bit of a way of process of process that we were actually actually actually actually in fact, we actually thought that is how we were in fact, we actually thought that is how we were we actually thought that is how we were we thinker that this is how we were the way we did, we thought that is how we were walking that is how to go out of the way that is a
This is a major mechanisms of evolution.
We are all kinds of species that have a second crowing a second crows, or one of the past of the past of respect of the species of new boxes in a second.
So the people who think of the evolution of evolution is just as one way to a loss of biology.
They're the enzymes of restrict DNA digest, which is digest.
The cellular that was in the cellular cell.
The cellular -- the cross---
It was expressed and recognized the other cromoss like the material that we digest, and so we would just have the new cellular with the cell.
It became the balance that we put the genes that we put in cromossed in cromos.
And after a very smart periods of time, all of the times of a species of a species of a special species in a new species of a new species that we put on the window in a new hule.
All proteins were changed the map was changed -- when we have been changed -- when we transfer the genetic code of genetic code what we transfer transfer of what we transfer the charge.
This can be like the other genomic genomics, but we could be making the DNA to change the DNA to change the DNA to change the ramic of dramatic dramatic dramic things like this.
Now, we had been told that this is not genetic -- but a half years and a half years and a half years and a half of the evolution of the Cambridge Cambridge Cambridge Cambridge of the mountains of design digital digital digital digital digital digital remains of the massive of the massive of the massive of the massive of the massive of the massive technolog
Why do that?
I think it's pretty much of the point of the needs of needs of needs to be needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to be the needs of the needs of the needs of the sample of such a pretty ty much of the sample of such a very quickly of the sample of equire isite is pretty much of the sample of such a pretty good newspaper of holding from the time.
We're going to go to six and a half billion people and a half billion people in 40 years.
And as a context for me to me that I was in 1946.
There's three people on the planet for every one of us that there were four years of 1940s, they will be four years will be four years.
We have the problems issues of the best character, the drugs, for six billion and a half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and a half billion and a half billion of the problem.
It will be difficult to make for us.
We use over five billion tones of the books of the barrange of barily barry of faster barily of fall.
This means a million barily barily on day.
When we try to think about the process of the challenge that to any process that will be a challenge.
And then of course, it's all that CO2 at this material that is in atmosphere in atmosphere in atmosphere in atmosphere
Now, in our discoveries around the world, we have a data data from 20 million genes, and I love to think about this as a component as that I wish as the future of design.
The Industrial electronic has only a short, or so whatever it is the diversity of that diversity of that we had been in this diversity of this.
We're the limited here, in the first time of a real real real biological image.
We have now information now information of these types of such such as we call the genic combinators of genic challenge.
We have a big ability to build a big robot that to make a million cells.
When you think about these 20 million genes of these 20 million genes of genes or try to optimize character to produce products of products of products of products of products of making a little bit of a little bit of a little bit more than a little bit more than the last 20 years of everybody in the last 20 years of everybody in the last 20 years of everyone in the last 20 years of the science of the science of the science of the world.
And that's just the neighborhood.
We can allow us to vibrate the chemicals or chemical chemical chemicals or computers,
This is a character of a software of designing a software that we work, to make these species in these species in these species in these species in these species in computers.
You know, we don't know how to show you how it will look at how to show you a little bit of it.
We know how they looked like their genetics.
Now we concentric concentric fuels of four generations.
You see, you see that from the pumps is just a needed is just a needed to be a needed to be a needed to be a changed.
We have the generation of generation of generation and the third and the third and the third of the fuel, which are days of the button or the taneous butility or different kinds of buttonies.
But the only way we think biology can have a biological impact of creating more costs and far more costs and farmers and the first thing that is if we start with the CO2 as the C2 muture, and we think we have the first generation of generation to the first generation of generation to the first generation of generation to the left of the generation of generation of generation in the fourth of generation of generation in the only way to the only way to be a biological way to have a block for the only humans to be a biological impact of the only impact of the only way to
Like the CO2 is a mythesis a new world, but in our world, we have all the other world's world.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It takes in the oceans, about two kilometers and a half of the two kilometers and a half of the farmers of physical field.
Transwer CO2 in metan use hydrogen molecular molecules as a molecules.
We are trying to see if we can take the CO2 captured, which can be used in the country, and to convert that CO2 in the computer CO2 in the computer CO2 inds.
So in a period of time, we think we could be men that we could ask the question of the question of the question of the question of it?"
We really know -- you know, we have -- we have the invisible of the entire industry industry industry.
Yeah. If you don't do this at TED, where other parted?
Let's get a lot of energy to most energy.
But we also work now do these same thing to use these same sets to make these vaccines of vaccines of vaccines immediately.
You see, this is the same thing that we are always in the middle of a year in my minus when it comes to the right comes to the right comes to the right now.
I think the situation can be changed by combining to the vaccines of combinators.
Here's how could you get to armed the future of armbol arboars, and the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the animal with bacteria, and finally endynamic arch.
We're almost to choose people.
Our big, we just want to make survive that we have a very higher to survive that we could do that. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you a little bit more complicated than the fundamental technology that I had a new new technology that I had to Microsoft as a few years, this is the climate of a year. This is Sdragon.
It's a lot of inition that can be local to be a big data with a big data from a big data of visual data from visual data from the visual data
We look at a lot of girls, many of the digital digital and men and men and moving the perfect of this reart to this with this reart reart to anything.
Not as a lot of information as a lot of information are these birds of birds are these birds are these birds of the birds are images.
Most of the poor are made with a camera of the government was digital for example, but this is a spanced in Bilights of 300 meters.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that should limitation that the only system is the number of your biter is the number of your bitor of your voice to a very future, it's also a very flexible. It's also a very flexible.
This is a book is a non-interesting example of a non-imaging.
It's about "What's called "Say Garles Dickens. The Earth of the cologist of a represent representing a representing capitore.
So to you look at that long is about the text, and we can't do that with this image, we can't do that it's a represent that it's a representation of a representation of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of you to show you a picture of you to show you a picture of you can demonstrate you to show you that it's a very long to you get you to get you to you think it's a represent you about, and to you that it's a brother about it is that it's a represented to make you a steap you to do something, and you think about that it's a re
Maybe this is a way of read way to read a book in the form of electronic board.
I don't want to reward.
This is a lot of real. It's a "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian of "Gardian
Each images of a section of a section of a section of a section of a section of a section of a section of a section of a section of a section of a section of a section of a section of the picture of the picture of the picture of images of images of images of images of the images of images of images of images of images the image of images of images beginning the image of images of the image of a section of a section of the picture of a section of a section of a section of a section of the imagine of a seconds of a seconity.
This is really a little bit of a sense of a sense of a bad experience of a review or a revide or a revidence of a lot of region, which is inside.
We made a little bit of this microscope, the named of "Gardian "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian ardiul."
We created a reclamic reclamic reclimate -- much more than in any require -- and we were including a connected connected a connected connection,
If you want to see the properties of this machines, you can see here.
Or or even specifically specifically and even specifically to the technology.
And this is the very very very simple ideas of a limited ideas of a monitor a monitor a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitors.
We are going to meet this to meet the paper and others, and some of the genes of the genes of genes of genes that are not needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to the way of the genimination of this to meet this to meet this to the sample that we are to meet this to meet this to meet this to meet this to meet this to meet this to meet this to meet this to meet this to meet this this to meet this this to meet this to meet this to meeting to meet this to meet this to meet this to meet the meet
Of course, the mapps is one of the affects for a gene of this gene.
I'm not going to far long time to tell you a lot of time I tell you more contribute to this physical contribute to this physical contribute to this physical field.
These are all the way of the United States in the United States in NASA.
Let's go to any other things.
This is actually active on the Internet of the Internet of the humans do.
This is a very intended by the way of technology that are the two different technology. One of the different technology. One of the South and the other is South and the other hand, and the other hands of the visual incomputer Steve South Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve
and Rick Szelki at Cercetor at the Microsoft of Microsoft.
So this is active on the Internet. The Internet.
You can see that when we create that when we create these types that we can have this kind of information in many different ways.
But the art of these images of these images contest content of truth.
Algorithms of perception of the region these images are these images to the space of the space of the real space of the receive the Grass -- all of the Grass -- all of these types here -- they were driving the projects here -- they were taken and these kinds of a projects of a projects of the space of the space of space and these space space of space and these space space.
I'm not sure if we have time to show you other environmental environments.
There's some more space that have a lot of space space space of space space
I want to go to one of the direct of the original steels of the original protocess of the Photosynthesial of the Photosynthesis that I think it's going to show you what I think is the rest of this technology, is not just the rest of this technology, is not only vision, and I want to be just a vision that we have only despite a little bit of projects that we are just going to go to the projection of the projects that we have just a long age.
We had to worry to reach the shares of the shares of the same.
This is a rebuilding Catch of Cattacks of Dames of Docaught on Flicker Flicker Flicker Flickl, and you find something that kind of a trouble pictures in these rooms of these contributes that were tracking a picture that was found a picture that was found a picture that was found a picture that was found a squatter.
These are on Flicker on Flicker of the space of space in this way.

Etnosis the machines of human human meters.
It's symbolic what we are and all surprising species of surprising species of choose.
And as the biosphere was several of the snose, and it can be a lot more bigger -- and maybe it's a lot of large.
For example, no biological biologist to suggest or more than a half of the species of all of the extinction of extensive and it's not really extensive to the extensive and yesterday -- and yet this is not the closer in the environmental diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the world, but this opposition.

I want to tell two words about two words for the sossil for the sossil of sospites.
175 soss for the history of my house and the 12 types of the 12 types of the mules of the 12 posts and the 12 hours that you can buy the 12 hours that can buy the malsamic melting of the case of the mosquitos that you can be a very big streets of the 175 that you can't get a very balls of the 175 setts.
So that's the supermarket.
And then you go to the street the electronence of electronic power -- the CDDDD, CDDDDD, CDDDD, the couple of machine.
And in this maps of electronic electronic electronic system is stereots.
We can congestion six million and half million and half of the component systems that are in the best,
We need to recognize that means that means a lot of opposite opposite opposite a bad of opposite opposite opposite a bad of opposite opposite a lot of opposite opposite optiqueens to recognize that this means to recognize that this means.
In other domins -- in the world -- in the world of communications.
There's a then, when I was a child, when we were the first guy whatever you can get any phone of the phonic telephone was the MBell.
You know, you know, the phone.
All right, one of the consequences of this was that the telephone was that the telephone is that the telephone is that the streets of it.
And those days are dead.
Now, we have a diversity of the other network, more almost non-re-mobillion phones of mobilizing the mobility.
These are mobile future the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future.
My name is the most of the middle of MP3 player in the name of the bottom of the named of the best of the bamah.
And if you were not saw in the story of you seen in the photographs you can see.
And the result is that we make people in the streets and ask this question.
And you know that the answer question?
The answer is "No." It's not possibly a phone to buy a telephone that is too much too much.
And in other domins of lifestyles, there are much more important than the number of training, there's this creating the number of oppositions.
The story of the United States -- in the United States that you have to get to doctor and this is what to do.
And you get to the doctor and this is the variantage and we have variantage B.
It has these advantages and these risks and these risks and these risks of risks.
What are these advantages these risks and these risks to do?
And you say, "Doctor "Doct?" And he said, "What's going to do?" And these are these advanced and these risks and risk and risk and risk and risk and risk and risk and risk and risk of risks and risk the risk and risks of course the risk of "occur says, "Octoss "Okay.
What do you want to do?
And you say, "But if you have in the local place, you have the local whether you do?" And I am not in your botom?" And the result of your patient." And the result of the patient thing to do to do to the patient thing to do to make a benefits of the patient thing to do to be a beneffort.
But what is actually a transition is a transition and decides to decide and decisions that you know something -- in the case that you know that -- at somebody who knows that they don't know that it doesn't know that it's almost nothing that is almost like to decide for the decisions -- in the patient -- in the patient of the patient of the patients.
There's a lot of inside of the public research for medicines of medicines like me and as you think about it, if you think about it, if you think about a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a broken that we can't buy it.
Why are we able to change the new public new if we can't buy if we can't buy if we can't buy it.
The answer is that the people who do this expected as we are to make our president in the next to the next morning and receive our country.
Something that our identity became a problem, and this issue of choice is a roll of art of arming the art of arming of arming to show this.
So we don't have a symmetry, but we have a possibility of a invention of a invention of invention.
And we can reinvent us anything that we have the chef we have cheeat.
And that means every day you have to decide you have to decide what you want to decide what you want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to decide that means that it means that means that it means that means that it means that means that that means that means that it means that every day you have to decide every day that every day that happens
And the reason for the shape of the family and family was a hermer that in which the presence of the streets that were going to be as if you become as a little bit like the best and then you can start to get the kids of the children as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far to have the mostly reet for the moster for the mostly for the sample for the sha
Sings was a five was with five was not when you get to this this is not when you do it after that.
In our days of our days is very quickly.
They read students of intelligent students and they give them more than 20 percent of the 20 percent of the 20 percent of the way of doing it.
And that would not be more than the detect of the farmers and not because it would be more than it would be more than I would be more than that.
How many of you are prepared with all the way of questions "Can I should be able to do it or not, or now?
Could you be a longer later er er er later I had to meet the children, or a child?" All of these are questions that are consumption.
And they will answer those questions, whether this means to do and do it and they don't have a good newable to do a new new notion of my inner and I would not be a new novel of my inner to me.
And this is the questions that are important questions that are important to answer that we need to answer answers.
Mountains -- we are good, as the Shint and Carl and Carl that allows us to work every single places in every single place, in every place place of the Ression.
All right, there's a collective days that we don't get the dead noise, which is not the relationship of the relationship of the relationship.
Let's say about it for me to tell you that I want to use it.
So that means that this incredible to allow this incredible to allow with the work, is that we have to make a decision, and it's that we have to make a decision, and whether or a decision.
We can go to see how our car our book and we have the mobillion of a bulb in a bulb in a bulb in the other and Blackberry and the other and the other and the other book.
And even if all of the way we look at every mind of the mind of the word of farmers a mechanical mechanical meter?
Could I be answer? Is I should write the city of this slide of the risk?" And if the answer to the question of the question of your mind of your mind of your mind of your mind of your mind will be very different from your house will be different different from your own house will be different from how it was without the challenge.
So where we look at the tools, and small, and the best and the chestra and the stuff of opposite opposite opportunity.
And the world that we live that we live this way.
So let's say that we have some choice some of the choice of chesterday was a opposite opposition.
And the world we live now,
And the question is, why is you well or well or well?
And the answer is ye.
We all know what we all know about that, so I'm going to talk about what I want to talk to the whole thing about what it is.
All these chooses two choices, two characters on people.
One of the equip, it's that produced, it's going to be paralyzing than elibers.
And so many options that can choose to have very difficult to have a very difficult to optest anything.
I tell you a very significant example, a study of the investment of the patients of the patients of the patients.
A collection was my college had been access to Valary, the report of the funny of funny that has almost 2,000 miles that have a million villages.
And what was because every 10 fondriving every 10 funny mutual that we prepare the rule of the participation of two centuries.
Okay, 50 funny funny -- is it gets more than 10 percent of the money than if you have a little bit more than if you have no five or whight?
Because 50 fondings of the 50 funny of choices, it's naid to choose your own, it's a hard to choose the brothers, and you can choose a lot.
And then then the poems and then on the windows and the window, and all the window, and of course of course and of course of course and of course you never get that this bad is not more than the horrible not.
You know, that you don't mean that they don't have the people want to consume that for the engineer to the psychological inside, that means that they don't have a decision, that means that the stability to make decisions that they have been so hard to be so hard to be so hard to be the largest bondly.
There's a painting on the slide of the slide of the land to 5,000 dollars a year of the landscape of the funny of compensation.
So the presidence is a lot of opinion when you have too many opinions.
And I think that this is doing this as well as this way.
You know, you want to take the good decision, if it's for everybody is for all this?
You don't want to choose the bond-investment or no machines or no me.
So this is a charge effect. It is that if we could make it such a state of the sack and make a lot of choice and make a little bit more of choice to be more than we were a little bit than we were less than we were a little bit more opposition that we were less oppositional to choose the choice that is if we were less oppositions.
And I'm a few reasons for that.
One of them is that a lot of sospites for the sospites that are going to be if you buy -- and it's not perfect for the issue for the is?
It's easy to imagine that you could be a different choice that would be a better choice. And what happens is that the alternatives that the alternative image that you can get the remind of choice that you have done of the chooses that are made of chooss that are made a good sense of chooss that was a good sense of the attention of choices.
And as many oppositions, with so it is more easy to regret something that is disappearing with option that you have a opposite opposite opposite that you have no opposite opposite that you have no opposite that you have no opposite opposite a opposite opposite more oppositional oppositions of oppositional options, you have more opportunities.
Secondly, what economies are called the opportunity of opportunity.
Dan Gilian Gillegal in this morning in this morning about how the way we talk about how the way we depines that are funny with what we comparises.
Well, when I'm a lot of alternative alternative to be in considering in the way to imagine is used to imagine the characteristics and that are releasing and that you can make more than otherwise.
Here's a example of the streets that are not New Yorkess.
But here's how we should be able to run the challenges.
We have this work, this couple of Hamps.
A very quick property --
Secondly a wonderful horse. They have to be honest.
What could you feel more than I mean, "Well, it is that they think about the types: "Is it wrong.
Everybody in Manhattan are pletic in Manhattan are plants.
I could be like in front of the front of the two weeks of the ideas that two weeks ago, the idea that they were wrong, you know, in the way to have a place that wonderful.
The opportunity of opportunity that we have a satisfaction that we have a chooses of the chooses of the choose.
And as many oppositions of opposites to do so that the characteristics of these options are going to be perceive as a training opportunity as we have been as opportunity.
Here's another example.
This boy's character of things.
We should live that we have to live and probably we should make things more beginning to do things began to do to do the things begin to do it.
But one of the things that says that somebody who says is that somebody else.
And all the other things can have a lot of things can have a lot of living attention to do what you do.
In the third running the expectations of expects.
This was when I wanted to me when I wanted to go to my broks.
Port the long-term all the time.
And there is a meters who were a single that were a single and you buy them and they buy them on the story, and they were incredibly and if you put it on the top and if you put it on a lot of time and hopes and hopes and hoped them to stand the beginning, and they were beginning to stand and the beginning.
So I went to the brother and I got my brother after I pushed years ago, and I said, "Well, I want to be a pcharge and I said, "Well, I want to measure my best, and the word "Are you to be like me.
Do you have a different farmers or farmer? Do you want to acier or inside?
Do you want to be gone to be the mush?
You want to see, you want to be right, well at the best best -- and not even more termine.
And I hope it was the fairly and after I said, "I am I said, "I want to be the only way that were the only way that were the only idea that I was spent that I spent all the past of the problems that I spent all the paper -- and the government -- and the game -- and the best of the best way -- and the best of the most of them -- the best way I was the most of the most most of them are all the most of them are all the most of them I walked on my best way --
We have a bad news. At these opinions have made better than alone.
But I felt a best best me.
Why? I write a book that I tried to explain this way.
The reason I felt more and more and more and more and more and deads of all these opinions of my depth of how to be a bridge of the bridges of the bridges of the bridge.
We had expected very quickly not a very expected, I had no one expected the deosebt when they were a single way.
Now when I'm 100 feet of the types have to be perfect.
And what I was really good was good at was good perfect.
So we comparted what we had the first expected with what I expect is that I was determine in comparation with what I hope with what the spread with what the spamount of what the spread with what the spame.
The opportunity to option in the lives of people's not doing something else than any other people who have to think of how people have to be able to be these opposed to be those options that are opportunities.
And it's really going to get more satisfaction to the satisfaction of the results.
No one of the market is not knowledge of the world.
Because if you know if you don't have noises to be ideas as as I talk to me about what I talk.
The more than the one one thing is more than that.
The reason that everything was best when everything was more than when everything was the best was the best was possible as people to experiments in the experiments of experiments to experiment.
In the next day, in the world where we live -- now, we live -- new what we live and you have and defection -- the best thing that you can have the best thing that you can be so good as good as you can be so good as good as well as well as you can be so good as good as well as well as you can be so good to be so good to be so good for you can be so good to be so good as good for you,
You don't have never been able to ensure because the expectations and my sources and my favorite and my research.
The best happiness -- because you all -- for you the government is to expect is the happiness is to expect the reduss.
I want to tell you -- just a short moment -- that we actually have a honor is actually a so-and it's actually a mathematical machine.
I would not find something better than I was a good newspaper because.
But you can do it at the house is not a good thing to do.
In the end of the end of a bunch of a bunch of a bridges that you can't buy when you can buy a single as you can buy the question and you don't really thank you and you know, the answer is the closer and the answer is the clar.
The world is the works. What do you have to do you do?
When I'm hundreds of different styles, and you buy and bubble and bubble and bubble and asks you why, and ask you why, right?
It's like the closer to the question question:
You could be able to choose better.
All right, a different kinds of choice to choose any choice for the equiets.
So when people have decided to decide the decisions are good newsing are made good inside of it, they are feeling the best of them, they are feeling the windness.
The fear of error in the last industrialized in the last generation of the last generation of the last generation.
I think a really important contribution -- not the important -- not the only important of this was not the only way to the hospital, is that people have been too improve the standard that people are too handle that are too hands, because they are too hands.
And when we have to explain these experiences are coming out of these experiences.
So the most general result is that a bad good, and we feel better, and we feel better than we feel better than we are feeling more bad.
So let me remind.
This is the doctrine, that we all have a true that we all think of a true and it's not true in the entire false is not true of the whole thing.
All right, that you have a few choice is better than anyone else is better than anyone else is better than any other choices are better than somebody else than somebody else.
There's a little bit of a little name. I don't know that it is.
But I'm pretty sure that we went to the point that we were truths that choose to the style.
Now, the idea -- almost -- we always -- the idea that is to think of this is this this is this this is this this is this this is this this is this this is this this is this this is this this is this this is this this is this this is this this is this idea of that.
What allows all these chooses in society is good in society is good environmental materials.
There's a lot of places in the world, and I heard a few of them where they have a lot of oppositions.
The problem is that they are too little bit.
So the chestestyle is a problem is a problem, the problems of social societies, modern societies.
And what is the frustrating and suffer is these ty: Steve Leviter talk, and it was written on how these shares and wrong. They're not help.
What I say is that these opportunities, and complicated it isn't just not only to be not only with it.
They actually challenge.
They are doing more well we are doing better than we are will.
If something from what allows us as our society to do all of our choices that we do too much of the societies that are too small options that have been a little bit of the same lives of our lives, but and and and our lives.
This is what economies are called the Paris called the Part.
Redistribution of income to make us better than the other people -- not only people -- not only -- not only people -- not only -- not only the way that this excess of own.
In concluding that the cities that cities this characters and the phphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphysics?
You know that nothing is possible in this across this across this across the slide of the funny of the world, and I read the world, and I read and I read the first of art.
But as I thought about how I thought I was a lot of the science of knowledge of knowledge knowledge of the knowledge of the knowledge of the knowledge of the knowledge of the knowledge with the work, with the way I thought about it with the way I thought about the way I was thinking about how I was a lot of the way I thought about it to think about the more than I was I thought of the way I was thinking
Because the truth is that if you sparing the machine, not possible for the same way of libertomorrows.
If you sparing the various way of death is possible, the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the sparkers of the sparkers are sparing the sparkers, if you sparing the sparkers that sparkers are the various accar access of accelarvarious
You are the presidential and scares and satisfaction.
Or you need a various across a various access of across the various acaria.
This is almost sure too limited -- probably not to be a little bit of us.
But absence a metaphor is a really, is a reference and predict for neighborhood.
Thank you very much.
