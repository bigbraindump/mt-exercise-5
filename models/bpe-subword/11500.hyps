He said, "You know, it's a lot of the bone, but the more of the best one.
It's my father was my homeography and a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
And I don't know that this is that this is what I want to do it
But this is that I was a little bit of the best way to recognize and the best and the best and the best of the best and the best and the best of the best and the best of the conditional conditions.
And the idea of course, it's like this is that I was in the best of the best of the Manananand, the Manananand, the Greey, the Greeorge of the best of the world's story, and a democracy of the world, and this is a very important thing to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the bad of the conditioned of the world.
The architecture is that the story of the people who are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the independent of the inequality of the inside of the end.
She is -- the condition, the conditional condition!
Okay, for example, you know, you know you know you don't know you have a little bit of a little bit of you can't read the best way you could be be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the bad of the bad thing.
You don't have a story that you would go to the end of the land the best of the best of the best of the world that would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the world of the world of the world that are going to be able to be able to be able to be the world in the world of the world of the world of the world in the world of the world of the world in the world of the world in the world of the world in the world of the world of the world in the world of the world that are going to be able to be dright?
It's very small, in the middle.
But it was more like to remember that I don't have a few years of you have two years ago, I was going to be about two people who were going to be able to be a little bit of people -- I was going to be able to be able to be able to be a little bit of the same stress of the same time, and I would have a little bit of the same way, and I would have a little bit of the same waiting of the same way.
And people said, "You don't have no longer that you don't have no one of the best way of the best of the best of the best way of the bad of the best of the bad of the best of the bad of the rest of the people who have no longer to be people in the people who have to be able to say they were people who have people have to be people people who have to say people have people people have to say they were people to have the people people have have to be people people in the people who had no no no longer people had no people who have no matter people in the bad "
I don't like to be my own ideas as will be the idea of you will be think?
You don't have the story of the best thing, you know, the next thing in this way, and you don't have a little bit of the best and you have a little bit of the broken and a little bit of the barry of the barrates of the best of the city of the city of the city of the history of the city of the city of the history of the city of the history of the city of the best of the situation of the city of the bade-state in the browing of the tor of the benddright?
And one of the Count of this gene of the gene of the gene.
The art -- the story of the story of the question of the questions of questions "Da" is "Day"
Yes, you know, it's a little bit of these things are all of these things.
And the next thing that was a little bit of my home.
And you know, it's a little bit of the things that are all all of the things that they can't be the things that they can't be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be there.
So for example, for the other stories and other things that are all of the things that are religious and the benefit of the benefit.
But when it's about the thing I think about the things that I think that I think that I would have all the question that I would have to be able to say "What do you have the last do?"
Is this this is what the brain is that?
It's a beautiful thing that you would have to be able to be able to be able to be very similar as a very good that they were very quickly.
And what is the most important thing to create the conditions of the situation of the balance of the balance of the balance of the way that you don't have a little bit of the people who are not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it in a city that would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a little bit of the people who don't have to be able to be able to be a little bit of the way that wordy?
My father for example, for example, for the shape and you don't have the first time to be able to be the first time of the first time you would have no question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the same question of the same question is not going to be able to be able to be able to be a balancycle of the history.
It wasn't the samplife -- how do you get the best of the balance of the barrates of the barrase.
And it doesn't be simply to be the best story.
But I feel like the story, the balances, the balances, they were not very much of the future of the future of the bold-bold-bollymmes of the bolly-bolds.
And we have the best stories of the sample, but we have no longer to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be done one one in the bad of the bad of the bad of the expectorizized.
And what we have is what we have to do is the best of the best story, the best story, the 21st century of the next 10, and the street of the best of the best of the best way to create the same thing.
And they are the same that they didn't have the same thing, they would be really hard to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the same thing.

But it would be no longer in the broken of the best things that I would have been so much of the things things and so they would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to recognize and the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the conditional and a little bit of the conditional and a democracy of the conditioned and a deeth, and a confidence of the conditional and a condition and a den condition to be a bitorize of condition and a and a and a beautifuture of conditioned of
And the question I want to remember one of the best ones of the best thing: "You know, you have a little bit of the things of things with this idea.
You can get the benefits -- for the story of the story of the city of the city of the city of the best of this is going to be in this way.
I think it's like the ocean.
And I think it's really like the best story, and it doesn't go to a little bit of the last 100 million dollars.
I think it's more more independent on the sample of the barrates of the art of the bar.
And I mean, I remember the ber, my father -- my father -- this would be very much for me to go to me to me to go to my own story, and the best of the best of this is the most important thing that the best of this is that the future of the situation of the situation of the conditional to the conditional research that I was in the next next time to the next streets of the conditional conditional to the be, and then in the next next next next year.
And for example, it's just like the art of the next 10, I was just in the last 10.
I have no more than 100 of the world's work.
And it's very important that I would like to be the moment when I was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the same story of the last city of the last city of the last best of the last year of the last year of the last last few day?
What they would say you say to you say to the best of the people in the city of the friend's work.
Okay, "Oh, no, "Why is a little bit of my home.
This is the way that would be when you could do somebody who would be able to do it in the city of the story, and I don't want to be able to be that I don't want to be that I don't want to be able to be able to be in that way.
I remember this is to do this in this room that I love me a little bit of my home.
And I mean, you know, the question is, right?
So I would like to say that I was in the middle of the best that I have to have to be able to be able to be able to create a little bit of buildings on a shared driving to build a bad dynamics of the beautiful and a little bit of beautiful and the beautiful.
And then in the way, a little bit of the best of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best way to be able to be in the way.
And as I was the last thing in the last time I was in this case, I was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and people would have to be able to be able to be able to recognize the same way to be able to reduce the connection of the connection, and the results.
Cara's story of Greenaga and Roican and Romana.
So the extract of the best ideas.
But my God God and Golf and Roman's workers and the people who think they don't think that people don't think that the story of the streets of the streets of the streets of the bold?
People think that the way that was a little bit of the best and the best of people who are going to be able to be able to be able to recognize and the best and the best and the best and research and understanding and the best and the benefit to be able to understand the rest of the benefit to be able to understand the benefit to understand it.
The Good was the broken of the benefits of the best of the city of the city of the city of "
The beautiful was the idea that that I think that the way that the story of the story of the situation of the best of the best of the best of the balances.
The Momances, but they have the same street, but they have the same conditional revolution, the galaxies,
What is the answer is that the bombs of the bombs of the best way of the best of the best story.
The condition that was a little bit of the best way of research of the best of the situation of the teacher of the teacher and a little bit of the streets of the best of the barrates and the best of the same, and the shared of the sample, the shape of the samount of the conditional conditioned to the situation of the shape of the shares, the shape of the shares of the conditioned of the conditional conditional conditions,
The balance of the balance -- it's actually in the middle of the land, that we have to build the beautiful that the best of the best of the best of the best of the bad of the best of the best of the best of the best of the city of the best of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the results of the result.
And the world is the world as a little bit of the situation?
So the architecture of the things that are going to be very much of the things of the barrates of the art of the architecture of the barrat?
If you were so far as a beautiful barries, you can't get the same thing for the world that the world is that the world is that the same story of the streets that help me to help that help us that help us that help us that they help the way that they help that they help the way that they help that help that they help the way that they help that help that they help the way that they help the way that they help that help.
If you were the best of the bone, it was not a complete of the best research of the bad of it.
The world of the world is that the story of the story of the best story.
They have the people who are going to create a four years for a long time.
And then the Renaish and the Radignosed by a very interesting of ideas, the idea of the idea of the universe, the United States and the United States and the United States, and the streets of the first state of the first time and the first ones of the first time and research of the first time to be able to be able to research and the first time to be able to reduce and the first time and research the first time to be the first time to remainssive the first perfect of the first stitude of the first condition, and
It was the best of the brain is the brain that projects that have to create the way to create the story of the story of the story of the story.
And for the first time of the first ones of the history of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the balance of the best story.
And you have to have a little bit of the bad of the best performance.
First, when a couple of an example, the other one or the best or is that the best and the best and the best and the street and the street and the best story, a little bit of the future of the four hydrogen and a four hypothese, a little bit of four hydrogen of the future of the same.
It's like you would have to be able to be able to be able to be a little bit of the broke.
And you know, the good newspapers and the streets and the streets and the next streets of these stories of the best of the streets of the best of the balances.
I think that this is that this research is a type of the last 100 years of the last 10.
And if it's really hard to be the question is, I think of the question is, what do you do you do that?
We can do we do all these things like this?
You can get the story of the best of the best of the best of the best of the balance of the balances.
You can hear it.
You can't be able to be able to be able to be able to be 100 years, we can be able to be able to be able to be a little bit of a 10-year-old months.
And it's probably going to be the world's projects that the question of questions that are going to be able to be the same streets of the best of the best of the best of the best of the conditions of people who are going to be able to be able to reduce the rest of the conditions of the beginning of the resources of the conditions of the way and research and the best of the conditions of people in the projects of the top of the conditions of people in the top of the top of the top of people who are ds.
It just just like to 2...'.
But the question is, I want to go to a little bit of you do it?
Why don't I think we don't think this is what happen?
And as a lot of way to be something like something that I would have something that the story of the best of the best of the best of the ability to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to recreate the expectorize the possibe.
What about the way that the story of the story of the people who do it -- it's not going to be able to do it in the city of the best of the best of the research of the best of the democracy.
And in fact, the city can be the end of the Middle of the Middle
I had a deal with a condition where I know where the expression of Righta Rewel, I was in the Rewel, and the next 10, and the first time that I was in the next year, and he was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a stop of the best and the best and the bridge of the best and the bridge of the bathroke and then in the bridge of the be, and then he was a beauer and then was going to be a bridge of the be, and then to be be be be able to be be be
The story is that a little bit of the best of the barrates.
And it turns out the best of the broke.
He was the best thing for the street on the barrates of the barrates of the best photography.
In that moment that is a couple of things, and you have a little bit of the best way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in the same way.
And the balance of the story of the best of the best idea, and the idea of course, and the idea of the ideas and a little bit of the best and a little bit of the best and then it was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a bad of the bar.
The best was not the best street that the best and the balancy and the balancy, but it doesn't get the street and the streets and the street and the broken and a little bit of hospital steel in a hospital in a city of "She said, "You know, a little bit of "Oh, I would like to be a standard of a little bit of a home."
They were the moment that -- and this is that I don't know that this is that I don't have a moment that the story of the story.
Our story is the barry of the best of the story of the first time and the expression and the expression and the street and the story of the street and the street and the best and the best and the best and the best and the baldness.
The first thing of the story of the streets and then the best of the best of the best of the benefit of the benefit of the balancy.
So in this case, the city of the middle of the middle of the last case of the last year of the last last week.
When I was asking -- it's the extremely really, the extreme of the exercise.
My father is not going to be the future of -- it's not always -- it's not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to read it.
They're a little bit of the things that I have to go to the same in every day and then they want to get the same and then they want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to reco.
But it even though it was not in the art of the barrates to be able to be able to be the endangerous of that was done that the end.
And I think about the thing that they were so many of you have been working on the bad of it.
And I had to learn how to learn or the idea that the idea that they were not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to read to me to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
And what happens to do?
So how do it works like to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to recognize to be able to be able to recognize and the benefit?
For example, for the most important thing in our cities, which is that we can do it is that you can do it is that the Mayadignose, and the Wawsh of the Maya's going to be able to be the first time to be the first time to be able to be able to be able to recognize the years ago.
I had to be the best thing that I was in the next thing that the next thing of the barrates of the best of the best of the best storyle, and what it means to be able to recognize and the conditions of these connections of the conditions of these connections of the conditions of the conditions.
The time of the time in the middle of the street, and the story of the story of the best of Life and the Los and the Lowlon Los and the South Africa.
And as a condition to a little bit of the land a little bit of the best that the best of the body's story, and how it works and how it works and the barry and a democracy, but it is not going to be a little bit of a little bit of what it is going to be a little bit of a little bit of what it is not going to be a little bit of what it is going to be a little bit of a bad of what it is not going to be a shape in to be a sha
It doesn't have no longer to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the bad of it.
And the Internet that the next story of the patient of the situation of the moment of the moment and the moment, and it was going to be a moment for a little bit for a little bit of the bad for a little bit of there.
They are not really expected to be a good thing."
And in fact, in the middle of the best and it was exactly the bad of it.
It was the story of the way of the brain and this kind of work.
She was the story of the story of the story and "Oh, you don't see the best of the benefit?"
"Do you have a little bit like a little bit of the best barrat?
If you do it with the best thing that they would have a long time, the more time, I can get a lot of time I can get the same thing.
If you ask it and farms and someone else's going to be here.
You know, you go and farms and the Lowa Cower:
The Internet is the project of this change.
It doesn't have the story of the story of the best way to be the same as well.
But the way of the innovation, and the land the land the time in the last time in the last time he was the same thing that was just in the middle of the street and he was just going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a story.
It could be this project of the long-term and the best of a condition and the rest of the things that are not really excited and the best of the Tomeics that was not very good at Mom.
And after I was that the story of the story of the story of the things that I was going to be able to be a little bit of it.
This is the building was the first time I was in the Manden of the Mananana Mananana, Ray and I said, "Ads" and I would have a little bit of the best way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a little bit of the bad of the bad that it to be a little bit of bad thing.
Not that the fact that the best of the best of the best one.
I mean, I would like to think that they should be able to be able to be able to reduce the projects.
And I was my father I was working on the same story of the story of the best and I was working and I was working on and I was working on it.
I was the story of the best and the benefit and I was working on the sample of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the bad of the bar.
I said, "What I said, "Okay, and I mean, and I would like to be able to be able to be able to be the best thing that would be no expressed to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the bad of it.
And if you can see that you can see that one of the best way I would be more than I would be more than it would be more than it would be a little bit of it.
So if you want to be more than you would have to be more than you want to do it and you have to do it in the case of the best one.
Okay, if you don't have to do that, you have to do this in the case of the broke.
And he says to me to be for me to be the best of my own own life.
And I want to be the same for me for me to be my own own hospit."
Because the Great the end of the future of the Middle Earth of the European North Europe, and they have to be able to be able to be able to be able to recognize and the best of the best photograph of the bridge of the beautiful and the beautiful.
And they were the best one, for the land, because they were so beautiful and the balances, and the balances, and the bone?
But it really remember, something that is something that one of the Internet of the conditions of the community of communication.
They're conditions that you can see what the best for the best thing that you can see the same thing that I would have a moment of time to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to connected.
It's like the time that the time is the story of the story of the best of the way of works, you don't have a different way, you don't have a little bit of the other history of the other history of the other history of the balances.
And in a city of that is not just the best story.
It's the world's conditions of the world's street is the shape of the balances.
And then I want to be the street of the streets were going to say and they said, "You know, they said, "
And the extension of the conditions and "Brunnel, "Oh Brun, "Dawesh! God, "Goh" --
It's the God.
A cycle of the history of -- when they were interested in South South South Sicons, and they were able to recognized by the wave of the long-term of the Soll, "Okay, "Okay, "Okay, "Okay, "Okay, "Okay, "Okay, "Okay, Shak."
and the story of the time in the middle of the land the best and the beautiful and the beautiful of the benef.
In South, a condition to be something like something that is something like a broken and "Bolly," "Bololly," "Oh, -- "Oh, -- "Oh, --
The condition -- a little bit of Darwine.
It's the architect, because we need to do it.
But the next story of the two of the other stories of the story of the story of the story of the streets and the best and the best and a little bit of the South South Field Stark.
It's a little bit of the best way of the best of the balance of the balance of the best and the best of the best way to be the same thing.
You would be the best you don't have no idea what the Greean Goller Someters have to be able to do with the body?
It's very quickly be.
It's one of the most most of the most excited by the wave of the same thing.
But it doesn't have a very bad of the most important thing that you don't have no longer to be the most excited that the most excited of the expression.
If you think you have a little bit of the best way that they were able to imagine a little bit of the best to see the samplife of the time, the more of the next time to be more than the next time to be more than the next time they would be more more than the time when they would have been working on the same time.
If we think we think we think we have the same thing, we change the way to change it.
I mean, I was going to think about the next thing I think I was thinking about the last few years, and the last few years, the next thing that would be a little bit of the best of the best and a research of the beautiful and a little bit of the best and a little bit of the best and a lot of the best and the beautiful of the best and the best and a very beautiful of the best and a very excitement of
And what I did was working on the best story, you don't have the best of the barrates of the bad of the bad of it.
Not the bad of it. You know, you have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the be.
If you have a story of the tone, they would be the same thing.
If the story of the galaxy and the expects is what you do, you can get the expect of the expression, and it's a very excitement to be a beautiful stories of the streets of the best story."
And if you ask me -- the best of the bone.
And with the "Okay."
I think these things that I think that I would have to be able to go to the work.
"Okay." And he said, "You know, you have a good for a little bit of the bonemails and the benefit and the shape of the best and the best of the best and the bad of the best and the best of the best and "
Thank you.
Thank you.
John Coh: Oka!
I have a lot of people on these projects, about the best of the best of the best and what we could do is the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the benefits of the best of the best of the benefit of the city of these things.
Now in the next story of a new way, we have a new hydrogen and we try to get to the best and we try to get this refer and a new beautiful stories and a little bit of the best way to be able to reduce the way to remember of the things that are going to be able to be able to research and the way of the way to reach of the way to reduce of the
We started all over the time, we learned to ask us to ask the important thing.
"What is you think you think you know that many of you have to understand how many people do with the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the bad of it.
I started different from different connections of the component of component to the component of the companies.
And we get the bridge of the next 10 years ago.
When I was the second of the best of the world, this is the world's disease of the world's living in the world of the world.
So I do what we do is this: We can do it in this way, or we can create the world, or this religion in this way?
This is a bad of a little bit of the balancy, the most beautiful thing that the most of the most important thing that can be the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the most fun.
We started to see if we were going to see if we can see it in a lot of bad and more and more and more and more than that.
We have been able to reduce the first thing of a story of the world.
But when we look at the end of the hole, it's very simple, it's very similar to our own own own and our own own own own and our own own own and our own own own own and our own own own own and our own own own and our own own own own and our own own own own own own and our own own own own own own own own own own own own and when we go to our own own own own own enough when we look at our ennigh.
And this is the good thing, this is simple.
But when we are in all of the world that we can get the first time to get a moment that the moment that you have a little bit of the best way to be a bad of the best bad of the best bad of the bad of the best of the best of the bad of the best way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be when it in a cell.
So I was that the only one of the only thing is that we have to be able to be the bombalancy, so that we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to ask the most most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most excited.
And so I started in the middle of the story of a bomb of a bombag?"
You can get the expect of this bule of this bold-bolls are really really really really really really expect to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it.
And if you can see if we have a bom?
A clopedia, it's just a little bit of the best of the best of the best of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the best one.
So our own story, our own digital in a city of the samplift-dimensional regions.
These are our own story of the story of the story of the story of the streets of the beginning.
The next time, the next story of a democracy.
I started to get to 100 years ago.
I had a few weeks ago, in a little bit of the best of the best of the first ones of the first question.
But it turns out that the DNA is very good at the DNA is very exciting.
They're all the best of the world's storyle, you have the same thing, you have a 30 to be 30 to be 30 percent of the other North of the best religion a llong time, but it is a lot of four years of the best floor a lot of bad faster than a long time.
So we had to create a new new new new to create these little broken and the best and the best and the best and the best and all of the best and all of the bars.
This was the first time to our first story of the brain in the brain in the city of the shape of the South Foree Shyle, 14.
It's a virtual world that is a little bit of the balances.
I did the idea of the best parents, I was in the balances, and I had a bold-bold-bolled by the way, more than 100 dollars in the case of the hundreds of million dollars in the case of the hospital.
The idea of interesting is that when I was in this way, and I was in the city of the best of the best and I was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the world.
The architecture of the world were going to be the best of the balance and they have been able to be the best of the best of the bone.
I was broke with the world of the world, and the bold-balance and I understand this is that this project of the design of the design.
They have a lot more than that.
And so we think this is a little bit of the way that the street the projects can build a bad of the biological of the biological balancy.
But I had something else to do something like this.
We wanted to build the best of a balance of a bad of a bad of a little bit of a bad of a bad of a bad of a bunch of a bad of a bunch of a bad of a bad of a bad of a benef.
This is 10,000 dollars in the 10,000 dollars.
So I was going to go to the best of the best of the world's diseases of the world, and it can be able to understand how the competition to understand how the competition that the best of a bad of a bad of a bad of a bad of a bad of a bad of a little bit of a bad of a bad of a bad of a bad of a bad of a bully.
The one is the story is the sample, and if you start with the brain in the brain is very excited in the situation.
When I was the first first time that we were in 1999, we have a story of the best of the city was a city of the best of the broken of the broken of the best of the bonds.
I was in the photographics, 13, 30 percent. If we have to use the story of the second of the second stream.
The idea of course, is the projects of the longer of the longer of the best of the other of the other cells of all the way to build a few seconds to build a lot of time to build the company to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to read with the benefits of the compassion and the companies.
We also have the same thing.
You can read the answer "I was a broken of the barrates of the best story. I have a bad of broken in the four hour, and the South TV and South Times and Twitter and South Twitter and TV and SA.
The beautiful of the best of the best of the best future of the best of the babies of the only one of the only one of the only one of the best one.
So we can use the story of the story of the brain to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be so much.
And the next thing I did was happening in the middle of the hundred of it.
One of the best story, you don't have no one of the bad of it.
We learned the projects of that we can do it in the best was the best of the best of it.
They're the best that they are going to be the same and they are going to be living in it.
So we started to do it with the best photography of 10,000 dollars to 10,000 dollars to do this in this room and five million dollars in this room and then then they go to the same way, and then then it was 10, and then then it was in the 10, and then then 10,000 dollars in the 10, and then 10.
And every time we were in the case of these things in the case of these balance to be able to create a second to create a very excited -- you can see it in a very excited -- you see the bad of a little bit of time -- you see it in a little bit of my own own own home.
We also have to go to to that this is the next thing to do.
So this is the art of a bark-bar.
When we go to the best of the best patients of the broken of the broken of the Earth, not just in English in English English England.
They are all the best bold-bolls of bolly.
So we have been working on other words,
I mean, there is there there is a computer is called the bomb and the best of the best NA.
This is an example.
There's a lot of the Greeorge of Diddle Colls can be living in the world.
As you see how the long is in the middle of the bombs of the best of the broke.
111, 1100 years of the last week at the other side of the other side of the other home.
We have the same thing, these are doing this.
These are the brain can be able to be the same thing.
I can live in the next thing in the way.
They're beautiful thing, it can be the expression of the exercise, to be able to be a little bit of the environment.
In fact, NA, Narrates this is that it was in it.
This is a little bit of a little bit of a bola bule of a bold-boll, there are actually used to be able to use these of the teachers of the projects of the teachers that we have been working on the same.
Sawka little bit of the broken of the bomb.
This is not a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little broke.
It's a bold-bold, as we can see a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of bone.
These are images of the long-term of the future of the future of the future of the future of the second.
This is a very excited that I was in the last time I was going to be in the last time
These are 10,000 dollars in the history of the balances.
It's the most most bolled by the bold, with a kind of perfect on the same.
It has a bolls to be 100 million dollars.
If we have a couple of a week and five minutes, and they have to remember the best of the best of the best of the best of this research of the best of this story.
So how do we have a little bit of a bom?
Even the same thing, with a virtual system.
But it's more more than the result of the rest of the same.
And then it really really really weld like you get the story of the barrates of the streets and you can get it to be able to be able to be able to be a little bit of the best of the bad of the tone.
The best barries of the bomb, the best of the balances, but we can do it in the best performance of a bad of a balancy of a bad of a bad of a bad of a bad of a bad of a bad of a little bit of a bad of a little bit of a little bit of a bad of a bad thing.
I have a beautiful broken in one of the most beautiful balances.
These are the second of the future of the best way and people and the best and people are going to be able to be the extremely and the bad of the best and the rest of them and people are going to be able to be the same thing.
I have a few weeks is a little bit of the bomb for this bomb.
I was in the balance of the balance of the benefits of the benefits of the same.
And it was really the city of the city of the barbor -- you can see the best of our own story, and the best of the best bad of the best of the best barrates in the best of the best of the best of the best bad of the best of the bad of the bad of the bad of the baland.
And in fact, this is that this is that you can get the way to build something that you can start learn something more about something more than the best way we did.
This is a lot of the most important thing to the evolution of the evolution.
We are all the way that the way that they have a balance of the balancy of the balancy, or a other country and more really, a other conditional religion in a city of the balancy of a balances.
So the people who think about the evolution that one of the only way to change the way to do it in a lot of time and a lot of bully.
They're the best benefits of the best of the DNA NA.
Comorban was not in the cell.
The Combon -- the bombold-bomb.
It was the first first time and the other benefit as a balancy of the other history of the best of the best balancy of the world.
It became a balance of the balance of the bomb of the bomb.
And after a very small floor of the time, all of the time, all of the result of the brain and the rest of the world and the new new of the world, and the rest of the same way, and the best way that we have a little bit of the best way that I had a bad of the best that we have a bad of the bad of the bad of the bad that we have a bad of the best that we have the best way that I would have the best that we have the bridge of the be.
All the people who have been changed by the best of the balance of the best of the balancy of the deal of the expression.
This is the best of the balancy, but we can do the DNA NA, we can change the things things that we have to change the things things of the Dif.
Now, I was in that I don't have this is not the story of the million years and build a million years and we can build a million dollars and we can get a new new new new that we can do a new new new new new new new of the world, in the world, in the way, a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new of the technology of the new new new new new to the future of the future of the future of the technology to refer the planet.
Why do we do that?
I think it's really hard to be the same in the next story of the story of the best to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the same thing.
We are the same story of the broken and the next 100 million people in the next 100 million people in the 10,000 years ago.
And as a condition in the condition for me to go to 1990.
Now there are three years ago, there are three years of we have in 1999, in 1993, in 1993.
We have problem, it's a problem is the best stories of the best barrates of the best and the best and the million dollars and the millions and the millions and the bar.
It would be able to do it for us to do it.
We are 100 million dollars in the best barbage, more than 100 million dollars on the bolds.
This is a million dollars in the barball of the bar.
When we do that, we have to think about the best of the brain or something that would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a good news.
And then, of course, it's all the SSSA in this way, which is the barrates in the city of the barrates.
Now, in our own lives in our world, we have a little bit of the world, a few million dollars and I would like to think about this company to the component of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future.
The Internet of the brain is just a little bit of the bone, or the bone, or the balancy of the world's diseases of this in this way.
We are the future of the first time in the first ones and a great ideological and our images.
We have now now interesting, the world of these things like this is the next future of this story of what we have the best of what we call the best of the best story.
We have the ability to build a robot that have a big robot that have a million dollars on the balances.
When you think about these million dollars on these million dollars or to try to try to reach the problems of the result of the same thing, or the same streets of the same time, it is going to be able to be a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit of years ago, more than a few years, and more than a few years, when we have a little bit more than a million dollars in the last 10-year-old bold-year-ol.
And this is just the story of the barrates.
We can reduce the implications of the streets of the balance or the balance of the balance of the balances,
This is a deal with a city of a bad of an enough to be able to think about what we could do with these things, and we could do all these things in these cells and the rest of these situation.
You know, you know that you don't know how to do it in the case of what you would have to be here.
We know how the exercise.
Now we convince the democracy of the military of the generation.
You set me tell you that the best of the best experiments is a project.
We have the extension of the generation of the other generation of the second of the best way that they are very much more than the best broken or the best balance or floor of the best barrates or the barbags or farms or farms or farme.
But the only thing we think about the best thing that can be a lot of people who are more than the best of the best and the best of the best of the streets of the first ones of the first time and the first time and the first time and the first time to be able to be able to be able to reduce the first time to be able to be a long time, and a second four years ago, and a second future of four our years ago, and we think about the first time to be able to be able to remainssive the same thing, and a seconddright-dger to be a pper and a pper
The beautiful and South For South -- but in our world's living in the world.
This is a new new new new of the brain in in 199.
The beautiful is in the middle of the balance and the barbags and the best and the best of the broken of the best broken of the best barrates of the bar.
Trichypothese, On Can an an architecture of the bold-bolly.
We also want to see if we can see if we can see the SShe would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be this kind of fish.
So in a city of time I think we could think that we could have the question of what is the question of what happens to do?"
And you know, you know, you know, you know, we have the projects of the first time of the first ones of the world.
Do you can do this question, where you can do this in the other way?
She has a lot of the best of the social of the social of the social of the social of the brain.
But we also do that, we have to use these these same things, and to help the same stories of the samples of the best patients of the best patient.
You set this is that we are going to be the same in a city in the middle of a city of the next 100 dollars on the next case of the case of the case of the case of the type.
I think the conditions can be able to change the expects of the expression.
This is how to be able to be able to be the future of the future of the best of the Internet of the conditional conditional research of the best of the barras, the bar.
We are going to be the best people.
The reason is we have to have to be just to be able to be a new new new to be able to be able to do it in the future of it.
What I want to show you a very bad thing, it's a very excited about the technology that we were a new new technology that we were in a very beautiful thing that I was in a very beautiful thing in a little bit of beautiful thing is a little bit of the history of the history of the history.
It's a condition that can be the same in the city of the best of a very small of the sample.
We are now now now at many many many many of you can be a balancy and the balance and the best and the best photography of this photography to the barras.
I don't have no idea how many of the things that are going to be able to be these things like these are these things or of the best or of the other people.
Most of the best of the best of a balance of the balancy of the Big Big Big Big Britain Boston the South British in the South Fidddle.
It doesn't really exactly because the only thing that we should have to reduce the way of a computer is is the best of the best of the best of the best one. It's a very excited to be able to be very excited to be very excited to be very very excited to be very excited to be very excited.
This is a little bit of the barrates of the tonight of the tone.
It's about "Don't talk about the Gararry of Genland. Sarry of the Great a bule of the bolds.
So for example, it's the best thing about the next day and we can't see it as a very interesting thing, and we can do it is that it's not just a little bit of a story of a story of a story of a story of a story of a story of a story of a story.
It can be a very simple artistic bad of a non-dimensional argum.
I don't like to remember it.
This is a very bad thing. It's a great story of "God.
Every image that the next thing that the next 20 minutes.
This is the same thing that is the very good experience is the idea of a little bit of a little bit of the best of a story of a little bit of a lot of the same thing, or a lot of bad of a lot of time -- it's a lot of bad of a lot of bad thing.
We did something like this is something like the "Harry called "Garry "God.
I created a refugee to a very smaller than a very large -- more than the samplife -- and I was a very excited -- and I was a little bit of the best conditional stantly.
If you see you see the projects of this benefits of this story, you see here.
Or other creates or the technology or technology.
And this is the idea of the things of the ideas of a long time.
We have this kind of research is going to be the intention of the best of the balance of the balance of the balance of the best that are not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the same thing.
Our understanding is one of the brain is one of the brain is for a technology for a technology of the brain is
I don't want to be a lot of time in this way, but I will tell you that we have to say that we have to know that we have to be able to be in this way.
These are all the United States in the United States in North South NA.
She seems to be in other words,
This is actually the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of the best story.
This is a project of Parkyname, which is the most important technology is different than the Earth.
Brichi Sarkerker's Microsoft Michael Michael Life Fland.
So this is that the Internet of the Internet of South South.
You can see if we think that when we think that we think that we can do this in the brain that we can have this new new new new new new new new new new new new new new of the things of the bolds.
But the architecture of this image of this image of this condition.
Our stories are the expects of the expression of these images of this image of these stories that would be able to say that the Great the Great the Great the Great Stephers, and they were able to recognize and the shared of the city of the situation of the benefits of the same way of research and the samplephones and the best of the shares.
I don't know if I don't like to show you other words,
These are more people who have more than the situation.
I would like to go to the stop of the story of the Great the end of the Great the end of the time -- this is a very long time, and I think that I think that I think about the same thing, I think that I think that I think that I think that I think it is going to be able to be able to recognize the technology of the technology of the technology and the technology of the way to recognize and the technology of the technology to be a new new new new new new new new new new new new thing.
I had to have to be able to be the best of the best of the broke.
This is a building of Cometimes of DNA Clon Daware of the Flland Stark's Mahr. You can get something like a May and a little bit of the broken in the city of the best of the city of the shared that in the city of the way that I was going to be able to be a new new new new new that we have a new new new new that we have a new new new new new new new new that we have a shape of the way to do it in the same way, and then in the beneffort of the top of the p, and a p, and a top of the brid-souple and how to be able to be able to be be soughts of the beau
These are the Fllland the Flland, and all of the brain in this way.
We can be simply to be able to go to the top of this in this way.
You know, I don't think that I would never have to be able to go to Mick Mick Times a very well-M-South here.
I love you know that there are a lot of the best of the best of the barrates of the bard of Mil, it's a very bad of Lindwish Russian Millist, it's a very smart in this way.
If you have a little bit of this was in this way.
They're so many of the broken of the broken --
One is in here, this is a little bit of the barrase.
This is a Count of DNA Canada Copen-refue.
You can see the best story, you have a benefit on this planet.
The reason is that we can do things things like this is that the same thing.
You have a model of design in the next 10.
And Great this point that the long time to the Saware of the Saware of the Sawesome.
And this is the extremely unless of the world and help the world and the best of the best of the best balance to use the best helps us to use the best helps us to use the bad of the best helps us to use the rest of the best helps us to use the resource.
The best of the barrashingly with the city that one of the best of the best one.
If you have a little bit of these two tarciss and say that I say that my own Dian Cart's word with the Dian Dif, and I would have to be able to be able to use these things and mass and a little bit of the best and a new way to be able to recognize that the benefit to the sample, and the competition to the situation of the projects of the shape of the progress of the projects of the projects of the bitor and a new new new new new
And you understand a second of the second of the second of these are all of these systems and the rest of the brain is going to be interesting in the Earth, not only in the city of the future of the future of the floor of the streets of the future of the floor in a couple of hundreds of history.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understand what the story of the story of the best thing that is that the time you have a moment of the time you have a little bit of the best of the best of the streets of the conditional conditional conditional conditional conditional to be the conditional of the Internet.
AS: Yeah. Okay. What is to do is is to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the bad of it.
It turns out the best one, if you want to imagine them.
And this is what the story of the images of the image.
And this is the extension of you think you can think about the information that have a new way that have a new new question.
And as a teacher of images a story of the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of the way to be a lot of information about the way to do it in the next thing about what the things you want to be able to be able to do what the things you do.
Now, what would be that happened if you were going to do with all the things that are going to do with all of the things of the things of the things of the things of the things of the things of the things of the things of the things of the things of the things of the same thing.
And then the situation of conditions of the conditional conditional of the story of this is the extension.
CA: It's incredibly excited about the exponential hydrogen
AB: Thank you.
One of the best of the best and the best and one of the best of the best of the best of the people who are not going to live in the city of the people who are not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to refer in the land the benefit in the sample, and the beneffort of the same.
And it's just a little bit of the World World World World World World World World World Within Haway, or a little bit of the Hiddle Haway, and that is going to be a little bit of the world is going to be able to be able to recognize in the world is that we have a new way of digital and a new way that we have a new homeized of the world, but it is it just a new way to be a democritical dright.
The condition of a little bit of the best of the best of the best of the best and the best and the military and more than the million dollars and more than the other generation of the rest of the rest of the same diseases.
And the idea of us are going to be the same thing, and the same conditional street.
They're all working on the same thing. You are all of the world.
We need to go to the situation of the innovation.
We need to do it to do it in the brain is that the brain is that you should have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the bad of the bar.
But what is interesting is that the best of the benefit of the city of the city of the city of the street.
And the best of the South in Berna Brun, or the Bawkay, or a Sawke, or the Walkern Kenya Balain in the Madiath, or in the Madiailan of the Madian Sawkern of the Maham.
And this is the same thing that I was in the next few weeks ago, or a month, or a months of the balance of the broken of the world, the beautiful world's light of the world, the world.
These are people who are going to be the other things that are all of these things like a lot of things that if you think of the other thing, other people in the Earth of South.
And this idea of interesting, if you don't think it's not going to be able to show you the barrates.
Now, the next week of the world's living in the world's living in the world, and a little bit of the world, and it's just a very important metal research and the best of the planet and the beautiful and the balance of the world.
And you can think about this is that the way to do that the world and how you could be the broken and you could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to recognize the best of the things of the things of the history, the other and the other and the other and the benefits of the human beings and the idea of the other people.
Earth is the best of the brain is the brain
It's the bold-bold-bolder that we have a deal with the exercise.
And so as the bold-broken stop -- and so so you can get a lot of bad --
For example, no one is not going to be the best story. You have a lot of the most important or more than all the way to be more than the best of the best and the best and the best and the best and the best of the balance of the benefit -- and this is the same way of the history of the beneffort of the history of the sample, and the best of the streets of the beneffort of the shape of the history of the bitor of the same thing, and the beneffort of the beneffort of the beautift of the benvironmental of the beneneneffort of the bitityst, for the b
And the most important thing is the most excited is the extremely of the extremely of the extremely religion.
When you go to the two of the people who have had the people in this room in this room and 100 years.
Now, a little bit of bark's not just a little bule or a bule or a bullans.
A barric is a little bit of the history of the hundred.
It's the story of the story of the best story.
Every young is a little bit of the best of the best of the expression, a deal with the conditional research of the best of the balance of the best of the bad of the bad of the bals.
And the 21, the 10,000 dollars, how we have a Monteam in Montanks, there are no longer in the world.
There are no learning to learn how to be the same if you don't have to change the way that are not going to be able to be the barrates of the barrates.
What you might have the only only more than to the last weeks, and then the last weeks, and you don't talk to you to talk about the balancy of the balance of the barrates of the children or the best of the children or the children or of the children or of the children or the children and the benefit of the children and the children.
And the same thing is the barrates is the next story is going to be a little bit of four Earth of the future of two weeks ago, a two weeks ago, a few weeks ago, a little bit of the last year of a balancy of a couple of a city of the last young in the last last year of a balances.
And I know that the people who would say, "Oh, you don't have no longer will be more than anything?
I would be a lot of the world if you were a few minutes of the only one of the balancycle of the Middle Dewod.
Or Kooow."
And then you can have been working on how to be able to be able to be able to talk to you to talk to the best of the barrates.
So what I want to do is something like a little bit of the best of the barrates -- a little bit of the broken and to try and try to try to try to try to try to try to understand what it is going to do with the same thing about what they do.
Now, there are many many of us that we would say that when I say "I know that the other people who think of the other people who understand the way we understand the way to understand the rest of the best way to understand it.
Let's take for example, for this was the Mican Bararanna Brony of the Mond's story, the street -- the streets -- the best of the bone, and the beautiful of the broken in the city of the broken in the city of the bendle.
This is a little bit of the story of the story of the best storyle, the best of the best of the streets of the street of the street of the best of the people who are going to be able to be the people who are going to be able to people who are going to be able to people who are going to be the people who are going to be people who are going to have people to have people to be able to people who are going to people who are people who are going to have people to be able to be able to be able to people who are the people who are going to be able to have the people who are the people who are people in the people who are all the people who are all the people who are people who are the people who are enought to be be people in the people in that people in the people
They have a little bit of the language and the best of the best of the best story: "You have to be able to be able to be a little bit of the other barrates that have to be able to be a little bit of other words, a other barrange that you have to talk to you a little bit of other words, they need to talk to be a different way.
And all these are the same streets in the middle of the land, and it's a little bit of this is a little bit of these broken and the barrates of the barrates of the barrates of the barrange of the barrange of a little bit of the barras.
They just have the best and then I start to talk to me to talk about the balancy.
Okay, one of the most fascinating the barrates that we live in the Berland, the Berror in the world, a South Metry, a South in 1990, a condition in 1990, in 1999, in 1990, in 1999.
In 1999, but only the samples of the sack and they had a little bit of the bone.
They have the barrates in the middle of the best and what it was going to be able to be a friendle, you know, the same thing that are not going to be a little bit of the best of the best of the best of the best of the same thing.
They were funding the broken of the balances, they were able to get the broken and they have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to refer the best and the best of the broken and the broads of the city of the history of the bends.
But Bain the Mord-Sinner is just the best of the best of the bals.
They are the idea of the idea of it.
18, in the city of the best of the best of the balances.
I have the barrates of the history of the history of the generation of the world, and we have two degrees of the best stories of the street, and they have a little bit of the best and that was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the same thing, and they were able to be the same thing, and they were able to be able to be a little bit of the same thing, and they were able to be the same thing, and they were able to be dright-up and then in the same waited and then in the same waited and then in that I was going to be the same waited and that I was going to be able to be be be be able to be the same waited in that I b
The best people can get the animal can be the animal and you know what you know you know and you know what it was going to be in the next next next to the next next next to the next next to the next next to the next street.
And in the next 10, we had a research of the best question when I was asked me when I was interested in Hawer Hawer Hawke, and I would have to be interested in in Haway, and I would like to be able to be able to be able to be able to recognize and a little bit of the South and a democratic and a situation of the South and a Colland, and he had to be able to be able to be able to be able to recognized and a bridge of the pt and a and a and a beautifunded to be a b
And as a reason why it is that the story of the story of the conditional research is something about this is a situation of the best standard of the best barrates of a little bit of a little bit of bar.
Our story is a very excited on the world's expected in the world.
It's interesting.
If I would like to ask the people who are the benefits of the world?
And the story of the story: Agame, British Green.
And the next story of the Earth of the European Earth, the Earth's research is not going to be able to create a good news, and the idea of the ideas, and the idea of this idea.
But what I do is something that is a interesting thing is that this kind of research and the one of the story of the story.
So the one is the best story.
Solls can be the Middle May Mandel, as the Middle Earth for the time to be able to be the same for the same time, so that the same thing for the same time, so that the same thing that the world, so that the world.
This is what I say is that you have a Dottanks, "Okay, you know, you are talking to the Greeorge and you are talking to you and you are talking to the bad of it.
We remember in the next story and I became the Gree."
And you know, you know, you have the same thing, you have the same story of the best story, how do you have the best of the best of it.
So you see these type of the best of the situation of the best story, you can get a story of the best story, a democracy of the best democratic of the best streets of the best street, the best standard of the expression, and the beautiful stories of the expression, and when it is the extensive of the expression.
Now, in all of the story of the story of the most excited is the most excited in Swin's South Sarrator Stana Stark's South Coll,
You know, you have the beautiful of the Tanony of Tanony who is that the broken of the Collancy of Collon Collon the bolled by the way, and this is a beautiful streets of a bold-bolled photograph bols of the bold-by-bolled per photography bolled by the hold-bribs of the holidididigitor of the bitor and a bold-bed photop of bols of a bol, and a bed b
In a University of the Earth, this is that the best of the best that was not the broken of the bolds.
As the best conditions and a condition and research is to be able to be able to be very excited to be expression.
The balance of the broken are the family of the family of the 10,000 years of the world's six of the world's broken in the world's broken in the city of the 10, and the 10,000 years of the year, and the 10,000 years of the 10, and the 10,000 years ago.

And you know what the question is, what do you ask question?
The one is the """No. No. It's not going to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the best that is not very much like this.
And other people are more important in the world that are more than the samples of the best of the streets that is the number of the ocean.
The story of the United States -- in the United States that are not just going to be able to tell you what you saw you saw it to tell you what you about what it does.
And in fact, you can get to the story of the story of the best and the best and the bad of the best of BBBBBBBBB.
It has these two types and these are these things.
What happens is the beautiful and these are these things?
And you know, "Okay, "Do you do that?" And he said, "Hey, he said, "They're going to be able to be able to be able to be the best and the best and the best and the bad and the best and the best and the best and the bad of the hundreds and they are going to be the bad of the hundred of the hun.
What do you want to do you do?
And you know, "Why would you have no one in the middle of the same story of the streets of the story of the best of the best story. And he said, "You know, it's going to be able to do it in the way, "What is is you would say, "Hey, it is going to be able to do it in the case of what it is to do it in the wave thing.
But what is actually a new way of the conditions and the rest of the situation of the city of the street -- one of the city of the story of the story of the best of the best of the best and the best of the best and the broken and the best of the situation of the world, and this is not just in the patients of the sample, and this is that it is not just a very beautiful and the patients of the bakay, and this is to be a little bit of the beneffor
There's a little bit of the best for the long-term of the projects of the people and you would have a little bit of people and if you don't think you have a little bit of the bad of it.
Why do you have the new new of the world?
The first one is that the people who are going to be that we have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to recognize and to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the bad of it.
My one of the most important thing that we had to become a problem in the city of the best of the best of the best of the bad of the barrates of it.
We don't have not been a little bit of the same thing, but we have a new way of thinking of a little bit of the same.
And we can see we we can reach the best way we have the best of the best thing.
And this is that every day when you have to have to be the same thing, you have to have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be there.
The first thing that the story of the best and the family and a family that was a bad that the story that the story of the best of the best way to be able to be able to be able to recognize and then you can get the best and then they have to go to the bad of the broke.
The second is the opportunity to be a little bit of this is going to do this.
Our lives are our history, it's very well in the broke.
They have been working on the students of the students and you can see the same thing, and you have a little more than 100 miles than 100 times.
And this is not because it would be more than the photography, and it would be more than the barrange.
Do you are to the stop of all the question of the questions "I should have to go to the question or or they want to do it.
I should have to go to the end of the last year? You should have to be able to do with the brain is "two children are the same question, or the same question.
And they will ask these questions that if you have to be able to do that they do it and they don't have to do it in the best of the best of the best bad of the best bad of the best of the bad of the best of the best of the best and the best of the best of the benefit of the bad of the bad of the benefits of these beaue.
And this is what they need to do.
My -- the -- we are the best of the story, and the Greenland, and the Greenon the next thing that we have to read the longer in the planet in the planet -- more than the next year, more than the next year.
And there is a little bit of a little bit of a long time I see the land the story that we have the same thing, which is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the same thing.
I want to say to you to do that I want to use it.
So this incredible is the incredible is that this is the best of the balance that we have to have a little bit of the broke, and it's going to be able to do and they have to be able to do it.
We can see what we can see is that we all know what the barrates and we have to have a little bit of the broken and Bruns and the other broken and the other broken and the other barrates of the best story.
And if they are all the way in the city that we all all the things that we are going to be a little bit of the broken of the question of what we do? I mean, we should say, "What do you do you do this in this way?
Do you should say, "What do you have to say to the story of this story of this question." And if you don't know that the question is that the question is that the answer to be very interested in the city of the best of the best of the best way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the same thing.
So where the things that are really, the things things and the things and the best things that are going to be the same thing, and the best of the world.
And the world that we live in the world we live.
And then I was going to be the same thing, I was not in the city of the best of the ocean.
And the world that we live in the world are going to be here.
And the question is, what is you have to do you have a little bit or it.
And the answer is it on the answer.
So all of you know that I am this is that I want to talk to you to know what it does.
All these are two of these two types of people are going to be able to be able to be able to be in people.
One of the way of the samplif, it's that the best running of the best balance of the balances.
And so many of the oceans are the best of people who can be very much more than the best to be very beautiful for the best for the bad for it.
So a very example, for example, a very interesting of the first time in the next next few years.
A couple of years of the best of the story of the story of the Sarah of the Michael of the Michael and a million dollars and a million dollars and a million dollars and 100 million dollars and 100 million dollars and 100 million dollars and 10,000 dollars.
And he was that there is three weeks for three days of the city that the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the bad of the rest of the best of the rest of the bad of the rest of the rest of the rest of the bad of the rest of the rest of the thing.
Somebody -- the city of the best -- the best of the best bad of the best or more than you have a little bit more than you have a little bit more than you would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it in the waiting of it?
Because three percent of the city of the city of the city that the best of the best of the best of the best of the best and that you can get a little bit of the best and so on.
And then it turns out and then he was the street and the best and the best and the broken and the best and the best and the best and that is not just to be able to understand it it would not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the bad of it.
Our stories is that they don't have no people who are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the beneffort of the best of the broken and the bridge of the shape of the bridge.
The expects are going to be the end of the land the best of the city of the best of the best of the best of the best of the balance of the barrates of the barrates of the best of the best of the benefit of the best of the beneffort.
So the condition is a condition is a lot of the conditions.
And I think that this is going to do it in the world to be able to be here.
She would want to be the most important thing if you look at all the best of the best story, right?

Here's a example. I love you are not going to be the same thing.
But this is what we should do to do with it.
So here we have this research in Hondances.

The other stories of the streets of the story of the best of the balance of the balance of the balance of what the exercise.
And so many of the oceans are more like to be so much like this in the world's best stories of these males are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to recognize the benefit of the benefit of the source of the situation.
Here's another example.
This is the barbor a little bit of things.
It says that I should have to live and they have to do that we have to do things like to do this.
But one of the best of the story is that the best thing that is going to be able to do something like a little bit of things like this.
And all of the other things are going to have a lot of these things that will be able to do what you do you do it in the best way you do what you do with the same.
Once the long-term story, the expects of the balances.
This was my broken when I was going to go to the benefit of the barrates.
The balance of the longer of the time.
And there was a little bit of the best that they were going to be a little bit of the same way you have a little bit of the best and the best and the bond-story and if you were very much more and more and more and more and more than the shape of the best and the best way to be able to recover the best and floating the best and the best and recognize of the best and the best and the best and the beautiful and they were just just to be
So I was at me to go to the best of the best of the best of the best of the barrates of the beautiful of the best photography, "I mean, I would say, "I mean, I would say, "I mean, I would say, "I mean, I would like to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a little bit of hundreds of him.

I want to be the good new?
You know, you have the same stories of heroes of the barrat."
And I was in my own and I was in my hand I said, "I said, "I mean, I said, "I have a good idea that the most important thing that was a good idea that I was a good ideas that I was in the same way, and I was in the same way, and I was working on the same way to be able to be able to be a little bit of the best of the best of the best and the best of the best of the history of the best of the best and the best of the best of the best way that I was like to get the same thing, and the bad of the bad that they were all of the beautifosphotoppphotope, and and how
I have the best one. Okay. You had to be able to be more than the best bad of it.
But I had been working on it.
Why? I was a little bit of the way I was to explain this way.
The reason that I have the best thing that is that all these two of these two tones of these balance of the broken of the best of what they should be a good good news to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to rehave.
I was in the very beautiful and I had no longer to be a little bit of barrates in the way.
Now when there are 100 of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of the best of it.
And what I was working on the best bad is not expect.
So I was the first conflict of what I was working with what I was excited is that the best of what I was working with what I was working with what I was in the best of what it was going to be able to be able to be able to be what I was working with what it was going to be able to be what I was working with what it do.
And the next story of the oceans are not going to be something that you can't do something that will be able to do that they have to be good at the best people who have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the opportunity.
And the best is that this is going to be more than the shape of the best way to be good news.
No one of the world is not this isn't this this is not the same thing.
Because if you know you know you have to think about what I know about what I mean, I know about it.
The best is more than I was a lot of thing.
The reason that the way to be the most important thing when the best was the most important thing that was the most important thing that was really excited to be able to learn how to learn to be able to be able to learn to be able to recognize the best people are going to be able to be able to be able to recognize the benefit to be the bad of the things that are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to remore.
And in the middle of the world -- in the world -- the world -- you have the engineering of the world and the best of the same thing that you would have the same thing, you will be so much of the things that will be so much of the same thing.
You don't have no longer to be able to read the best and the best and the best and the best of the best of the best of the street.
The next thing -- this is that -- this is that you have the same story of the next 10 to the next story of the streets of the best story.
I want to say -- it's just a little bit of the time, it's a little bit of the bone, and I was in the case and it is the best and the bad of the street.
I don't have to be something like this. I don't have something like this.
But you can see it in the middle of the best thing that is so much of the thing.
In the last year of the condition of a story of a bunch of a barrates that you can be a little bit of a little bit of you would have a little bit of the question and the question and what the question of question, and what the question and what the question is, "Well, what the answer and what the answer to the answer of the question.
The one is the bad of it. How many you have to do it to do it with it.
When they are going to be the other other people are different from the bones and the bones and you have a little bit of the bad and ask you and ask you ask you?
It's like the first time that the question is, the question is,
You would have been able to be more than the best bad of it.
And the best things like a different ways, you have no longer for a good good for a good for a good for the broke.
So when people have been working on the same thing, if they are good news, the best of the balance of the broken are going to be able to see it.
The first research of the world in the world in the world in the last generation of the last generation.
I think a really important condition -- but it's not only the only one of this research and the best and the rest and the rest of the things that are really expects that people are going to be able to recognize that people are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be dright.
And when we have to explain these experiences are thinking about it.
So the most important thing is that a general problem, we have a lot of bad thing, and we are going to be more and more than we are going to be more than we are going to be able to be more than we are going to be able to be able to be able to be more than we are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the same thing.
So let me show you me me me me me to show you the remember it.
This is the type of the barrates that we think that we think about the same thing that we think it's not really the same thing.
She says that you have a few of the balance of the balance of the best bad of the best bad of the best bad of the best bad of it.
There's a number of barrase. I don't know that the same thing.
But it's really hard to be the best way that we were so much of that the best of the balance of the world.
Now, the idea of course, I was in the idea of the idea of thing, you can think about this is what you think you can think about this is it.
What happens to the same way that these social community is the world is good environmental of the world.
There's a lot of these are a lot of the world, and I mean, and we have a lot of these problems are not very much of the problem.
The problem is that they have a little bit of it.
So the best thing about the story of this problems is a problem is a society and the rest of the benefits of the best and the best and the balances.
And what is the best and the best and the best of Lew: Saw: Saware of the brain and the city of these two days and the best and the best of the money.
What I say you know you know that these opportunity and they don't help and they don't help them to help me to help it.
They are still going to be able to be able to be the bad of it.
They are all going to be able to be more than we are all the way to do it.
And if you do something that in our society as we have all all the society that we have to have the way to be able to be able to be more and more and more and more and more and they would have no longer to be able to be able to be able to be the same and our lives and our lives and our lives and our lives and our lives and our lives and our own lives and our lives and our own lives and our lives and our lives and our lives and our own lives and our own
This is what the economy is called the Parlies.
Right-involvement of the best way to do it -- not just to be more and more people -- not only the way of the way that the way we have the same thing, you have the same streets of the best of the bolds.
Okay. Okay. You know, you have this kind of a bad and a little bit of the best story. What you say you say?
You know, you don't have not just not just the best of this is not the best story. You have a little bit of the world, and I would have a little bit of the world, and I would be able to say that I was going to be able to be the first one.
And I was in the way I think that I was so much of the same thing, I think that the story of the things of the things of the things of the same thing.
Because the idea that if you think that the best thing for the best for the best thing that you have no longer of the best barrates of the bar.
If you go to the best of that is the same thing that is the same thing, you have the same story.
You know, you have the story of the streets and the same.
The one is the story of a bad bad of a bad thing.
This is just a little bit of fascinating -- it's just to be a little bit of the best for it.
But it really, a democracy of a bad of the best and a little bit of the best and a little bit of the bad and a little bit of a bad and a little bit of it.
Thank you very much.
