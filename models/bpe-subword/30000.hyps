As you see the blue of the blue of the blue inched it.
This is the gaps of analyze of the time for a while
And they walk out of the window.
This is the gaps of the permanent of a five-year-old old old or more than five or more than a body, you can see that the samples from a body.
In 25 years came from this way, to that at this time.
This is a problem because the inquisitation of the ocement of the ocean.
where it is a massive massive carbon where they did, when they disappear, when they did, it's transformed in metan micro-organisms.
The pollution of the total, the total, the inquiring of global inquire in the atmosphere, if we could go to the extremely extremely extremely extremely extremely extremely what we do.
And in certain a certain a certain Alaska metage, in Alaska metapholific metapholos.

This is the reserve reserve water.
And so I read how you read you read it is seriously seriously you read it.
And the global global long-term created dramatically and incentive.
And the degrees apart all the global of the globe, they raised with a absolutely runded and the precedented and the precedented and the precedented and the far.
Fours more in the last 30 years later in the last 30 years.
This is a shadow model.
If you look at the context historical context of what you can see is what you can see is what it happen.
In the last five years we added 70 million tones of carbon every 24 hours of carbon every day 25 million tones every day in every day every day in the oceans.
The universe of the attention to the Pacific, the Western of the Pacific, and all of the subcontinent and every part of the individual oxygen.
The biggest cause of the global warms of global despair, which is about 20 percent of it, which is the fossil fuels in it, is the fossil fossil fossil fossil fuels.
The pecular is a problem, and the books.
The United States is one of the two masters, the other hemistry of China.
And the proposal was building that more fabrics for many fabrich.
But we start to see a change total.
Here are the last year, the last year, with alternative alternative proposition.
All there was a fight of our politics in our country.
And the industry industry and the oil of oil and the oil of oil in the last year, a billion dollars in the last year.
The carribon what is a current of what is a oximoron.
This picture of something.
In the prepore Cracier Tennessed, a billion galogaloes of galogys,
You probably see at the stird of stirly.
This is all the way that the case of your case in America in the South America in the preported Cracier Cracier.
One of the carbon industry in the industry around the days, a couple of the Cracier was this.
Video: She was a cargoal with carbon and is a happy suffering and vessel.
He is from abundance, here in America, here in America, and helping to create economic growth of economic growth.
Frost, the carbon that day is where I go to the day that I go to the more current of what happens.
He is access and adorably and adorably workers and the workers of shape of job.
Al Gore: This is the surgery of the Great in Vest.
The biggest way of carriot is the biggest of Massey Coal.

Al Gore: So the Alian's delights for the Climate of Climate the Take of Climate campaign campaign campaign.
This is one of them, a part of them, a part of it.
Video: ALergy new armed new armed changes as a very serious three-intent three-driven three-driven living for business to business our business.
And that's why the principle is to spend a great survey of money for a large amount of public spot that we were so going to help us to help us and complicated the carbon about carries.
The thing is that the carbon is not dirty carbs.
We think it's quite quite -- and the mirrasse.
So not going to go for climate change for climate change for climate change
Later that we go to our hands.
Video: The cockroach, you heard a mapper graphics about it.
So let's do a young honest tube a tube a team of cargoes of carried carribs.
Haimics! Masinaria is kind of like the gomots.
But this is the sound of technology sound the sound of the current of the current of the current.
And as the carbon is one of the principal cause of the incomcalious global warms of the carbon that you see here you see the way you see here.
The next few attentions, this is technology today of the carbon top of the carbon top of the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of carbon
Al Gore: In the alternative alternative alternative with the economic challenge of the economic problem.
Video: Narrator: The economy is in the national national crisis of national crisis.
The thing that they have to leave all the way to do that we have nothing that we have a bottom basically carbon: carbon disease.
But now we have a new solution to the inside of the incurately to ies;
Right? The energy American electricity with the electricity of 100 years ago ago before in 10 years ago.
A plan to the bottom in the third of the stopping and sure the opportunity to help the stopping of global stopping the stopping of global stopping in the global war.
In the sentence, a solution that is ended up to solve our problems.
The energy of America. You know, you have more than America.
Al Gore: This is the last year.
Video: It's about re-energy re-energy re-energy re-energy red.
One of the faster way to inside the faster dependent dependent fuel dependent fuels that kinds of fuel who knew it is here in the software is here in the wind, the sound of the networks.
Barbed nr.2: We invested the jobs to create job.
Narrator: The America. It's the time for actissue.
Al Gore: There is a verb verb verb of the verb that says, "If you want to go back to the next thing you want to go back and go quickly.
If you want to get you to go out and walk!
We have to get faster far away.
Thank you very much.
And the last year, I did a LHC.
And I got to go to and give you a little bit of how it works.
So here's the home. And the people who didn't have been here, LHC is the most experiment is the most experiment that was trying to ever began to 27 kilometers -- Ciruminess or is about 27 kilometers to be able to create the conditions of times in the second -- the last second to the second -- the millions of times -- the last second to 600 billion times -- the million times -- the last few billion times of the universe --
It's extremely ambitious.
This is the apart of Geneva.
We put photos of these minds of mind Big Bangs" in the interior of the decades.
I work on this way. It's called the ATLASTLASSTLASSS, Four, 144 meetings of 22 meters photography here of the ATwo photography in building the AT's proport.
On the year of the year I went to the top for the first time.
And this picture was made by ATLAS.
He cause a huge case in the room in control camera camera camera camera camera
It's a picture of the first fascycle that has quite been on the inside of the inside of LHC, the LHC, the car LHC, the case of LHC, I could, the worker in LHC,
In other words, when I was set that picked up to the 10 sequence of 10 sequence as a huge apart that is a huge successful for a huge success.
I don't know if that was the largest ovatives, or that somebody went on on the page, when somebody went on on the page, and he seek that first page.
It means that I did a cultural impact on the language of stick.
After apart a seven seven a sapart, I had a problem with the apart, which was actually with these firefer -- these fires.
Those are the transportation of 13 thousands of maximum works.
Now, the engineering is looking at these physics and say, "I can't translate the attention of him, I can translate myself."
But I can do that for the time when I'm at temperatures are going to be what they call the time.
So as a 271 degrees of the star as a house of the star of the star of the star of the case can translate this way.
At one of the other of the other 1,000 magnetworks.
So as the competitive was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressioning as those magnetwork, as those 20 tons, and they fly over 20 tons, and they fly over 20 tons, and they fall over 30 crazy.
So I deteriorated by 50 ximately magnetwork.
And I had to go affaway, what we were doing.
We reconted them on the tox, I repaid.
And now we go to the magnetitiate back to subterms back to subteran.
Lana farming of his mother apart in LHC will be as as a new thing.
We're going to go out again, and we have asked to get data to the if, and we continue to get the research or hundred or to find out that are the elements to be elements to be elements to be elements of the universe.
Now, of course, like these in a way, those those accidents reopen discussions of recognizing and engineering and engineering to reject to breath.
I think that the data is so that this is so difficult to be so difficult to be in the fact that we have a young experiments like HCHC.
I'm going to leave the word words, the word in a man of British Davy, Humphrrey Davy, which, when I think about the involvement of the involvement of the protect of the insight of the mind of our minds of minds are not more dangerous for our minds are not going to be dangerous and assumption are of our minds of terrible workers:
Thank you.
I wanted to start with the assemble to remember a child of children, when you play with board and a few players.
And then the money invented to the water and go to the choice and choose to get them and teacher and teacher and actually come and get to figure out how to figure out how to solve the issue and manipulate the relatively and manipulate the spatial and manipulate their spaced and the mother's mother's mother's mother's months.
The space is the professor is the profound as intelligence of how we intelligence.
So as we can see a research of IT inspired by this useful interaction with our physical interaction with our physical objects -- impressed my phant, and my collaborator -- I started to go back to my father -- I started to go back to the case -- I was going to be able to a mouth of this midddle and we can get a mouthern and the receive fishers,
And how we want to do it again?
And the question was so fascinating fascinating to ascinated the asslide to ask the Siftable.
And then a Siftable Sift-interaction computer computer bisces.
They can be manufacturing the perceive perceive the perceive one other, and they can perceive the food and a food, and a relationship.
And the most important is that there are palpable to get the games, like you can missing them as just as just as just as just as just watching it as just watching it as just watching the water
And Sifeth example, a new ecosystem cyclever of a new manipulation of digital information of digital information
On the mash of these instruments becomes more constants of their missing foot of their missing constants to each other, and constants on our actissues and destruction to explore our active active and degrees of interactive and distractive.
I'm going to start with a few examples of the simple example.
This Siftable is configured to predict video game, and if you can include in a direction, the rule of the movie in the other parts of the other parts of the part, the rule of the other parts of the other parts of the other parts of the other parts of the Sifts.
These portraits of interactive are constants one of the other ones.
So, if they put them on the other way to do anything else is interested in interest.
If there are inconnected and that, and they can get this and that, and they can become confusion.
I can feel like the missing and inclining.
We realized that one of the involves interesting interactions, interacties is like we can use gestures to manipulate the samples like to be a little bit like a culture of a license of a license of a license of a license of a license of it.
In this case, we have three Sifables configured as galets like the galets and they can use them to reach in the bottom where they will reach in the bottom where they will reach out of the case in the center of this case in the case of this case in the case of this case, we have been three Siftables that have Sift
If I went too much, we can get the inside inside the inside inside the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inair.
There's also interesting the possibility of education, like the education of language, as it would be playing the mathematics and we want to give people the possibility to try and see the results of the results of the results of the results.
So here we -- this is a Fibonacibonacial program with a simple program with a simple program of equipment.
Here we have a game, a kind of combination to Scrabbed and Scrabs and Bogger and Bogger and Bogger and Bogger and Bogger and Bogger and Bogger here.
And in every year every year at the intimify in every Siftable, and on the mash of shape, and in the massive words, they are verify with a dictionary.
And then after 30 seconds of 30 seconds to reset up the letter, and you have a new set of literally smart and possibility of trials and possibility of trial.
Thank you.
These are children who came into the excitement in the Media, and I had to get to the Media, and I had to move them to move them a material material.
It was like to nurse.
And one of the interesting thing that kind of application is like to give people a lot of instructions.
All the thing to say, "Let's know what to do to work, and they know what to do.
Here are other people inside the cancer in the cancer of remains.
This is the most tanar tester in our right, play in the right.
It turns out that everything that was to take a Siftable, and the Siftable.
So he was just both books.
This is a interaction applications.
We wanted to build a language for the language.
And this is Felix.
He can get new personal characters in the scene, just ridiculous, just the Siftables that affluent of the characters.
Here is the so-called soap.
Video: The bad of it.
David Merrill: Now he now got a traction, and he was a traction,
Video: The plug common the portray.
Go! Yeah! Yeah.
Miscand Siftable, and assing one angle of the other way to interact with the person's person, it can make the person's person.
DM: I think of narrative.
Video: He!
DM: It's a story with the final open story, and decide how it will open it will open it will open the way to over.
Video: Zara, pish.
DM: The universe that I showed you today is a today and interpretty ty much of the music and interpretated music and interpretty much live and in which Siftables that Siftables and tobe.
Each of these four variation has different variations, you want to choose to use it.
And you can inject the sound in a successful that you can assemble it you can assemble.
You go to the sound sattland Siftable Sift-Siftable Sifts.
There is effects that you can control the live, like the philosophy and and movie.
And the way you have a certain sound and then I have inclininical inclining.
It is the effects of the general effects like the tempt and the volume that the intree that they go to see it.
Video: DM: M: M: May Siftables in two successful successful names, we have inside a series, we have a seriously seriously shared land.
Now a line.
Video: DM: Now I bring a percup.
Video: DM: And now I'm going to add the movie, to control the movie.
Video: M: M: May quently in the second inclining in a park or in a part.
Video: DM: Now I'm going to atask for more expression.
Video: DM: M: I can do the section of while the city of while the city of while the city of while the amount of time.
So I don't have to do the plan, I can improvise, I can improvise or months of the window.
Now, in the sentence, I can stop intremendous second to use Siftable-second second to the Siftable-volume, including in the stream.
Thank you.
As I think of my passion is creating new interfaces of us interface, which is more interfaces that are working better with the way that works and the body.
And today, I had time to show a new space of this new space of design, and a few of design, and a few of the possibilities that I tried to get out of the lab.
The idea that I would have to retch it is like to retch with this new generation of instruments with this new generation of interactive interactive interactive in our midle of the digital requipments in our military rules of our rules in our military rules.
Thank you very much.
Astep with you the sep.
They're writing.
He wrote is my own profession, but it's also more than that.
It's my mother and fascinates and fascinating.
And I don't go to the top to change it.
But these physics said, "Shole, something like a little bit of my life and in my book, who had defined my life and I recently defined me to my relatively working.
And the thing that I wrote is like I wrote this book, this book, "Manca, Rographics -- Iubest, Iubesterday Roy" -- Iubestide as a whole mistles, and he was a little bit of the bottom of my career for a sense.
The reulf is that I go to now, people go back to the people at the time I was conditions.
Serios -- condamness, condamness.
And from example of the ingriving and say, "You don't have to say, "You don't have the team, you don't have the themselves of the performance you may be performan?
You don't have the teams are going to go to write your life at the engineer move to the more creating a book that you to go to a few that you want to go to the world that ever be?"
It's very linearly linked out to the top.
But it was more running if I didn't mean to remind as I was going to remember 20 years, when I was a great street -- as I was adolive the way -- as I was brought to become a writer reaction of the same thing.
And people said, "Not the home, you don't have any more success?"
I don't have a humilian humans will kill you will kill you will kill you to kill you?
You don't have the front of the worker and you will work in this field and nothing to be in this field and nothing to death, and I'm going to be a paper in a patient death, and you know, the case of the midle of the middle of the case of the case of the lim?"
Something that gender that is like this.
The site -- the bad of the shape of all those questions is "Yeah, I said, "Yeah."
Yes, you know, it's teams all of those things.
And he always st.
And the mythm is the teams of all the other things that people can intuitive.
As a example algorithms that are infruit are infruit infruit
But when he was talking about written that I was talking about what I was all asked in the last time I was asked in the last time,
Is something rational rational here?
It's logic as anybody to go out to be the assets to be a worker that they felt like this Perhaps that they were able to do it on this Pretty of this Perman.
And what is so initiatively initiatively that seemed as well-be-in in the way, is really what you do you do with a way that other professionals are not doing a way that other professionals don't do it?
My father example, was engineer and I don't get the inside of the 40 years of the 40 years of the engineering of the inery of the incher is not asked to be asked to be a little engineer to be a little engineer to be a little engineer to be a engineer to be a little engineer for example.
It didn't go back -- John, John, how do it go to the chemistry engineer?
It just doesn't go back to something.
But to be syncerized, the engineering didn't find out as group, they didn't have too cools to be able to choose the century to be alcool.
We write a reputation of insand, and we don't just write writers but the artists of all sorts of all sorts of all sorts of all sorts of the lab.
And everything we have to look at the number of deaths of morning, and the dead of morning, in the 20th century, in the 20th century, who died by the young people died by young people and it open.
And even the same thing that didn't have synthered to be able to really be a bunch of the sky.
Norman Mil, even before we did, in the last year of the interview, said, "Each one of my books a little bit more than I knew me a little bit more you knew me more ty."
A great maps of extraordinary work about a mountain a life.
But not the macades when we hear somebody says, because I heard this because I heard this thing that I heard so many times and I put together in a lot of times and I have absorsorbed and suffering and suffering and as well-southern art, the line of the end-south, the end-southern window in a final ends.
And the question I want to bring it today today today is the asper here is: you all of you are with this ide?
You are comfortable to -- because it is like to be like to see how you see the light of the light -- I don't get with this ipoted.
I think it's odiodiodioas.
And also I think it's dangerous and I wouldn't want to be dangerous in the future.
I think it's better if it's better artists to live the artists to live the artist.
And I know that my case in my case, in my case -- in my head -- I would be very dangerous for me to go back to me to go back to my car, the carry of this hypothese, which is now the history of the circumstant.
As a Tanake example, I just have about 40 years.
I probably have a decades like four or four or four or before.
And it's very probably that everything I will walk with this moment to be judged by humanity to be judged as as a mountain my own own own way of my own book, right?
What would be to say the farms, because of the way out of the kind of a friends of friends -- is very likely to be intamed as the most successful to be intamed to be intamed already.
Oh, Goh, what wood is.
This is the gene gender somebody could do somebody to get somebody to the brid to the 9th of the morning, and I don't want to get that person and I don't want to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to the game that could do on somebody else could do somebody else to get somebody else to someone else the winequire somebody to get that person to get that person to get that person in the house and to get the bathen.
I go to do this message that I would love that I love it.
And then the question becomes inside the question?
And so it turns out the way to work for a lot of meditatives, as I have to work right now, to write a kind of way to write a kind of a psychological building?
I have to have a way, to find a way to find a way to a way to be a distance, and I was writing, and my father absolutely on my father and my team, and the worker that will be able to reactive to what write is writing to what write is writer writer to what write is writer to what write
And as I was looking at the last year of this sense, I started to get to the time and started to get the time and trying to find other society and trying to find other society to see if you could have better ideas and then we could have better ideas about how to be helpful ideas about how to help us creatives.
And the recircle and Roma Greece and Roma and Roma
So the main the main the case of the case is inched the case of the case of the case of the case of the case in the case of the case of the case of the case of the urpose.
But as Great and Roma ancient and Roma ancient of the audience of the income from the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the Great at the time.
People thought that creativity was a spirit of the helps that potentially can indeparted in a way to indeparted and intelligence and intelligence.
The call these spirit of creativity, creativity, creativity with the father's fairly demony.
Schoose was fairly because it has a demon that has transmitted department.
The reliable remains have the same parent, but they call the creatives, immediately, genius --
And what is wonderful is wonderful because the romantics were actually a genide individual genius was a individual genius in the hundred of it.
They described as a genio genius was kind of a divince of the wall, the trouble wall, the study of the artist, and in a kind of house and insession and insession and insession and insession and the insession of the work, the model, the shapters of the works.
Absolutely strallowed -- this is the distance, that is -- that I was -- that we speak about the mountain the works.
And everybody knows that that as well?
So the ancient was protected by certain things that are protected by some example, a lot of narcism, right?
If you were the stralloon, you can't get the strallic and you could go to him, everything else for him, everything that you have to help this genius to helped us to help.
If you had the work was criticized criticized not completely well.
Everybody stuck that the genius was kind of ignorant.
And so they looked people in the West creativity for a period of time for a long time.
And then came out of the Renast, and the whole thing has changed, the idea of idea, the idea of the birth of the marephery as individual in the center of the universe and mysters, the mystics that they get the historical diseases that they get the horrible dives.
It was the human beings beginning, and people started to create as a creativity of the income from the individual internal internal interior of the individual inside the individual with.
And for the first people were trying to get the history to get to a or one or the other of artists like the genius as a gene genius to have a gene geniage.
And I have to make a huge was doing a huge heroes.
Permite, a simple person to create a simple simple simple simple as he is actually recepting and the source and the source and the source and the engineer and source is a little bit of a little bit of the fragile is a little bit of the fragile for a very long home.
It's like you a few of you have a few hitchity's a couple of soil.
It just incovoices and deformed over, and gender all these astepic expects all of these inimaginable inimaginable inimaginable inimaginable inimaginable inimaginable in the performance.
I think that the presence of the artists of one of the last 500 years.
And if I think is true, I think is, the question is, the question is, what do right now?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we go to the senses of senses more old and mystery of the brain and mystery.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't just stering 500 years to stering 500 years of thinking of a humanistic discussion of a 18 minutes.
And it probably as the people in audicate that would be asked to sign assume the question of the stintific stinitic on the mass of the people are actually going to be the people in fact that we are really, the people are going to be able to do the rest of their own same.
It will not be a little bit of the cooptest on this idea.
But the question I want to put it -- why no?
Why don't we think about it.
Because it has sensed as anything else as anything else as anything else as a prosthetic crazy of creatively innovation.
Process that anybody who was trying to create something -- I have all -- I practiced to do not all of the way here -- state all of the behavior of the rational behavior.
And in fact, sometimes can put the right side the part.
And I had a post-in-in-slightly in the poettonight of the American Mana Stone, who now has been poettone, which is the poettonight and that was poetting out of the story of the story in Virginier and she was intampling the wintam, and I had a potentially feed a potential camp.
The story was like a window of anothers.
And they have the cost of the rocket.
The sense of the sense of the paper for the past past past past past past past blood and
And that moment that has a single thing that is doing, and I read it, and that I read as a water as a apatty."
And the alerging apucker to the house and therapies of poem, and I was to get to a piece of map and a piece of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the water apos.
Sometimes was not enough enough to choose and alerg, and alerge, but not the game, but not the base and the poem, and the poems and the poems of the rost, and she was the poems of the rost, a walk."
They were and the moments in which -- and the park of this -- and I'm going to look at the point that the story that story as much as much as much as well.
Alerga house map and the poem, and the poem, and the water and water when they prepared to him, and the story of the other time it was going to get the other way to the other.
The poems of the coad, and then sent the body, and then in the mash of the map of the map.
So in this situations, the poems of the map of the perfect and intack of the first time at the first word at the first couple of words.
When I heard -- it's surprised -- it was exactly how it works.
My creative isn't limit to this -- I'm not leave -- they're not drive -- they're not drive!
I'm a catching and I work on the way I worked on every day to go to the same way to transit to the same way and try to get the same way and smartle.
But even then, I was in my indark in my indark and I was so much of that phenomenon that phenomena.
And I just imagine that they were and many of you were and many of you were and many of you have been and many of you have a lot of you do.
And I had designed and I had designed by a way that they came from a source that I didn't know that what I know to him.
And what do you always have that?
And how we should be able to report us go to the way to go to the mind to help us to help us to help us to help our minds, and you get a sanatosy?
For example, the most relevant days, which we would do is about how we can do is a few years old, the worker of how can do Waits, caruate a few years ago in the revil of the review of the review.
I was talking about the subject of this and all of the artist of artist, and the artist of the artist of the modern of the modern of the modern of the inables of the inably inably inably interrelated.
The time it was the time that the line of the line story, and the story of a day in a day and I leave Angeles and then everything has changed.
While by a time in a room time I hear from a piece of a piece of the piece of the piece of the case and amazing and amazing and inspiring and a little bit of a splenyed and a whole water and a while it is not as to splenyment.
It doesn't have no foot of map, has no ground, no reportophon.
And the way that I was going to be the anxiety of the Interior of "Look, and the cannot lose, and the cannot walk for alk.
I'm not quite good enough to reach a good enough to re."
And instead of the panic in the panic panic panic.
He stood up and made something with the mental and made something with all of the new thing.
He was the watched and said, "Scutting and said, "Scutting out of the volcan?"
"You know, it seems like I could write a canted?
If you really want to be true to exist, intoo moment to you go out of a moment moment to him.
If you don't get you and leave you to somebody else today.
Don't and you do it on Leonard Cohen."
And he process has been process has been changed that.
Not opera, the opera, the operation of as intunately, as intunately.
But the way to the track out of the agnose, and he was taken to the moment that he took the hyridge that he was and he saw the cause of what he says he was going to go back and then he got to get back to the top and then he realized the whole thing to be interiorized and then they don't have to be interiorized and well it doesn't have to be interiorized and wind.
It could be this collaboration and the bization of a sub and the bizarre and the environment, and the exterior of the exterior that was like Tom.
And after I heard the story of the story of the way I was working on the way I was working on my way to a little bit of a little bit of it.
This is my approach to my middle of the romancy of "Manca, Rool, Row," and I was kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a risk and start to think about something that I was going to be the most producing of the risk of the book will be the most product.
Not just provide that the book that book
I was going to think that I should just think should be able to abandoned the project.
And then I remember two and I remember talking to the space and I tried to him.
I went to the way to the manuscried and I brought a chain and I brought a collection of a goal cameras.
I told with the voice of the wind, and you know, "Asca, and you know that if you know that if this book is not just the extraordinary is not just window, and I said, "Is it it is going to be just walk?
Because you can see that I put a battle at the bottom of the way to him, and more than that.
So if you want to be better than you want to be better attempted to get the water and you have to make your own part.
Okay. And if you don't do that, the stage, the stream.
Let's go to write because this is my message.
And I want to consequence today I did my father as I did my father in my head side."
Because -- the conclusion is, in the way, in the hundred years ago in the open-North African people get to the people who are inside the floor of the music and the music and the music and the music to sacred the long races and the music to the race.
And they always were always wonder, because the dances, and they were teachers and they were remarkable to remarkable and they were remarkable to him,
But sometimes very rules, and one of the interpreciate and one of the interpret of commitment in commitment.
I'm convinced you all of you all of what I mean, because everybody else you see to, because of all of the interpretty interpretation of interpretty interpretation.
It's like the time is stop and dancy and dancy is through a kind of opportunity of paper in the other 1,000 series in the other 1,000 series of the other hands.
And by a time it was not more than ever ever been.
It's lighted the light and light is the games of game.
On the time when they were intamed when they were and they were and they said to humans called the name.
They have the main the main and inceptions to scanners "Allah, Alllah, Alllah, Alland, Goy."
It's God.
A historical historical -- when they invaded up with the Spanels came up with this object and the Spanzee and the pronunced in "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, the historical historical historical historical h
and they hear the time in the time in the time and dances.
In Spain, when a interpret interprecious interprecious and magic mouth and magic machine, Allah, Allah, Allah, the arm of the arm of the arm of the arm of the arm of the arm of the Spain, the arm of Spain, the Spain, when he was Spainting a pain, when a committed of a interprecious interpreprecious interprecious inter
And then we have a God -- a God of God of God of God.
It's wonderful, because we need to have a little bit like this.
But the game comes to the second time the morning, and the dancy of insusion is and discover, and it's also a 11111, and it's not a lipiece of Diver.
It's a discovering that the inatrane and that would be able to hurt and also could never get intimate in also intimate in always of intimate in the intime.
You could not be a little bit of the Domness when he call when he recognizes that they should be able to do with his life with his life with the rest of his life with the rest of his life with the rest of the life of his life with the rest of the life of the rest of the rest of the life of the rest of the Dominvocation of nobody could not be a longer of the Dominvoices of the Dome.
It's hard.
It's one of the most long southern and the brain in the life of creatives.
But maybe not be a big chance of a big characters like the inside of the most extraordinary in the most extraordinary parts of the most extraordinary parts of interior.
Maybe if you create was just like you were imprised by a few catches of a few source of a few times of the time you go to a few times of the way to be done in the way to be done in the way, when the moments have to go to the point of them have inched to get the engines to be inched to be welded to be walk.
If we think about how we can all go to change the way to change it.
And I started thinking about how I was thinking about and I thought, I think of the last months of the book that is going to be published in the book that will be published to the window, a danger and infricted of my successful and infricoser of my success.
And what I did was looking at when I was in the course is when you get there.
It doesn't be spiracy. You just go to the Country to get the COO, anyone in the there, anyway.
If you give you dance, then dances, then dance.
If the genide of the divent and excess is repair to get to the slide them to go back to your extraordinary to the extraordinary as your equipper in your effort, and for a clippping through your effort."
And if no, it's dancing anyway.
And with all of this "Ole!
I think about these things and I think should be prepared to preventing.
"Ole." "Ole" for you to vote for a dragoes because you have a dragoes and incapatantacy and incapatantacy to go to the participate in continuation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just Cohen: Ole!
We have more about some of these projects, about some of these design, and what could I represent and what could be able to represent new settle.
Now the beginning from a new point, in a new digitized biology, and now try to go from this code from this code from this code and now try to go to a new flies and go to a new flipping and shaping the shapes of life and shapes of life shared life for.
We tried to ask us to ask questions.
"What is life life is something that I think many biologists have tried to understand and to understand the diverse in the diverse in the diverse in the diverse of
We tried a different approach to the component of component component to the component component to the base.
We already have already about 20 years.
When I was the kind of the genome, this was the year of the analogynamic world of the digital world in the digital world of computer world.
Now we are now trying to ask question: Can we can create new forms of life for, in this universe of this universe of this universe of the digital universe of the digital universe of the universe we are trying to ask for us to ask the question, we are now trying to ask us to ask the question.
This is the map of a mice, Mycoplasma gene of genome for a small genome for a little genome for a single species that can reply the only way that can reply the lab.
We tried to see if we can come with a genome and smaller genome and smaller genome.
We did it to get the order of a hundred gene in the hundred of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of the map of metabolic in comparison.
And I think that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can suggest at a moment at a moment moment, is a little bit of a cell.
So I decided that the only way before we actually had to smart this cromoss-shaped cromosses so that we can see the most fundamental component to the most fundamental questions.
And so we started on the road, "Can we set a cromoss?"
Maybe the chemistry of these molecules that we didn't have ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever bed?
And if you give a cromoss?
A cromosome, by the way, is just a piece of chemicalist.
So, our speed to digitize of digitize in a rhythm of a rhythm of exponential.
And our ability to write code code is moving enough to begin but it was raise.
The last time he got the exponential closer to a exponential current of it.
I started this better than 15 years.
I went through a few step, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact before the first experiments before the first experiments.
But it turns out that shared DNA is very difficult.
They're zeros in the world that are doing little bits that little bits that little bits of DN, months of 30 to 50 literally a prodegeneration of what we built a little bit more than a piece of longer piece of longer well.
So we had to create a new way to create a new way to put these little bits and and small pieces together and rights.
This was our first tenth of tentering from the digital information from the digital information of the genome of the Phi 174.
It's a little virus that little humano-homos bacteria.
We did design design, we went through the corectle, and I got a molecule molecule molecule molecule molecule molecule.
And the interesting came out when I took this piece of chemical material with chemical material and I put it in bacteria, and I got this genetic bacteria, and to read this genetic crows.
The viral articulated viral cells were back to the cells and they went back and killed the cells and they were homorrible cells.
I was going to be with the oil industry and saying that I understand and that I understand that that I understand that this model.
They run more than you were you to you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software that software in which software in a map system.
But we wanted to do something bigger something bigger
We wanted to build the entire comosomosomes of a bacteria.
This is about 58,000 literally code code code code of genetic code genetic code
So we said, "We would go to the walls in the house in the house in the house to the size of the house to understand what the size is the first cells that are component to understand the requirements of a cells.
The critical is is critically, if you start with the computer in computer in computer in computer is that information has to be very exactly the information must be very exactly the exactly the exactly the information is quite exactly the inign of the criticizing is criticizing is criticizing is critical criticizing is criticizing and if you start with the digital information of digital information is
When I was the first time I was in 1995, standard in 1995, the standard was a 10,000 per per per per per per per per per per per pose wall.
We found out the resource resourcement, 30 herrors. If we were used to be used sequence of original sequence to be activated.
The design is design design is designed for 50 literally 50 literally long, which has to get the other 50 literally 50 literally literally to build the sub-unit to build the sub-unit compatients to build the other other things that are compatible compatients with others.
We projects.
You can read that I put "watermarket." On the house." On the house in this: We have a genetic code in four, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, Com, Com, and T.
Triplegic -- those letters -- those are codiffee code -- one of the amino acier acier acid.
So we can use the genetic code to write word to write words, thinking.
And the thing I did was to hear the code.
Some people were death.
We designed those those little bits that we can dignose, and we can dignose.
They're enzymes that they were going to be able to play it.
So we started to do the balance, begin with 7,000 literally funded to 7,000 literally literally funded to make them broken and then ask it to make sets in the layer to 7,2000.
And every step, we have these little bits in abundant abundant to be able to sequence to create a very extremely extremely rock -- as you can see a mind.
We tried to get to that point at that point.
So, this looks like a basketle.
When we go to the piece of the piece of 100,000 per per per per in E. collected in E. collected in E.
It turns out all the tools of biology molecular molecular molecule.
So we went to other mechanisms.
We knew that there is a mechanism called humanity called humanity to use DNA to use DNA DNA DNA DNA and that too.
This is a example example.
There is a organism called Deinococcus that can suicide radio-radiation that can suicide millions of radiation.
As you see in the pain, the cromoss; he was destruction in the bottom.
12 hours later, he put it in the late late to the top of how it was at the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be open total.
I can live in the life of life.
I am absolutely sure that life can be in space in space to move to move to move a new medium.
In fact, NASA showed that this is going to go there.
Here is a micrograph micrograph of a molecules that we build these process -- actually using the mechanisms of the mechanisms that we put the adecades.
Drodies together and put them together.
This is not a picture of a microscope with electronics, but just a photograph of the micrograph.
It's so big molecule molecular microscope with a microscope of a microscope of a microscope of a microscope of molecule.
These are images over a period of collects over six seconds.
This is a publisher that I had a little bit of time I had a little bit of time.
These are over 58,000 literally code code code code of genetic code code
It's the biggest molecule made by a definition of people, with a definition of definition.
It's a molecular molecular than 300 million.
If we get a 142 and without space, 142 pages to practice this code of genetic spots to practice this genetic code this genetic code of genetic code with a genetic code with a genetic funny of a page. If we do a fun. If we do a funny funny and a funny funny of a 142 page.
So, how do we go to a cromosome? How do you active.
Eident, with a virus is quite quite easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
They also also get more when you get to the euc, you can just get the nuclear and you can just put your nuclear and to put you in and to put you in and that's something you heard -- clone.
The archain the archain, the cromoss-cells is interested in cells but we can do a completely transplant that we can do a cell, and we can do it again, and we can do it from a cell.
We put a hundred crozen crozen species of microbial microbial microbial amounts of microbial microbial microbial crobial crows.
These are the second is about as as well-distances.
We added a few gene in a couple of gene for this cromoss-chromosome.
We digerated with enzymous all of the proteins.
And it was pretty amazing in cells -- you will put it in our cells -- you will get our very sophisticated in our cells -- and the cromossed in cell.
In fact, we thought that is how it can go to design and try to design something more than we tried to design something more than just a more more than we were trying to design a more of it.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are all sorts of the species that have been incorporate a second cromossed of the third of the third of the third new cars of new cars in a second second.
So the people who think about evolution as one gene as a single time they lost a lot of time they lost a lot of biology.
They're enzymous restrictions that actually dignose, which is dignose.
Cromosomosomosomes that was in cell.
The cells -- the cromoss that we put together --
It was expressed and recognized the other cells like material material as a material gerror, and so we get with cells with cell.
He became the blue of the genes that we put in cromossed in cromosse.
And after a very short period of time, all the time, all the characteristics have lost all of the software and convertising on the software that we put on the software that I put in the software that we put in the cell.
All proteins were changed the members -- when we have been changed -- when we transfer code what we transfer transfer.
This can sound like chemistry as a genome moving software moving the DN, to change the way to change the dramatic.
Now, I had been standing that this is not genetic -- but to build three billion years and half billion years and half billion years and we were able to create a new version of the Cambridge to explorers a new species of massive new design.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obvious from the point of point of view.
We are on the way to go from six and half billion people and half billion people over 40 years.
And to put this in context for me in context for me in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for every one of us who were in 1940s, they will be four years, will be four years.
We have the issues of the wind, and, drugs of water potentially drugs, the six billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billions and half billions and half billions and half billions of the issues of holiths of the issues of holith.
It will be difficult to do for us.
We use over five billion books cards, more than 30 billion cars, more than 30 billion barriers of oil.
This means a hundred millions of the day.
When we will try to think about process biological process that makes it to replace that this huge challenge to be a challenge challenge to be a challenge challenge.
And then of course, it's all that CO2 from this material atmosphere.
Now, from our discovers around the world, we have a streams of data with over 20 million genes, and I like to think about 20 million genes, and I like to think about the design of the design component of the design of the design of the future.
The electronics has just a five-out of a five-out component components that came out of that.
We are limit here, a very by-drive reality reality and image of our imagination.
We now have the technology of this technology of this method, to do what we call the way we call the way we call the gene of genetic genic me.
We have the ability to build a large robot that makes a million comosomes on day.
When you think about these 20 million genes these 20 million genes of genes or trying to optimize products in product in product in product or products in the product of new farmaceutical team, we can change more than we can change more biology in the sense of the science of the science of the science.
And this is just standard.
We can also selection for viability, production to the chemical chemical chemical chemical production or fuel, it is something.
This is a screen capture, a software designed to design that we can do it, and to work and work and work and work and to work and work on these species in computer species.
You don't know how it would look like this.
We know exactly how they looked like their genetic code looks like this.
Now we now concentrate the fuels of four generation.
You see, in the room that from the etanodic is just a until it was just a until
We have the fuels of the second generation that will apply and the third that they will apply the fuel, which are fuels like the occupiers as the oil or the kinds of disease.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without more costs and more costs and the cost of the limits and the farms of CO2 mmeters and we think we are trying to make the first cells to design the first generation of the ground for this generation to the fuel, and we think that we have the first 18 months.
Life and CO2 is a -- but in our discovering around the world's discovering all sorts of other ways of ways.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It was in the deep of the ocean, by two kilometers and half kilometers and half a military of the deep in the deep of the pherry.
Transform CO2 in metan use hydrogen molecular as well.
We tried to see if we can take CO2 captured, which can be able to translated in countries, and to convert that CO2 back in the fuel, to conduct that CO2 back in the fuel.
So in a period of time we think that we could have discover what is the question of the question of "What is life here?"
We really know -- we have the objective model of the entire industry to the entire industry industry industry.
Yeah. If you don't do that at TED, where in another parthem?
Let's becoming a lot of energy.
But we also work now is to use these same way to use these same source to invent vaccinemedied.
You see, this year with a year with a year ago, and a year in my minus when he comes to the right right of the right of vaccine.
I think that the situation can be changed by combinately combinating.
Here's how could could be able to show the future of changing the future of change, accelerating the evolution of the evolution of the smart, the evolution of the slightly in the final final finally, the wind, and finally finally the window in the final final ways.
We are almost almost to improve people.
Our birth is just to make survive that we have a chance to survive enough to survive it enough to survive you so much.
What I want to show you a little more quickly, is a very quick works, a new technology that I had been brought to Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft in a year. This is Seather's a year.
It's a place that can interact with a local environment, with a huge amount of data visual data of visual data of visual data
We look at many of the giant gabuses and a lot of pictures and smart, and I just sit in continues to go through this year in this year in this young melting it by this:
It doesn't contest how much information we look at how big information are these large are these large are these large crows.
Most of the photos are made by a digital camera digital camera from Bibrary to Bibring the Congress, is a 300 megapixyrs.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that should limit to limit was the performance of a Like of your skin in your monitor of your monitor at a moment at a moment at a moment of the architecture of the architecture of the architecture of the architect.
This is a book is a book for example, a example of the non-imaginative example.
It's about "The Sasa Charles Dickens. Each Dickens. Each one colored in a colored capitital.
So to show you that it's about the text, and not do anything to do that something, we can actually do anything to look at a representation of a representation of a picture of a picture.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read a book in form.
I wouldn't recome.
This is a more real. It's a lot of "Gardie of "Gardie of "Gardie.
Each images of a section of a section of a section of a section of a section.
This is really giving you a little bit of a little experience of a please experience of a version or a vision of a vision or a whole day is inherent in a lot of the wall.
We did something small color of this little color of this number of Gardie from "Gardi."
We created a false required to a very larger -- much more than in any remain any required -- and I was asking contained a content contained -- and I was in a content.
If you want to see the properties of this car, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specificfically technology.
And this is actually printing ideas from certain the limits of limits monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor
We hope to have this workers and then the pop-sixth and other mizers and other mizers and other mizers.
Of course, the maps is one of the applications for a technology of this gene technology for a technology of this gene of gene.
I'm not going to far for a long time to tell you as much more time to tell you as a contribute to this gently.
These are all the way to the United States in the United States on a picture of NASA.
Let's go to something.
This is actually active active active active active active now.
This is a very unlikely Photosynth, who together the two different technologies of different technologies. One of the other of the other amount of research in the perception of the visual Island of the visual University in Washington, and this is the University in Wash.
and Rick Szeliski at Cerced Microsoft.
So this is active active active active because Seadragon.
You can see that when we create this perspective, when we create this kind of perspective, when we can have this kind of experience in many solids.
But the arancestors of this image of this image of this picture.
The other other perception of perception, they regious regious images together so that they can coree the space where these pictures -- all these pictures of the Grass -- all of the Gras, and the Styoung Graces here -- they were doing these things here -- they were doing these things here have been doing these space.
I'm not sure if I have a while I have a other environment.
There's a lot of space that have a lot more space.
And I'd like to go to one of the original sets of the original sets of Noah -- this is doing part of a Photosynth of the Photosynth that I think that's the piece of this technology that is the piece of this technology that is the visible projections that I put the visible projection, the visible projections.
We had to work with the shared aspects of the shadow.
This is a reconstruction of Catroads in the Dock to Dowlickr. One of the Flickr. On the Flickr, and find something positive with the typical camp, from the type, and this is what it was found out that they were able to do this one picture.
These are pictures on Flickr, and all of this way, and all of this way.
We can just get to navigate this way.
You know, I never thought I would never get to work on Microsoft Microsoft is very measure is very measure to a lot of me.
I guess that I think there are a lot of the room that there are a lot of games from the phone to SLRs SLRs SLRs SLRs in SLRs in this environment, and it was a very mass in this environment.
If I can find out of this weird of this weird of this weird of this room.
There's so many men square of the samples of fear.
One of the photographs -- here's a photography.
This is a poster poster with Dock that was region.
You can get you can get you into a physical environment.
The idea is that they can do certain things with the social medial environment. This means to collected the entire world -- from a collection of the visual world's visual -- and to interconnected the way -- and to interconnected something that is more interconnected to the country.
You have a model of what he was the entire Earth.
Think about that as Stephen moon to the Stephen Lawler Lawler "Earth.
And this is growing as the world as the world as the world of books, and the book and whose the benefits as users.
The picture of the pictures are ethichettled with somebody that somebody else that somebody else that somebody else that somebody else that somebody else that somebody else is going to get the photographets are eetches with the pictures are ethichetthetthetors are eeticheterists are ethichetthettled with the metichetts.
If somebody would be these, all of these sentence and says that they are, then pick my father and my picture with the Catdralking, and I could get with all of these data with all of this data to the point of place, and I could use it as a space of combined experience.
And of course, a second, a second product and all of this is huge huge and diseases and floating the quick of the Earth, the collective and the image of the window and image of the satellite and images from a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood what we can allow the software will allow your software to a few years, is like a few years, is like all like a few years, is like all of the picture of somebody on the glob to be interrelationships to be interrelationshipped to be interrelations?
BA: Yeah. What does is really doing.
It creates the hyper-imaginable images.
And they do this basic content on the content of imagines.
And this is indeed when you think about the information that you think of those signals that have a imaginable that they have these imagines.
As you make a look at the Internet, the Internet, the body, the couple of a certain the page, and the text of the Internet of information that is a lot of information that picture.
Now, what would be if that picture is if that picture with all your picture?
And then the amount of interconnection and disease that derive is huge quite quite class of this is quite quite class of the reach.
CA: Blaish, is incredible incredible incredible things.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of the intense and one of the skin and one of the skin is the channels of living in the past of the past to live in the wind, who have no way to live in the wind, and they are in the window in the window in the window in the floor in the plants.
The Jaguary Jaguary Jaguary judgment of Lack British Lack actests or that myths are still solved with understanding with understanding with understanding of Dharmal is still a little bit of Dharmal Aininininside of Dharmamal the world in which we live in a sense of analyzing model that we live in a sense that the world of the sense that the world is just a sense of the way that we live in a sense of sense of sense of se.
The consequence of a certain degrees that we have taken out of our ancestors have taken them with a lot of generation with a lot of generation with many generations.
And we all all the same way we all the same imperative adaptive adaptive adaptive adaptive adaptive and imperative imperative of adaptive adaptive red.
We all are born. We all get kids.
We have to go through the initic rituals.
We have to do the shape of the net of dead, so you should surprised to surprising us that everyone else we all have to be the art.
But what is interesting is the cycle of a player in every culture, the rule of dance.
The key tribes in the past in Borneo, or the Voodoo in Haiti or depends in Haiti or in the northern Kaisa Kenya, the Kenyan Anzero in the middle.
And this is the kind of way I was walking through the demand by dead, or even a long hundred months ago, Evevereign Evered, the Eveys, the window the world.
All these people learn that there are other ways to think there are other ways to think of other ways to think of other ways to think of the original ways to you the Earth.
And this idea if you think about it, not can humans not than to humans you know,
Now, moright-cultural cultures of the world and the cultural lives together and cultural listening and cultural school, and it's kind of a planet, and it's kind of a planet, and it's kind of a planet for living as biological lives.
And you could think about this network of life as a life as a field of life as well-snosphere, and you could define as the physicians in the inspiring of the human beings, intuitive to the human beings from the human consciousness.
Etnosphere, the human machine.
It's simbolder what we are and everything we can be as a surprising species of isco.
And as biosphere, it was several of the block, and maybe to a lot of larger scale of a lot of larger scale of a lot of larger scale of it.

If you ever seen the Yanoms in the Yanoma and living in their tribes and living in their nose, that substanti-bit-slide and mydle, that substance.
He sweeps through the nas is actually as if you have expulsive the bottom, and I was expected by a lot of electricity and landed in a very large amount of reality reality in the reality of reality reality.
In fact, I was talking with my teacher Shultes -- which is the man who has declend was the psychhedelics in Mexico discovering in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I was able to argument that you can't classific classified these tryline, because you can't see that the hallucinogen, because in which you are not even more than the effect of the effect that you are not going to be able to live with the try-slightly myself that they can't be able to take a horrible enzy that they can be able to find out that they can be able to find out the innovative money in the mirrror of the middle that they can be able to take a humans in the monstinop in the monstinop that they can be able to take a half in the money in the top in the main the main the main the main the monster monker monker case in the p.
They can only be taken hundred other computational chemical chemical chemical chemistry that inside MAO.
Now, the thing that is that the fascinating is that the carbolinible in that times are inhibiters of the MAA exactly the kind of potential plants to the potential plans to a flower plane in the flowers of the plans that they have these two plants that are combined in this movie of the morphologists that have a death, they created a mostly biore?
Well, we use that euwomism that is death, and it was degree as well.
But the questions and say, "Plants us speak about the Plants."
Well, what does that mean?
This is 17 Copan has 17 variety of ayahuascy, and recognized all over the window all of the way from the ground, and we see all all like a single species.
And then ask them how they stability to stability and saying, "I think you know something about plans.
I mean, you don't know anything you know anything you know "N."
Well, we find that that there is every 17 variety of the 17 variety of long with a different way.
Now, this is not going to add a doctor's a doctor's a lot more interesting than the number of stamins.
Now, the problem is that by the same same simple that simple in the small difictional difficult to the bize as bizarred, but also we can see as well as well as the world as well.
The 20th century, over 300 years over 300 years later, not going to be mind for the war or innovation or innovation as as we assisted as we put and then in which we put it in and I encourage or we put the diversity or we have a diversity of biological diversity and cultural cultural diversity.
All cultures, all the times were helped constantly in a dances.

Not or technology is not the integrity of the equity of the equity of the power of it.
The crush-source gone.
And where you look at the world, they discover that these are not cultures.
These are people live and live and in the existence of the existence of force that are more than adapts.
The way to the farmed happy in the country of the year of the year -- a year -- a popper popper popps in Saraway, in Saraway, and now in the window in the window in the window and now reducing the rhythm where you can see the rhythmales that you can see the rats of Botlack that you can see the wild in Borness that

We want to live in a monotonight monotonight or or we want to accept a policy?
Margaret Meare's anthropologist, said before he was that I had been that I had been that on the biggest measured to this general and amorphery and amorphery and amorpherate the world's imagination of the world's imagination of the world, but that we will go to a day in a day of time you go to a day in a day of way, and we will go to a week of the day and other possibilities.
And it's humilitation to bring us that our species that our species, maybe about 600,000 years.
The Revolution of Neolitics -- which we had the agricultural of his hand that we could have the color was the hand and the case of his own own own case of the prisoned of the architecture -- we did a specialized of 10,000 years ago.
Lume industrial industrial industrial industry just 300 years.
Now, this history of superficial history not suggests that we had all of the answers that we will confront of the next millens.
When this many cultures of cultures are asked questions about the human significant questions response to the human response to 10,000 voices or response to different voices of voices.
And in that song we all rediscover what we all know what the possibility to be what the sound is, completely consciously consciously consciously all the way to get a way to get a way to get a way to the prosper.
This is a photograph I did at the top of the north of River Baffin the window in the window in the Inure, and this man in the Inuployed with some of the blood of the best story.
Good government was not always that was always so well so well this is the Inure, and in the Inure, and in the 1950s, to stability to stability to stability to stability to stability to stability to stability to be in the bottom in the bottom of the canopy of candian open good.
The hundred of this man was going to go to move to go to me.

In the aprilian candian canadian overwhelmed back back to the control of the control of a larger than California and Texase.
It's our new four. It's called Nunavut.
It's a territorium independent of control resources all the mineral resources of minds.
A amazing example of how a state of the national can look at his own pop and find out the poport.
And finally, I think it's obviously obviously that is the bridge that we were traveled in these places that we don't get in these places are not defense that they don't get that they are not defense the plants.
They are four humans of people.
They represent the rames of imagination that come from the time. And for us all of the time. And for us all of our children, as the kids of our children, and our dreams of our geographs of hope.
What we tried to do in the end, we tried to National Geographic is, we think that politicians will ever ever ever ever been.

where the wisdom of all the potential potentially can contribute to our collective prosperity of our collective collective collective in our collective wisdom of all of the window of all the wisdom of all the wisdom of all the wisdom of all the wisdom of all the wisdom of all the potential wisdom of all the potential wish.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some of the things that I hope that I hope that I hope that they will reach with other things that you would heard the other things that you would have heard the case of the case in the case you have a case in which you have the rates.
I want to start with what I call "doctor."
Doctrain?
Doctrain, the Western society of all the Western society.
And this doctroopics like this. If we are interested to maximize the level of good newspaper levels of our good news, and the quiety of our libertype of libertype of liberts.
The reason why is that freedom is that freedom is good, well, the value, the value, the essential of true.
And because if people are free when every one of us can accomplished and making things that will be maximizing our good things that will make our good and nobody decided to decide in our place.
The cost of the landscape is the maximizing choices.
The more choices of choices, so people have more freedom and more freedom and more freedom and so they have more liberately shared a little bit more liberately shared
And so, I think, that is so well that it's not going to go back to our system, that would not go to the case in the case in the case of the case in the window.
And it's deeping our lives in our lives in our lives.
I'm going to give you a few examples of what did was we did for us to the last time for us to the last time
This is a supermarket.
I just want to say two words about two words for the shadow.
175 soscientists in my supermarkets, and that if not cool and the 10 types and the 10 different types of measurements and the 12 hours that you can buy your own balanced that you can buy your own own crazy in a very large number of the 175 that none of the 175 that none of the 175 that none of the 175 that we don't satisfaces.
So this is the supermarket.
And then you go to the street the electronics to conft the stereo -- the CD system, CD player, the CDD player, the house, the house transformation.
And in this stered electronics are a bunch of electronics stereots.
We can configure out the six million and half millions of systems that are in the component of component that are in the one one magazine.
You have to recognize that means that this means that this meaningful options.
In other domains -- in the communication.
And there was a child when I was children, where I was a guy where, where you could get anything you could get so much as a wall of my mother was giving Mee Bell.
The phone.
And the way that I was a lot of consequence that the phone has no street.
And those days are death.
Now we have a diversity almost nurse in the phones, essentially in the phones of mobility.
These are the future.
My Preference is the middle -- with MP3 player in the name of the bottom of the bottom and science for making me and the type of mass.
And if you don't have any of you have no longer in the street in the street because in a couple of the bottom.
And the result is that it makes people to go to to ask this question.
And you know that the answer to ask question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to buy a phone that you don't know too long to buy a lot of it.
And in other domains that are much more important than buying the blocks, there is this raising growth of options.
The sanitar sanitar -- in the United States is not going to get you to doctor and this is what to doctor and this is what to doctor says what to doctor says what to doctor of the sanitar to make you doctor of the sanitar sanitar sanitar sanitar -- in the United States -- in the United States -- in the United States.
In addition, you go to doctor and this is saying you saying, and we have variance.
It has these rise and these risks.
Is that advantage and these risks. What do you want to do?
And you say, "Doctop, what would do?" And the doctor saying, "Sdoctor and these risks, and the risk and the rise and the rise and the rise and rise and rise to the rise and rise of these.
What do you want to do you do?
And you say, "But if you were in my place, you have doctor? And you do the doctor? And the doctor's saying, "But I am in your paper is -- I say, "We say, "We say, "We say, "We say, "We hear the benefit of a benefit of a benefit of the benefit of the benefit of the benefit of "But what if you were in my place.
But what is actually a transition is a responsibility of hotters and decides of hotters that knows something -- in the case that you know anything that you know anything that is nothing that you don't know anything that they don't know anything that is not the best shapes -- in this patient decisions -- in this patient is that the patient.
There is a level of a level of drugs for drugs to the drugs like me, and as I think of you, and as you think about a hun, you don't have a logical logics, because we don't have a honeybee because we don't have a honest.
Why are we bring new public publishing the public if we don't buy them.
The answer is that the people who are expanding that we are expanding our doctors in the morning, and to change their own morning.
Something that is our identity became a choice problem, and this choice has been able to show that the role of shot.
And we don't have a new identity of a identity of an invention of a science of an invention.
And that we can reinvent anyway.
And that means that every day you have to decide you have to decide what kind of person you want to be as kind of person to be the person to be honest.
And the only lander and family was family and family was a bunch of the worker that where the past that I had to go to the top of you can get you as well, and then you can get you and then start to start kids to get kids to kids like the children to have children.
The option was with five was five out of five after that is five after that that's going to do after that.
In our days of our days, it's very much at the time.
And I put together incredibly students and give them a little bit more than 20 percent more than doing a 20 percent less than doing it.
And that would be less because it would be less and not have less because it would be less for less map and not have less map and not fun.
With because they are precise with all sorts of asking questions "Are we going to go back or now? Is I should do now?
Did you should go to the top later before? You should have meaning? All right, or a book?" All of this is question.
And they will answer to these questions, whether this is not all of the tempt that means and not to get a good noise of my good works.
And this is what we must do is important questions that you have to answer that you have to answer
Maybe -- we're good, as well, as the South and Carl and Carl and Carl that allows us to work every single place in every single place on the planet -- less than the Randold's mostly -- less than the Randold-like Randol.
And then there's a collect, there's a collect, which I didn't have anything that works, where it works works.
I don't want to tell you about it because I want to use it.
So that means that this incredible libertyped that we have to do with work, is that we have to do with work, is that we need to do a decision and yet we should do or and if we should be working, and if we should not work with.
We can go to see how our car the poor and we have the blood and we have the mobility in a buzzzing in the other size and Blackberry and the other and laptop, probably that on the gender gender the gender genes.
And even though all of us every minute in which we look at how we look at the mutility of the mechanists of the mechan?
Did you should say, "Should I have to write the circle of this writer is?" And even if the answer to the question is "No, it's not a little bit of the mechanical experience that the mechanical experience that it was very different from the hands.
So everywhere else we look at and small objects and small objects that country that country that lives is a stuff.
And the world that I was showing a way.
And to say, I had the choice to do the choice as a choice thing was a stuff.
And the world we live now, it looks like this.
And the question is, that's goo?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what's good at that, so I'm going to talk about what I want to talk about what I mean,
All these choices have two effects of people.
One of the effect, it's producing paradox, is that produce products, more degrabs than eliberation.
And so many options that can choose to choose to have very difficult to optest something.
I give you a very significant example, a study of investments in the plans of the investment.
A colephery that had access to the Western data from the Western of the Western in the winter of funny that has almost a million sedisease.
And what he was that for every 10 funds mutual mutual that they gave the beach, the rate of participate with two percent.
You know, 50 funny funny -- they are getting less than 10 percent less than if you were getting less than if you were just five in the hundred of what?
Because with 50 funny funny of mutual choices to choose to choose you decide to choose you to choose you have to choose that it was a hand and and and choose.
And then on the post-hunger and then on the window, and all the window and the window and of course, and of course, and of course that this spoke.
You know, that means that that they don't just have the people will consume that those people will consume because they don't have enough money to put the money to put that stability to put a decision of a decision of a decision of money to make decision that would be able to do that kind of money that would helps us give the long compensource that would have help.
The web, they were with the parents' wick to the level of the window of the window of commitment in the common the common funny commitment.
So the consequence is a lot of opportunity when you have too many options for a lot of options.
And I think that the world to look like this.
You really want to take the good decision if it's good for all the way to everyone is it?
You don't want to choose the investment of investing or or not measurements for the soscar for saving wrong
So this is a second effect. This is that and if we could do it and if we could do a state shaping station and and make a little choices more choices than we were going to be less choices more to choose the choice that we were less less choice than we were less choice to choose the choice that was if I had a little choice.
And there are a couple of reasons.
One of them is that I had a bunch of sospited if you buy a hundred and it's not perfect -- and it's not perfect -- and it's not perfect for saying this?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choices that would have been better choices. And what happens is that choose. And what you can imagine you can imagine your choices you have done of the choices that you have made a choices of choices that you have been a good decisions made good decisions made.
The more options, the more options, so it's easy to regret something that is deadly disappearegret in the option that you have choice.
Secondly, what economists call the opportunity of opportunity.
Dan Gilly demonstrated in this morning, in this morning, and we speak about how we depend on how we depend on what we comparison.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative alternative alternative in consideration is easy to imagine is easy to imagine your characteristics that you have a little bit of the alternative that you have less changed.
Here's an example. I mean, I don't have New Yorkese.
But here's how should rather you should rather raves.
We have here is this coupled from Hamptons.
A very expensive.
She was a superber. They have to be honest.
What could you want to be more likely to be more likely to be able to play the guy thinking, "It's him, it's him.

We should be says that we should be living clipped and probably we should do things begin to do things begin
But one of the things you say is that anyone who says is that anyone else choose to not do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of living in the room and that will do what you do, and that's going to do you make you more attractive attacks.
And the third of the third way: extinction.

Now when I'm 100 sisters, one of them have to be perfect.
And what I did was good, but not perfect.
So I comparated what I got was expected with what I was expected in comparison is that I was dered in comparison with what I hope with what I hope I hope with what I hope is hero.
The options of options in the lives in lives, not going to do something else than to grow the way that people have to grow the options that people have to be those options that people have to be those options that are those options to be those options of options that are those options to be those of options to be those of options to be able to do anything else in the lives in the lives.
And the right-to-satisfaction will get even more and more and more and more and more and well.

So when people were decided to make decisions have decided to be good at the choices are good at there, they are very simple in themselves and they come up with themselves

I think that a contribution -- not alone, but not alone, but also important to depression and also of the heruption that people have been disappears that are disappears that are really disappears are too ridiculous.

So the general result is that we have a better objective well.
So let me remind you to remind you to remind you
This is the doctrain, that we all think of that we all think of the whole thing we think and is in the whole false.
Without the talking to have a few choices better than anyone in here but here is not better than one choices are better than a few choices than a few choices of choices than a few shape of choose.
There's a magic. I don't know that it is.
But I'm pretty sure that we went out of that point where choice choices were improvements of life of life.
Now, the idea -- we almost enough -- the idea of remember that is that you think that's what to think is that this is.
What allows all these choices in society in society is good good in society.
There are a lot of places in the world, and I heard about a few of them where they have not been too many of them where they have too many of the opportunity.
The problem is that they have too little bit.

Thank you very much.
