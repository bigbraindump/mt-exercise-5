You probably see you see, you can see at the streets.
This is the word of your art in the botttargets in American Sahara Cracium of the Cracium of the Cracia.
One of the building industry of the industry in the days of the Western of the Cracium of the Cracious of the Cracium was this.

And that's why our principles is to spend a big deal is to spend a lot of money for the public of public public and we have a lot of the carbon and we have a complicated.
The thing is that the books is not didark is not dirty the bridge.
We think it's the current -- and move and move and move forward.
So it's not going to not going to get to change the climate change the climate change.
Lass you that in the way we realize it.

Thank you very much.
The last last year I made a provide of LHC.
And I got to come and come to to give you a data data on how it works to do the water of this water.
So the a-mazing. And for the people who didn't have been here, LHC is the biggest experiment that was incerned about 27 miles -- the Western of 27 miles or is recreated by 27 miles or is recreated a concrete of a second of a second sequences of a second of a second-source of the universe -- the sequences.
It's extremely ambitional ambition.
This is the water under of the Geneva.
We do photographs of these minds of the Gres" in the decades.
I work on this way. It's called the ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAs a 22 meters of a photograph of the ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLA's building the proportion.
On 10 sequence of the year of the last year.
And this image was taken by ATLAS.
It just cause a huge of control.
It's a picture of the first fashion the particular of the physical system, the WHC, the LHC, the LHC, the delibers, the delibers, the worth of the LHC particularly deliberated in the deliberator.
In other words, when I was a paper that image about 10 square about 10 sets of works, what a successful is a successful successful.
I don't know that if that the largest ovarious oves, or that, when he went on the Google and seeing the first page, and he seems to be able to see this kind of art tool.
It meant that I did a culture of culture in the impact of the streets.
After about a saptama per of the water with the arrating, which was actually a problem -- these field -- these fields.
They're the phrase of the 13 thousands of the maximum works.
Now, engineers in the engineering and says, "I can't translate the attention of American ans. They're farmers.
But I can do that for that when they're on the temperatures becoming what happens is the shape of super-super-super-conductor.
So as a 271 degrees of the street the space of the street of the street can translate the way that they can translate these things.
At one of the laws of the other of the other of the LHC, was a fabricative.
So as the common was income, and the 13 thousands of the 13 thousands of electrical electrical electrical internations.
This was the result.
This is more impressive to the magnetic chasn't about 20 tons, and they fall over 20 tons, and they fought them 30 to 30 to 30 to 30 to far.
So I determined us to get about 50 magnetic field.
We had to get affected to the affect and down.
I reconditioned on the top of the tool.
And now we go to the street in the subteran.
Pana the sware of the HC is going to be as new as of the LHC will be like us.
We're going to go back to the new data and we have to get data to fix data or hypothese, and we're going to keep research, and we're elementing to be the universe that are the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, of a way of a sense of the accident, those accidents about the extremely important and engineering and engineering to reduce the extreme to reduce it.
I think that the fact that is that the fact is that we attacks, because we have a little bit of the experiments of experiments like HCH.
And you can reach that the windows of a words of a street of the Britain, Humphrey Davy, when you get the internal experiments of the Internet of the protect of the protecting of the protecting of the minds: "No one is not a farms for the progress of us is not farms to our own sensition to our live and the beautife that we don't have the beautiful st,
Thank you.
I wanted to come with the roughly remember of the trees of trees, when you play with the kids.
On the massive to invest to the ridicates and get them to the challenging and swimming and reaches and removed to deliver and solve the problems and shared and manipulate problems and sectors of spaces and the relationships and the relatively intelligence of spaces of the space.
The deep of the space is the profound of how we understand a lot of how we understand a lot of the world of the world of the inconnection.
So if we can figure out the research, and we can get to this useful interaction with our philosphere, and my collaboratory -- I began to Pattlaboratory -- I began to Kanan Kanan Kanan Kanan Kanan Kanan Kanan to the computers -- I would be able to use a computer, in the computers that are going to be a little computers that are a little bit of a little deep to a little bit of a little demachiners,
So what do we want to do we want to do we want to us.
The question was the question of fascinating to the research, I decided to come to the Siftable.
On the score is a Sift is a very large computer.
They can be manufacture, they can perceive the recident of one of the other one along the other one and a fires, and they have a relationship and a relationship and a relationship relationships.
The biggest is that there are the palping of games, you can just get them as you can just watch it just watching them as well.
And Sift example, we have the ecosystem of a new parts of the digital information of digital information.
On the mass of these instruments becoming more constantly constantly constantly one of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of our network on the other sides and disease and diseases and distractive and distractive and distractive and distractive.
You start with some examples of a simple examples of example.
This Sift is configuring is configure out the video games, and if you get the philanthropy of a philanthropy of the other including in the other hands of the parts of the parts of the athroom.
These common are constantly constantly one of the other of other one of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the pasting of the past. These ese are the pasting of interactive interactive and these are the pasting of interaction are interactive interactive interactive
So, if you put them on one language, it becomes interested in the interest.
If I'm inconnected to that, and they can become a confusion.
I can feel the missing and incline.
We realized that one of the interesting of interaction is that we can use of interaction is that we can use to manipulate the way we could be able to manipulate the license.
In this case, we have three Sift configuring as a galets of painting and can use them in the central core and can use them in the center of the center of the center where they will have to be in the center of this streets.
If I was too much to be too much.
There are also interesting to learn for education, how the mathematics of education, the mathematics and logical logical and logical people's lives, and we want to see things that quickly the results of the results of the results of the result of the results of the results of the result of the result of the results of the possibility of
So here -- this is a f-Fibonacibonacibonacial program.
Here we have a game of form combination of combined by the Scrabs and Bogging and Bogging Bogglllllll.
Again, every one of the first one of the first time on every Siftable, and on every Siftable, and you try to form the word of the word with a dictionary, they are verified with a dictionary.
Then, you know, a 30 seconds of the solutions of the literally seeing of the targets to a new such a new such of incidentally, and we have a new way of research.
Thank you.
These are the kids are the kids who came to the Media, and I received to the Media, and I was to start to move them a material and filmmaker material.
It loved to love to the negotive.
And one of the interesting of this kind of interesting is that kind of applications is not to give people a lot of instructions.
All right, "For is "For is the exactly what to do.
Here are some other people are other people to get them to them.
This is the most tanar is the most stering of our river.
It turns out that all of the way to do was to take one Siftable, one of the other one of the other one of the other one.
So for he's just work.
This is a applicator action of animating.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who invent language.
And this is Felix.
He can get new personal personalls in the scene, just ridiculous, just by the Sift of the Sift of the personal characters.
Here is the so-well.
Video: She was the race.
David Merrill: now it turns into the scene.
Video: The brothers.
Go! Yeah! Yeah!
When Sift Siftable, and the assessing of one can make personal personal maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe Ham!
DM: I think about the narrative.
Video: Go: God.
DM: It's a story of the final story of how it will be drawn to fashion how it will be drawn to fashion.
Video: Zara, pish!
DM: The Ultimtimo I showed you today is a created today is a live and interpretated and interpretated music that we built the Sift and in Sift and in the Sifables and all the role and all the rhythm of how they would be rolled and all the rhyth.
Each of these four various various various various choices that want to use it.
And you can inject the sound of a successful you can ask you you can ask you you want to keep you want to keep you want to keep you want.
You can go to the sound of the table, Sift of a Sift-up of a successful Sifts.
There are the effects that you can control the deliver and philosphere and filter.
He's atassessing to a certain in a certain in the a-a-use.
It is the effects of the general effects like the fuel of the square of the sequences of sequences of sequences of sequences of sequences of sequences.
Video: DM: DM: Well we're going to start in the second Siftables of successful successful things, a series, a extinct, a lot more usually report, a lot of far.
Now you put a line.
Video: DM: Now I put a little bit of a periods.
Video: DM: And now I'm going to add the filter, to control the effect of the effects.
Video: You can be indeed by the sections of the sections of the paper or the other other or in a part or in a whatever in a part or in a whole part or in the other hand.
Video: DM: Now I'm going to move the movie.
Video: I can do read the sections of the mountaining of the cants.
So I don't have to do the planet, I can improvise, you can get or a long or a melodie from the window.
Now, in the sfarshape to established my sections of the Sift of the Sift of the Sift of the stangle of the stangline in the stangle in stangline in the stangline in the stangline of the sfarsft of the sfarsft of the sfarsfarsfarsft to be able to established by the swell.
Thank you.
As you see my passion is creating new interface, the computers that are far more than the way that works is worse with the brain that works and the brain is worth and the brain is worth and the brain and the brain is worth and the brain is worth of our brains and the brain is that we see the brain in of our brains of the brain is the seeing of us seeing our brain is creating new inter
And today, I had a time to show you a space, and a few homework from design, and a few of the possibilities that I tried to give them out of the lab.
The one that I wanted to retinent it is that we are at the granted to this new generatures of interaction with the middle of the digital world of the digital world of the world of our digital information in our information.
Thank you very much.
I met with you send to talk about you,
They're writing the wrong common
It write the book is my own teacher -- but it is, of course, more than that.
It's all my mother and fascinating.
And I don't think that this is to change it.
But these physics to hold the bad was intamed in my own boy and in the bottom of my own own own and in my own own own living my own own own living.
And the thing is that I wrote this book, this book, this is the Manca, Rograph Manca, Rosia, Roy's "Mances, Iubestern for the bottom of my body, and it became this important method for a little message, and became this important sensitive to a sensition for a sensition of the world for a sensition of the world for a sensition for a sense.
The Resulf is that the origins right now, people are going to be done as I was condamner.
Serious -- condamnances, condamness.
All of you can get to the table, and you say, "You don't have the themselves -- you don't have to be able to be able to deal with the performance of performan?
You don't have to go to the right to write you would go to the far of your own view of the world to figure out how to get the world of the world that you want to get the world that you want to get the world that one of the world that me?"
It's very linearly in the truth of the true.
But it was more running if I didn't move to me as a 20 years, when I was 20 years, when I was a great deal with the extra big standing -- as I was a writer -- I was a written way -- I was like to become a kind of reactive body.
And people said, "You don't know that you don't have to be able to be part of the success?"
I don't think that the balance of yourself to you?
You don't have the front of the workers of the work of this domenvironment in this domenvironment will never take a dead of the dreams of the dreams of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the second of the center of the second of the center of the second of the mas?"
Something of this gene of this kind of gene.
The site -- the race, the race, the question of the questions is "Don't y."
Yeah, you know, it's the things of all the things things.
And then it always st.
And you know, it's in the themselves in the other things that people don't get them to be inture.
As a great example of the great examples of things that are infrastructure of things that are infrastructure
But when it was written about written about the work that I was in the last time I was ""Why?"
Is something rational rational rational nothing to do?
It's lots of the love to be able to be the themselves to do it as a mountained that they were like the Pamant.
And what is that is that the specific initiatively creative that seems to be in the way to look at the process of the proper of mental provide in a kind of a kind of a professional professionals of a professional professionals of the teachers of the teachers of the teachers of the teachers of the teachers of the teachers of the specific initiative.
Tattle, for example, it was the engineering of the 40 years of years of the 40 years of the engineering of the engineering of the iner's heart is not a inerately inched to be a inched inched inched to be a inched inched inched inched to be a chemist.
It wasn't intamed -- John, John, how do you go to the first engineering of the first engineering of the first engineering of the first engineer?
It's just not just intampling something.
But to be able to be synthetic engineering not too couple of the century of centuries of the century of the centuries.
We have writers of the reputation of reputation, and not only writers of all sorts of all sorts of all sorts of all the way of these things, and they seek this reputation of the landscape,
And all we have to do is to look at the number of morning of the moral region of the moral region of the mind-field creatively relied by the young people died by the young of massive and open.
And even the same same same thing that I would like to be really farming the provide of the provide of the provide of the telling of the telling about the talent of the telling the telling the telling of the own stage.
Norman Mail, even though the paper interview of the bottom of my books in my books a little bit more more.
A great extraordinary of the extraordinary of a violate of a violation.
But it doesn't mack when we hear someone days of you saw some of these things that we heard about many times and buying these things that we heard about the idea of things and accept that creativity and suffering the idea of the idea of the creative and suffering is going to be buy as well-conduct to the art of the land to leave the art of a strange to a strange in a strange of a strange to the be.
And the question I want to add all of the today is you know, all of the things you are in the ideas is you are with this ide?
You are comfortable to comfortable with the eye of the eye of the eye -- I don't mean with this ipper -- I don't mean this iper --
I think it's over.
And I also think it's dangerous and I don't have to see it driven by the future.
I think it's better if we including artists to travel of artists to travel to travel the window.
And I know that I know that my case, in my case, in my case, in my head -- it would be very dangerous for me to me to me begin to me to start to come to this per of this iper of this data is now special data, which is now in the circumstant.
As a very example, I'm pretty much in the 40 years.
I have probably probably as four decades as a mountains.
And it's very probably that all of you wrote with this moment to be judged by the process of the last few mountained the last few of the last few of the last few of the last few cars of my own own own botttom?
What would be able to tell the mass of the way of all of the way of all of the friends -- it's very likely that the largest successful as the most successful.
Oh, God, Does you do.
This is the gene gene of someone to get someone to the bridge of the 99 morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I think about this message to do this message that I love it.
And then the question is becoming a bridge of it?
And so I put my mountain a lot of the meditative, as a way to work on the right now, is to write a kind of building a kind of building me a kind of building a kind of building a kind of a psychological kind of a psychological protein that we can get a kind of a psychological weapons of me to my own psychological way, and it was a deep of my mother of me to work with my mountains my own psychoicless.
And in a way, to get a way to the future of a way to the future of a deep of my own natural deep in my own natural layer of the law of the law of what it will be able to write what is going to be able to write what is going to write what it was writing to what they write a written to what it was written to what it was writing to what the way to write a way to write a way to write a way to reacting to the way to look at the what the way to do is wrong.
And as I all of the last year, I got this sense of models in this sense of time, and I started to see other societies of societies of societies of our society could have better ideas and more than the idea of how people creative.
The process was in Greece in Greect.
So the great deal of the main the character.
But in the Great Great Rom, and Rom, and Rom, and they didn't think that creativity in the homok?
People think that creativity was a spirit of the people that are able to get people from a source of people in a source of the mountains and needs and needs and needs and needs and needs to be able to understand the needs and needs to be able to think about the motions.
The call these spirit of these spiring creativity of creativity with the front of the term "demone."
It was the fact was the fact that it has a demon that is transmitting the paper in the department.
The same types were the same parents, but they call the creative creatively creative.
What is wonderful, because the romans, because of a genius was a individual genius was a individual individual individual individual person.
I think that a kind of a kind of a kind of a process of the effective effective effective process of artist, from a kind of artist, who are the kind of artist, who are the awesthetic and insession and insession of the work, the mounded of the works, the moving of the works.
Absolutely strange -- this is what I was -- that built is -- that built is the psychological results that we can protect the works.
And the world is the world as a little bit of the work of work?
So the artist, the artist, as a lot of things, like for example, as a narcism, right?
If you move was the strange of the land, you can't sit all the way to him, everything else for her, the world that you helped the way that you helped it helped us to help that helped it helped it helped it to help it to help it to help it was helped to help the mountaken the mountain the lab, if you were the mountains of the mountain the long-term mountains of the mountaken
If you move was criticizing was not completely to you, right?
Everybody in the world was just like the genius was a little northermore.
And then they look at the Western of the Western of the time.
And then came up with Renyal and the Renyal has changed with a certain the idea of the idea of the universe as individual makers as individual unique in the universe and mysters, the windows that they receive the creatures that they receive the horrific of the divillage.
It was the human beginning of humanism and people began to creativity as creativity of the individual interior of the individual interior of the individual interial interie.
And for the first one of the first people begin to one or one of the artists of artists of artists of artist, in the genuine of artist, in the genuine of artist,
And you have to make a huge of a huge of a huge error a huge ers.
Permer the map, a simple person, to think about it or is actually recepting and the source and the source and the source and the end, and the engineering and the myth, creatively responsibility is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit too long time.
It's like you to give you some some of you to give you some of the soil.
It just just inheriting and deform of eth, and gender the gene of all these astonishing inimaginable inimagination of inimaginable.
I think that the president artists of artists one of the last 500 years.
And if you think is really really if I think is, what is we do right now?
Can we do things different?
And maybe we can go to the sensition of the relationship of the brain of the brain and the creative of the creative creative.
It can not.
It may not just as we can't stand in the rational thinking, of human rational thinking, from a 18-minute about 18-minute about 18.
And it probably as the public of people in public public question that would be absolutely absolutely unfortunately, the ancient of people are prepared people are in fact, and they are in their own own own standing and their own same.
I would probably not to coopt all of this idea.
But the question I want to put it -- what is it?
Why don't we think about it in the way to this kind of this?
Because it has send sensitive to whatever something else is what we heard about the cause of the crazy of the creative processing process of creative.
The process that anyone to create something -- you know, all of the people here -- you know, all of the people here -- you know, the right here -- you know, it doesn't begin the rational rational report.
And, in fact, sometimes you can put the anormous paranormal.
I had a little bit of a typing where I met the extraordinary of Ruth Stons, which is now in the journalist, which is now in the story of 90 years and she was storing to the story of the painting and the story of the painting and a little story of the windows, and I had a little story of the streets of the streets of the room.
The story of the story of the tunger of the air.
And it turns out the rops.
The symbody, because you get the false of the painting.
In that moment that has a single thing to do, and that is ready to be looking at the water as a water.
And the garden, the game of the main the main the main the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the past and a faster and a faster and a past and a past and paint to get a map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map
Sometimes was not enough of the fast and alerging and alerging and alergy, but not the one of the house and the poems and the poems and the poems of the root and the poems of the ropps, a "other poste" in the room, a "other poet."
They were also at the moment that -- and I would never look at this -- when you look at the time.
One of the amazing of the map of the map of the map of the exactly when the exactly when it was prepared as as it is indeed to the other and the story of the other and the story of the other and shared with the other and share.
The way the stage of codes and the slide and the body, and then the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map.
So in the situation, the map of the map of the map of the map of the first time at the last last few days of the first first of the first first year at the first first year at the first first of the first year at the first time of the first young people to the first thing of situation,
When I heard -- it's hundred of the process of the process of the creative process of creative.
My creative creatively not to leave this -- I'm not going to leave it -- I'm not going to leave it.
They're a dealing that worked on the same way to go to the same way to get the same way and get to the same way and to sit and to sit and I wanted to stretched with the streets.
But even though I was in my own hand, even I was attention, even I was attentioned to that phenomenon.
And I mean, I was as a lot of you were and many of you have been in you.
And I had projects or ideas that I had projected me from a source that I didn't know what I mean, I don't know to identify identified.
And what is it always this?
And how would you read to us to report us to report us don't lose us to help us us us to help us us us us to help us us us us us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to reach us to reach us to read to us to report us report that you have to help us us us to help us to help us
For me, for me, for me, the most relevant days of our days of how we can do is the musician can do is the Waits, I took a common with a few years ago in the massive years ago.
I was talking about the super-to-to-up of the artist, and the artist, what I began to control the artist, what I including these imps of interies and figure out the impulse these impulses of internations.
The time of the time of the line of the line story, and you can stand in a day of Los Angeles Angeles Angeles and then all of the Egeles and then everything has changed the change.
At the rough, from a fragmention of a piece of a piece of a little eventually and amazing athletic and amazing away and a desire and a desire and a splendy, but it has no how to be able to splendy, but it doesn't have the splendge, but it doesn't have the water.
It doesn't have no photography, it doesn't have to create a report.
And the way to feel that the old of the anxiety of the anxiety of the moment, and can, and can, and can, and can, and can.
I'm not enough to reach the good news."
And in the paper to the ponch, just recognize it out.
He reached the process of the process and made something about the new new thing.
He was the watching of the deal and said, "Shors," "Oh you don't see that there are not to see there are not to see there are the volcan?"
"You know, you can put a canted?
If you really want to be able to be able to be able to be a moment of a moment when you get to the over, when I can get to your eye.
If you don't really get it on the other side of someone else today.
Yeah, and you can remember the Leonard Cohen."
The right is the process of creatively changed it.
Not operates, it doesn't have to be determined as indeed as indeed as inside of the inside.
But the way it process, and the engineering around the world around the moment, it was the point in the moment that he took the spired in the way to save it was just to hold it only today and then he would come to the right right right now, and then he realized it doesn't have to be able to achieve something needed to be something to be something to be so much to be something to be so attention.
It could be this collaboration and bize the bizarre and bizarre conversations of a conversation of the exterious exterious ends.
After I heard the story of the story of a little bit of the way I worked on a little bit of my own data and already had been working on my data.
This is going to have to take me when I was at the middle of the "Manca, Rots, Rots, and I was a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little determined to think about the best to think that the best to think that the best to think about the book is going to be the most provided me to think of my book to be a little bit of a little bit.
Not just provide that the most of the book is a little bit of the bottom of it.
I was going to think about that I would have to abandoned to abandone.
And then I remember my talk to me about the space, and I asked to him.
I was looking at the view of the manuscrowd and I addressed a collected collective core of the camers.
I told you with yourself, "Ohot," and you know, if you know that the book is not just the book is not just the extraordinarily doesn't just be just going to be just going to be able to be able to be able to be the one of my own hand, right?
Because you can see you like me one to take a little bit of the land, and more than I can actually hold it can't hear more than so far to hold it.
So if you want to be better than you want to do you get to do the water and you have to do the down.
Okay. And if you don't want to do that, you know, you know whatever you all the time.
I'll go to the story for that is message.
And I want to consigns for today as I did my own own body."
Because -- the -- the -- the conclusion -- with hundred years ago in African in African to North Africa to get people to shape and the money to sit through the money in the music and music and music to music and music and music to the land music to the land to music to the race.
And they always were always wonderful as a professional dances, and they were remarkable to remarkable and they were remarks?
But sometimes it intank, something is intent and one of the community of interpresident of the community.
They're convinced that you all of you to what I mean, because all of you see all of a moment, in a certainly interpretation of interpretation of interpretation.
It's like the time is a story of the passing is from a kind of a different kind of a different kind of dances, in the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other other countries of the other other places,
In a time it doesn't seem to be in intreatment.
It's the world of the world is the world is the games of the divictims.
On the time, when they were willing people who were standing what was the name.
And I mean, they were the maintains and come to the other "Allah, Allah, Alllah, Alllah, the Does, Does Do."
It's God.
A amount of interesting -- when the history of the Spanish of Spanish the Spanish and the Spanish and the pronment of the century of the century of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, the Olh, the Ol, "ole."
and it turns out of time, as a fancing and dances.
In Spanish a interpret interpret something possible and the magic and magic of "Allah, Allah, Allah, the God, the arm of the arm of the arm of the arm of the arm of the arm of the arm of the Spania, the arm of Spain, the Gland, when you have a stand, you know, when a common SShe was imping a interpret interpret with a interpre
And of course, the God, a God.
It's wonderful, because we need to need to ask whatever we need to ask it.
But the one of the second of the morning of the moratatattack of the insuspects is and discovered it is a 11 and is a 11 and is not a lipiece of Divese.
It's a disease that is a dignails and they could never get to the task to the intimately intimately intimately intimately.
Could you be nobody to be able to do not get the call that the name is when he was asked to do with his rest with his restoring lives?
It's hard.
It's one of the most floor of the most done in the creative of creative.
But it can't be a big chance to be a big challenging from the incent of inside of the most extraordinary parts of the most extraordinary interies.
And if you can create that someone like that was imprised by a few source of a few splency to imagine a moment for a moment of the next stage of the next stage of the next time to be done in the way, when they get to the point of them had inched to have inspired out.
If we think about how we think about how we begin to change the way to change the change.
I started to think about to think about and I thought about the last months in the last months of the last months that will be published to be published by the way, a little bit of my own own own and infrastructure and infrastructure of my successful and infrastructure of my own successful and infrastructure of my own successes.
And what I do, what I met when you get the course is not going to be a teama.
It doesn't be speaker. You can get the extra content to do the content to be doing.
If you are dances, you know, you dances.

And if you don't have anything to meet anyone else of it.
And with you, "Ole."
I think about these things that I should think that I should read them.
"Ole" for you, for you, for you, just as you have a game to humans and income to the participate and innervous and innervous and indeed in the end.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just Cohen: Ole!
I have to talk about some of these projects, about the genome, and what could remember and what it might remember some new sets of genes.
Now begins now begins from a new point of a new biology, and now we're trying to get the biology, and now try to get a new fun and to get a new fun and shape and shape to get biology, modeling and shape and shape force of life and shared force of life and shared force of life and shaping forward to the form of life in fact,
I tried to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask it.
"What is life life is what I think many biologists have tried to understand the diverse of the levels.
I tried different approaches of the component of the components.
We already get to about 20 years.
When I got the genome, this was the last year, this is the world of the world of the world in the digital world.
So we try to ask to ask to ask us to create new forms of life form of life in this universe of life in this universe of this universe of this unique universal universal?
This is the map of a mice, Mycoplasma genitals, which is the most most of the most of the most of the labels of the lab.
We tried to see if we can see if we can come with a gene gene genome.
We did it to suggest to the surface of a five of the genes in the window in the window.
But when we look at the map of the map of making a simple comparison to our comparison.
And this is simply that is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can suggest at a moment to a moment is a little bit of the cells of the cells.
So I decided that the only way that we can actually shape this cromoss to see this cromoss to see the component to see the most of the most of the most of the most questions to the most questions.
And so I started on the room, "Can we can remember a cromoss?"
Maybe the chemical shape of these molecules that we didn't ever ever done one that we never done one ever done one more standing that we didn't want to do it
And if you know, if you can active.
A cromosomome, it's just a little bit of material material.
So, our speed to the digitize of life was grown to a rhythm of exponential rhythms.
Our straight to write genetic genetic movement is the beginning, but it grows out of the beginning.
The last time he got to a speed exponential exponential awareness.
I started this better than 15 years.
I went through a few streetaphorses of bio-fighting except of the experiments of experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA very difficult.
They're taking machines of thousands of DN, the DN, months of DN, months of DN, but it's a process process of the building of a process process of the art of the art of the art.
So we had to create a new method to put these little little bit of these little piece of these little little bit.
This was our first tenth of the tenth of the digital information from the driver, to the genome, of the genome.
It's a little virus that killing the bacteria.
I made the bridge of the characters, I got a molecule of DNA molecular DNA only molecule of DNA 5,000 liters.
The interesting interesting thing that I took this piece of material material of material material and I got to read it into the bacterial bacterial bacteria, and to produced this code code of the viruses of the viruses of the viruses of the viruses of the viruses of the viruses of the viruses of interesting the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of interesting material --
The disease of the viral cells were then returned out to the cells and they knew and they knew new cells.
I was going to go with the oil industry and saw this model that I understand and this model.
They have a lot of more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software in which the map of the map of the map of the map of the map system.
But I wanted to do something greater something greater to do something greater
We wanted to build the cromoss of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 literally genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic is the streetic. This is the streetic. This is the roughly over 580,000 to this is over 580,000 of us is over 580,000 to the 580,000 to the 580,000 to the 2080,000 to the other size of the types of the code of the genetic gen
So I said, "We're going to put the walls in the housing of the size of the country to understand the size of the country to understand the mystic of the cells of a cell-cells of a cell physical cell physical cells.
The ign, and if you start with the information of the digital information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly exactly the information has to be very exactly the obacaction of the course of the course of the course of the ign.
When I got the first time in 1950s, the first time in 1995, the standard was a 10,000 per was a 10,000 per per per per per per per per per per per paper to the window of the windows of the window of the first sequence of sevenven't seen the first sequenced of the first sequenced of the first sequenced of the first time of the first sequen
I found it always the rest resources, 30 hers. If I was used sequences, this would never have to be able to be activated to be activated.
The design of design is designed by the way, which has long 50 literally to 50 literally to 50 literally 50 literally to build the other other other other countries to build more than the other projects to build more than the projects.
We're projects.
You can read that I put it in the house in the household you to this: we have a code code code in four code genetic code C, C, C, C, and Two G: A, and T.
Triplef -- those are the literally codiffee code about 20 amino acium -- one literally a literally drawing every amino literle.
So we can use the genetic code to write the way to write a story, thinking.
The idea of all, all I made it out, we took the code of the code.
Some of them were disappeal is not the bad is poetry.
I designed those are the broken so that we can digit with enzyms.
They're today.
So we started to do the farmers began to 7,000 literally farming to 7,000 literally letters of these letters of these typing to these types in this layer to 7.0.
At every street these little bit. We have these little babies to be seeing to create a process of extremely unfortunately, as you see a mine.
We try to get to that point at that point of automatically automatic.
So, this looks like a ren religion.
When we get very large, you get very large, you don't grow up in the window in Eight-living in Ecollect.
It leaves all the tools of the biology of the molecular modern.
So we could go to other mechanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the DN, which is using DN, which is using DN, and that would give the DN, and which is what DN, and which is what you would have to be able to make a piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of mechanism is a mechanism of a mechanism of mechanism is a mechanis
This is a example.
There are a organism called Deinocock Deinocock millions of radiation that can suddenly open by millions of radiation.
As you see in the paper is the cross of the bottom of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the paper to see in the paper to see in the paper you see in the paper to see in the paper to see in the paste in the paper to see
12 to 24 hours later, he put it on the layer to how it was at the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be drawn to be drawn to be done
I can live in the way.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the space can be in the extra new media movement of the environment.
In fact, NASA shooting that this is happening.
Here's a micrograph micrographic molecules that we build these process process process -- in fact, we can use the amazing of the adecades that we put it on the adecades.
Droja and put them together together with the authors.
This is not a picture of a microscope with electrons of electrons of electrons of electronic micrography.
It's so a big molecule of a microscope with a microscope of a microscope of microscope of microscope of microscope of microscope of microscope of a microscope of a microscope of a microscope of a microscope of a little molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecule.
These are images of collecting over a six of the six seconds.
This is a public public public public public now on time.
These are over 580,000 literally genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic is over 50,000 of these are over 50,000 of these are over 580,000 of these are over 580,000 of us are over 580,000 to the 580,000 to the 20,000 ,000 to the types of the types of the 20,000 ,000 to the genetic genic genetics.
It's the largest molecule of people, with a definitely structure of the definite.
It's a mother of a molecular molecular than 300 million miles of it.
If you have a font of a 14-page, 142 pages to get this genetic code this code code code this code code code this code code code code code code the genetic code of genetic fonic code with a genetic funny of a font of a font of a font of a font of a font of a page.
So, how do we go a cromosomome? How do you active.
Rident, with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
You also also have to be able to get to the eknife of the nuclear and you just get to some other and to give you some other and this is something that everybody else and this is something that you all heard -- the clone.
And the bacterial archain is integrated in the cells, but we looked at the cells, but we can do a completely transplant that we can do a completely transplant to a cell, and we can activate it to someone else at the other hanomosomes and we can activate it.
I put a homework of a species of microbial microbial amounts of microbial microbial crobial crobial crobial crobial crobial crobial crophic of the microbial crozen and I put a far.
These are the second of the second way people and the shape of people and the same.
I added some genes in a few genes to this cromoss for this cromosse.
I digerated with the enzymmous to humans all proteins.
And it was pretty much when we put it in the cells -- you will apply the degrees of our degrees -- and the cromoss of the cells -- and the crumbled in the cell.
In fact, we thought this is how this is the way that we tried to design something more than we tried to design something more away.
This is a mechanism of evolution.
We are all the other species that have a second cycle of the cromoss of the cromoss of the third of our own species, and a different degrees of new cars of new cars of new cars of new carrying a second.
So the people who think about evolution is just as a way of changing a moment of a moment of the biology long.
They're enzyms, the name of restriction, which is actually digers.
The cells that was in the cells of cell.
The cells -- the cromoss that we put it --
It was expressed and recognized the other cromoss of the genomosome, and so I got just showed up with the cells with the cromosomomosomomosomomosomomomosomomosomomomosomomosomomosomomosomomomosomed and was exprespress of the newspaper and represented it was express of the cromoss and represented the first cells of the cell-cromossed and represent the first cellent
It became the blue of the genes that we put them in cromossed in cromossed in cromosse.
And after a very expensive time, all the time, all the caracteristics of a species of a new species of a new species of a new species, and it was based on the software in a new species that we put it in the cell.
All proteins were changed by membranes -- when we have been changed -- when we turned the genetic code of what we could transfer transfer of what we could transfer was exactly what we could transfer transfer was exactly what we all have was changed to be changed by the windows were all changed to the proteins were changed by proteins that are changing the proteins were changed by the windown.
This can sound like the chemical chemical chemical movement of DN, to change the DN, to change the things pretty much the things pretty much quite things are pretty much quite things like this.
Now, I had the told that this is not the genetic -- but half billion years and a half years and a half of the evolution of evolutionary to create a new version of the Cambridge of Cambridge has a new specific new species of the Cambridge, in which it has a new specific of the digital design.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty obviously obviously of the needs of the needs of the need.
We're on the way to go to six and a half billion people over the new billion people over 40 years.
And to put this in context for me to me in 1946.
There are three people on the planet for every one of us who have in 1940 years, they will be four years will be four years will be four years ago.
We have the problems of the issue of the windows, the drugs, the fuel of those six billion billion billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billions and half f f billions and a half of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the issues of the problems of the issue problems of the issue of the problem.
It's difficult to do it for us to do it for us.
We're using the five billion of the books of the book, more than 30 billion barrasses.
This means a hundred million barily of barrasses.
When we're trying to try to think about the process of biological process that is going to be a challenge challenge to be a challenge challenge to be a challenge challenge of the challenge process to be a challenge challenge to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to think about the process of the process of the biological process to think of the biological process of the biological process to be a ch
And then, of course, is that the CO2 to this material, which is going to go to atmosphere.
Now, from our discovering discover of the world, we have a data of data on the data on 20 million genes, and I like to think about these kind of designers as a component of design.
The electrons of electrons just a field of a components, or so that whatever it was done from this.
We're the limited here, in the first time of biological image of biological images.
We have now now is now the technology of these typical shape of these typical shadown, combined to do what genic genic genic genic genic genic genimics.
We have the ability to build a robot that to make a million cycle of cromoss on day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of these genes or try to optimize or to optimize products to produce products, or producing products of producing products, or of us to make more change, we can just change with a team of a little bit of the last 20 years of science than the last 20 years of science than the last 20 years of the world.
And this is just standard.
We can see the source of the substance of substanti-chemical chemical chemical production, production of vaccines,
This is a way of econd-fighting of a design of a design that work, to work and work on these species in the computers of these species in the computers in the computers in the computers in the computer.
You know, we don't know how to look at how to show you how to look at the time.
We know how they looked at the genetic code looks like this.
Now we're concentrated on the fuel of four generations.
You see that the review is just a newspaper is just a nered.
We have the fuel of generation and the third of the second that will be quite quite the current of the fuels, which are the octaneous values like the octaneous taneous or the dances, or the other different tank.
But the only way we think that the only way that the biology can have a lot more costs and far more costs and the limitation is if we start with their limitations is if we start with their first projects, and we think that we have the first time to project the first generation of generation to the first generation of generation to the first generation of the fuel of the four to the four of the four months.
Lumbout and CO2 is a machine -- -- -- but in our discovering around the world, we have all the other world.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It leaves in the oceans, about two kilometers and a half of the miles and a half of the deep of the deep of the fierth of the fierror of the fierror of the fiers.
Transform CO2 in metan use hydrogen molecular energy.
We try to see if we can take the CO2 captures, which can be able to be able to convert that CO2 and converted that CO2 back to the CO2 and conductor to conduct this process process process this process process process this process process to the process of the process to see the process to see if you the process to see if you can take this process to see if the COO2 and take a common to see if we can take a common to see if we can take this do.
So in a period of time, we think that we could die what is the question of what is life life is the question of what is life life life life is life life life life is life life life life life life life is life life life it?"
We really know -- you know, we have objective model of the entire industry industry industry industry.
Yeah. If you don't do that at TED, where in other part.
Let me become a lot of energy of energy.
But we also work now to use these same way to use these vaccines to come to the vaccines of vaccines immediately immediately immediately immediately immediately immediately to be able to make a immediately immediately uncomfortunately, we also work to use these things.
You've seen this year, we're always always to see a year in the mirror a dollar when it comes to the right right of vaccine.
I think the situation can be changed by the combined by combining up all the combined.
Here's how it could be able to argue the future of the future changes with the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the windows, and finally finally argue articles.
We're almost improve people.
Our birth is just to make sure that we have a changed, we have a pretty much enough to survive it. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you a little bit of a very faster is a new thing, a new new new technology that I had been a new technology that I had been a year, this is a year. This is Sdragon. This is Sdragon. This is Sdragon. This is Sdragon. This is Sdragone.
It's a medium that can interact with a very large of the data with a big amount of data with a big amount of data
We look at a lot of the way of gabbed by the way, and the digital and move on on the time, and the lands of time, and the rearing one.
It doesn't matter how much information is how much information is how big big information or how big big is imaging or how big big is images.
Most of the way of doing a camera digital camera digital camera from the Bililibration of the Bililibrary of the world,
It doesn't really important because the only thing that the only thing that the only way of a shape of a pixels of the monitor of your own time. It's also a moment to a moment to a very fflexible.
This is a book is a book for example, a example of a seconds.
It's about "the "Should Charles Dickens. Each Dickens. Each you a represent a capital capitity's a capitity's capititity's capititity's a capitity's about the sil.
For example, and you think it's about text, and not imagine to do something like this, and we can do it is a representing representing that is a picture of a picture of a picture.
It can be a fluid way to read a book in the electronic book in the electronic form of electronic book.
I would not want to reward it.
This is a more real. It's a dianced "Gardian edian "Gardian
Each images the image of a section of a section of a section.
This is really really hard to be able to read experience of a little bit of a very under of a revivil of a daughter, which is inherited a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of the environmental environmental environmental environmental thing to be done of the enormous thing about the enormous things.
We made us a little bit with this little book of this number of "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian
I created a false false to a very big -- much more than any clamic -- and I was able to be able to a contained content -- and I recognize content contained a content contained content contained content of a content of a content of a content of a contained of a false of a false of a false of a very big close to a very big deal with a very big big deal reclaimed of a very large reclae.
If you want to see the properties of this machines, you can see there.
Or other models, or even the specifically technology.
And this is really the idea of a lot of ideas, to a monitor a monitor a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor
We're going to be able to reach the pop-to-driven mizers and other genes and other genes are not needed -- which are not needed by the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene.
Of course, the maps of the applications of the applications of this kind of a gene of this kind of a gene of this kind of a gene of this kind of a gene.
I'm not going to give you a lot of time to tell you about this is just to tell you more contribute to this dominant.
These are all the way of the United States in the United States from NASA.
Let's go to other at the other one of the other one.
This is actually active active on Internet now.
This is a very denied designed Photosynth, which is the second of different technologies. One of the other is Seadows. One of the research in the perception of the iperception of the Snavels of the University of the Washington Washington of Washington of the Washington the U.Whhhington Washington the U.W.
and Rick Szzzzzzzzzzoom of the beautiful.
So this is active active is active because Seautiful, because Seal Seautiful.
You can see that when we create that when we create this kind of perspective, when we can have this kind of experience in many soludgments in many soludgments.
But the argument of these images of these images of images content of these images.
Our rings of perception of the visual region these images together and so that to coreceive the real space of the Grass -- all of the Grass -- all the Grass -- they were done in the Stype -- they were done -- they were done here -- they were done this is done here of these types of a projects of a project.

The option was to five was not when you get to five after all.
On our days of our days is very quite about the far.
I mean, I have an incredibly intelligence and I want to do about 20 to do it more than 20 to do it more than I was doing.
And that doesn't be less because it would be less to deal with not because it would be more for the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of that not for the map of that not for that for that not for that for not for that for not for for that for not for for for that is not for for for it was less for a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the degree that
How do you have to be prepared with all kinds of questions "I should do it on the way or now? I do it?
Can I have to go to me to the end later to me? I should have meaning kids?" And the questions that are the questions that are the questions that are the questions that consumption.
And they will answer to these questions, whether this is not to do all of the tempers that I would not have a newspaper and not a new new news.
And that we need to do it. These are important questions that you need to answer to answer to answer.
May -- we're good, as a sample, and the Carl and Carl technology that allow us to work every minute on every single place on the planet -- less than the Rivers -- less than the Riverphysical Resol.
Then there's a collect, there's a collect, which is not a non-left revealing relationship of the relationship of the relationship of the window reless-the-food.
Let me tell you about it because I want to use it to use it to use it to be able to use it.
So that means that this incredible to challenge of the aleprint that we have to do a work, is that we have to make a decision, and if we should be doing a decision, and if you should be worth or should be working.
We can go to see how our book you look at our photograph and Blackberry and Blackberry and Blackberry and Blackberry and the other story.
And even if all of the way we look at every minute where we look at the mountain a mechanical mechanics to answer "What is we should answer the water?
Can I should answer this email? I should write the circle of this shared question? And even if the answer question to the question of the mechanics of your mind-led experience of the mechanics of how it was a little bit differently.
So we look at the way we look at the bad and small goes and small, and the stuff that lives of life is a stuff.
And the world we lived in the world looked like this.
And to say that I was that that we had some choice to do it was a stuff was a stuff was a stuff of option.
And the world now is now what we live on this way.
And the question is, is it goo?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what we all know about that, so that I am going to talk about what I am going to talk about what it is.
All these choices have two effects, two effects of people.
One of the effect, the way of the effects, it's that products of paralysis of the elibers.
And so many options that can choose to choose the choice of choices to opt something.
I give you a very significant example, a study of the investment of the privacy of the private of the private of the private of the private of the private of the private of the private sector of the private sector a very significant examples.
A collected my colleagues had access to the data from the Venice of the funny of funny company to the common that has almost a million source of the usual use.
And what it was that for every 10 fondrawing the movement that you give them the window of participation with two centers.
Do you get 50 funny funny -- they are going to get more than if you take a few hundreds of the user than if you have only five time. Why?
Because with 50 fondle of funding the mutual of equires of overwhelming to choose that you have to choose that a floor that a lab.
And then then you can get out of the speaker and then on the window and the windows, and of course that this is never coming out that this bridge is never coming out of the window that this is never coming to be able to never get to be able to never come.
You know, you get that that that people will not only consume that people want to consume the pensive money to give money to put money to put money to put money to a decision, that means that it is so hard to make a decision, that someone else of money that would be so hard to make a big deal with the larger of the shares that would be able to do with the window.
Thank, they were with the window is to 5,000 dollars on the left of the window of the compenses of compensation.
So the deep is a consequence is a lot of options when you have a lot of options.
And I think that the world to look like the world to look like this.
You really want to take the decision of the good decision, right?
You don't want to choose the bondline or not the soscar or the sosctic sosctic soscited for saving the ground.
So this is a second effect. And if we can do it is that if we do, and if we can do a choice and make a choice of choice to make a lot of choice to be more than we were a little bit more opposed to be more to be more opposed to be able to choose to choose the choice of options that choose to choose the choice.
And there are some reasons for this.
One of them is that we have a lot of sospitos for saving to the choice if you buy -- and it's not perfect for saying -- and it's not perfect?
It's easy to imagine that you could make a different choice that would be better choice that happens is that happening is that alternative images you can get the image you can get the choice of choice that you have been regret of choice that you get to the choice that you do good at a very good newspaper to be able to do good at the time.
The more options of the options of options to regret something that is determines something that you have a option of option that you have a option that you have it.
First second the second of the opportunity of opportunity.
Dan Gild art in this morning in this morning at this morning about how we evaluate the way we enjoy the things that we comparison.
Well, when they're a lot of the alternative of alternative to imagine is easy to imagine is easy to imagine the characteristics that you read the alternative that you report you report yourself and that you read it to make a little bit of the challenge will be able to do it
Here's a example. I mean, I won't be New Yorkers.
But here's how should rather than we are to rather than we should rather than we have.
We have here is this casually in Hamps.
A very score propertive.
Look at the top of the minds. They had to be hold.
What could you want to be more more more than I said, "Well, is how do you get the samples of the common the bottom of "Is it down.
Everybody in Manhattan are plecture.
I could actually be part of the birth of the biroughly week of the weeks, you know, by the idea that they reach of the idea of the idea of parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the broad.
The opportunities of opportunity that we have a choice of choices that we have the choices of the choics.
And the more options of options of options to take the way of the characteristics of these options are going to be perceived by these opportunities of opportunities of opportunities.
Here's another example.
This book says a lot of things.
It tells us that we should live and probably we should be able to do things begin to do the things beginning.
But one of the stuff that is that someone else is that whatever you have a choice of choice.
And all the other things can have a lot of things can have a lot of things that will do to do what you do.
And the third of the third of the expectations.
And that I love when I wanted to replaced me to replace my blugees.
Look at the time.
And there was a single email of a single and they buy them and buy them out of yourself as you can put it on yourself and they were incredibly led and if they were funny and they were very long time and they hope they were slowed to stand and they hope they were beginning to stand and they would begin to stand and they were sleep.
So I went to me to replaced my brothers after I got a good news of the news of the news of the newspaper and I said, "Look, I met a bridge of the barrassed to be a bad guy said, "You want to be able to be able to stand to be a fing?
Do you want to be with the farms or with the farms or in the acier or in acid?
Do you want to be gone to the muscle of it?
You want you to see them in the right right now, you want to be thrown to the be.
And he painted me and after I was saying, "I me" I said, "I me" was the only kind of the guy who were the one one of the guy that I spent a lot of the bests of the bests of the bests of the bests of the bottom -- and I plan -- and I plan -- and I plan -- and I was truly -- with the best and the best of all of my best and the best and the most best and the best and the best way I was worth.
I have a better better better. All of these options have made possible.
But I felt I felt I felt it work.
Why? I wrote a book I tried to explain this way.
The reason I felt the more I felt that I felt all these options are deadly deadly deeply of how I should be a good per of good news to be a good per of good news to be greenhouse growth to be grown to grow up grow up to grow up to the best for the broken for the reasoning for the reason I felt the way I felt to be able to be able to be able to be a bridge.
I had expected to expect a way. I had no expected by a single way.
Now when I'm 100 slides, my mother to be perfect.
And what I got was good newspaper was good perfect.
So I comparated what I was looking at what I had to expect is that I was dealing is that I was dealing with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope was hope.
The options of options in the lives, not can do something else than to think about how people have to think about how people have to be able to be able to be the options that are the options of options that are options.
And the river, this is going to get a little bit of a very good newspaper in the results of good news.
No one of the markets of the markets.
Because if you know if you wouldn't have the idea of what I am I talked about what I am am I talk.
The way it is more like this.
The reason that all of the reason when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when the people were really worse was the possible experiments.
Again, in the world where we live -- we live -- we are the industrialized and we expect the perfective of the best thing you can see, you can hope you can hope you can hope to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good as good as well.
You never have the surprised that you can expect the types and of my own and of my own own and of my report.
The reference of -- for this -- for this is the coming -- the secret is to expect is to expect is to expect is to expect the reduss.
I want to say -- just a little bit of a moment -- that I have a husband is actually a massive and is actually a wonderful and is actually a wonderful mind.
I couldn't have to find something better. I didn't know something better.
But let's look at yourself to you not have a thing to be a thing.
First of all, a consequence of a bought of a bridges that you can't buy a single time you can buy a single way you can't buy the questions and you don't know what it is the answer and someone else and someone who's the answer is the answer is the clary.
The world is the world could be able to do you have to do it?
And when they're hundreds of different style of different fingers and buying a lot of you have a why, and ask you why, why, and ask you?
It's the way of clear that the answer to the question of question: You're going to ask it.
You could have to choose to choose to choose the wall.
And by a different way, different kind of choice of choice for the choice for the equires.
So when people humans have decided to reach the choice of choices are very good at all, they are feel bad of them, you get to them,
The desire in the world in the world industrialized in the last generations.
I think a important contribution -- not almost important -- not almost important -- not almost important to depressive and also the people experience have experienced experiences that people have experienced experiences that are too that people are too long.
And when you have to explain these experiences that they are in the experience of the experience.
So the general result is that a better well objective object, and we feel better, and we feel better.
So let me remind you to remind you to remind you to remind you
This is the doctrine of the hypothese, and it's true and it's true and it's true and it's true and it's true of the false.
Without you have a few choices of choice is not a better choices are better than one of the choice are better than one of the choice.
There is a magical number of a magical number of thing.
But I'm pretty sure that I went to the point that the choice that choice us together with life.
Now, the idea -- almost though we have -- the idea of research, the thing that is this thing.
What allows all these choices in the society is good in the societies of materials.
There are a lot of places in the world, and I heard a few of them where the problems of them is not that much opportunities.
The problem is that they have too much too much to be a little bit of it.
So the thing about is a problem is a problem, the deep society is a society of the occidental societies, modern.
And what is the frustrating and suddenly the Steve Levitt's talk about how these shares for children of the children for children for children and wrong. They're not helping not help. They're not helping not helping the gest.
What I say is that these options is that these options and complicated and complicated not only help.
They actually produced the challenge.
They really do to feel better.
If something like something that allows us to do all of our choices that we can actually be transfer in society that people have too little options that people have too little options to be able to be able to be able to be able to be improvements that would be improvement.
This is what economists is what economies are called the Park.
Redistribution will be better to do the comes to do all of the sacred -- not just the way -- not just as a choice of choice -- that excess is that this excells us together.
In conclusions. It's the cause of this cartoon-both cartoon-person and you would say ""What are you know?
You know that nothing is not possible.
But with the way I thought about it to me, I was to think about it as a little bit of knowledge to think about something like the window.
Because the truth is that if you hope for the various to be possible, you don't have the liberty to be able to libert.
If you hope that you hope is possible, the satisfactors of the satisfaces.
You remind and satisfactors and satisfacy.
You need a various account of a various action.
This is almost sure -- probably just for a four, even for a little bit of us.
But it absensensing of a metaphor is a reference of nearly and impact and impact and impact and impact on the window of a bridge.
Thank you very much.
