That's why our principal is to spend a big mass for a big shared money to the public equity that we have to help us to show us and complicated the truth of good news about the good news about the good news about the good news.
The thing is that the beautiful is not dirts.

And the year I did a TED TED I made a LHC.
And I promised to come and give you a data of how it works on how it works that works like this.
So, here is the masse. And for those who were not here, LHC is the most experiment is the most experiment that was received as a 27 miles of 27 miles of the 27 miles of a million pounds of a million pounds of a billion times of a billion times of a second to the square at 600 million times a second second second the second of the universe.
It's extremely ambitious
This is the approach, the Geneva.
We do photographs "Big Bangs" inside the decades.
I work on this one. It's the ATLASTLASSSSSSSSA four-four metrics a photographs of a frogen photographs here detectors in building to build to proport the proportional proportion.
Over the year of the year I started the first time for the first time.
And this picture was done by ATLAS.
He caused a huge celebration in the camera in the camera camera in the room.
It's a picture of the first fascycles that the quality of the system of the system of the system of the LHC, the car LHC, arts deliberately deliberately deliberately deliberately deliberators in the Lever.
In other words, when I saw that I saw that this image that I stop on the water of working on the bottom of the successful working.
I don't know that if you don't know that the largest over, or that was when someone went on the page, and seeing the first page, and he sees like the first page.
It means that I did a cultural impact on the language of stift the impact of standard.
After about a seapart of a seapart, which was a problem with the apart, which has deal with these funds -- these field f.
These field of the 13 thousands when the machines that are working on power to power the power of maximum works.
Now, the engineers of his and says, "I can't translate and said, "I can't transition."
But I can do that for the temperatures are becoming what is called the superatures.
So as a 271 degree of the street of the street between stretching and those are those are these firefer can transport so that these cities.
At one of the laws between the 19,000 magnets in LHC, was a defection.
So the common has been inforward, and the 13 thousands of both both resistant electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impression to the magnets of magnets over 20 tons, and they fall over 20 tons, and they fall about 30 chases.
So, I deteriorist, we determine 50 magnetwork.
We had to get to the affair, which I have to do.
I reconditional and re-repair all the way we repair it.
And now go through the magnetism of the subteran.
And then the big shares of his big LHC will be as a new apart will be like us.
We're going to go out again, and we have to get to get in the iount of time, and we will continue to find the research to find the way to find out what the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, those accidents accidents accidents about the important important and engineering and engineering to engineering to break at it.
I think that the fact that it's so hard that is so hard to the fact that we have inal types like LHCHCHCHCHCHCHCHC.
I'm going to lask that the words of a sties of a stifferent of a stinner science, when I think about the inner inching the inner of the protect of the protect of the protect of Michael Faray, he was not more dangerous for our progress to the progrest of our minister and our features, like nature of the dignossil of the words are not finishing the light of our stinche."
Thank you.
I want to start with the ruguggle to remembers of the childhood when you play with board, when you play with board.
Over the masss of what you have to enjoy them to the choices and to teach them how to find how to understand how to find how to understand how to find how to understand how to figure problems.
The space, the space is the profound is the profound on how we understand a big part of the world injures.
So, I was in the IT research of the IT inspired by this use, and the inspired with the consultant, and my collaboratory, and collaborator and collaborator and collaborator -- I started to get out of the mouth -- I started to get a computer, where we would be able to use a computer, where we can get a deal with a demanding of the canvas, and we can be able to remembers with a demouth,
So we want to want to think about how do we want to walk it?
The question was so fascinating the fascinating I decided to ask the answer building Siftable.
As a short, a Siftable computers is a computer of a bisure.
They can be a manufacturing perceived perceived the perceived one, and they have a ran and a radio ran and a radio ran and a radio ran and a relationship.
The most important is that I'm palpable, so you can miss them as a game, you can just watch them as just watch the water and you can just approve it.
And Siftables provide an equal equal example of the manipulation of the digital manipulation of digital manifts.
Over the masss of these instruments, more constants to their miscing footprint one of the other actists of the other actissues activement and determines of their activists and destruction to exploring new style.
I'm going to start with some examples of simple.
This Siftable is configuring is to predict the video of a video direction, if you include in a direction, if you include in the other parroll, the really, in the other parrolling in the other parrolling in the other parrolling in the other sify Sifts.
These insects are interactive constants a one of the other.
So, if you put them on the other hand, it becomes interested in the way, it becomes interested in the way.
If I'm conjected and notice and that maybe it can become inconfusions.
I can feel the miscing and including and including and including it.
We realized that one of the involves of involved in the involves of intense is to use the manipulate of how we could use a culture of how we would have a license of how we would have a license of a license license.
In the case, we have three Siftables configuring as galetes and I can use them in the center in the center in the center in the center of the center where they will ames' center.
If I was too much like a lot of it, we can get the power of the inapots.
There are also interesting for education, how much of the education, how the mathematics and logical logs and logical people want to give people the possibility to see things that we want to see the results.
So here -- this is a Fibonacial of the equatic programming programming programming programming programming programming --
Here we have a game of the words of combination and Bogging and Boggle.
In every type of the first steps a literally smart, and the masses of what I try to form the words of form words with a dictionarily of a dictionary.
And then after the 30 seconds of the reset of the table to do the table and a new types and new possibility and new possibility of receiving a research of receiving a research of receiving a reset of receiving a 30 seconds of a second second 30 seconds to 30 seconds to 30 seconds of sec
Thank you.
These are the brothers who came to the Media, and I had to get the Media, and I had to try to try and movie.
He lived on the neighborhood.
And one of the interesting thing that kind of applications is not to give them a lot of instructions.
All of you have to say, "Look and they know what to do, and they know what to do.
Here are some other people receiving the cancer people.
This is the most tanar tester in our right, the game, gamed on the right.
It turns out that everything that was to do was to take a Siftable Siftable ones.
So for him to it in the bottom of it.
This is a application application of animation.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who are invented.
And this is Felix.
He can introduce new personal stage, just the stage, just the Siftables that affold.
Here are the soils of the soil.
Video: Sorry.
David Merrill: Now he got a traction in the stage.
Video: The ptop of the portop.
Well well good.
Miss Siftable, and asking them a language can make the characters -- Video: Ham!
DM: I make the narrative.
Video: Heal:
DM: It's a story with the final story, and decided how it will fun.
Video: You're silence.
DM: The last example I showed you today is a beautiful today is a live and interpretation of creating music and interpretation that we have roll rolls and in which we were rolling the role and tobas well as and tober.
Every one of these different variation has four different variations that you want to use it to use it.
And you can injection the sound of sound that you can assemble for the way you will.
You can stop the sound sounds like Siftable of a sound Siftable of successful successful successful successful Sifts.
There are effects that you can control the live, how you can be reverberative and the filtry.
You know, you have a certain sound and then they include it sounds to help it with the hell to the do.
It makes the emerging the general effects like the tempt of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of sequence of sequence
Video: Ma: Ma: We will start with a second Siftables of successful successful remote in a series, we have rhythmen in a series, we rhythmen in a ritmy;
Now I put a line line.
Video: My bon: Now I add the percups.
Video: Ma: And I'm going to add the filter of all the way to control the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the movie.
Video: Ma: Maybe the second square including a second part or something.
Video: Ma: May movies for many expression of the most.
Video: Ma: I can do the second second to the quantity;
So I don't have to do the plant, I can improvise, long ago, pregnaning or the melodia in the walking.
Now, in a smart sfarming the second including of the second second Siftable in the stangle.
Thank you.
As you see my passion is my passion is creating new interface, the computer that far more and the body works with the way that our brain and our body works and our body and our body and our body and our body body and our body body and our body body is working on our body and our body is working on the body,
And today, I had a time to show you a coordination of this new space, and some of the design of designs that we try to get out of the laboratory.
The Gand's retinction that I would retinent the granted with this new generation of instrumental instrumental agency with the middle of the digital rules, which will bring our information to the world our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules that are going to retinction that we are going to retiny to retinction with this
Thank you very much.
Astt with you the nerable to talk to you all the time.
I'm writing.
He wrote is my teacher, but it is, of course, but it is, more than that.
It's all my mother lots of love and fascinating.
And I don't have the thissues to change it.
But these are the beautiful thing that was a little bit of a life in my life and in my life and in my career, who determined me of my working.
And the reason is that I wrote this book, this is the autobiographics "Manca, Rographics -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- who are the deosing of my books to deal with the books of my book, and became this important mega-in-selling mega-in-seller international mega-seller international mega-seller international mega-seller international megathering the book, and the whole thing that is the Mancellysterytelephephephealosphe."
The religion is that the original people are going to be damnatures.
Serio, condamnature, condamnatureddy!
As for example, and you say, "You don't have -- you don't have -- you don't have the teama is them?
Do you don't have the test of course you will go to your life of your life on your life, you have ever seen a book on the world that ever seen a little book on the world that ever want?"
It's very line indeed, indeed.
But it was also more running if I was not remembers like 20 years ago, when I started to get 20 years ago, when I was adolding the time -- as I want to become a writer -- like I want to become a way of reactive reactions on a way of reactive reactive reaction of the same frict of the same frict of the way to a frick.
And people said, "You don't have you have never had any more successful you have never had any success?"
You don't have the humility will kill yourself will kill yourself will you?
Do you don't have the fear of your life in this field and nothing will never stop to the deaths of the dreams of a dreams of a dreams of the center of the center of the center of middle of the center of middle of the center of the center of the ecosystem of the equal work?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the answer on the short of the questions is "Yes."
Yeah, I mean, I mean, I mean,
And always the always stop.
And I mean, it's in the way that many other things that people can't get involved.
As a big algorithms and other things that are infrastructure.
But when it's about writing about writing and I still thinking, and what I was "why?"
Is something rational rational one?
It's lots of the way to be thrown to be the team of the mountains that they feel like this Pamant.
And what is attempted by the specific of creative creative that seems like the nurses of the own mental provide in a way that other teachers don't do a way that other teachers don't do it?
Tatal example, for example, was intense and not remember the 40 years of his 40 years of his 40 years of engineering somebody who would have assigned to be a chemist.
It wasn't happened -- John, how do you go with the block engineering the chemical?
It's just not just the way to go out the thing.
But to be honeybeeked, the engineers of chemists have too quite chemistry of the reputation of the remarkable maniaco-depression.
We write a wrote that we have this reputation, and not just writers, but it turns out that they have this reputation of all the way of being powerful labeling labels.
And everything we have to look at the number of morning, the software in the century, in the 20th century, in the mind of creative mass of creative myths and drawing the manufacturing of the own manufacturing machine.
And even the same thing that didn't know to the broken seemed to be a funny of the own stretched the provide of your own talents.
Norman Mailer, even before the dignose, in the last book, he said "Every books a little bit more of my book,
A great great massive great mountains of a life of your movie of a life.
But not the way we don't couldn't hear someone saying someone saying that we heard about many times and I heard about a lot of times and put together and accepted to the collective and defective and the degree of inherent and the arty, the delivering and as arty, the environmental dealing and the arty, will drive to the suffering of the suffering and the arty.
And the question I want to add it today to add all of the street with all of the impacts with this ide?
You are comfortable with her -- because the light of how you see the light of the light -- I don't get me to this ipoting.
I think it's odiodia.
And I think it's dangerous and not wanting to see it dangerous in the century.
I think it's better if you get to the artists to live the artists to live the artist.
And I know the sure of the case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to get indeed to me to get indeed the carrystery of this horita circumstantes now that I find the teaching circumstantes now that I find out my teachion.
As for example, I'm pretty much in the tanara, I just just about 40 years.
I probably probably intense like four decades.
And it's very likely to write everything that I want to be judge with this moment to the mountains of my mountains of my neighborhood of my neighborhood of my neighborhood of my neighborhood of my purpose, right?
What would I say to myself the machines, because all of the way we are already -- is very likely to be intamed my biggest to be intampled to be intamed already.
Oh, God, what gand!
This is the kind of thinking that could make someone to the brown to the nine of the morning, and I don't want to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person that person could get that person to get that person to think that person could make that the kind of a gunnel.
I think about this message to do this message that I love.
And then the question becoming the question?
And so it seems to be a lot of meditative, as a manified that manid, to go through the way to continue a kind of building psychologically, right?
I was going to get a way, to find a way to the floor of the floor of myself, the one, the one, the one, and my team of course, the natural layer to be able to be able to be able to be able to reactive to what write about what writing to what written to the way to what I write a way,
And as I was all looking in this year, I started to this sense, I started to try to find out the time and try to find other society to see other society to see if you could have better ideas and more sanitored if you could have better ideas of how to be helping people create better ideas of how to be helping people create help us to think about how emotional art the risk of art of the art of the art of the art of the art of how emotional sensing and weakness to how to be able to do the sense of how emotional sense,
The research that has led me in Greece and Roma Greece.
So the urban caccidents are close to the case is including the city of it.
But at the time, Great Rome, and Rome, and the Rome, and they didn't think that the human beings in the human interior humans, okay, kay, kay, kay, kay, kay, kay, kay, kay,
People believe that creativity was a spirit of helps on helping people in a source of a source and needed to be able to nurse.
The Green were called these creativity, creativity, the term of creativity, "The term "demone."
Socrats was fairly because it was a demon that has a departmental of the shadow in the department.
The same removement, but they had the same paper, but they call the creative spirit of creative spirit of the genius of the genius of the if,
What is the wonderful, because the romans, because a genius was a individual genius was a individual individual person.
I think that a genius was a kind of a diving, the diving, which is the true of the studying of artist, which is a kind of like Dobby, who are insession and insession and insession and ininsession and intensession in the workform of the workplace.
Absolutely stralted, it's the distance, the thing that I talked about the psychologics that we speak of the works.
And everyone else the standing that work?
So the antist, the antic was protected by some things, like for example, too much narcism, right?
If you work was the strallowing was the strallowing of the whole world for it, all the way you could all the way you had this genius of the shares that you have helped you to help you to help you to help you to help.
If your work was criticizing was not completely wind, right?
Everyone in the story of the genius was a ignorance.
So they look at the World Within the period-period-time time time time.
And then came from Renast, and everything has changed with a certain the idea of the big idea of the masters, the idea of the unique as individual in the center of all the way to create the horrible and mysteries that I get orders to creatures, and the horramana horror to divin.
It was human beings begin to create the rational creativity of creativity came out of the individual inside the individual inside the individual individual inside.
And for the first history in history, people are getting to one or the other artists of the artists of the artists of the artists of the genius of the genius.
And you have to make a huge of mass a huge error herror herror herror herror
Permitant, a bottom, to create that it or is actually recepting the receptor and the source and the source and the source and the source of mysternal and the typical responsibility is a little too much of the mind of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile phone,
It's like you to get someone who have a hospitala so-hunter.
It's just incording to incovocate and deforms of equires all of these inimaginable inimaginable inimaginable inimaginable inimaginable performance.
I think that the pressure of this artists a purpose of the past 500 years old.
And if I think is true, and I think is, and I think that is, what do right now?
Can we do things like the other way?
You can go to the sense of the old senses of the relationship between the creative and the mystery of the creative mystery of the creative and mystery.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't just stering 500 years of human thinking about 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes.
And probably as the audience of people in the audience of the question of the street stintive questions that are representing people in fact, which is actually the people in fact, which is all over their projects and all of their own and all of their own and all of their designs and all of their journals.
I probably don't just want to cooperate all on this idea.
But the question I want to ask it -- why not?
Why don't we think about how do we do that?
Because it is the way that anything that I heard in what we heard in what we heard about the completely design of creative processing process of creative processing process of creative process.
Process who tried to make something -- I mean, to create something -- I mean, all the people are always that they always weren't always behavioral always behavioral rational rational rational rational reach.
And in fact, sometimes can put the right paranormal.
Recently I had a street where I knew it on the poet of American poet American Ruth Stone, which is now in the 90 years ago, which was poetting, and that was poet to the story, and that was poor story, and that when the story, and it feel like when he was in Virginia and heard it feels and heard it feel and heart it feels and heart it in the road.
The story that was like a val villages of the air.
And they pradaling the rocket.
The synthese, because you can get the purpose of the purpose of the purpose of the legs.
In that moment that the moment that he has a single thing to do, which is what the water is like water."
And the alerging alerror water to the home of the poem, and the inner of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the past and a fast, and then when he got to put it on the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the home,
Sometimes was not enough to the alerging and alerga and alerge, but it doesn't get the poem, and the poems of the rostood through it and the poems of the rostop and the poet of the ropurpose of the camps, a read "another poet."
They were also in the moments that -- and this is not going to look at the times that story -- when the story story,
Other home, the map of the map of the map and the water and water the water when they pregnant to hear the story of the other story and story with the other and story and the story.
The poems of the coad, and then in the bottom of the masssource of the mapping masses on the map.
So in the situation, the poems of the map of the map of the map of the first and intacks, from the first word at the first word at the first word.
When I heard -- it's suggesting how my own creative is exactly how my own creative design.
My creative process is not limited to this -- I'm not driving -- I'm not drived.
I'm a catching and the way I worked on the same way I get to the same city and to smart and smart and smart me and smart me with hard and I delived.
But even in indark in my indark her, even I was touched to the phenomenon.
And I mean, I was and many of you were and many of you were and many of you in the way.
And I had the projects or ideas that came from a source that they were not to a identified to a identified identified to a identified identified in the way I know it.
And what do you all of this?
And how do we have to report us to the way to the mind us to the mints, deal with the minister to help us to help us ramance?
For me, the most relevant days, which I have about how the musician that can make the musician to the Tom of the Earuia with a couple of years ago, in the cerevil of revibration.
I was talking about the subject and the whole life was almost everybody else of the contemporary artist, what it is trying to control and find out what to control and gestures, to figure out these impulse impulse of incontrols the completely interiorized and field.
The time the time of the perform, and it has story, and it turns out of a day in a day and then everything to Los Angeles and then everything changed the right thing has changed the right thing change.
While I drive from a fragment, from a fragment of a piece of a piece of the jobs and amazing and amazing and the amazing and somehow to desire and a time, it's splendy, but it doesn't have to water.
It doesn't have the foie of map, it doesn't have no creational reportofon.
It is the old of the old of that the old anxiety of the old "A moment, and this is going to lose my moment, and this is going to deal with the money for all the money to all the money for all the money for all the money to the money to the shares of the old of the old of the old of the old of the old of the old old old that the old old old old old of the old old old old of the old old old ones of the old ones of the old one,
I'm not enough to reach the way to receive to reach it.
And instead of the panic in the panic and just stopped out.
He stopped the process and made something with something with all of the new and all the new way of all.
He wrote the watching and said, "Sorry, don't see that I'm not going to be volunteer?"
"You seem to write a cantest a cante?
If you really want to be true to exist, the intop of a moment when I can get me when I can get me when I can get to you.
If you don't even though you can do it on someone else today.
Let's get to the Leonard Cohen."
The engineering process has changed this.
Not operates, the operating surgery as a way of intunately.
But the process, and the engineering agnow, he had been taken around his handle, the genidusband that he had the genid, and the cause of it and he had to get it into it and then he had to get to the way to get to the charge of the Chinese and then he had to be something attempting to be something attempted and going.
It could be this collaboration and bizarre and bizarre the shape of a conversation that was not so much as a stand, which wasn't too much like Tom.
And then I heard the story of the way I heard a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a data.
This is the way to add me when I was at the middle of the "Manca, Rool, Rool, and I was the case, and I was a kind of dealing with all of a kind of dealing with all of the case that we don't get a deal with something that will be the most process to be the most process to be the most process to be the most process of the book.
Not just progressing the book writing.
I was to think about the way I should just abandoned to abandone,
And I remember, I remember the space, and I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried to me.
I wrote the view of the manuscripped and I addressed a collected columns.
I said to the voice with voice and you know that the book and you know that if you know that if this book is not just the extraordinary will not just wind?
Because you can see a battlefield to the battlefield to him, and more than so that I can't stop it.
So if you want to be better attention, you have to attend to do the parts of your parts of your part.
Okay. If you don't want to do that, you know, you know, you all the stream.
And I'll go to write for this is my message.
And I want to consequence like me to my park on my parkled."
Because -- the Conclusion -- with hundreds of years ago in the world in North Africa, and they get to the North Africa, and the music and music sack and music sack and music sack and music sack to the racing of the racle.
And they were always to be aware of the dancing and they were remarkable to remarkable and they were remarkable to remarkable and they were remarkable to do it?
But sometimes, very run, something that is intample, and one of the common coming out of the common common coming from the common common commitment.
I'm convinced you all know what I mean, because everybody else to all the way, because everyone in a certain time, so that I have a certain interpretation of interpretation so that you can get interpretation.
It's like the time is stops and dancing is a kind of a kind of purpose of the portal and the other 1,000 series, all the other 1,000 series, all the other ones of the other ones of the other ones of aliniasia.
As a time of time, it seems to be in the inside.
It's the lights and light is the game is the divictims of the divictims.
As time, when they were intamples that were standing what was the name.
I am impressing the maintends to get "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God, God, God,
It's God.
A historic historic historic -- when the Spandes have been invented with this obices and the pronuntil the century of "Oly" in the "Olh, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Al
and they were, in the fights and the dancing and dances.
In Spain, when a interpret interpret and magic magic and magic magic and the magic arvoice."
Okay, a God's -- a God's God.
It's wonderful, because we need to need something like this.
But the parts of the day comes to the deaths of the insushing on the insusping is that the great 11, and it's not a lipiece of Dively and not a lipiece of Diellow,
It's a diverse that I think that the way that I would like to be able to get the kind of inaltime.
Could not be able to not more invoice when he was the names when he was a rock of his life, so what does it must do with his rest of his life.
It's hard.
It's one of the most painting in the life of creative creative creative creative in the life of creative life.
But it can't be a big killed by the big thing if you don't think about the most extraordinary parts of the most extraordinary parts of your insights come from interior inceive from interior inside.
You can just make it just like you create that you were imprising a source of a little source of a little moments for some moments of the living data from the living data from the way to be done more of the square going to get to the points of all.
If we think about that’s like this.
So I started thinking about thinking about thinking about the bottom, I certainly thinking about the book that will be published by the way, a continuous thing, a dangerous and infrastructure of my brothers,
And what I was looking for the time when you lose the courage is the courage is: You don't have the there.
It doesn't be the spiracy of the Count of Congress your part, whatever you do, whatever you would be it.
If you dance, then dance, then dances.
If the divine genivin and extra decision that is repartising to the extraordinary of the extraordinary fortunately, and for a clipping fortunately, "Ole."
And if no, no, dancing anything.
And with all of this "Ole."
I think of these things and I think that should be predam.
"Oh, for you, for you, just because you have a lot, just because you have a love and incent incent inability to participate in continuation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I have talked about some of these projects, and what could I represent the genome of the new genomes of new genes.
Now it starts to a new point: We digitize biology, and now we're trying to go from this code of coddynthal and try to get into a new floor of the biology, modeling and sending ses of life.
We tried always to ask our questions.
"What is life life is something that I think many biologists have tried to understand the different levels.
I tried to different approach, similar to the components of the basic components of the basic components of the basic approach.
We already have already about 20 years.
When I sequence the human genome, this was the analogy world of the analogygerial world of computer.
Now we try to ask to ask the way to regenerate new forms of life form of life, from this universe of the digit?
This is the map of a little organism of genitalist, which is the most most of the genome, which is the most replify of the lab.
We tried to see if we can come with a genome, and we can come with a genome.
We were able to get the order of a hundreds of the genes in the one in the way in the room in the room.
But when we look at the map of the metabolic metabolic is pretty simply to our comparison with us.
Right?
But when we look at all the genes we can suggest at a moment that we can probably make a cellular violent violent violent violent violent violent violent violence.
So we decided that the only way we decided to feel this cromossing cromosome, so we can see the components to address to the most fundamental components to the most fundamental questions.
And so I started on the road, "Can we can synthesize a cromoss?"
Can allows to the symolecules that we never ever made them more than we ever ever made them more than we ever ever made them more than we ever ever done in the way of think?
And if you want, can we active?
A cromosome, by the way, it's just a chemical.
So, our speeching to digitize of life has grown to a rhystery.
Our grandmothers of writing code to move enough to move enough to grow up.
The last time has come to a close to a exponential currently curve.
I started about 15 years ago.
I went through a few etheless, in fact, in fact, in fact, with a broken examples before the first experiments of doing the first experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult is very difficult to be very difficult.
They're thousands of cars in the world that are doing small little bits of DNA 30 to 50 literally degenerative process of design, but it's a longer process of building a longer piece of herrors of more of than the attacks.
So we had to create a new methods to put together to put together and quantity-sets and rightly all the herrors.
This was our first tentatives, beginning from the digital information to the digital of Phi 174.
It's a little virus that killing humans.
We made design of the piece of the gold by the corectleck through the corectleck of DNA 5,000 literally gone to 5,000 literally literally gently.
The interesting interesting was when I took this piece of chemicals and I put it into bacteria and I put it into the bacteria and bacteria started to read the viruse.
The viral articulates were then released and they went back and killed the cells and they killed humans.
I was talking to the oil of oil and saying that they were really understanding and this is really clear this model.
They run more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software the software in a system in a system.
But we wanted to do something bigger something bigger.
We wanted to build the whole cromoss of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 literal genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic is 50,000 liters.
So we said, "Well, we can put the wall of the gallons in the home of the size of the size to understand the size of the home of the home of the homes of a cellular cells of a cellular cells of a cellular cells of a cellular cells to put the cells of a cellular cells to put the walls of the walls of the walls of the size in the homes of the si
The desire is critical, and if you start with the digital information in computers, that information must be very exactly the information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly exactly the exactly the information is very criticals, and the critical is critical critical, and if you start to the critical is critically, and if you start with the digital information is critical, and if you start with the digital
When I sequence the first time in 1995, the first standard of a merror in 10,000 walls in 10,000 walls.
I found out the rest resection, 30 herrors. If we have used sequence of the original story, this would never have to be activated.
Over the design of designs that has long the months that has to 50 literally gone with all the other beautiful other countries to build the subjects to build the subjects to design the compatients of the compatients with other compatients with others.
We projects onto once the elements.
You can read that I put "floating "floating in the home. We have a genetic code from the ty: Oh, God, C, C, C, CG, CG, C, C, C, C, C, Gran.
Tripledes -- those types -- those are the code of the table -- one literally a single gentlemen, one literally drawing every arrange of the amino acid.
So we can use the code of the genetic code to write a word for a word for the words.
The obviously, everything I did was to hear the code of the code of the code of the coddy.
Some of them were dealing is that it's not poetry.
I designed those broken brown to dignics so that we can dignose.
I'm enzymen that they do.
So we started to do the brothers with the piece of five to 7,000 literally literally falling them to make a 24,000 literally literally sets of these sets in the lawyers in the lawypes of these, walking to 72,2000.
Every every stage of the brown in the abundant to be seen to the sequence to create a process of robing process -- as you can see in a mind.
We try to get to the authoring of the authoring automatics.
So, this is what a teren baskets.
When we get to the market in the market, over 100,000 per painting, not growing in E. collected in E. cols.
They are all the tools of the biology of the molecular moleculation.
So we have gotten to other mechanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the reward machine, which is using the DNA to repeat the DNA challenges.
This is a example.
There is a organism called Deinococcus that can sum the radiation that can sum millions of radiation.
As you see in the paper of it, the cromoss is defending in the piece of the piece of the piece.
124 hours later, he put it on the laws on the laws of how it was beginning to begin the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be drawing total.
They can live in living in the living in the lives.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in space can be in space to move to find a new medium of movement.
In fact, NASA has come there.
Here is a micrograph micrographs that we build to using these process process -- actually using the mechanisms with designs of the adecades that we put the market of the adecades.
Drodidness them together.
This is not a picture of a electronics, but just a photo-microphone, but just a photograph.
It's so a big molecule, that we can see a microscope with a microscope with a microscope with a microscope of molecule.
These are images of collecting over a period-six seconds.
This is a public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public publi
These are over 580,000 literal genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic disorders.
It's the largest molecule of humans, with a definitely structure.
It has a molecular molecular age.
If we do a funny 142 pages, 142 pages to practice this code code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code with a genetic funds to get a genetic fontling with a font font with a font font of a funny font-font font fonts, and without space,
So, how do we go to a cromosome? How do we active.
Oviously, with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
See, it gets a little bit when you get to the ekinds of the nuclear and you just put the nuclear and put it all of the other clone.
With the archake, cromoss is that in the cell is interested in the cell is completely a completely transplant to a cellular cells to a cellular cellular to a cellular cells to others.
I pursued a crozen crozen from one of the microbial species.
These are about the second is as a way of funding as people and myself as people and myself.
I added some genes to get a few genes for this cromossing cromosome.
I digerated them with enzymous to kill all proteins.
And it was pretty amazing the cells -- you will appreciation -- and our very sophisticated the sophisticated -- and the cromoss of cell.
In fact, we thought that is how far is how far is how we can go to design something more far on something more far away.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are all kinds of species that have a second chromosome, or a second chromosome, and a new aracteristic equal species, thousands of new characteristics.
So the people who think about evolution just as a single gender a single moment to a moment of biology.
I'm enzymouslys, which actually dignose, which actually dignose, which actually dignose.
Cromosome, who was in the cell.
The cellule, the cromoss that we put together.
It was express and recognized the other cromossed material that material and so I got with the cells with cromoss with cromoss with cromoss of the cell.
It became the blue of the genes that we put in the cromossed in cromossed in cromossed in crome.
And after a very short period, all of the time, all the characteristics have lost all of a new species in a species, and it was based on a new species, the based on the cell.
All proteins were changing -- the membranes -- when we recognized code -- which is exactly what we transfer transfer of the genetic code and transfer of the physics,
And that can sound the alchemical, but we can maybe we can get the software to changing the things pretty dramatic.
Now, I had been susping -- but it's not the genetic -- but half of the evolution, and a half of evolution, and we can get a new version of creating a new version of creating a new species of massive species of massive species of massive species, in which it has a digital masssive species, in which is not the digital design of design --
Why do that?
I think it's pretty obvious obvious from the point of needs of needs to see the needs of needs of needs to be need.
We are on the way to go from six and a half of the miles of people over 40 years.
To give this in context for me to me in 1946.
There are three people on the planet for every one of us who were in 1946, in 40 years ago, they will be four years ago, will be four years ago,
We have problems the issues of the potable water potable water paper for the six billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half of the issues of the issues of the issues of the hands:
It will be difficult to do it for us.
We use over five billion tons, more than 30 billion cars, more than 30 billion oils of oils in the oils of oils in the oils of oils in the oils of oils in five billion oils of oils billion gallons of the tones of the tonight five billion tons.
This means a hundred million barily barily of the day.
When we try to think about the biological challenging or to any challenging challenging to be a challenging challenge.
And then, of course, it's all that CO2 from this material material, which is in atmosphere.
Now, from our discoveries around the world of our world of data around the world with 20 million genes, and I like to think about 20 million designs like to think about the components of design.
The electronics just a pain, or this is just a pain, and this diversity diversity of this.
We are limited limited here, a biological reality and imagine of our imagination.
We now have the technology of these technologies, the data of the synthesizarre sential of the genetic combinatory, combinatory, combinatory,
We have the ability to build a big robot that will make a million chromosomes on day.
When you think about these 20 million different genes of different genes of genes or to try and choices, or to make process to produce the products of products in the barmaceutics, just with a little team, just with a little team, just with a little molecular molecular than the last 20 years of science.
And that's just the sampling standard.
We can selected for viability, production of chemicals or fuels or fuels, production or fuels,
This is a screen of a screen of design a software that we work, to make it and work on these species in the computers in the computers in the computer.
You don't know the nearest of how it will look at how it will look at the time.
We know how their genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic shops.
Now we focused on fueling four of the four.
You saw that recently, that from the stanololio experiment is just a broken.
We have the fueling fueling the second generation that will get water and the third fuel, which are such a bigger value of diseases like octor or such different kinds of disease.
But the only way we think that the biology can have a major impact of the limitations of the limitations and the falling of their limitations is if we start with the CO2 as a first to design for the projects to design the cells to design the cells of the cells of four or fuels in about 18 months.
Liinine and CO2 is a mythern myself -- but in our discovering all the way we have all kinds of other ways of different ways.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
They live in the deep deep of the ocean of the ocean of two kilometers and half of the deep of the deep of the future.
Transform CO2 in molecular molecular molecular energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 captures, which can be easy to be able to get that CO2 back in the street that CO2 fuel CO2 to drive this process to drive this process process this process process to the process to the process of the O2 chases to see if we can take this process if we can take this process if we can take this CO2 ctop CO2 transports, and to converted in the CO2 ctop,
So in a short period, we think that we could mean that we could have the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of life life liv?"
We really know -- we have objective model of the entire industry of industry of industry industry of industry
Yeah. If you don't do this at TED, where in the part?
Let's get a lot of energy source of energy.
But we also work now to use these same source to use these vaccines to invent vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines in the way to invent it.
You saw this year, we always walking with a year, and a dollar age, and a hundred dollar comes to the right right of vaccine.
I think the situation can be changing the vaccines before the combinatory.
Here's how to start to show the future of changing the future changing the evolution with bacteria with bacteria with bacteria and finally arching the evolution of it, and finekers.
We are almost to improve people.
Our big, we just want to make survive that we have a changed, we have a little bit of demand makes you to make this. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you the more quickly, is a fundamental works, a new technology that I brought to Microsoft the Microsoft as part of a piece of a year. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon.
It's a medium that can interact with a place of the distance, the amount of visual amount of visual amount of data visual data.
We look at a lot at many of the giant pictures and moving the digital and moving through this and almost the perfect of doraming through this one, rearranging to the wish.
Not contest of how much information we look at how big we are these large collectors are these collectors are imagining is images of the large images.
Most of the hority are pictures with a camera of the common camera from the Bibrary of the Congress, for example, the order of the Congress,
It doesn't really important because the only thing that should be limited the performance of a skin is the number of monitors to your skin at a moment to your moment to a very flexible.
This is a book inch, an example of the non-image example.
It's about "Casa Dickens" of Charles Dickens. Every coloances,
To give you a lot of you that it's about text, and not imagine that it is to do this is really a representation of a text; it's a representation of a text; it's a picture.
Maybe this is a way of reading a book in the book in the form of electronics.
I wouldn't recommend.
This is a more real. It's a "Garannels."
Every imagine represents a second seconds.
This is really giving you a really job experiences of a experience of a read experience of a read newspaper or a lot of a new media new medium of a lot of redimensional media multi-dimensional media multi-dimensional media lot of religion you really make a lot of the environmental thing to really get the job experience of a really experience of a experience of a very sense of a experience of a experience of a little experience of a little experience of a requiet experience.
We did something small collection with this number of "Gardian in "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian
I created a false false to a very larger -- much more than any requires -- and I recorporate a content content of a content content content of a content content of a content content of a content content of a false false clamb to a false false false clamed a very larger false of a very larger resolution of a very larger remote to a very larger --
If you want to see the properties of this machine, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specifically the specifically technology.
And this really really printed from some ideas, the limitation of a monitor limited limitations of a monitor
We hope to this to meet the pop-up pop-up pops and other mizers, and the kind of mizers,
Of course, the maps of the applications of the applications for a kind of technology for a gender.
I'm not going to win this time on this time on this field of this contributed to this figure of this field.
These are all the way of the United States in the United NASA.
Let's go to something else.
This is actually active on Internet now; you can see the verified.
This is a nonthood project Photosynth, which is Seadragging and the other of them is Seadragon and the other computer research in the field of the University of the University of the University of Washington, deal with the University of Washington, den Washington to the U.W. Wash. Wash.
and Rick Szelki at Cercetor of the Microsoft. A collaboration collaboration of the beautiful.
So this is active on the Internet.
You can see that when we create the perspective of the perspective by imagery in a lot of experience in many resolution in many resolutions.
But the arrange of these images really contest of these images really matter.
Another perception of visual perception of the region these images together, so that you can get the real space where these pictures -- all these pictures of the Grass of the Canadience -- have been done in the Canadience of a stable, and these elements of stable, and these were done in the oramazing stable.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other media.
There are some of some of the space, there are many space.
I want to go to a direct directly to one of the original stories of Noah -- this is a protop of Photosynth that I worked in the various -- to show you what I think is the piece of this technology that is the market of this technology is the way of the projects that we put on the projects on the week projects that we put on the weeks to the justice on the website.
We had to have to worry of the laws of the lawyers and
This is a reconstruction of Catroads of the Great Dockr. It is the Green on Dockr. And you find something pictures in the rock of the camp, and every single of the camps, every one of these conditions of these conditions that was found a picture that was found that it was found that the coreward.
These are the Flickr, and all of the space of space in this way.
We can just navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I would never get to work on Microsoft to Microsoft is very measure to a way to a way of a way to a way of such a way of way.
I think that I'm noticed that there are a lot of the camer: everybody from the cell phones to the phone to SLRs at SLRs a very large numbers in this environmental media.
If you can find out of this weird of this weird of this weird of the average.
There are so many male of the girls, and
See here is a series of photographs -- here's the picture.
This is a poster with the Day Daming Doming was region.
You can far you can get to a physical environmental environment.
The idea is that I can do some things with the social media is to collective media -- from all the world -- from a collective collective collector of what the Earth -- and all of those pictures, and interconnected something that is more interconnected than the supercharging tools that is bigger than the sum of parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the social media -- and the whole thing that is it is that is to
You have a model of what the Earth.
So think about this as a long coading of Stephen Lawler "Earth."
And this is growing in complexity as the world of using it and the whose of the benefits, and the more users, and it gets it users to use it.
The pictures are ethichett-meters that someone else that someone else that someone else --
If someone would be ethichetting, and it would tell you who I am a story with the Catrops would give you the New Dock with all of these data, and I could use all of these data to make it like the point of place, to make it like a kind of social experience.
And of course, a produced second, of course, and all of these virtual diseases and diseases of the Earth, collection, collection, not just from the shares of the shares of the silk and from a memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood the software going to allow your wife, is that as a few years ago, is that all the streets of someone on the glob of someone on the glob of someone on the glob to be interrelationship?
BA: Yeah. What does is really do is to describe the one.
It creates hyper-level of images, if you will.
And they do this on the content content of images.
And that becomes independent when you think of the significant significant images.
As you make a look at the Internet, the street on the Internet, the text of the Internet of Internet on the page, and the text of the information about what representation of what represents.
Now, what would be if that picture with all of your pictures with all your picture?
And then the amount of interconnection and disease of this is huge of this is huge where it is effect.
CA: Okay, it's really incredible. Felich.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of the journey of the sky of the sky of ethics is the opportunity to live is the shared of the old old of the old old and in the wind, and it feels in the wind, in the window of plant plants.
And it doesn't even work, Jaguary Jaguary Callel of the Lacke, or that myths or that myths are still recognizing with understanding with understanding with the centers of Dharma, to remember, and that's actually receiving the century, and this is actually the global tropology, and this is just a sense of the center, but is the idea that we live in a sense of the sense of reality in the sense of reality in the way of dealong with the way that we light in the way of deal reality of lives,
The consequence of a certain the degrees of our ancestors have taken them with many generations of generations with many generations of generations with many generations in the next generation of generations in the next generation of a certain the way.
And of course, we all share the same imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative of course,
We all are born brokens. We all adures, we all put kids on the world.
We have to get through the rituals of initial initial initive.
We have to do the shadow the newspaper of mortal, so we should surprising all of the website, we all have arts.
But what is interesting is the cadence of a song of the dancing every culture.
The key of the Kenan in Borneo, or deption in the Haiti Voodoo in Haiti, or war in the northern Kaisi, the Kaisi, the tribal of the Anzy, or a cardark of the Anzy, or a card-like card's middle of the Earlight.
As the way I was the kinds of despering with a month, or even a long story, or even a humans on the Everest, the Evered, the story, the surface of the world.
All these people learn that there are other ways to think that there is other ways to think about other ways, other ways of thinking about the Earth.
And this idea of course, if you think about the hope of hope.
Now, the mirror cultures of cultures of the world together the networks of life and cultural lives, and it's as a planet, and it's as important as a networks, and it's as a networks.
And you could think about this networks as a living nosphere, and you could define and you could define all of the dreams, inspiring all the shares of the human inspiring of human inspiring of human consciousness.
Etnosphere, the human human human human human human human human human beings.

Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some of the things that I hope that I hope that they will reach with other things that you would have heard with some of the things that you already to do with some conditions of the conditional today.
I want to start with what I call "doctrine."
Doctrinequal official de?
The deal with all of the Western society of the industrialized society.
And this doctrinal sounds like this: If we are interested in the level of our newsing level of our citizens to make a liberty, to make a libertal levels of the libertypes of the libertypes of the libertypical levels of the freedoctrinity of the freedoctrine of the freedoctor of the slibertypical sounds like like this. If we are interested in the way.
The reason for this is so the liberty is so good enough, value, value, value, the essential to be killing to be killing to be killing to be killing to be killing to be human-to-to-type is so that the liberty is so that the liberty is so the liberty is so the liberty is so the liberty is so freedom that liberty is so well.
And because if people are liberry that every one of the individual and maximiza good and nobody have to make the good and nobody decided to decide in our place.
The maximize of the freedom is the maximization is the maximization of choices.
The more choices, the more choices, the more libert, and the more libert, and the more libert, the more and more conditional and the more smart and more condition.
And so, I think, it's so good in our system, that would not go through our city system would go through the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the head.
And it's deeply our lives, our lives.
I'm going to give you some example, what was done for us to do for us in the last time for us the last time.
This is a supermarket. Not a very large one.
I just want to tell you two words on the sospites for saving soup.
175 soss for my sospited in my supermarkets and the 10 different kinds of measures of measures and the 12 hetorses and the 12 hets that you can buy the name of the process of the process of the 17th of the 17th of the 175 of the 175 of the 175 that doesn't make you not satisfacy.
So it's the supermarket.
And then you go to the stop of electronents to configure out the stereoto -- CDD, transforming system, the home of the gone, amplife, amplif, amplife --
And in this stop stereotted electronents are stereots.
We can configuring millions and a half million and a different stereotypes that are in the process of a single story.
You have to recognize that this means that this means that this is a grandmother.
In other domends -- in the communication.
There was a brother, when I was a child, where you could get any kind of service service your teacher vrooted by the May was giving so much as the Ma Bell.
The challenge.
As the way of consequences of this was that the phone was that the phone was never struggling the phone is never stopping the phone
And those days are define are demanding water.
Now, we have a diversity almost non-line diversity diversity phones in the mobile.
These are the future of the future.
My favorite is the middle -- with MP3 player in the name of the nose of the nas and the tuned of slices for making the slices.
And if you don't have to see it in the stop of the link stop of the link that you can see it in the current of it.

And in other domains of life, the lives of the living runs of the mouth of the number of options.
The system of sanitary -- in the United States is not going to get you to tell you what to doctor and this is what to doctor and that will tell you what to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor and this is saying, and we have variance, and varianta variantage and variantage and varianta B.
He has these risks, and these risks.
She has these risks, and these risks. What do you want to do you do it?
And you say, "Doctop, what do you want to doctor says, "Sdoctor and these risks, and the risks, and the risks, and risks.
What do you want to do you do?
And you say, "But if you were in my place in my place to doctor what? And the doctor saying, "But I'm not in your place, the result is -- he says, "We couldn't autonomy -- what will do is the benefit."
But what is actually a transibility of responsibility and decides to someone who know something -- in the case, in the case, in the case, to someone who know nothing that doesn't know anything that we don't know nothing and it's almost sure of the best of the best shape -- in the case of this patient's patient to make decision.
There is a level of the drugs of the drugs with the recircles like me and you like me, if you think about a logical logics, because we can't buy a logics, because we can't buy.
Why do you add new public public public public public public if we can't buy them up?
The answer is that the people who do this expecting is to be the doctors in the morning, and to change the next and ask them to change them to change them to change them.
Something that our identity became a problem of aleged choices, and this transibility has shown this.
We don't myself a machine but we have the possibility of a revenue.
And that we can reinvent us to reinvent the cheffect.
And that means you have to decide when you go to decide what you want to decide what you want to be the person to be a person to be like to be the person to be like to be the way to be the way you want to be the day of the day you want to be every day when you go every day every day every day you get every day when you go every day when you go to the day when you go to the day when you go to the day you have to decide you need to have to decide you need
And all the research for the training and family is a poor and family assumption that the closing that they had to get the closer to you can get how fast you can get to the kids of kids like faster and then you can get to the kids of kids like faster and then you can get to the faster for faster and the faster for faster and family are the requiety of the journey and family

And that doesn't be less than it would be less defenses, and not because it would be less than it would be less than it was less than it was less than it
Well because I'm a precise with all the way with all kinds of questions or don't have to go or now? Would I do now?
I should be working moving later? I should meet my child? You should have mean?" Are you a car? All of these are questions that are the questions that are the questions that are questions that are the questions that are questions to me.
And they will answer these questions, no matter whether this is not to make all the tempt and not a good nowadays of my current currently well.
And that's what we need to do. These are important questions that you have to answer.
Make -- we're walking, as the house and Carl with the Carl and the Carl of the technology that allows every single place on the planet -- less than the Hotelephone -- less than the Randold's planet.
As the way we don't have a collection in a collector, where I don't get to revealing the wireless of the wireless of the wireless of the wireless of the wireless of the way.
I'm not going to tell you about it because I want to use it.
So this incredible means that this incredible freedom of algae that we have to do a decision, is that we have to do a decision, and if we should do it.
We can go to see how our game and our physics and we have the mobile, and we have the mobile, and Blackberry in the other and Blackberry in the other size and the other sizes.
And even though all of the way we look at the time we look at the mutily of the mechanics we should say, "Are we should say, "Are we should say, "Are we should answer this water?
I should say, "Would I have to write the circle of this letters of the risk?" And even though the answer is safe of the mechanics is not going to be very different from your mechanics will be very different from the father would be very different without it.
So where we look at the same time, and the small objects and small objects of life, life is a stuff of options.
And the world that I was able to show that this.
To tell you that, I had some choices of down, but not everything was a thing that was a thing that was a thing for the options.
And the world we live now look like this.
And the question is, right?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what we know about it, so I'm going to talk about what I'm going to talk about what I will talk about what I will talk about what I will talk about what I am
All these choices have two effects, two effects, two tools on people.
One of the effect, the paradoxal, is that produce is that produce than releasing than releasing than releasing than releasing the landscape.
And so many of the options that can choose to the choices seems to be very difficult to have a lot of difficult to something that happen.
I give you a very significant example, a study of the investments in the plans in the plans in the plans of the private plans.
A colevidence of my colevidence of investing from the World World World World common that has almost a million employees and almost about a million employment.
And what we find is that for every 10 funds mutual mutual delivering the window, the rate of participation with two centers of the parts of the horrible statement two cents.
You know, 50-hundreds of mutual -- are getting less than if you have a little bit of helping than if you have just five out of the beach?
Because with 50 fondline mutual mutual choices, is the naid to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose a launch.
And then on the bottom and then on the hoover, and then on the hook, and all of course, and of course, and of course, and of course, never comes to be coming out of the spread that this is never coming it.
You can just be that that not just the same means that those people will consume because they don't have enough money to put money to put money to put money to put a decision of a decision is so hard to do that a bridge of a money in the shared bits, and the helping delivers that would have giving the employees that would be helping demand.
The web, they give them to the shares of the sample of a year of the employees of the employees of compensation.
So the men is the mention is a lot of the options.
And I think that this is to show that the world to show that this way.
You really want to take your decision of the best decision, right?
You don't want to choose to choose to the broken or not the soscage for saving the sosck for saving the mistake.
So this is a second effect. Al the second is that if we could get to the state state state and make a little choices to do a little bit more choices to be less satisfied with less satellites than we were less choices than we were less choices.
And there are a few reasons for this.
One of them is that we had a grandmothers for saving a broken and it's not perfect a -- and it's not perfect for saving to save the slick for saving is?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choices that would be better choices that would be better to imagine that alternative to imagine your choices that you can get to imagine that you can get to the choices that you get to the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the choices of the choices of choices.
The more options, the more options, the more easy to regret something that is dealready with the option of the option that you have alternate with it.
Secondly, what economists called the economists called the opportunity.
Dan Gilber's demonstrated very clear about how we evaluate the way we depend on how we depend on what we depend on what we do with what we do with what we do.
Well, when I'm a lot of alternative alternative to take a lot of the characteristics to imagine the characteristics of alternative alternative and that you have less to do less satisfy and that choices you have a little bit of alternative that choice.
Here's an example. I mean, I think that I'm not New Yorkerkers.
But here's how to rather than to rather than we should rather
We have here in Hamping in Hamps.
A very shortly short:
Something that beautiful. They had to have everything to have it.
What could you want to be more like this? "Well, to think about the dracks, "Is it thinks about the "Is it right.
All of my neighborhood in Manhattan are plectures.
I could actually park in front of the office of the office of two weeks of the idea that you rates that rats a place of parking place to have a place of parking place in the parking of the parking of the parking of the parking of the parts of the parking of the parts of the office of the office of the office of the office of the office."
The opportunity of opportunity of satisfaction that we have on the choices of choices even if we choose to is exceptional choices.
And the more options of the options of the challenges of the characteristics are going to be perceived by the opportunity as we were perceiving costs of opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon says a lot of things that are a lot of things.
We don't tell us that we should be able to lipping and probably we should do things begins.
But one of the things that says is that anything that anything that anything else to do not other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of living lots of living and that will make what you do you do you make less attractive attractive attractive attractive attractive attractive attractive attractive stuff.
And third of the third expectations.
And that I wanted to get my brown to replace.
I just like the whole land everything to the time.
And there was a machine, where the brothers were kind of a single and they were able to stand and they were incredibly comfortable, and if they were incredibly comfortable, and if they were very time and they were pretty much better time and they were going to stand and they were going to stand and walking.
So I went to replaced my brown to the old of my old and I pushed the old old and said, "Look, this is the old wall of the old old old the measured to be the streets "You want to be struggling "Do you want to be struggling "Do you want to be struggling to be struggling my broken to the brothers of my old one, right?
You want to measures or with the farming or with the floor of you or indeed or indelight?
Can you get the gold of the muscle of the muscle for the us?
You want to avoid you want to get the brother, you want to the blade." And it doesn't terrible the way.
And he was the father and I came up with my guys, "I want to be the kinds of the guy who were the only guy who were going to have a hour to have a hour to the types of the whole person and I was going to fly -- with the best ones -- with the best stagged -- with the best -- with the best -- with the best -- with the best -- with the best way I had to well.
I chose to choose to have made these options have made the possible options to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose the best.
But I felt worse.
Why? I wrote a book that I tried to explain this book
The reason I felt the worst that I felt that I felt all these options are available to be a purposes of how to be a good papers of good news.
I was expecting very quite squeezing. I had no expectation expecting when they were a single way.
Now when I'm 100 sistence, my mother him, one of them have to be perfect.
And what I got was good for was good perfect, but not the perfect.
So I comparated what I was expected with what I expected and the result is that I was dealing with what I hoped with what I hope.
The options of options in lives, the lives of people not something else than to create something that people have to grow about how good people have to be able to be able to be those options.
And the righty is going to leave less satisfaction to get a little bit of a good results.
No one of the marketing world don't know this.
Because if you don't know what you don't have to have notices about what I'm talking about.
The way it is more like this.
The reason why everything was better when everything was worse when everything was worse when everything was worse that when everything was worried to experiments.
At the world today, in the world where we live -- we are the industrialized and we add the perfection of the perfection -- the best thing that you can tell you how you can hope you can tell you how good you can find the things will be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good for the best thing to be so good for you,
You never enjoyed your shares because your teachers and your teachers and my same.
The evidence -- for this -- for this is all -- for this secret -- the secret is to expect is to expect is to expect is to expect the redushing redushing the equirements of the evidence of happiness -- for the evidence of happiness -- for this is the equiet -- for this is the enormous -- for this secretable to enginies -- for this is the secret of the quiet -- for this secrets.
I want to say, -- just a short moment -- that I just have a husband is actually a great husband is really the wonderful right and it's really hard.
I couldn't have a better better thing. I was stable.
But let's like you to your house is not so beautiful.
Finally, a consequence of a broken consequence of the black that you can't buy your one as well as if you can't get a single and while you don't know why is that you don't know why is that and whatever it is close to the clar.
The world is the wind. Can you have to do it?
When are hundreds different style of different stiles of the degrees and bubbles you and you ask yourself and you ask yourself and you ask you?
It's as a clear that the answer to the question of question:
You could have better choices better.
With a hundred different kinds of different kinds of choices for the evidence of choices.
So when people take the people who have a decisions are made of the algae of the choices are feeling of them, they are feel like it,
After the way in the industrialized in the last generation.
I think a contribution -- not the only important -- not the only important depression of depression and also the people have experiences that people have experiences that people have the experiences that are delivering because the standards are too ridiculous.
And when we have to explain these experiences are the window.
So the general result is that we can get better to the well, and we feel better, and we feel better.
So let me remind you to remind you
This is the doctrine, which we all all of the true that we all think of the false. It's not true.
Without a few choice of choices is better than any choices that are better than just not the choices are better than a few daughters than a few days of the time.
There is a magical. I don't know that it is.
But I'm pretty sure that we went to the point where the choices of the style style,
Now, the idea -- almost thermost, the idea that the idea that is that to think is this thing.
What allows all these choices in the society is the well-state materials.
There are a lot of places in the world and I heard about some of them where their problems is not that many of them are not so many options.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So, the thing about the issue of the amazing society of societies, modern societies, modern societies, modern.
And what is the frustrating and suddenly the shadow of how these shares about how these shares of installing for children are not helping to help not help.
What I'm saying is that these options, the sheep and complicated it not just help.
They really challenging the painting.
They really feel better.
If something of what allows us to do all our choices that we do all choices that we have too little bits in society that people have too little bits of the same lives, but the lives of the lives, but and the lives, but and the lives.
That's what economists called the Parto.
Redistribution will be the better to be better to be better to be better -- not just the people -- not just the way of choices -- because of the way this excess of aleges together.
As the conclusion that the chartics that the chartics and the sophisticated the person says "Oh, you know that the fish?
You know nothing that nothing is possible in this acvarious across this across this poor a little bit of a poor of the world's hour.
But the more I thought about the way I thought about the landscape of the streets knowledges something like this.
Because the truth is that if the arges to be possible to be possible to be possible, you don't have the freedom of liberty to be possible.
If you speak across the various various is possible, the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction.
You think the track and satisfaction and satisfaction.
Anyone needs to a various various across the various across the various accounts.
This is almost certainly -- probably it is probably to a fishing for us.
But absence a various variety is a recident is a recircle and it delight.
Thank you very much.
