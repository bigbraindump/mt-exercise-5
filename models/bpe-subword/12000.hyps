In the English, it's a research for this is to this for this way.
Does have been received it.
But when it turns out to the paper and smart with the same.
In the environmental was a 4-year-old shape in Shan Shan Sudddle Shan Suddw.
This is the shape of the slightly on the slightly
And the reason why you can read it.
In the world of the global standard is a shape of the connection.
And the research of the world have been built with a global house and the extraordinary and the extraordinary and the extraordinary and the research and the research of the connection.
For four years ago, the last 30 years ago of the 250.

So this is our own story is to be a great beautiful for the shape of the connections that we can reach to the bad and research and we really really really really really really excity.
The person is the best of the best broken is not the bar.
We think we can think about -- and the paper and the paper.
So as you don't have to be the power for the projects.
Let's go to our home.
Goo: The good is the good newspaper is a photograph.
So as we can read a story of the story of the future of the best paper to the benefit of the benefit of the benefy.
He's researcher: I was a beautiful.
But this is the biggest technology is the best of the benefy.
And as the beautiful of the best of the world's population of the world's population of the world's biggest in this new new new that you see here that we can see here that there is a new way of change.
The only one is to reduce the technology is the best technology is the best of the benefit of the benef.
The Good is the shape of the situation of the power of the universe of the economic of the problems.
Doo: North Americ: The economy is the economy of the economy of the history of the landscape.
The reason that the story that we are in all the way to reach the balance of the bones of the bones of the bones of the bone.
But now we have a new new new new of the slide for the pursue of the shape of the same.
Right? The economic with the economic economic economic growth to the best second to the right of the hands.
A couple of the first of the first time to do and recognize the world's population of the world.
In the shape is a very important thing that is to help us to help us to help us to help us to help the problem.
Right? As the world.

If you want to go to the street the best paper peak."
We need to go to to the streets.
Thank you very much.
The first thing I wanted to do with HI.
And I have to reach to the story of a shape of the shape of the shape of this is this kind of a shape of it.
So at the end of the house that they were not here for the most important thing that was the most important thing that was the first time that was the first time -- the Count of the Sikind-Siky is a few years.
It's the extraordinary research of it.
This is the shape of Genen.
We have the paper of the Middle Big Big in the conditions.
I am just a little bit of this is called EETTTTTTTV -- Let's Have South French 2, a couple of the SAASAAASAAASAASAASAs the HIV to the HIV with the HIV for the HIV to the HIV to read the rest of the human.
First of all, I was the painted to the first paper for the first time
And this is the image was the ETTTTTTTTTSA.
He says, a chase of the room was a house of the shape of it.
It's a image of the first of the world that the way to the shape of the shape of the world's in Hiddle Like HIV in the Hipt of the house of the cells of the shape of the cells.
In other words, when I was in that I was in the next 10 to the four hospital standard that is a very simple of the complex of the complex of the complex of the complex of the complex of the very very very simple well.
I don't don't know that if this is the most most of the most of the most of the balance of Google and Google and the first of the first time of the first time of the first time of the first of the first time.
And that I thought I was a shape of the shape of the slide of the shape of the situation.
After a research of the paper to be a problem with the problem, which was actually a question that they had to do these --
These are the shape of the 100 days of the slide of the shape of the cells.
Now, the intense of the South and the best and "I don't know the best and read the best research of the hands.
But we can do this for the slide in the slide of what the slide is the shape of the connection.
So as a 250-year-old story of the best way of the best way to the best and the best and the slightly the slightly and the shape that can be the slightly and the shape that you can get the slightly the source of the way to the slightly and so on.
In one of the city of the 1990s in Like, was a shape of a shape of the fascinating patients.
So the story of the story of the 12 hours of 100 percent of the brain have the electronic of the social economy.
This was the same thing was the same thing.
This is more excited when you a story of the shape of the next 15 to the second to be 30 percent of the future of 30 percent of it.
So we have a research of research of research for 20 percent of the situation.
We had to go to the story of the story of what I do with it.
I received the same thing I remember the research
And now we get to read the rest of the shape of the
The next to the story of the car of HIV for HIV for us to be in the way.
We can go to the new way to get to go to to the street or to reach or to reach to the street that are going to be able to reach the universe that are the universe that are the universe that are the universe of the universe that are the universe of the universe that are the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe that the world.
Now, the idea that the condition of a sexual research for the most important to reach and the insects of the best and the expects of the exception.
I think that the way to the situation is that we have the same thing that we have the most important thing that we have a very important thing that we have been a very important thing that I have been a experiment.
I want to ask the story of a story of a British Harvary, I think this is the Dikay, I think of the first time of the first time of the first time of the first time of the Michator the Michator the Middle East, and the beauty of our lights are not going to be the bad that we have a bad that we are not going to the best way to the bad of our hands, and the chasn't going to be the bad for the except of the bathern in the bad that the beautissues that are not going to be the same same way.
Thank you.
I would like to go to the story of the best to the kid to the kids of children with the botttom.
And as you remember that you can go to the standard and you want to go to the best photographs like to go and research how to reach the problem.
The research is the power of the things that we are a great part of the world in the world in the world.
So I think that we read the TV is the Internet of our insects with our insects -- one of our connections with the Paul May Kenny and Johnny Kayan May Kenda, and I could be a bathroad, and I could make a rule that we could make a research of the house that we could reach a purpose.
Hander, how do we want to do that?
The first question was the fascinated by the shape of the Sippt Sify Sift Sify building.
For a Sixx, a nuclear of the interaction of a silkey to a silkey of a balloon.
They can be read for the research of the projects can be a silk of the cells, and they have a beautiful and a role in a shape of the situation.
The most important thing that are the balloon, as a beautiful st, you can just go to the paint of the landscape.
And Sithern the image of a new new new research of the shape of the shape of the shape of the situation.
And the research of these research connection, more intension, the consumption of the balance of the balance of the silick of the content of our patients and research the connections and we can explain the conditions.
You can see the situation of the exception.
This is the Sift is the condition to the future of the farmer, and if you reach the past of the language, the farmers of the balloon of the farmers of the silick.
These are connected to the conditions.
So, if you were a little bit of a little bit of a very interesting thing.
If you are connected to that, and they can be able to be able to be connected to connection.
We can also be the insects and the including and the including
We had one of the way to be interesting the more interesting of the connections is to use the stories of the slightly will, as we could use a bunch of a bunch of a paper to a paper to a paper.
In this case, we have three days of the Sift and the balloon and to use the standard and the cells of the cells of the botttom.
If we go back to the shape of the same.
There's the way to think of the interesting for the technology for the language, and the farmers and recognize that we want to get to the things that we can see the connection of the things that we can see the situations.
So here is a little bit about Fixic Fixide a little bit of a new new new new new new new new research of a new new new way.
Here's a games of the shape of the South Sholio and British and Boston British and Bost.
The first time that every single of a couple of the Sipper Sifer Steve the shape of the source of the story of the story of a bunch of a story with a story of a story of a bunch of the story of the street.
And then I remember 3D is about the second story of the story of the story and a new way to do the connection and we have a connection.
Thank you.
These are the balance that they were connected to Ladian Mragricultures and I remember the landscape and I read a new way to the top of the landscape.
He was going to be the good news.
And one of the interesting of this interesting is that it is to get to the people to do not just to get a lot of the brain to the brain to the brain.
All of what you need to remember the story of what you want to do.
Here's the other people who are going to be the people of the people of the people of it.
This is the most important thing to our cells in our cell.
It has been doing the way to do it was just to do a Sixxform in the cells of the other of the other of the other people.
So for the best was just the bad of it.
This is a new new animal is the animal connection.
We want to build a beautiful of the best way of the blood of the balloon.
And this is Fixx.
He can reduce the story of the story of Sif, just as well-silk silk silks.
Here's the opportunity.
Good Shas:
David Mor: I remember a shape of a silk of a bunch of the game.
Doo: To be the slightly
Good of course.
My nature's paper and the paper to one of the connections can do with the connections -- Ham.
D: So I created the projects.
Doo: He's Go!
D: It's a story with the story of the story of how to go to the beautiful of the babies.
Good God, Good wish.
D: The U.S. And I have a little bit of the beautiful and research the best and the research that we built the Sikindness that we built the babies that have been building the babies of the balloons.
Every one of this is a four different shapes of different shapes that you want to use it.
And you can reduce the benefit that you can get a very simple of the silk of the paper to the botttom.
Our governments are going to be the Sikinds of Sixximate a complex of the complex of the complex of the complex of the rest of it.
There's the situation that you can get the story of the farm of the patients and the language.
This is what you call a couple of a bunch of the beginning.
The only way the research of the consumption that the story of the future of the future of Health of Health of Health of House
Dono: Don't be in Stephen in Siky Sipping in Sikinds of a very simple parents, a lot of the best research of a lot of money.
Now a few days of the painting.
Doo: Yeah, I love the best person of the best period.
Doo: And I am I I like to go to the photography to the shape of the shape of the source of the shape of the shape of the hands.
Doo: Yeah, I can reach the future of the future of a couple or in a couple or other or or other or or other than anyone in a different way.
Doo: I want to go to the farmer, I want to get more excity.
Doo: Yeah, I can do it in the next time to do the right thing that I do.
So we don't need to do the future of the research or the paper or purban history in the book.
Now, in the best performance can be the farm of Sifer Sippt Sifer Sift the future of the connection.
Thank you.
And as my father is the story is the interaction of the international of the brain that we are going to be the brain and the brain and the brain and the brain.
And so we had to show you a little bit of this research of this project to the design of the connections that we have to go to the situations.
The story that we call it is that we are in this patients with this new landers to this research with the connection of the shape that they will recognize the world, which will be able to our light in our lives.
Thank you very much.
As the shape with me to go to you it.
They're not going to be there.
He said, "You're going to show you a lot of an innovation of the projects.
It's my father and my father and the fascinating a paper of a paper.
And I don't know this is that this is the right thing to do is the right thing.
But this is the best way that I remember the street and the paper and the paper and my father was my father and I was a very sentence of the connection.
And the thing I wanted to be this is that this is the beautiful of the Manhator the Manhator the Manhator the Manhator to the benefit of the world's research of the world, and the most important thing that the world is a very important thing that the most important thing that the traditional of the extract of the power to the stop of the most important thing that the interact.
The best thing is that the people who are going to go to the connected-up connected as well.
Servillage, the concercertain:
As you get to the standard and I say that you don't know that you don't know that you don't have to be a little bit of the best way you can't set the story of the story of the shape?
You don't know that you don't want to go to the pages of the landscape of the best way to reach the book that the world that the world that the world to this world?
It's very hard to be the right thing.
But it was more if I didn't know if you don't have to go to the next 20 years ago, I have a few years ago, I would like to the best -- I would like to be the same -- I would like to be the same thing, I would have been doing the same thing, I would have a little bit of the same way I was a little bit of the same way that I could actually be a kind of a kind of bad of the same way to the same thing.
And people who said, "Well, you don't know that they have no one of the way to be the same thing?
Do you don't like the shape of the idea of ideas?
You don't know that you don't know that the line of the pages and I hope to go to the story of the story of the car and a couple of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the balance of the story of the history of the city of the history of the painting?
Why one of the brain
The first -- the story -- the story of the things that is the same thing.
Yeah, you know, you know, the things that are all of the things of all of the things of it.
And they read it.
And you know, it's a little bit like many people who are not going to be the other people who can't do it.
As a example of the balance of the connection.
But when it's about the thing I think I I think I was talking about the last time I was in the last few questions?
Is this this is something that you do?
It's like the weapons to be able to be the way to be able to be able to do it that they were very well to do this in the Pananalyze.
And what is the most important thing that we create the connections that is really the slide is really hard to the project of the shape that you don't have a kind of like a kind of like a kind of like a kind of like a kind of like a kind of like a kind of like a kind of way to do you do with the other people who are going to do with the other people who are going to do it in other word?
My name, for example, for example, and you don't really go to the 25 years ago, the first time you walk of the shape of the story of the question, which is not a couple of question,
It didn't remember -- John, Johnny Socide the best of the best of the history.
I don't know that it doesn't get the street it.
But we can reach the story of the balance of the balance of the farm of the future of the balance of the hospital source of the hospital.
We have the stories that we have this requipment to the story of all the way to do that they have the best way that they have to be the best way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the result of the result.
And what we have to do is to go to the story of the story of the street in the 20th centuries of the cells that have a bunch of the slightly and reduce the city that they have the story of the slide and the rest of the house of the rest of the history.
And even though they didn't have to be the way to be able to be able to be able to be the rest of the projects.
Northern Mayl, and the last year, and he said, "Midd," which is a lot of the best painting."
A couple of the shape of the world.
But it doesn't have a beautiful st, and that we have this kind of a lot of things that we would like to be so much more and more and more and more and more and more intended to be able to reach the idea that the idea of the idea of the idea of the context of the conditional connection to the context of the condition to the connection to the content to the conditions.
And the question I want to reach the story of the story of the patients, you know, you know, you know,
You can be the connected with the story of the story of the story of the story -- I don't have a story with this story --
I think it's a beautiful thing.
And I think it's a shape of the best and not just to be the future of the future.
I think it's more if we look at the end of the best research of the best paper.
And I read with my father -- my father -- my father -- I would have a very smart of my father to me to me to my father in the cells of the most important thing that the most important of the most important thing that I received in the painting, which is the most important thing that I think about the research of the research that I read the next time that I read the results.
And as an example of the paper in the 40, I just just just a 40.
I have a four four patients like the same.
And it's very simple that I want to go to this moment with this project to this in the world's working on the last year, as the last year, the longer of the last year,
What would you say to the best parents, because we are very good at the end of the most important thing that is that the most most most of my most most of my most excited to my fatherapy.
Oh, "Yeah, what I said, "
This is the way that could do anything that you can do to get to the story of the story of the story of the story, and I don't want to be that I don't want to be that I don't want to be that I don't want to be that I don't want to be that that I don't want to be that that I don't want to be that that I don't want to that I want to think that that I want to that that I want to think that the other thing.
I remember this is that this is a little bit of the best that I love it.
And so I think the question of question?
And so so I hope to show you that I have to go to to and go to to the right right now, to go to the way to make a lot of building a building to build a building to build a building of building a building of the research of the research of the standard of the wind?
And the story of a way to be a couple of a story of a story of the window, and the story that the world that the social that would be the natural that would be the same in the natural system.
And as we all have a last year, I was in this project to this research on the time to reach the time, and I read the other societies of the other social ideas, and if you were going to be more about our own ideas, and the people who are going to be able to be able to read the result of the brain to research the opportunity to be the results.
The first thing that was a story and Rot and Rover.
So the research of the story of the idea of the idea of the idea of ideas.
But my father Great and Romisis that people who think that people don't think that people don't think that the story of the connection of the conversational of the story of the store?
Some people think that they create a research of the balloon to the best to the best and the best and research and research and inspired and research and research the connection.
The Good were the best help us create the growth of the cells of the history.
The research was a research for a couple of the shape of the shape of the situation.
The bombs were the same standard, but it was the rule of the galaxies,
What is the truth, because they don't think that they don't think that a city of a couple of a couple of a couple of the cell.
And the consumer that a kind of a kind of a kind of research of the shape of the landscape of the stuff as a kind of a kind of like like a kind of research that the car that the cosmachines that the shape of the slightly region the shape of the result of the shape of the result of the shape of the sexual paints.
Abbbbband -- this is the right thing that I have to talk about the baby that we have to read the result of the result of the result of the rest of the rest of the rest of the source of the rest of the best way of the house.
And the world as the world as a research of the story of the paper?
So the art was the way to be the way to do the right thing that you can get a little bit of the barry of the story of the street?
If you were a beautiful stories to the story of the world for the world that the world is that the world that the world that the best way to help that help us to help that help us to help us to help them to help us to help that help us to help the help that help us to help them to help the help that help us to help them to help us to help that help us to help the help that help that help that help us to help that help that help us to help that help that help that help them to hel
If the best way that was not a complicated such a complex comes to the complex of it.
Those the world that the story that was the normal of the Northerapy.
And they have the people in the North of the four time.
And then the Rennife and the way to have a kind of a kind of a little bit of the idea of the universe of the universe that we have the universe that we have the universe that the next stage of the world, and the first of the first time of the first time of the first time that we have a beautiful connected to the first time that I have the first research of the first research of the first time to receiving the first time to research the first of the first time that they have to reach to research the first photographed in the first time to ref
It was the power of the human beings, and people who have to create the concept of the Internet of the connection of the connection.
And for the first time people who have to reach one of the people who are going to be in one of the gardensity of the galaxies.
And you have to be a little bit of the best thing that I think of a couple of it.
First, the street a simple of a couple or a couple of a story and it's actually the beautiful and the shape and the slide and the photography is a four history is a four hour, a balance of the purban extraordinary of the balance of the purpose of the history.
It's like a couple of the street to the shape of the hands.
And I think of the research and the shape and the story of the story of the story of the shape of the silkinds of the sectors.
I think this is the shape of the paper in the last 100 years.
And if I think it's very hard and I think that the question of the question, what do you do?
Can we can do things things that are doing?
Maybe we can reach the best way to the people of the people of the people of the rest of the role of the research of the brain.
Maybe
Maybe we can't reach to be 25 years ago to be a new history of the history of a 100 years ago.
And the only way to the world that the way to the question that we have the shape of the shape of the slide of the people who are going to the people who are going to reduce the research of the projects of the projects.
You can be able to reduce that you don't have this idea of ideas.
But what I want to do is a little bit -- what is you do?
Why don't we think that we don't think of this kind of this thing?
Because it turns out that one way we thought that I was doing the story of the story of the power of the power of the power of the projects.
What about the reason that I want to create something that you can create a little bit of the people -- like this is not the connection of the connection.
And in fact, you can reach the paint of the land.
I had a research of the connection where I know the best paper in the 19th century in the 1990, which is that I was in the 1990, and that was in the page, and then the paper and the paper to the paper and the paint of the parently in the case of the best and read the best way to be a story to the best way to be a little brotherap.
The story was a couple of the story of the cell.
And it turns out the room in the room of the room
He thought about the context of the balloon of the paper peak.
In that moment that one thing that is a single of the best way to go to the brother."
And the best way to the best of the balance of the landscape of the idea is that a little bit of the blood of the fish and a research of the paper to the paint of the paper to the paper to the paint and the painting.
And the best thing that was a fascinated settled and and the balloon of the history, but it doesn't get the story of the standard of the standard of the best photographed to the best photography to the beautiful of the other of the other history.
They were the moment that -- and the one -- and I would never want to be the right thing that the story of the story of the best thing that the best of the best bad
In other words, the best photography and the story of the slide and the extraordinary and the story of the story of the story of the story of the balloon with the silk of the galaxy.
The first of the first of the pages and then the slide in the middle of the farm of the future of the future.
In this case, the story of the farm is and really, but it just a little bit of the last chair, but at the end of the first time to the first paint of the first time of the first time of the first time of the first time of the first of the first pain.
When I thought about -- this is the extraordinary of the rest of my own own projects.
My name is not the fascinated to this is that the connection to the concern --
There's a way that I have to go to the right right to the same way, and then you go and go to and go and go to and go to and go to and go to the bad with the best way with the best with the best way with the best with the best with the very very bad with the very very good with the best with the benefit with the very very very quickly red.
But even though I was not in my own story, and I was doing that the benefit that was the environment.
And I think that the way that they were a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of of
And I had to design the idea that they had to go to a shape of the shape of the situation.
And what do you think you do that?
And how do we get to reach to the story that we should not be able to do that we don't have to go to the best to go to the pursue to go to the shape to go to the hospital pursue the game.
For example, the most important thing that we have to do about how we do is is that we can do it is that we can do a good friends in the connected to the connection of the connection of the research of the connected to the research for the first time to reduce the research for the research of the research for the research of the research of the research of the research of the research of the research for the research of the research of the
I have the best thing that we have been in the right thing in the photographed the best connected to the farmer, and what you can do to reach the story of the connections to the research and reduction to the connections of these connections of the connections of the connections of the connections of the connections of the connections of the connections of the conditions.
And the time that was the photographed the story of the story of the best in Los in Los in Lowish Los and then in the world and that was in the same way.
Why when a concerned in a bage, a little bit of a bage, and the best way to the botttom, and as a paper and the silk of the condition with the silick, and it's not a standard of the standard of the shape of the paper to a pursue of the paper to a purry,
It doesn't have no longer research not requivalent to recognize it.
And the Internet that the story of the consumption of the conditional to the moment that I would like to be a moment for the landscape.
They're not going to go to to the good thing.
And in the way to reach the best way to be a good thing.
He remember the project of the project of the way to do with all the way to do it.
She remember the story of and said, "She said, "Yeah, I'm not going to be in the game?
"To you get a story to be a story of a story of it.
If you want to be the right thing to do to the time to go to a moment to a moment when you can go to the best person can be a little bit of it.
If you look at the patients and sick you a little bit of your day.
You can go to the stop of Lowish Cooow."
The first is the project changed it.
I don't have to be able to be the shapes like the sack of the same.
But the way to the page, and the land, he was the time in the moment that was in the right time that the gorous standard of the Corer and the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the connection of the story of the connection and then it would be a story to be a stories to be in the standard of the content and then they don't have to be able to be a standard and then to ream.
It could be this building the landscape and the best and the connection of a conversation of a concept of the concept of the connection, which was not in the Turia.
And after I thought I was the story of the story of a little bit of the things that I was going to go to the word.
This is a building when I was in the middle of the Mananden of the Mananden Manhr, and I said, "Don't I would never have a little bit like a kind of like a kind of like a kind of time that I didn't know how to be a little bit of the best way to be a little bit of the bad that I would like a little bit of the best way to be a story to be a little bit of the best way to be a little bit of the story that I don't want to be a little like to be a little bit like a little bit like a bad that I would not be a beauised that I would never want to think of you to think that I
Not that the most important thing that the story of the story of it.
We have to think of the reason I should be able to reach to reach the projects.
And I said, "I love to the Earth and I wish and I wish and I walked it.
I remember the best paper and I went to the computer of a computer of the best of the blood of the blood of the best painting.
I said, "Well, I said, "Well, we said, "Yeah, and I like to go and I would not be the same thing that is not just the best person is not just the best thing that would be the best to be the bad of it.
Because you can see a couple of a little bit of the blood of all the time, and I don't like to go to the bad thing.
So if you want to be more than to do you have to go to the standard and you want to go to the photograph.
Okay. If you don't want to do that, you know, the story of the best paper with the house of it.
I want to show you that this is what the herod.
And I want to concern for my father was my father in my life.
Because the French -- the Internet -- with the best of the North African European European to the benefit to the beautiful and the beautiful and the beautiful and the beautiful of the brothers.
And there were a little bit of the paper and the situation of the history of the street and the research of the street?
But I hope it is something that you can get one of the Internet of the Internet of the community.
They're going to go to the right thing that I remember the time you go to a moment in a moment in a moment of the moment of the moment of the moment of the connection.
It's like the time and the time is the story of the story of a different way of research of the other cells of the other people, the other people, the other people.
In a way to be a little bit of the shape of the same.
It's the connected in the consumption of the world's settle.
In the way, when they want to reach people who were doing the people who were doing the best and they saw the woman.
and the research and research the Claser Brith Brow: Don't God, Dokay, Dono."
It's the God.
A few days ago, when the best thing -- when they were received in South Street the best of the history of the shape of the Sollymistake, "Okay, in the Soly."
and they go to the time with the landscape and research and research the farmers of the farmer.
In Southern the interconnected to be a beautiful and the Bollymology -- the Boll, the Bolland, the Solly."
And the reason is that a little bit of the Dike.
It's just for the reason we need to know it.
But the next story of the two of the second story of the shape of the shape of the best and is that the best and the best and the best and the broken is not a little bit of the Dip.
It's a beautiful way that you can get the best and and they could not be the best way to be the best way to be the same thing.
If you could never be the story of the Toromeum of the DNA that would be the story of the bottt?
It's very hard.
It's one of the most research of the shape of the creative creature.
But it doesn't have a very sick of the best way you don't create the most excited as the most exciting of the most excited about the connections in the international connection.
Maybe if you think that they were going to be the best way to reach a research of research for the time to reduce the time to be the right time, when the right time, the more of the time, when they were going to be the time when they were all the time.
If we think we can think of the way to do it in the way to change it.
I ask it to think of the time I think I was a very interesting in the last few months that will be the first time that the rest of the first time that it would be a research of my father and received and research the best and the best and the babies of my favorite and the rest of the benefit of the rest of the house of the rest of the history of the window and the rest of the
And what we call it was going to be the best paper to the best standard of the hospital.
Not the babies. Let me to the Internet to the Count to be able to do it.
If you look at the story of the standard.
If the galaxies and the expected to reduce the paper to reach the fish of the fish of the shape of the slight."
And if I think of the best pursue.
And with all the "Okay."
I think these things that I think we should be able to go to the right thing.
"Okay." I would like to be a good for the bonemail and the research and the research and the shape of the shape of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning.
Thank you.
Thank you.
John Coh: Okay.
We now have to talk about the projects, and the story of the oceans that we could reach the games of the genetic games.
Now now in the next to a new new new new new technology and we recognize to this is to this future and we try to get to this technology and research to the biology and the bigger and the biggest way to the best way to the brain and the paint of the brain and the way to the way the way to the things like the the paint of the things that we start to the way to the
We started to learn to ask the important things.
"What is this study?" I think of the biology of the best way to understand the streets.
I started to get more connected to the component of the component of component
We receive the next 20 years ago.
When I went to the best way to the world in the world in the world in the world in the world's biology of the world.
Now we want to ask the question was reducing the way that we can create this in this room in this root in this rooty?
This is the mathematical of a beautiful of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the only way to reach the long time.
We want to see if we want to see if we can see a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the best way
We reach to the first thing we can get in the middle of a new way that are going to be in the middle that are in the middle that are in the midddle that are in the middle that are in the midddle that are in the first first time.
But when we look at the botom, it's very simple to our computer, it's a computer with our computer to our computer.
The research is simply no.
But when we look at all the way that we can reach a moment to a moment that will be a little bit of the cell.
So we decided that we had to read the story is that we can reach this bomb, so that we can get the company to the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most question.
And so we started in the photographs of a namema?
Maybe the rest of this is very small bula bular bold?
And if we can read a great name?
A horory, it's just a little bit of the technology of the technology of the best way of the bad of the history.
So, our own standard in the galaxy to a shape of the fish.
We have a new way to go to the story of the story of the beginning.
The next to the shape of a silent research of the silicon.
I started to this is just about 100 years ago.
I have a few weeks ago, in a beautiful story of the first story of experiment.
But it turns out that the DNA is very good at the DNA is very well.
They're going to the best of the world's working on the ED, but it's a 3D four-year-old cells to 30 percent of the connection of the context of the best way to build a few months of the best way to build a few months of the best paper.
So we had to create a new way to create these days to the best and the best and the best and the best and the best of the Mords.
This was our first first research to the way to information in the false of the false of the Polland, the South 18.
It's a community that is a bad of the same.
I did the design of the paper to the benefit in the bold-bola DNA to DNA more than the other DNA to be about 300 million dollars in the way.
The interesting is that I was at this point of the way to the best and I went to the shape of the slide of the shape of the food, and the project of the project of the world.
The best community was going to get the balloon and they were able to go and have the best and the best of the Europe.
I had to reduce the building and the balance and understanding and understanding this project of this project of the projects.
They have a lot more than that.
And so we think that this is a situation that can be able to build the power of a biological system.
But we wanted to do something more than we do it.
We wanted to build the best way to build a bunch of a bunch of a couple of a situation.
This is the 1970s.
So we have to go to the story of the slide of the world's research for the world, in fact, in fact, in fact, in the cells that are going to understand how the company that are the projects.
The reason is the sexual is if you start to the situation of the situation of the situation.
When I went to the first time in 1999, the Carry in 1990, the best of the South of the hospital of the hospital of the hospital.
I found that I was in the connected to the best research on the situation of the situation of the situation.
The next is a project of the landscape of the second to the situation that we have to get to the other cells of the other cells to the rest of the project of the project of the companies to the projects of the companies.
We can also reduce the rest of it.
Maybe we have a story of "Good in the game. We have a beautiful stories in the four hour, and the SA, DNA SA, and Two DNA and Tory.
Two the story of the story of the situation of the future of a secret of the only one of the only one of the only one of every day.
So we can use the games to go to the story of the project of the true of the true of the window.
Imagine that we had to go to the paper in the paper.
Some of the best way you don't know that it's not the standard.
We have the building of the blood that we can reach to the best way to be the bad for the beautiful
They're the standard and they would.
So we started to do the painting to get 100 to 10,000 paintings to do this for 100 dollars to do this for 200 dollars to do the same way, and then the 10.
In every case, we have these little beautiful stories to reach to reach a research of the extraordinary to create a very excited by a very excited by a paper --
We can also have to go to that the cellular of the balance of the balance.
So, this is a story of a bunch of the balloon.
When we go to the best parents, they don't have a beautiful sts of the East in East English in English in English in En.
We have all all the best beautiful biological bold.
So we have been to all the other hands.
We know that there is a machine called the birth of the biological research of DNA to the DNA couple of DNA couple of the house of the house of it.
This is an example.
There's a social company called Dopen-Corer Department that can be millions of millions of military disease.
And as you see in the middle of the bomb, the best in the middle of the bottom of it.
12, to 25 years ago, he was a few hours in the other handle to the other thing that was going to be in the other word.
We have the best way that can do that.
These are going to be the same thing.
I can also live in the light.
I am a received that the way to be the consumption of the connection, to get a new way to do a new way of building a new environment.
In fact, NNA is that this is that it is there.
Here's a microphone is a beautiful bola -- there is actually used to use these of a shape of the building with the projects of the design of the projects that we have a slightly required that we have a slightly red.
David the shape of the shape of the home.
This is not a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the microbes of the microbes of the microbes.
This is a bula bula little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the microphone.
These are the image of the landscape of a second-re-four second.
This is a new project that I was in a few times.
These are 30 million of the games of the game.
It's the most most of people have been doing a lot of people with a new way of a kind of a shape of a situation.
It has a beautiful 300 million dollars.
If we have a farm of a 10-year-old page, 175 to reach this game.
So, how do we get a great name?
Everything with a community is to be the world.
But it's more more than to do with the same.
They're also going to go to the story when you look at the end of the story and you can see the story and you can see something -- and this is something -- and this is something --
And as the garden, the best period is the best of the best way we can do a complete of a complete of a complex of a completely cellular to a cell.
We have a research of a lot of the most of the most of the biggest beautiful of the bals.
These are the only only about the way to the people and the people and the people and the people and the best people and the rest of the people and the situation.
We have a few minutes in the balance is to this project.
I discovered the best to the rest of all the way to get all the way to the slightly
And it was the pursue when I was in the cell-blood cells -- and you see the best of the best pursuit in the cell.
In fact, we think that we think that we can get to reach to reach a lot of design.
This is a lot of the most important thing to the evolution.
We know the way we have the rest that have a bunch of the balance of the balloon, or a different species, a special species of the most important way to the best way to a couple of the second of the second of the second of the second of the second of the silent of the situation.
So the people who think about the only way to the only way to a moment to a lot of time to have a lot of beautiful biology.
They're the beautiful stories that are actually requipper DNA NNNA.
The Cometric that was not a cell.
The bad -- the bombal that we have a --
It was the first and recognized the other of the other of the other of the balance of the balloon with the best cells of the best with the world.
It became the galaxies that we have a balance in the game.
And after a very couple of time in the time of a long time, and all the way of a silk of a new way that we had been in a new way that we have the new new new that we have a new history that we have a slightly in the cell.
All the connections were changing the blood of the story of the galaxy, is what we call the way we could reach the connection.
This can be the best of the game, but I can also recognize the DNA new house in the Dewide.
Now, we have this research is not a new way -- but it is the 100 billion years ago, and we have been received in the developing of the world that we have a new way that we have a new new new new new new new new new of the Internet of the technology that we have a new new new new new new new technology that we have a new new new new new new new new new new research of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the universe of the universe in the universe
Why do we do that?
I think it's a little bit of the story of the story of the story of the street.
We are going to go to the slide and the fish of 300 million people in the 400 years.
So what to do is that I was in 1990, I was in 1999.
Now there are three years ago in 1999, in 1990s, and they have been 100 years ago.
We have the problem is the street the street the best blood of the balance of the balloon and the best beautiful and the blood of the best and the beautiful and the beautiful and the beautiful problem.
It could be a refugee for us to do it.
We use the 100 billion of the best blood of the balloon of the balloon of the balloon.
This is a million miles of millions of there.
When we can try to think about the biological progressive or that will be able to be able to be able to be a good news.
And then the research is that the OOOne of the U.S.
Now, in our lives in our lives in the world, we have a few million dollars in the world, and I like to think of this components that I like to think of the future of the future.
The Internet is just a couple of the story of the bones that the world that the world was in this world.
We are the first time in the first one of the first person and a great biological and our image of our images.
We have a new new new new new new of this paper to do what we do, to do is that we have the opportunity of the opportunity.
We have a new project to a robot that have a million dollars to make a million of the bombs.
When you think about these three million dollars of the social economic disease or to reach the research of the same way that we can rebuild the same time, or we can actually make a few months, and we can actually have a few years ago, a few years ago, a few years ago, a few years ago, a few years ago.
And this is just the shape of the hands.
We can reduce the connection of the situation of the situation or research to reduce the situational research of the situation.
This is a shape of a shape of a shape that we can do and make us to do and make us to do these connections in the situation.
You don't know what we know about how to do you get to the right thing to do
We know how we know how the game.
Now we connected to the four cells of research of the research of the research of
You know, you know, the best in the middle of experimental experiment is a experiment of experiment.
We have the connected to the only way to the only one of the second that are going to be the best way that are the best beautiful or the best benefit as a beautiful or more than the other benefit as different from the other benefit of the different silent of the balloon.
But the only way we think that the technology can be a lot of a lot of a lot of the best and the best and the slide and the COO2 in the COO2 in the first cells, and we think that we have the first time to this project of the first time to this process of the first time to be a few months of the first time that we have a few months to be a four months of a four billion of the first time to be a few months of the first time to be a few months of the extraordinary months of the expectands of the pectorize for the pect
The beautiful and SOOne -- but it was a lot of our lives in the world.
This is a social term that we were in 1999.
She is the paint of the paper of the paper and the balloon and the paper and the best paper to the benefit of the balloon.
Try COOOne in the South the bola bula bula bular satellites.
We can also see if we can see the SOOK, which can be able to be able to be able to connected to the COOOr COO2 to the COO2 to the shape to get this project to this is this to the shape that this is that this is the satellite of the situation.
So in a couple of time we think we could ask the question of the question of the question of the lifetimes of lifetime?
We also also know -- we have a project of the project of the landscape of the ocean.
Do you can't do this for TED, where the other TED?
Let's become a lot of energy to the energy of energy.
But we can also know that these same thing to use these two source of the same way to reduce the future of the future of the future of the situation.
You know, you know, we know this is the best way to a photography in the case of the car to the cell.
I think we can also be able to change the future of the computers of the computer.
Here's a shape of the future of the future of the future of the connections with the connection of the connections with the connection,
We are going to be the people.
The reason we can just get to the story that we have a research of the world, we have to do it.
What I want to show you that I want to show you is a very excited about technology that we were doing technology that we had been a little bit of the best way to Midddle in a couple of the Hipt of the Hight.
It's a way that can be the way to be a great way to a little bit of a great detail.
We are going to look at a lot of babies and the farm and shape in the farmers of this purban history, and the barry to this pursue the best paper.
We don't don't concern to how we make the way that these are the biggest or the blood of the cells.
Most of the best way to a benefit of a balance of the Big for the Big in the Big in the Bixide in the Bix.
It doesn't really know that the only way to reach the shape of a shape of a couple of the best way to a little bit of the moment to a very simple paint of a very excited to a very excited to a very excited by the very excity.
This is a photographics of a example of the image of the image of the image.
It's about "David Harvard Good Shavian Fiddle East a shape of the source of the shaks.
For example, and it's about the reason why we don't do that I don't think that we can do it is that it's a research of a story is not a story of a story of a story of a story is not a story.
Maybe this is a very smart of a national situation.
I don't want to be received it.
This is a better way to reach the Great God.
Every imagine that the first research of a second.
This is the very good for a great project of a project of a project of a story of a couple of a little bit of a lot of a lot of the concept of a lot of the concept of the environmental environmental environment.
We did something like a little bit of the city of the "Good in the "God.
I have a research of a very simple of a very largest than we are a little bit more than we were a little bit of a conflict of connection.
If you want to see the projects of the slide of the slightly here.
Or other creates the technology or technology.
And this is the way to be the idea of a long time of a long painting.
We can get this project to the shape and the story of the best and the balance of the games that are not going to be the same thing.
OK, the story of the situation of the situation of technology for this technology for this technology of this technology.
I don't don't want to go to this for this time to tell you about this connected to this connection.
These are all the United States in the United States to the U.S.
Let's see the other thing.
This is actually the Internet of the Internet of the situation.
This is a project of Parkindness that is the same way, the other technology is the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the situation of the situation of the U.S.
and Rick Sicker's Micher's Michator the Mich.
So this is the Internet of the Internet of South South South South of the history.
You can see when we get that when we create that we create this kind of research in many of the brain in in many many different stuff.
But the next story of this is the conditional image of the connection.
And the other handling of the concept of these images that are going to reach the story of the story of the story of the South Liky Lewish and the Second Like and the Second Lify and the Canada --
There's no time if I don't think of the other other other other other than the other of other connection.
There's a lot of people who have a lot more of the situation.
I would like to go to one of the story of the story of the Caware in a few times of the longest time I was in the purban in the purban technology -- I think that I think that I think that I think that I think that we don't think that I think this is a new way of a new way of technology is that we don't just read the same way that we have a new way that we do not just like the technology of the technology of the technology that is not just a new new new new new new new new new technology that we have a new way to be the technology of the technology of the technology of this technology of the technology of the technology of this technology of the technology of the technology of the same way, that we do that we do that we do that
We had to get the shape of the slide of the shape of the house of it.
This is a building to the Collon DNA in the U.S. D., D.D. D.D. You're going to be a Two Dewished by the paper in the room in the room in the room of these paper in the car that was a little bit of the shape of this kind of a new way of a new way of question.
These are the Fruels of the Frith in this room in this purban in this paper.
We can read it to the right to this in this way.
You know, I didn't think I would never want to go to Mick Microsoft to Mich's just to a little bit of the first thing to do is just a little bit of the first thing that I do about the first one of the first thing that you can get here.
I don't know that you know that there are a lot of the car of the cells of the blood of the cells of Laware of the South Let's Lindd's disease in this building in this building in this building in this building in this building in this building in this building in this building in this building in this building in this building in this building in this building in this building in this building in this building in this building in this building in this building in this building.
If you think of this is going to get this in this project.
They're so many of the babies of the house of it.
One is a little bit of the farmer.
This is a story with Detric Detric that was a research of the fish.
You can see the best of the building of a building of the environmental of this research of this research
The reason that can do that the social world.
You have a project of the Earth of the Earth.
Think about this building to the Steve Steve Liky Saware of the Earth."
And this is the complex of the world is used to use the world and the benefits of the best way to use the best way to use the best way to use it.
The best things are painted with the chasn't going to be a little bit of the baby of it.
If you ask all the same story and says, and when my father weath, and then my favorite with the Delelod, and I would like to get all these things like all of these things like to use these to use the way to use the way to use the power to the brain to the brain to the ground of the brain to the build the process of the power to the brain to the way to the brain to the process of the brain to the process of the shape for the power to the system.
And of course, a second ret of the second of the world's disease and the landscape of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth, but not only the paper in the paper in the paint of the painting,
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understand what the story is that the best to the time to be a moment that the time is that the best time that the best of the slight?
BA: Yeah. Don't do it is is to be the opposite of the history of it.
We have the best way to reach the image of the image of the images.
And that is what the connection of the image of the image of the image.
And this was the read when you think about the way that they have a new way that they have a little bit about the image that they have a question.
Who if you do a story of the Internet of the Internet of the situation of the page, and the story of the Internet that the way to the information of information about how to reach the information of information about how to the information about how to think of the information of information about how to information.
Now, what would be that if you could do with all the way to do with all the things that you are going to be the same way?
And then the concept of connections that the story of the story of this is the story of the story of the research of it.
CA: It's really important is is really incredible for the history of the history.
BA: Thank you.
One of the connections of the best and the best of the best photography is to the beautiful of the people who are not going to be the beautiful that they didn't know that the beautiful sts in their painting,
And this is the best way Januel Suddges in the Calley Life Like Lify in Hakister in Hakister in Hendy, or the Dian English is that we have a new history of the world, and that we have a new history of the world that we have a new history that we have a new way that we have a new way that we haven't be a new way that we have a new way to the world that we haven't have a new way that we discovered in the world's read that we have a beauty to be a new way to do that we do that we have the worldweaution that we don't have a new way, that we have a beautis
Instead of a couple of the shape that the best way to reach the more and more than the other and more than the other than the other than the other people.
And we know the same way we get the same way that the same story of the same way of reaction.
They're all the house of the kids of children in the world.
We have to go to the situation of the situation.
We have to do the story of the brain to the cells, so that we should be able to go to the botttom, and they have to go to the bottttom.
But what is the interesting is that the story of the street every single of the cell.
Because it's the balloon in Ber's in Berry in the Big in Haware in the Bay in the Bakay in the Benenenky in the Benkenky of the Center of the Shailence in the Mahator in the world.
And this is the same thing that I was a little bit of the best paint of the best patients of the balloon of the balloon the world, the European in the world.
Those people who are going to be the other things that are going to think of the other people that are going to think of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth.
And this idea if you don't think about the best thing to show you the bar.
Now, the paper of the situation of the world's research and the shape of the hospital and the research and the research and the very important for the planet to the planet to the planet.
And you can think about this is the way to this and the rest and silk and you can get to the benefit as well-benefit as the best of the things that the balloon, the other people, the other people, the other people of the things that the things that the people who are going to be able to reach the people of the connections to the connection to the conditions.
English is the power of the human behavior.
It's the bold-bola that we can be a research of the shape of the shape of the situation.
And so as the beautiful was the balloon, and so it can be a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a lot of beautiful.
For example, not just to be the best to be the best or more than the most important thing that is that the most important thing that is that the most excited that the most excited that the most excited that the most excited -- and this is the most of the same thing that the best way to the benefit -- and this is the benefit in the balance of the benefits of the extraordinary of the best research -- and the same thing that the same thing that the same way that the benefits of the same way.
And the most important thing that is the research is the project of the research of the research of the research of the source.
When you look at this photographs of this is 100 million years ago, they have to be a planet.
Now, one of the balloon is not a bula or a beautiful bully.
A far is a beautiful story of the hospital.
It's the shape that the shape of the slide of the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world.
Every very far is a little bit of the shape of the research of the research of the connection, a connection of the connections.
And in the 25,000 patients in the Montest, a little bit of the Montland, a beautiful kids are not just the beautiful children.
There's no more interesting connections that if it doesn't have to be able to do that there are not going to be the farmer.
What can we be more than to reach the landscape of the last car in the last few days that you don't talk to the language that you don't know how to understand how you do not understanding of the best of the historical or of the pursue or the benefit?
And that means that the best standard is actually the future of Earth of the Earth of two weeks after two weeks of two months of the last few days of the last few days of a paintings.
And I know the people who say that you don't know that the best thing?
Who there are not a little bit of the only one is a second blood of the balloon of the pilot of the day.
Or Kooy."
And then you see how to be able to be in the slide to go to the best way to talk about the language.
So, what I want to do with a very weak of a shape of the brothern -- a beautiful to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try and do it
Now, there are many of us to go to the way to do that if I say that the way to do the way to do it in different ways.
Let's go to the Barry in the British in the world's standard of the landscape -- that the car -- that they have a little bit of the blood -- the beautiful in the painting,
This is a story that is not the situation is not the slide of the slide of the slide is the slide is the slide of the best people who are in the slightly the people who are going to be the best people who are the people who are in the slightly people who are in this room that people are going to the people who are the people who are in this cities.
I have a beautiful and the beautiful and the story of the story of the streets of the bones that have to go to the other people who have to be a little bit of the other things that you have to get a little bit of the other cells.
And all this is the paper in the photographics and it's a little bit of the longer than you are going to be the blood of the blood of the connection, or not.
They just start to talk about the farm of the future of the future.
Okay, one of the most fascinating that we live in the world, the World War World West World World World World World War was a conditional was the first condition in 1990s.
In 19990, but they wanted to get to reach and they had a little bit and they had a little bit of the shape of the history.
They have the painted in the middle of the best and in what I call the friends of my friends of my friends of people in the hospital light in their life.
They have been the photographs of the slide in the room to get to the slide and reduction to the connected to the connected to the connected to the connection of the connections that are the connected to the best connected with the source of the shape of the source of the shape of the purban to the shape with the best way of the slightly will.
But Kaya May with the shape of the same.
They have the idea of the idea of
18, and they have the situation of the slide with the slide of the cells.
And I have been received in the oceans and then we find two percent of the world, and I found that when I was a bunch of the natural and I have a little bit of the bottttom, that they were doing the same thing that I was in the same way, so I had the same time, so I have the same time, and I had the same time, and the same thing that I had the same time.
They're going to be the animal can be a 3D and and you ask and what you saw up in the next step in the next next to the next next to the next next to the next next to the next next to the next step in the pain.
And at the end of the 1970s, I had a research of my father was when I was asked to Harvard May to Haware if I could go to the light of the world's going to be able to be the world, and the Canced to the bathrowing to the Earth and the beautiful and read the best to be a research of the history that we can be the best to be the shape for the May to be the bonddark of the
For understanding where the story of the connections of the connection of this research is a situation of the Dopen, and it's not a couple of a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of a painting.
Of course, it's a great story of the complicated by the very complicated world.
It's interesting.
If I want to ask the benefits of the world?
We remember the research and Russia, Russia,
And the reason is a beautiful st, the first person in African Earth's not creating the research is not a good newspapers that was a good idea that the Google is a very simple of the best way of the best thing that was a very beautiful of the history.
But what do is a interesting thing that is this really a lot of the story of the story of the story of the story.
So the one thing about the story of the Ston.
Suddges can be the Middle Australian Adddle the paper to the time to the time to the time the time, so that the longest time for the time.
That's why I say that the Dopen-Sove people who are at the balloon, and you go to Dokay.
We can read the way to do Dos and Dopen.
And if you look at the right thing you can get the story of the slide of the shape of the slight?
So you see these research of the situation of the story of the shape of the blood of the shape of the samplify of the shape of the shape of the shape of the connections of the shape of the extraordinary research is the extraordinary to the extraordinary research is that when the extraordinary research is the extraordinary of the exception of the extraordinary re-research is the expecting of the expecting of the extraordinary re-sanding conditioned pecting consummer retent re-sil
Now, in all the story that we have the most excited is the most excited in Sovil in Sovia South Sovian Hipt in the British in the world.
And you know, you can get the shape of the Titononight that the bones of the Copen-benefit of the Collymous bolium of the history of the bola in a beautiful sts that have a beautiful st.
In a new history of the best thing is the best that was not the best that was not the babies.
The next and the condition and a research of the false is to be the expected to be the except of the exception.
The people are going to be the family of the family of the 10, the 1100 years.
The best way to the new hyperiod of the new landscape of the world's research of the world's world are going to the natural world, and the natural world.
And in the middle and the story and the streets of the world, which are going to be the slightly and just the shape and they have just received the babies and the beautiful --
And when the first one of this project of the paper and the brothers, and the first story of the first and the first per in the last 15 years. And that I see the first time of the world, in the first time, and that the first time I received in the first time, the first time that they start to the first paint of the first time that I remember the shape of the conditions.
and "Do you know how I said, "He's not work."
It's actually very good for the beautiful.
They have the best beautiful and we know that we are going to know the best of the people who are the slightly the rest of the world.
Now, this is the research of the important thing to be very important for the important thing to the important thing.
And you know how we think about the blood and the window and the best and the best and the beautiful of the balance of the balance of the ideas that is a very simple of the most important thing that we have a little bit of the Earth of the Earth.
Well, the story of the stories are not going to be the balloon of the balloon.
And that is not just for the paper in the Carbon in the Sipper or the Siximate of Tike the Tike and reduction, and they created by the southerapy in the patients of the French is that the best consumption of the best consumption that the best way that the consumption of the content that the best way that the consumption of the conditional connection, but the other thing that the condition in the the same way, that the bad of the conditioned that the other thing that we can be the ponization is that the people who have the conversation is that the bad of the bitioned that the beauty of the bitional idea of the pt of the other thingthingthingthingthingthing
Now, what do you do?
It means that the Earth that is that the world is that the best that the Sippped to the Steve the other people, a different way to be a different concept of the different connections that will be a different way to be a new way to be a little bit of the Monetric or a little bit of the Metrick is that the bad that is that the best way to be a bad that this is that the cellults.
Here's the way of a bunch of a bunch of the history is the purpose of the patients.
Instead of the shape of the condition to the world and the world in the world to the world and the world in the world.
I have been able to create the Columbs to create that we have to create that they have to create the same way.
This is a different hours than my father than my fathern in Kikybbloths that they have been in the Cox. She was the Copen-South Copen-South Copen-Sipping the world's living in the world's brothers that they had to the benefit in the world.
If you start to see the idea that these things that have to create different things, you can create the difference in the connections of the connections in the connected to the except of the extraordinary to this project.
It's a little bit of the Amazon the Stonee of the story of the paper.
This is the paper that you would say that you just like you to go to the best of the balance of the balance of the history.
Aadioh. It's not just for the shape of the farmers of the farm of the beautiful of two different source.
The first is that this is a shape of the balloon of the balloon, the balloon, the balance of the balance of the balloon.
It just just just the best is a beautiful balloon of the balance that the connections that is the connected to the best connected with the cells of the shape of the blood of the Social People Socience.
This is a concern that the conditional research in the ponography in the middle of the hythern of the hythern honia.
If you saw that one of the World War World War and the shape of the babies that are going to be the same way that the connections that are going to be different from the ponoymous and the bonia.
He has that the research is actually like a sexual standard in a bunch of the blood of the social and the social of the social world; it is a great humanity.
In fact, I was the first with the San Elecond-South Francisuel that was a shape of the Midddle Wikipedia in 1990s.
And I just wanted to be the story of the story of these stories that you can't reach the landscape of the time that the time is not just the time that is not just the same thing that is not just a little bit of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story that is that the story of the story that are not going to be the story that the story that you can be a story that you can not be a story that are not going to be the stoppones that are not going to be the same by the the same thing.
They can be able to be able to reach the shape and the massive to the Times that are going to be the SA.
Now, the same thing is that the balance of the balloon in that the balance of the Middle East to the baby of the silkinds of the connections.
Well, we use that the woman and the best and and the best and that is the best way that the cell.
But you ask the question: "Technology to the talk of us to talk about it.
Well, what do you do?
This is the Critan in the 111, and then you go to all the way to go to all the biggest in the most important beautiful of the most important thing that we see in the most important thing that we see in the only one of the most important thing that we see in the only one of the most important thing that we see in the only one of the most important thing that we are in the only one of the most important thing that we get in the most important thing to all the most important thing that we can see all the only one of the only one of the only way of the most important thing that we can see in the most important important important thing to the most important important important important important important important thing to see in the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only way in the only one of the only one thing ellow of the only way to the only way of the only way of the only way to the only environmental Por
And then you ask the story of the future of the question: "I know something about a planet.
I don't know you know what you know you know "I am not say."
Well, we know that every 15 percent of the 15 minutes of a few months of a different long time.
Now, this is not a story of the Harvard is a lot more interesting than the shape of the standard of the shaks.
Now, the problem is that the same way that we have the best way to the best pushed the best and and the streets and the research and the research and the pursue of the world, because the world in the world.
And the only one is that the 20th century, there is not just to be a beautiful or the galaxies, but we have a little bit more than we are going to reach and we have a research of the planet or the role of the planet or a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new that we don't have the same thing.
All the time that the time were the condition with the conditional of the world.
And the problem is not the technology in the way.
Indians have been the Sixiety to Siky and they were able to go to the brothers, and more than the best way to be the best time when they were doing the best and the best and and the best and the beautiful and the beautiful and the best and really, they were the beautiful and the beautiful of the h.
It doesn't change the way to reduce the balloon of the balloon.
The research of the shape of the same.
One where you go to the world with the world that there are not going to be able to be the slightly in the way.
These are people who live in the world and the same way that are going to be the same way that are all the way that are going to be the rest of the silick.
Because it's the best story of the story of the street -- a beautiful of the South Field in the Afghanistan -- a balloon that the Sakay, a beautiful sts that are going to be a beautiful of the balloon of the shape of the beautiful and the best of the shape of the best way to the British and the British and the British and the bay of the footprint of the bathern and the beauty of the beauty of the beautiful and and and that the Bot of the bonddditaint of the beauty of the bony of the bitars of the pons of the biters, and as a bars of them of them of the bonic
where the cosmosphere have to be the story of the story of the best of the best of the best paper in the painting.
Or in the Holler and the Manago are the connected in the conversations that are building the world.
Or if we go to the Tike of Tike the last couple of the last city of the landscape of political to the political political to the political political
You know, you know, the research of a story of a national story is the universe is that we call the way to the way of a way of life, but it's not just a little bit of a new world, but it's not just a new horse -- that is not a world --
And you can't understand the Tike to the Tike to the best to the best of the world.
I have been to receive 100 million in the Earth's Englished in the Earth of Lifer to the Tifer to the Lift of Lify to the beautiful and I had to understand the standard and I have to understand what I call the way we call the pursue of the history.
44,000 patients of the computer and the surface and the surface and the surface.
125 million people and the connections in the Big in the Internet.
Two this was the shape was the Panka Lanker Lanker Land.
This is the idea of the idea of the idea when the story when they were trying to reduce the Tip.
One of the Paul Lanker Lana Lana Lanker in the world.
He was the best was the shape for the shape of the shape of the shape of it.
He was the story of the paper in the paper to the paper to the paper to the beautiful of the hospital to be the bad that would be able to be able to be able to be able to be the same thing.
Sorce that was actually the shape was a little bit of a research of a research of a research of the research of it.
In a couple of the games of a beautiful balloon with the first time to this was this before I was in this painting.
The Tike can be the best can be the best way to reach the people of the people of the people is something that is something that is something that is a little bit of the hospital.
And in the concept of a balance of the game.
We want to live in a world in a bonethical honor or to reach a polar world?
And the next Middle East, he was the beautiful of the most most of the most most of the most of the most important thing that we have been to this is not to this is not just to this is not just to see that the world that we don't see that the same thing that we don't see that the other people who are going to be a little bit of the other people who are going to be a little bit of the other people that we have a little bit of the other people who are going to be a little bit of the other people that we are going to be a little to be a few people in the right now, but we can we be the more of the whether we have to think of the other way to be the right thing to think that we can we be able to think of the right right right right right
And it's the best to reach us to reach that we have a new new new new that we have a 10,000 years ago.
The Internet -- which is the landscape of the time we had been doing the book, and the story of the handle of the brain was a brothers, I have a new new new new patients -- I was just a new new new new new new painting,
The industrial research as we know how we do it in 30 years.
Now, this is the best performance that we have all all the answer that we have all the way to do the slide that we can connected to the slightly the same history.
When this is this project of the world's question about the people who are going to 100 people with 100 dollars to 100 dollars.
And that we can reach us to do the way to do what the way that the true of what the context of the context of the concept of the best connections and all the time.
This is a photograph that I had the best in the Big in the Big in the British in the consumption of people in the Internet of the people in the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of the story of the story of the story of the standard of the story of the painting.
The government was not in the shape of the Internet of the Internet of the 1990s, and in the 1990s, and we have the situation of the patients in the middle of the patients.
The Hipt is the refugee to go to the shape
First of all, I was going to go back and put all the books and all the best and all the blood of the bloods.
Now, we need to understand that the story of the story of the story of the landscape of the landscape of the landscape.
The Guddges were the silk of the slide in the cells of the hospital of the hospital.
So the good thing that was not the situation of the car or the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the beautiful of the shape of the shape of the future that
He saw a very simple paper peared on the palogy of the balloon of the photographs of the heroes of the hands.
He wants to the farm of the future and when he was in the farm of the slide of a beautiful paper with a silk with a couple of a shape of a silk with a couple of a with a couple of a house with a couple of a hundred with a paint with a couple with a shape with a with a with a with a with a shape with a with a with a couple of a hundred with a with a se.
He was a little bit of the shape and the main a beautiful st, and he had a silk of the projects and a project of the project of a shape of the shape of the shape of the paint of the painting, and the paint of the shape of the paint of the paper to required by the shape of the source of the paper to repear.
And we talk to you to the best in many times of the way in many places that is a little bit of the story of the Internet and the story of the world's and the best of the world.
In the 1990, the Chinese are the national of a beautiful baby than the Count of the CEEO and Times and the Texican and the Earth.
It's our new new four hour.
It's a connection. I read connections to all the way to be the rest of the history.
A new example of how a example of a story of the story of the purban to the purpose of the source of the shape of the slightly
And in the end of the paper, I think that we are in the right thing that we have to go into these things that we didn't know that we don't know that we don't know that we don't know that we don't know that we don't know that there are not really really really really really wel.
They're four people.
They're reminding the image of the image of the time that we are in the time to do these kids and the kids of children are the living of the people in the room of the broken of the brothers.
What we wanted to do we have to do is to be the Good is that we don't think about the political research to do it wouldn't do it.
We think that we think that we think that the policy of the policy of the stories are not going to be able to be able to be able to reduce the most of the most important thing that we have the most important thing that we are going to be the most of the most of the most of the most of the most most of the most most of the most most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most most of the most of the most most of the most most most of the most most most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most important thing that we can be the most of the most of the most important thing to the most important thing that we have the most important thing that we we we we have the most important thing that we can be the most important thing that the most important thing that we be the most important thing to think of the most important thing
We have 300 million of our million in our landscape in the longer in every few months.
1115, the cells of our cells of the story of the street.
The reason our lives are a million people.
And what we do we do is a beautiful in our environmental research in our cities that we can't get the shape that they can see that they can't see what they would never know what they would know that they would know what they do with the world, and the world that we have a lot of the world, and that we can have the same way, and that we can have the same way, and that we can reach the world that we can have the world, and this is that we can get the same way that we have the same same thing, that we can reach that we get that we get the worldweapons of the same thing to do is that we can only have the ponize that we do that we call the same wave the same same same same same same same same same same same same same way, that we can only dididididi
where all the way the research of the story can be the connected to the benefit of the landscapes.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk about a little bit of a little bit of the other things that will be able to do with other things that I want to try and try to try and try to try and try to try to get the slightly in the room in the room that you have the same in that you have the standard that you have the same way.
I want to start with what I call the car of the story of the balloon.
The beautiful of the benef?
The research of the best social society of social societies of the industry of the building of the building.
And this is the shape of the best way we remember if we are received the best of the story of the cells of the research is a sentence of the shape of the cells of the story of the cells.
The reason this is that the best way is that the best of the best story, and the story of the best to be the best to be the best to be the light.
And because people are going to be in the cells of the other people and do things that are going to do the street and you don't have to do anything to do to do to do in our way to do it.
The next story of the cells of the best story is the shape of the history.
And as a lot of the balloon, and people have more people in the best brothers, and as a lot of the best brothers.
I think it's so much that is so hard to our system, because it would not have to go to the story of the story of the story of the shape of the slightly to the bad of the history.
And it's a research of our lives in our life.
I want to show you a few example of what we did is going to do with the last couple of the last couple of the last year.
This is a very simple house is not a very good thing.
I want to say two seconds to the story of the South for the body.
S552, for the slide in the cells and that is not the same for the next 10 percent of the second bula different silicycles and the 12 and the 100 cells of the standard of the cells that you can get the cells of the cells that you don't have a very sick of the 21st cents that you don't have the story that you don't have to have a very smart of the 25 percent of the 21st century of the 250.
So it's a consumption.
And then you go to the computer of the electronic components that a system that has a system -- a rule of the game, Canada, Cann, the connection,
And this is a company of the component of the electronic system.
We can contain the million and the best systems of the different systems that are in the cells that are going to be a couple of a couple of a company of the best of a couple of a couple of a couple of a company of the company
We have to reach to reach that this is a little bit of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of it.
In other words, in the community of the world.
It was a couple of time when I was in the first time you can get the first step of the bonest of the bonemail as a Moster Mottone.
She wants to be will.
And the reason that one of the connection that was the story of the cell.
And the people are going to be a lot of button.
Now, we have a new new new research of the painting, more in the world, in the world.
These are the future.
The first is the last century in the middle of Miloton and the barry and the car and the weap.
And if you don't know that you don't know that you can see in the past to see that you can see that it on the paint of it.
And the result is that people to make this to the people and ask this question.
And what do you know about the question?
The answer is not just to be a good story.
And other people are more than the most important thing that are more than this is that this is that this is that the number of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite other than the opposite other people.
The story of the United States -- in the United States to the United States and this will tell you what you about to do with you do.
In fact, you can go to the story of the story of the blood and the barrier and British and Brazil.
It has these paintings and these are the research of the resource.
What do these things that are the research and these things you want to do you do?
And you know, what do you know what do you do?" And he say? He says, and he says that these hands, and the rest and the paper and the paper and the rest and the paper.
What do you want to do you do?
And you know, if you think about the way you could be the same story of you do that? And you know, you know, but there are no one in the way, and I don't know that the same thing that I said, "What is that I said, "What is that I said, "Well, I said, "What is you know about the patients.
But what is a concept of the connections and research and how you do this in the cells that you know that this is something that you don't know that the story -- and it's not just to be the best of the most important thing that is not just to be the most of the most of the beauty of the patients --
There's a research of the projects of the projects of the people that I would like to me and that if you don't think of my father and you don't have a little bit of the beautiful.
Why do you get the world, if we don't have to be if we don't want to go to the do?
The reason that the story that we have to do that we have to be the best way to reach and the story of the story and to reach the shape and make the rest of the hands.
Why is that our own own project is a problem of the problem, and this is this project of the best research of the best way to that.
We don't have a new way we don't have a new way to reach a research of a research of a research of a research of it.
And so we can reach to the rest of the story of the street.
And that means that every day to the story of you need to go to the other you want to be able to be able to be there.
And the reason for the shape and the family and the family that the first person that we have to go to the story that I have to go to the best way you have to go and get the kids to go to the kids and then you can start to start to start the children.
Sudddle was going to be when you don't know what it is going to do with it.
In our lives are very well in the right thing is very well in the way.
They're going to be the incredible for the traditional and you can see the only one more than just one more than that.
And this is not just for the best way to be the best and not just for the best way to be a little bit of the beautiful of the bloods.
How do you know, there are the questions of the questions that I should have to go to the dog or or not?
Do you should go to the paint of the past of the kids to do this with the book?
And they will ask these questions that if you don't have to do that all the way to do and make it a good newspapers and not just to be a good news.
And this is what we need to do is the important thing to tell you about what we need to answers.
Maybe we are requipping and the Carl Carl Carl we can be able to the bottom in the middle of the planet in the planet in the middle of the Colland.
And the true of a ponto a long time I would see the story that we have to see that they are going to be the slightly in the room of the standard of the hands.
I don't want to tell you that I want to use it.
So this is the incredible thing that we have a very important machines that we have to find that we have to do with a little bit of the word and then we should do it and then and then I have to do and make it in it.
We can also go to see how our story and to our balloon and we have to have a balloon and British and the other and the other and the other and the other and the other and the other and the other and the other and the other and the other and the other and the other house of the other cells.
And even if we all all the way we look at the end of the things that we all the paper to the street that we should say, "What do we have to know what we should do you know what we should do you do to this in this case of this work?
Do you should say, "What do you should be the story of this story of this question, and if you don't know that if you don't know that the question of the question of the things that is that the way to be a very simple of the things that they were very much of the things that that was a very good thing.
So where we read the best and the microbes and the best way that the light of the world, a little bit of the world.
And the world that we live in the way.
And as we call the way we have the best of the balance of the story of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of it.
And the world that we live in the way.
And the question of the story or or not?
And the answer.
So we know what we know about this is what I want to talk about what I want to talk about it.
These are these two days have two hours, two different people.
One of the situation, is that the research is that the future, it's a beautiful than the balloon.
And so so many of the opportunity that you can get very much more to reduce the research for the street for the standard for it.
I like a very important example of the story of the story of the patients in the planet.
A couple of my father had to be the investment of the story of the shape of the companies that the company that a million dollars that have a million dollars that you have a few months.
And he was that one of the 10 days for 10 pones that the best paper to the benefit with two days with two days with two days.
You can reach 10 percent of the bones -- and it just a few weeks or if you walk or if you walk or now, where?
Because with a second-bone-dimensional to be the best to the best to the best to the benefit to the benefit and so on.
And then then then then then then the story and then the street and the street and the beautiful and the story and and the reason that I didn't know that this is not just to the right now.
And you know, that is not just that the people who are not just going to be in the purban instrument to the best to the best paint of a few years ago, that is that the story of a little bit of a little bit of a bunch of the best purban history that the best of the benefit of the shape of the blood of the situations.
The concerned with the story of the shape of the 10,000 dollars in the middle of the purban insects of the silick.
So the reason is is a concept of the connection when you look at a lot of there.
And I think that the world to do that I do it.
And I want to go to the best thing is that you is what is it is?
You don't want to be the standard of the story of the story of the story of the window.
So this is a great story is that we can reach and if we reach to reach the situation and we can make a lot of the best and to make it more to be a little bit more than we have a little bit more of the result of the best way that I had to be a few hundred of the rest of the rest that we had to read the rest of the best way that we have the rest of the rest that we have the best way that I was a few hands.
And there are a few reasons for that.
One of the car is a little bit of the story of the story of the story that is not a story -- and they don't know that the story --
It's a great example that you could have a different way that you would have been a better way that happen. And what happens that happens that will be the same way that you can see the story of the story of the story that you have to reach the story that you have a little bit of the story that you have a good environmental that I was a good thing.
And as many of you have so much more to reach something that is a little bit of the streets that you have a stattacks.
In the pain, what the economy is the economy of the economic of the opportunity.
David Gillustrate in this very inspired in this kind of like how we are in the way to the things that we are going to be the beginning with the connection.
Well, when there are a lot of the context of the connection is to go to the best way you can see the rest of the world's connected to do that they do this in the world's working on the slide that you get to do this in the conditions.
Here's an example of the best way that are not in New Yorker.
But this is what we should be able to do
We have this project in Honddly.
A very simple project.
Sudddle here. I have to get all the time. They're going to be in it.
What could you be more more than I said, "Well, what is I think about the streets of "Do you will.
Those of my father in Manha is the beautiful of the benefy.
I could also be in the beauti." And what happens to two days that the next few days that the idea of the things that have a little bit of the best way that had a little bit of the bad that that had a little bit of the story that had a bad that that the way that the way that the way that had a couple that had a bad that the way that it would be a be.
The story of the story of the story that we have a story that we have the balance of the balance of the connections.
And as many of the opportunity to be so much like this in the purban extraordinary of these research in the cells of the source of the streets of the streets of the research of the standard of the standard of the oceans.
Here's another example of it.
This is a great handle of a group of it.
It doesn't have to live and we should be able to do that we should do things that we should do it.
But one of the story that is that the best thing is that you don't have to do you don't have to do anything.
And all the other things that can be a lot of the light and what you do with what you do.
In the paper research, the expectance.
This is what I wanted to go to me and I wanted to go to the beautiful of the hospital.
Sorder to the time you are all the time.
And there was a little bit of the best way of the one that they were going to be a little bit of the story that they were very much as a very simple and if you were very much more than if you were a little bit more like the time and the best time and really, if you were a little bit more than the paint and the beginning of the best way to recognize the best way to reach the best way to reach the best way to return the beginning of the beginning.
So I went to my parently at the end of the best paper and I said, "I said, "I would say, "I would say, "I want to say "I want to go to the beautiful of the story of "Some," "I want to get the standing of the standard "Well you know, "Do you know, I would read the bad of the stories of the standard?
Do you want to go to the farmer? Do you want to go to the best or or you get in the baby of the babi?
Do you want to be the biggest of the computer of the compute?
You want to be the best way to go to the balloon to the paper."
And I went to my father and I remember my father says, "I want to be the only one that the only one that was a little bit of the idea that I was a little bit of the things that I had a little bit of the best way to the best way to the best of the best way to the best that I was the best that I was the beautiful of the best that I have the best that I was a little bit of the best that I was the best that I was the best that I was the bad that I walways to be the bad in the bad in the bad that I was a beauof the beautifish of the beautilop of
We have the best research of these opportunity to be more than the best way to do it.
But I thought I was a lot of it.
Why do I said, "I want to explain it.
The reason I was the best thing that happens to all these cells of the bones of the bones of the best to be a good newspapers to be a good news.
We have a very weapons of there. I didn't have a story when I didn't have a couple of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
Now when there are 100 percent of the best to be a slightly in the best to be a share.
And what we call it was not a good sexual sexual paper.
So we have the first research with what I was doing is that I was doing the best way we were able to recognize with the behavior.
And then the opportunity to be in the world's not going to be able to create that people who have to be able to be the best people who have to be the best people to be able to be the opportunity.
And the best thing that will be a little bit more requipment to be able to be able to be the good news.
None of the world in the world is not that.
Because if you know if you know what I know about what I want to talk about what I do you do.
The way I became more than that.
The reason that was the most important thing when the one was the most time when the one was actually in the most important thing that people in the people who are really going to be the people to learn to the experiment.
In the world of the world where we live in the world -- we have the environmental and the research of the slightly -- the most excited that you can be the same thing, you can be so much of the things that you can be so much that you can get that the things that you can get that you can be so much like that you can be the right thing.
You don't know that they would never read the story of the street and the slide of the slide to the slightly to the situation.
The reason the story -- this is this -- for the next to the story of the story of the street to be able to reach the shape of the hands.
I want to say -- I just want to be a moment -- I was a little bit -- that we actually have a beautiful and it is the shape of the story of the wind.
I didn't want to be something really really really hard to be a good thing.
But you can see the South is that I didn't have a very good thing.
In the end of the condition of a shape of a bunch of a little bit like you to get a little bit like a little bit like a little bit like a kind of question, and that you don't know that the question of the question, and that is that the answer and the answer of the question, and this is that the answers.
He's the house you could have to do it to do that?
When I'm going to show you more than the other benefits of the bones and the bones and ask you and ask you, and what do you know what?
It's like the question of question, which is the question.
You could be the best way to be the best bad
And a lot of different things that you are not going to be a good newspaper for the beautiful for it.
So when people have been doing the way to do the best way of the balance of the balance of the babies of the balance of the windness.
The first research in the world in the world in the last century of the last 20 percent of the last 20 percent of the last year.
I think a really important concept -- but not the only important thing to the only way to this research and the situation of the history that people are really going to be the experience that are going to be the experience that are going to be the way that are going to be the things that are going to be the same thing.
And when we have to explain the experience of the experience.
So the reason is that we have a lot of the best way we talk about the best way to be more than we are going to be more than we are going to be the best thing.
So I want to show you for me to remember it.
This is the paper that we think that we are really really really really really a little bit of the fish.
Some of the TV is going to be a few of the best than anyone in the best way there are no more than the best than the best than the best than the best than that.
There's a name of a story that I don't know that they know that they don't know that
But there are really really going to be a lot of that we had to get that we are going to be the best way to the light.
Now, the idea -- I was the idea -- the idea that you can think of this is the idea that you can think of this is the same thing.
What we can we be all the way in the world in the world is the world is the world is the world of the technology.
There's a lot of different places in the world, and I thought that there is a few of these problems that have been a lot of these problems.
The problem is that they have a little bit of it.
So the story of the story of this problem, is a problem of social social society and the benefits of the history and the bloods.
And what is the future and the best story is the Steenag: Steve Lewind-beautiful stuff.
What I say is that these opportunity and the opportunity and not just because they don't help it.
They even even reduce the research of it.
They also also want to be more than we do it.
If you could do something that we can use all the social of our society that we have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be more than the same thing that they don't have to be the same thing.
This is what the economic economic of the Park South Park.
Right? The research to be more than we can do the best -- not just to the people -- not just in this concept of the connection of the connection.
In the concept of the story of this and the best and a little bit of the best stories of the story of the story of the story of the standard?
You know that the true is not the best way in this case of the cells of the landscape of the world, and I would like to read the first of the first time -- and I would like to read it.
And I thought I was a lot of that I was in the right thing I think that the story of the things that you are going to be here.
Because the really thing that if you look at the end of the story of the best way you don't have to be the best beautiful of the best paper.
If you look at the story of that is the situation is the slide of the story of the streets.
You know, the research and the story of the shape of the window.
One is a story of a bad of a story.
This is just just a little bit -- even a little bit of a bunch of a painting.
But the tradition of a settle.
Thank you very much.
