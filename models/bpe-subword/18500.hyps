This is the rest of the rest of the water of the water of the water
And so I represents, they are serious things.
The global research on a creation of a creation of the incenter of the incenter of the incentiss.
And the faster on the global reapproach, they were created with a rates and the flight and the funny and the funny of the precedented and the precedented of the precedented and the receptable of the receight.

And the process was building more fabrical.
But we are going to see a change change.
Here's the last one that are the last last years, with alternative alternative propects.
Everyone is a journal policy in our body.
And the industrial industrial and the wilifest, and the wild of a million dollars in the last year of a million dollars in the last year of the mathematical common the last year of the money of the fish.

This image the image of something.
In the previous of the Cracia, in Tennessed, a billion galogorithms was the prison was was the prisoned by the network.
You probably have the stories of the stird of the stird of the stird of the stird.
This is the first one of the car in the first year in the Sintarget, the Sintamed Cracia.
One of the industries of the bottom, as the Great Cracia, was this one, was this one.
Video: Yeah, the Great the bottom, is a super-four and the window.
He is the abunderestaura, and helping the ground economic growth economic standard economic standary.
The Frostom, the cost of the book, which is that in the room what's going to be aware of the pleasure of what it was the currently affected to the rostom.
He is access and adorably and adorange and workers and working on the shares of the source of the same.
Al Gore: This is the prisoners in Virginia.
The best ones on the largest of Massland of Mass-Covy Covy Coal.
Video: I mean, I want to be closer to be closer to be closer Selosophy, Harry Reibout of Reijay Reijay Reielos.
Al Gore: So the Alian Alian Climb for the two limator for the two laptops.
This is one of them on one of the one of them.
Video: The track COOLergy new archairs of the archair for a very serious intargets very serious for our own hands.
And our first story is the first car is to chargument a large spending a big shares for the public of the public and we have been able to art our own books to argue the ars.
The fact is that the botom, in fact, the bottom.
We think it's like this is -- and we move and wood and good.
So it will not come for changing for changing the changes for change.
This is our hands.
Video: The challenge, you heard a massive paper to him.
So let's do a test of this paper for this machine instalant instalance.
Hual! Minary is crazy.
But this is the sound technology of the bottom.
And as good as good as good as well-based is one of the global remarkable of the remarkable of the networks that you see here is changing the news.
The next one is a technology of the attention of the bottle.
Al Gore: In the sfarmers is the story of the story of the source of the national economics and with the problems.
Video: Nator: Nator: The economy is the national economy, the national nationaly, which is the national climate climate climate climate climate climate climate climate the city of the ninicity.
The prison that they live all the way that we live on the left of the bottled on the body's murdependent on the street of the streets.
But now we have a new solution to the inden to the independent to the innovation.
RS energy in American electricity with electricity in 10 years ago in 10 years ago.
A couple of home in America, and then the region us and then to help the stopping of the stopping of global incomputer intension.
In the squarter, a solution that is a big solution to make us resolve problems.
RS energy America. You know, I mean, you know, I mean,
The Gore: This is the last is the last one.
Video: Nois: It's about region region the region the American economy.
One of the faster to get the faster to independent on the dependent of the fuels of murdepends on the Barbon is here -- the Sibridge is the reenergy is the resistance.
Barbed nr.2: We are investing to create the well.
Narrator: Reenergy for actists for active.
Al Gore: There's a vecosystem to be the front of the front of the broken you walk your only fish."
If you want to get the depart, you go on the well.
We need to get the depart, we have to repeated.
Thank you very much.
The next next to TED. I had a choices to LH.
And I was to replace and I wanted to give a little bit of the water and a little bit of the water of the water of the water of this work.
So the second ondly. And for those who had no matter the largest experiment that was the biggest stinition that was the biggest of the standard of 27 kilometers -- Cirirird Street or is recreating a million dollars to a million dollars -- the second level of a billion dollars --
It's extremely release.
This is the apart of the Geneen.
We put the photograph of these minds "Bangle" in the interior in the interior in the decision.
I work at this year. It's called the ATLALS -- Lake TALAs -- Lucgon a 22 meters a photography of a photograph of the detector can get here to the top of the challenge.
On the year of the year of the year of the first time for the first time for the first time.
And this image was download.
He heard a car car was a control of the control of the control of it.
It's a image of the first picture of the particular particularly that computer has the ended of the game of the system that the LH, the No one of the LHS determined in the HNA.
In other words, when I was a teacher when I was standing of 10 several paper to the work, which is a successful work, which is a successful thing.
I don't know whether he was the most best of the most best or whatever it was the best and when he was swelling the first time and the first time and the first time of the first time it was a way to the first way.
The meaning that I had a cultural impact of the impact of the impact of the street.
After about a sappeared a saptarget, which was a problem was a problem of the paper -- these physical farmer.
The machine of the men of men as a machine when the word workers working on the power of the power of the power of the machine.
Now, the ineventually of the safety and says, "I can't transsport the attention of American American message."
But I can do this for that when they're in the temperatures that are the square the square the square the super-suaffected super-suaffected performance.
So as 27, 27, the farmer, and I think of the space of the space of the story, those are the mouth.
At one of the cost of the 9,000 of the 9,000 defect in LH, was a fabricatic define of fabrication.
So the computer was a little bit of a little bit, and those 13 men and those 13 days have intended electrical resility.
This was the result.
This is more impressing that those region you as you can get over 20 tons, and they were 30 deploted 30 degrees of what we do.
So I was deteriorists about 50 percent.
We had to get affair, what we were doing.
I recontent on on the top of the top of the tool.
And now we now get the challenge.
The line of the squarters of the LHC will be like us.
We're going to go to the new top, and we are going to get out of the hundred or we will go to the research to the research to the hundred of the universe that are the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe is going to be the top of the new tops of the new top of the new top of the new ones of the new top of the new top,
Now, of course, as a way of region the way of region recognize and the intense of the streets of the street and the intense of the extremely reject.
I think of the point of the fact that is that the attack of the fact that we have to have a good thing, this is important important to you like LH.
You will be the best of the words of the words of a street British Davy, I think I think I think I think I think I think about the conjators of the Michael Faray, "No, I said, "No, I said, "No, I don't mean the mind of our minds of the mind of our minds are not the enough to be the minister to our mind and the best states are not far to our mind us that our minister and the beauty of our beauty as of the beauty of the words are that are that are not the beautifish of our beautils of our beautifises are not the beautiling of our beautiful st-top of our of us of the balans, as of the bals,
Thank you.
I walk with running with running to remember the kidney to me.
The measure what you can go to the sample, and to get them and to get them and to get them and to reach them how to despite how to reach and the resolution and the problem and manipulate the issues of the issues.
The space is the space is the profound is a big part of the world of how we can understand the world conductor of the world conductent.
So we can get the research and IT researchers and the interaction of our interaction with our objects -- impressing a consultance, and my collaboratory -- I was independent on my laboratory -- I would be used to use a computer, and I would use a computer programmed by a little bit of process that would be used to be a little bit of project, and we can use a mouse and the process of a machine and the procells of the mought of the machines of the mouth, and we can we be a mosquality of the retyoung and the mysteasurface of the baway, and the beneffortabling of the men of the myp, we can be pertisiling of the baling of the men way of the mittern of the mellow of the meld of the mospher
Do we want to think of how we want to us.
The question was the asked to the fashion the research to research the research to build Sift Siftable.
On Sift-Sift-by-bis-bish.
They can be manufacturing the research on the research can perceive the other one, and they have a ran and a ran and a ran and a ran and a ran and a relationships.
The most important is that I'm palping is the palong as you can just square you can just square you can just get the water and shares that just the water and shares that just wanted to be the water and shares of the best important thing is that just away from the most important important important is that the most important important important important important is that the important important important important important is that the important important important important important is that I'm a stalarm is that the most important important important important important important important important important important important important important important important important important important important important is is that I'm palones are the important important important important important important important important important important important important important important important important important important important thing that I'm the press you is that I'm shappialities, so important important important is that I'm shaps are the important important important important important important important important important important important important important important important important important important important thing is that there is that there is that I'm enough important important important important important important important important important important important important important important important important important
And Sife example of an ecosystem to a new instruments of the digital restrict of digital information.
The measure that these instruments becomes more constantly constants of the case of the cells of the cells of the cells of our neighbors and conditions, we can innovative and research and research and researchers and research and research and research and requips of the measure of interactions.
You start with some examples of a couple of examples.
This is the Sift is confidence of video of video games of a incline, if you have a direction, if you were able to include the car to the other car to the other car to the other cyces.
These are constants are constantly constants of one of the cell.
So, if you put them on a language, it becomes a language.
If they're inconnected to this, and I can become intense and it becomes a confusion.
They can feel the prison and incline.
We realized that one of the implications of interactions is that we can use gestablished the gestablished to manipulate a culture of how we would have a culture of how we would have a culture of a liquid rich.
In this case, we have three Sift Sift that galaxies like the galaxy and can use them to hear the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of this standary.
If I was too much, we can get out of the car and the types.
There are also interestings for education for education, like the mythmmen and the mythmen and loggical and logical logical and the rest of the possibility of the results of the results of the results of the results of the results of the results of the results of the results are trained to see the results of the possibility
So here I have a Fibonacy of a Fibond-effectively programs.
Here's a games of the words of combination of combination and Bogger and Bogger and Bogger and Bogger.
At every single standard a garden, and the region every Sift of the Siftable, and the measure of the measure of the hundred of a bunch of the hundreds of hundreds of well.
Then I sat at at the point of reset of reset to a new set of the test of the next solution and new possible.
Thank you.
These are the nists of the trees that have been in the Media, and I was to remember the Media, and I had to get a material to the conditional material.
They love to love to the neighbors.
And one of the aspects of this kind of applates is that I don't need to give them a lot of instructions.
All right, "For is "For the She said, "You know, what I do.
Here's some other people are incatic to the cancer.
This is the most stering sterm in our rights in the right right her.
It seems like everything that was to do was was to do was was to put a Siftable.
So for he was just the works.
This is a apply involved in the animature.
We wanted to build a instrument for those who instrument language.
And this is Felix.
He can get new personal personal personal character, just the Sift of the Sifables that the Sifables that the personal of the personal character.
Here's this software the sound.
Video: You know, I mean,
David Merry in the room in the room in the room.
Video: Tracier.
Good goo! Yeah.
Misland Siftable, and the asseting and assessing to the interaction of the interactionary -- Video: Hell.
DM: Mcreating the narratic narratic narratic region.
Video: Bunkay?
DM: It's a story story, and he decided to recognize how it will be fascinating.
Video: The pissue of the pish.
DM: The next example I showed you to look at the point is a instrument and interpretated and the interpretated and the interpretation that I built the Sife of the Sifables that we were able to roll the rolling and and well.
The one one is four various various various of choices that you want to use it.
And you can inject the island of a successful works that you can ask the guy that you can do it.
You can stop the sound of the Sift Sift Sift Sift Sift-source success.
There are the effects that you can control the reduction of the reduction and the movie.
Imagine a certain a certain the inclinics for affected to the air.
The tradition of the level of the previous and the volume of the second streets of the second streets of the second story.
Video: You know, I think of a rit-rit-rit-rit-slipps, we have a little bit of success, we have been in a series, we have been a serious seriously excited to love the bite.
Now a little bit of a region
Video: Yeah, I love the person I have a little person of the period of time.
Video: And I will add it on the bottom of the philosophy, to control the rest of the connection of the connection.
Video: You can M: You can you include the inclining of the incline, or in a part of the include or in a part of the park.
Video: Yeah, I will come to the far for more expression.
Video: You can read the second ret of the second time in the case of the case of the case of the case of the chair.
So I don't have to do the planet, I can improvise, I can improvisible or the window or or the window.
Now, in the sleep, I can get the page, I can get the Sift Sift Sift Sift the volunteers.
Thank you.
As my favorite is the brain is creating new interfaces that the rest of us that the way that works with the way that works with the brain and the body.
And today, I had a time to show you a school, and the space of design, and the car of designers who are going to get out of the possibilities that we have to put out of the laboratory.
The one that I was the region is that we are like we're at the granita generator of the range of the instruments of the men digital digital research in our world's digital reward and our resistance of our world are going to our removement.
Thank you very much.
Astep, I would just have to talk to you with you to.
I'm a well.
He wrote is the teach, but I mean, and of course, and it's a lot of attack.
It's all my mother and my mother's fascinating.
And I don't mean this is what it down.
But this is the physics, something like the husband in the middle of my body, and my body, who was my father, who was my father's remother with my father.
And the thing is that I wrote this book was written this book the "Manco Rool, Roy-Island, Rool, the death of the horrible for my own personal horizonest because of my father and it became a reason that the way to be the reason that was the important thing that was important to be the important thing that methaningful stattack of the streets of the internal thing.
The truth is that the origin now, people are working on the condamn of the condamn condamn condamn condamn condamn condam
Serious -- I wrote -- I wrow.
Since for example, and I say, "You don't have the hunger is the horrible is the horrible is the perform of the perform of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of the form of the form of examples of the example of examples of the conditions.
You don't have the stream, you will go to the fish of the flight of the flight of the best way to the hundred of the world that would come out of this world that would be able to hear this world that would come out of this time?"
It's very linked the land of the land of it.
But it would be more running out of the remind I don't have the track of the time when I was inceived to the myself when I was a little bit of people -- I was going to become the same way I was a fishing kind of reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive reaction of reactive reaction of reactive reactive reactive require as well.
And people said, "Not you don't know that you never have no longer in the success of the success?"
I don't want to me. I don't have the best ideas?
You don't have the front of the mind of the vision of the vision of the phenomenage and not anything to deal with a map of the hundred of the hunger of the named of the network?"
Don't gone that this gene.
The region -- the racier on the room is "Yeah, I said, "Yeah, I me."
Yes, you know, it's all the things of all of those things.
And always I always stop.
And the impact is the mosquito that people who don't get them to mean people who can't get them and I can get them and I can get them and I can get them and I can get them and I can get them and I can get them and improve things that you can get them to the top of the things is the challenges is the training is the improve is the training is the challenges is the testing is a testagering of the mosphere is the trage.
As the big example of algorithms, and other things that are infrastructure.
But when it's talking about the word at the word at the point and I was the last question of the last thing I was "Why?"
Is it something rational ration?
It's the broke that somebody to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it as they were very well to do it was so pretty much as the Pame.
And what is the specific initiatively requires as a nelinists of the nelinists of the satisfy of the teachers don't do a kind of way that other teachers don't do a kind of way that other people don't do a way that other teachers don't do a kind of driver?
My hattan, for example, was not improvement and not improve in the money to the money inches of the inery of the inery of the inery of the inchemistry is not a hero to be a hundred of the incher inch.
It didn't get -- John, John, how do you go to the block of the chemistry?
It doesn't just get it out of something like this.
But we are the inching of the inchers of the couple of the funded of the second long removing to be able to be able to be the alcools of the region of the oili-depression.
We have a rewriters of insects, and we have no writors, but not only the artists of all of these things that have been able to be the power to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the power to be able to be able to be able to be able to challenge.
And all of us is to look at the number of region the room recognized 20, in the second second the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mass of the machines of the process of the cost of the prison the process of the promise.
And even the same same same mystic work, they would be truth, it would be truth,
Norman Mail, even though the past of murdemic in the last stream said, "One of my bottled a little bit more of my bott."
A challenge is the extraordinary of the mountains.
But I don't have when we hear when we hear that we have hearing this guys, because we heard these things that we heard these things that we heard these things that we have heard of things and the idea of the idea of creative idea, and the idea of the idea of the idea of a bunch of a beautiful, the infinite of a bad of the mosquality of a massive comes to a little bit of the top of a bunch of a barrier.
And the question I want to add this is today today is you know, you all the paper with this idea of you with this idea of the ideas of this ide?
You are comfortable to -- because of the eye of the eye of the eye of the eye -- I don't mean the hand -- I don't mean this photography.
I think it's odiodiodiodiodiodiores.
And I think it's a periphery and not to see the person in the future.
I think it's better if we involved in the big artists to truly the artists to truly the challenge.
And I know that I was a little bit of my handy -- in my handy -- it would be very perform to me to me to me to me to me the botttom, special test, special test, special test, which I think I know that I know that I think I know that I know in which I think is now a teach.
As you know, I'm pretty example, I just just a half of 40 years.
I have probably four decisions.
And it's very probably what I'm going to write the time to be judged to be judgment as as the mountain the money of my father, the successful stret?
What would you be a funny of a funny, because of the people here are the best of my friends -- it's very simple to be the largest successful work.
Oh, no, Good no, which is now!
This is the gene of the game that could do somebody who could do somebody to get to the horize of the young in the young of the person.
I think it was going to do this message that I love that a lot.
And then the question becomes the question of the question:
And so I put it on a little bit of a resident of my mind, as to work now, to work now, to go through the wish is a kind of building a way that is building a kind of building that building a kind of building that building a way that we build a way to build a clever?
I must be a way to get a way to the purpose of a parent of a fantastic death of my mind, and my team is the natural handling of what the nature, and the natureactive to what it would be able to write what the works.
And as I was in the last year in this sense of the sense of the sense of the time I was going to get to get other society if we were able to see other society if we could be able to see people who would be better and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more excitizens to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the opposition of the emotional handling of the emotional hands.
The Cercer was in Great in Great and Romantic and Romantic and Romantic and Romantic Romantic Greomantic Greomantic Greomantic Greomantic Greomantic Romantic Cerystertanism was the answer to this research this was the researching this standartor this was the answer to this was my researching to me in Great me this hand and to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to my Gretrack it out my Greetr
So the urpose, you know, the car accident.
But at the Great Greene and Romoie and Romowish didn't think people have no creativity of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interior of the Greenokkkkkinds of Greenness, but in the time in Great Greending Greennigh, but in Greenge Great Great Great the Great Great the Greenniantic Greenthants and Romotic Greennet
People thought that creativity was a spirit of the attack of people who can get the way from a prison a prison and understanding of the neighborhood, and needed to the neighborhoods and understanding of the streets.
The number called these spiracy creativity creativity of creativity "demone."
The Social was the research for a demand that has a square the slipping of the same.
The Romands were the same psychologist, but they call the attention, the genius creatively genually genius of the genius genius of the genius of the genius of the genius of the history.
What is the one, because of the romantic that I didn't think a genius was a genius was a genius was a very quickly genius fy of the genius of the genius of the hands.
I think a genius was a genius of the genius of the deep of the message of the artist, the horrible of the artist, who are the kind of a house of the house of the slightly the insector and the insects of the works.
The remarkable street -- this is the tradition that is building -- that we were going to protect the protection that we were able to protect the results of the results of the works.
And everybody in the world of work?
So the artistic was protected by the way, as a certain too much like for example, what do we do?
If you were the stralley, you don't have the street you can get all the way to hear the street the street of the street that the genius that helped me that the genius that help.
If the word was the criticized was the completely unfortunately, right?
The world of the genius of the genius was the northerapist.
So they have been looking at the West creative time.
And then came out of Rena and the point and the reattack of the idea of the mammmmake, the idea of the mammmysteries and the universe and the universe and the windoor and the windoor and the region that I would have the first time to create the first ones that I would have the first divillage to the type.
It was the human rational research and people have incepting the creative of the creative of the invention of the interior of the interior of the individual of the individual of the individual of the individual of the innovation.
And for the first one in the history of people have before the story, or the other, or the other of artists of artists of artists of the genius of the genius of the genius of the genius of the genius of the genius of the first genue.
And you need to be a great challenge, I think that was a massive of the massive challenge.
Permity-based on a simple person, to create the receptable of a sense of the receptable and the surface and the source and the surface and the surprise, receive the responsible "exactly a lot of responsible fuel.
It's like you to get the couple of hitchititecture to the sound.
I just just to get the incottomorrow and gene the gene of all these today and the gene of all these tools of these tools.
I think this has been able to show the artists of the last 500 years.
And if you think it's true, and I think that I think is, what do we do is we do it alone: what do we do is we do it?
Can we do things things different?
Maybe we can get the sense of the sense of the brain and the mysteries and the mysteries and the mysteries.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can just get to the stery of the humanity of digital region from a hundred years of a half of a 18 minutes.
And you probably like the public in the public of the question that the question of the question of the streets of the streets of the team of the mysteries of the labor all the people of their own spends.
It will not be that I will not have all the coopters.
But the question I want to give you a per painting?
Why don't we think of this is what we do?
Because it is a sense of as any other time, what happened to explain what the case of the prison the prison creative process of creative design.
The process that somebody who was going to create something -- the extractive -- the street is the behavior is not always to behavioral research.
And in fact, sometimes can see, sometimes the far.
I had a little bit of the types where I knew that I knew mythern Mana Stone, which is now in the Ruth Stone, which was the story, and that was storing to me and the storyle of the story, and the best way to work out of the word and it was a simple and a simple and a simple and a simple and a similar to work on the room and it was a little stage.
The story, it was like a village of the tunny of the air.
And it turns out the roads.
It feels like the wind, because you have a purpose.
In that moment that has a single thing that has done one one and say, "You know, I read the approach, "You know,
And the algin to the middle of the housing of the hemistry of the idea of the idea of the idea of the map of the map of the map of the map of the horrific and when the window and to get to a hundred of the massive to a hundred of the massive to a hundred of the war and to get a little bit of the water and the war from a little same.
Sometimes was the survival faster and alergy and alergy and algoritha, but not the poem, and the poems and the poems of the root and the poems of the root and the poems of the room and the story of the root of "One lappeare."
They were and they were going to be looking at this point I will never forget -- I will never forget to the story.
One house the map of the map and the poems and the poems and the poem, and the story of the exact of the exact of the exact of the other way to the other.
The first step of the cool and then I get the past and then in the middle of the massive of the massive of the massive the massive to the massive of the massive to the first person of the first time of the first time of the first step of the first step of the first step of the first stem cost of the poems of the poems of the poems of the poems of the cool of the cool of the cookindn
And so in the situation, the paper and intack and intactical and intack at the first time at the first time at the first time at the first time of the first time at the first time of the first time of the first time of the first time of the first situation.
When I heard -- it's the surprising was exactly how the workers working on my own creative process creatively creatively creatively creatively remotion.
My creative creatively creatively not to leave this -- I'm not conducting?
They're a way that I worked on the way to go to the next day at the same time, and to get the same way to get the same way to get the stage.
But even though it was in my indness to me just like I was attention to be the awareness of that fen.
And I just imagine that they were and many of you were and many of you were a lot of you.
and I had projects or ideas that I was the idea of a surprising of a sure of the handle of the hands.
And what do you have this guy?
And how do we have to recognize us to get us to the point of us don't lose to the point of the windows, and we are to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to releas?
For example, for example, the most relevant of our days, which we have been making the Maitahi Waite, I took a few years ago to a few years ago to revide a couple of years ago.
I was about the surface of this was almost all of the vision of the vision of the contemporary contemporary contemporary contemporary to control the contemporary of the connection of the immunization of the immunization of the inner interior of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interibbest internal stress.
The time of the language, and the impact of the story of a day conduct of a day in the autop of Los Angeles and then everybody has changed the change.
At the time in a fragment, from a frager of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the mind of the mind of the mind of the samples of the space, but it is not as a splending, but it is not as a name is to be like to be like to be like to independent on the water is not as well.
It doesn't have no photography, it doesn't have no report.
The research on that the veck of the vecologist "I want to put the street in the interior for the traditional moment, and the cancer.
I'm not suffering the good news."
And instead of a little bit of a little bit of recognized.
He recognized the process and make something with something with this new and do something with everything.
He requires the question of the question and said, "Science I don't see that I'm going to be the volunteer?"
"You have a cancer that I can hear a cancer cancer is a cancer cancer is a cance?
If you want to be truth, you know, when you get out of a moment point when you get to the hundred time.
If you don't know, if you walk and walk out of the elders.
You can go and look at Leonard Leonard Cohen."
The research of the creative creative creative change.
Not the surface of the slipped to be as intunately as intack.
But the process of the aggressive to the aggressive in the moment, he was the point that he saw it was the game of what he says, and he was just asked to the humans and he had to get the art and then he had to be something to be something to be something to be something to be something that I don't have to be something to be something to be something that has to be something to be something that I don't have to be something to be something to be something to be the interior of the interior of the interior of the interide and the interior of the interidddridge of the interior of the interior of the interipl
It could be this collaboration and the bridge and bize the conversation of a conversation of a conversation that we don't really look at the exterior the exterior that was not like Tom.
After I heard the story of the story of the way I was working a little bit of the way I was working on my father was a little bit of a time.
This is going to return out to my remother in the romancy "Manca, Royal Roago -- and I said, "Manca, and I have a kind of like that we don't have a kind of way that we don't have a little bit of what they don't have to think of something that I don't have a little bit of the window that they don't have a best deep commitment to be a little bit of the botttom.
Not just the rest of the bottom.
I was to think of that I should have a little bit.
And I was remember the space on the space and I was talking to the space and I was remember and I was swell.
I was the ridicated to the window and I admitted and I admit of a collect called the challenges of a narrange camp.
I said, "Astank: "Alot," and I stand and I stand I stop it is not just the extraordinary is not just the convention, right?
Because you can see that I was a painting to a bunch of the window and more attentioned to be not easy.
So if you want to be better attack, you have to do the water and you want to get the botttom.
Okay. And if you don't want to do that, you know, the stream.
Something to write for me to write messe.
And I want to consequences like me to my father."
Because -- the conclusion is, I was conclusion in the hundreds of years ago to North Africans are going to be able to reach months and requires and the music and the music and the music and the long-term rought.
And they were always to remember the mind of the teachers were remarkable to remarks?
But sometimes, so that something that is intame, and one of the interpret of the interpret of communication.
I'm convinced you all all of you all the time, because everybody else all the way to a certain a certain a certain a certain a certain a certain a certain a certain a certain a certain the interpretation.
It's like the time and the open-source is the satellite is the way you don't do anything, you don't do anything, you don't do anything, the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other hundreds of series of the hundreds of serving behind the window of the time.
In a time that it doesn't seem to be in intuition of the wide.
It's the world of the world and the world's best and the window is the divinced of the divinced of divinced the divince.
As you want to get people in the people when they were in the people who were the named people who were called the named named name.
They have the impresses and incept and the "Allama "Allam, Allam, Doam, Doam, Doam, Doam, Doamam, Goam, Goame."
It's God.
A year of history -- when the history -- when they have the Spanded up with this kind of Spanish the Spanded with this object, and the "Allam, Allam, "Bloah, Allam, "ole" in "ol,"
and and it turns out of the purban and square and square the source of the source of the source of the source of the source of the source of the source of the source and and they hear and and and and and and and and and and they hear and and and they hear and and and and they hear and and and and and they hear the samples of the time.
In Spain, when a represent interpret and the mythmist, "Allam, the Bolh, Allam, the Gola, the Foundation of the physical argument."
The neighbors -- a farmer.
It's mining to us that we need something we need something like this.
But the one of the second of the heart of the heart of the heart of the insector the window is and discovery, very high school and not a best and not a best and not a list of Diff.
It's a murited murited and that you could never get the challenges and they could never get to the point and they could never get the way to be along the way to be able to be always to be along the time.
Could you be no one one of the case of the car that the number when he call it was to do what they should do with the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the nobody could do anything?
It's hard.
It's one of the most receptors of the creative creative creative creatively remaintains.
But maybe it would not be a big attack of the inceive from the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary of the front of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interior can not be an interesting interest.
Maybe if you just have been able to just as well as a surprising surprising for a couple of time for a couple of time for the next time to be death, when they were going to be death, when they were inner inner when they were inspired to be the inner of the inner of the inner if you get the inner if you get the inside of you have a little such if you have been really, if
If we think of us today we get the way to change the way to change it.
I was began to think of the point and I was thinking about the last months of the last thing that would be public in the middle of the bottom, a little bit of the successful and infrastructure, and the infrastructures and my father's success.
And what I was doing, I repeated when you get the point is you would be amazing the issue.
You don't have the spends. You know, I just want to be the content to be the story, you would be the one, you would be here.
If you are the region you and then such a region.
If the genius of the genide and excentral and excellent decisions to shape their own sense to a clipping with a clipping through the equiets of the team of the streets of the streets of the hands, "Ocle"
And if you don't know, if you walk out of the horrible.
And I said, "Ole." And I said, "Ole."
I think of these things and I think should be able to prepared to reach them to prevent them to prevent it.
"Oley." "Ole" for you to have a room for you to have a room and the capacity to the project and incenter to the projects.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just Cohen: Ole!
I have been talking about some of these design, about genome, and what he could represent to represent new discovering new genes.
Now in fact, in fact, in a new point of a new point of biology, and now we now try to get to the top of this cognize of this cognized by the way, and the way to make the form of life and the form of life and the form of life and the form of life and the form of life.
We tried all the important questions to ask us questions.
"What is the life is that I think many biologist?"
I tried different approach, simply to the component of the component of the component of the massive component to the resones.
We dealing the already of about 20 years.
When I got the genomome, this was the genomic of the world's analogy of the world's digital world.
So we try to ask it to ask the regenetic and we can create new form of life in this universe, and we can create new big,
This is the map of a little girl, Mycooking gene that has the most gene that the most gene that can reply the only one that can reply the only one that can replify the only one species.
We tried to see if we can see if we can get a gene genomes and smaller and smaller genomes and smaller genomes and smaller genomes and smaller genomes and the smaller genomes we tried to see if we tried to see if we were trying to see if we tried to see if we tried to see if we truly and we tried to see if we we tried to
We were able to suddenly the first gene of a hundred of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of a massive metabolic is pretty easy.
And this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can sure the first time that we can get a little bit of a moment that is a little bit of the cell.
So we decided that we had to test is that we are going to be able to teach this cromossing this chair, so we can see the component to the most questions to the most assesses of the most questions of the most questions of the most questions of the most questions of the most questions of the most of the only way we decided that we decides we were decided to be the
And so I started the room "Can we can interested in a cross?"
Maybe the chimps of these molecules that I didn't have been very large that I didn't have been doing a lot of the molecules that I didn't have been doing this thing?
And if you can activious?
A cycle is just a little bit of the chemistry of the chemical chemical material of the chemical chemical material chemical material chemicalistic chemomosomosomomosomososomosomosomosomosomosomosomomosomomosomomosomosomosomomomososomosomomosomomomoso cromosomos
So, our speech of digitize the ritize of life.
Our research to write code the genetic code that is a little beginning.
The next time I got a exponential approach.
I started this talking about 15 years.
I went through a couple of hundred image of a bio-fishing images before the first time to do the first time of the first experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult DNA is very difficult is very difficult to the window.
They're a message of machines that are doing a little bit of a thousand moke for a 30 to 50 to 50 to 50 miles of DN, but it's a respect of the degeneration of the degeneration of the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the mechanics are building a best deeply of machines of thousands of thousands of thousands
So we had to create a new way to make these little square these little little bites and releasing all the way and schools.
This was our first standing of the tant, the digital information to the digital information to the genome.
It's a virus that virus is a virtual genuine.
We did design design, I went through the school, I went through the school, and I was just a molecular DNA 5,000 genes of DNA 5,000 genetics.
The interesting point when I was a little bit of the stuff that I was a little chemistry, and I went to the bacteria to read this covered genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic virtual and product that the viruses of the viruses of the virus.
The viral virtual virus was then in the eliberattacks and they were able to go and have the cells of the cells of English home.
I was the best industrial industrial industrial and the day's handle and the day.
They have a lot more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software the maybe maybe maybe maybe it can build in a system in a system that is in a system that is in a biological system system.
But we wanted to do something more bigger than that.
We wanted to build the cromossing the cross-term cells.
This is about 50,000 guns cooking genetics.
So I said, we have the painting of the cycle of the men and the virus of the virus to the cost of the men to understand the car cells of a cells of a cell-cell-cells of a physical cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the physical told us to put the cells.
The region is critically, and if you start with information of the digital information has to be very exciting.
When I was the first sequence in 1995, the standard of the precious handling at 10,000 per per paintings of the window of the window of the windows of the windows of the window of the first sequences of the first sequenced to the first sequenced of the first sequenced of the first sequenced of the first sequenced of the first sequenced
I found in the resources of the rest resources of the second story. If we were used the second story.
The design is designing is projects that has been projects that has been to get the top of the country, which you have been to build the other countries to build the subjects to build the best way we need to design the competition with the other side of the task with the other.
We projects of the elements of it.
You can read "We put "Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhydrogen to this physical code in the gestablished the garden.
Trigs from those characters -- those are about 20 amount of 40 men to the only second ret of attention every car crowdness.
So we can use the genetic genetic code to write the potential to write a sense of thinking.
The next thing I did was to hold me that we were to hear the cody.
Some of them were not already to be the poetry is steep.
We designed those little little bites so that we can dignosed with enzyme.
They're the ending, and you have a little and you would have a little bit of it.
So we started to do the bad with the bad five to 7,000 garden, the right way to do with 24,000 garden, and then then we can do the ethick of this physical sets of these kinds of the lawyer in this room of the 20.
At every every step in these little bag and we can come up to the sequence and we can come up with a process of a process of a machine -- as you see a mind.
We are trying to get to the point that point of automatic automatic automatic automatic automatic automatiatic point.
So, this shows that a region the disease.
When we get a little bit of the samples, over 100,000 per paintings of the speech, not more creating in English English.
They are all of all of the biology of the molecular modern.
So we went to other mechanisms.
We knew that there is a mechanism called the reward reward to return to return to return to return to the DNA DNA bunch of the best of the bad things.
This is a example of example.
There is a Geinognamed Deinism that can track the radiognosed millions of range roughly recognized by the radiodiation.
As you see in the case of the sample of swings is distract.
12 to 24 hours later, he put it in our new long-term line line to the incer of how was the incepting.
We have a little bit of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be recognized.
I can live in the vision of it.
I am absolutely that life can be in the space of the extratisful, to find a new way to find a new environmental environmental environment.
In fact, NASA shows that this is dark there.
Here's a little bit of a little molecules that we built these process process process to mechanisms with mechanisms of design manages that we have a little bit of design design.
Drodio they put them together.
This is not a little image of a little bit of a little bits, but just a little bit.
It's a molecules of molecules, we can see a little little microscope with a microscover.
These are the images of the collective times of a sixth of six-seconds.
This is a public public and I was a little time I was a little bit of time.
These are over 50,000 guns cooking genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic code the chetic.
It's the biggest molecular structures with a structure of a structure of a structure of a structure.
It has a molecules over 300 million in 300 million miles of the millions.
If we have a funny of a funny and a space and a space of pages to remember this code genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic code this cool costic cost.
So, how do we go to a cry? How do you get active?
Eident, with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated with the bacteria.
You also also also feel more easy when you get to the note: you can just get to the nucle: you can just get the nuclear and it's something that everybody else -- the clone.
The game of the archair, the cross-interested in the cell, but I showed that we can do a common a completely transplant to a cell, and we can get a cell-cell-cell, and we can get to the same way to be able to act.
I have a crowing from one of the microbial species of a species of microbial species of microbial microbial microbial diseases.
These are about the second is about as many of the way people and the machines and the machine.
I added a couple of genes that we can get to the cromossed for this cromory.
I digted with enzymmous and reaching all the proteins.
And it was pretty much when I put it in the cells -- you will applies -- you will be very sophisticated -- and the cromossed in the cells of the cell.
In fact, we thought this is how this is how we can we go out of the project of something more depart.
This is a mechanism of evolution.
We are all the way of the species that have a second version of the cycle of the cromossed of the cycle, or a new species, the other species, the species of new books in a seconds.
So the people who think of the evolution of evolution that one gene is changing a moment moment to a lot of biology.
I'm the enzy of restrict of restrict, which is dignose.
The Cromosomity that was in the cell.
The car -- the cromosis that I put new --
It was expressed and recognized the other cycloser to the target, and so I found that the cell-cell-cell-cell.
It became the garden, that I put the genomosphere.
And after a very bad period of time, all the bottomororists have been conversations of a species of a species of species in a new species that I put on the ground, and the networks.
All the proteins were changed the membranes -- when we have been changed the genetic code the genetic genetic what we could transfer the genetic what we have transferred to the exact of what we have transferred to the future.
This can be like the garden, but we can also be a physical muture, and we can change the DN, to change things things things that we are changing the things things things that we are very quite things like this.
Now, I had been able to build that is not genetic -- but to build a half of the evolution of years and half of the evolution of evolution; and we have a new way that we can have a new specific resident to explode the new way of creating a new species of the message of the massive of the mouth.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty good at the point of the point of the point of the needs of needs of needed to be needed to be needed to be the needs of the needs of point of the point is pretty good at the point is pretty good at the point is pretty so.
We are the cost of the six and half of the millions of people in the new 30 years.
As a context for me to me in 1946.
Now I'm three people on the planet for every every one of the 1946, in 40 years, they will be four years of years old.
We have the problem is the characters of the potable, the medical clipping and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billions.
It will be a divide for us.
We are over five billion of the bottom of the bottom, more than 30 billion barrier of males.
This means a millions of barily day.
When we try to think of the biological process to every challenge, and every single process to be a check process that makes a challenge.
Then of course, it's all the CO2 in this particular material, which is the atmosphere.
Now, in our discovering discoveries of the world, we have a little bit of genes, and I love to think of the gene, and I love to think about the design of design.
The electronics has just a square just a square a component of the component that was the diversity of the diversity of this home.
We are the limited here, in the first time of a biological reality and imagine and imagine and our images.
We now have now been now because of these types of the samples of the genimic chemicalistic genemicalistic genemicalistic genome.
We have a big solution to build a big robot that to do a million cynose.
When you think about these 20 million genes of genes that are different genes of genes or to optimize the choices to produce the region the region or a little bit of a molecules of the molecules of the last 20 years of the country of scientists of the windows of the neighbors.
And this is just the standard standard standard standard.
We can see for the substanti-chemical products, or of the substanti-ssuper-committed computers,
This is a capable of proper and a square of design that we can work and think of how we can do these things that we can do these species in these species in these species in the computers in the computer.
You don't know how we look at how it would show you how it would show you how it would show you the show.
We know how they look at the genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetics.
Now we now are now concentrated by four generations.
You see, you saw that from the humans is just a lot of science is just a require require news.
We have the generation of the generation of the second generation that will appearing and the third of the amazing beautiful balance, or the beautiful or different kinds of butility or different kinds of butter.
But the only way we think biology can have a lot of larger than the one that is creating a lot more costs and the funny of the limited with the CO2 as the CO2 men to the first time to project the first general for the projection of the reward of the general economic levels of the general economy.
The Both and CO2 is a year -- but in our humans are all around the world's world's all the way we have all all the other things.
This is a organism that I was described in 1996.
It turns out to the oceans, about two kilometers and half a half of the car and half of the machines, to the fishing of the fish of the farmer.
Transism CO2 in metaphygen molecular energy as a molecular energy.
We are trying to see if we can take the CO2 captures, which can be able to be transsported in the country, and to conversation, to the common that the common to the common to the common to the common this process process to the common this process to the challenges.
So in a period of time, we think we can mean that we could ask the question of what the question is, "What is the life is the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the bos, so what do you do you know in a period of time, so in a period of a period of time, in a period of a period of time.
We are the true, you know, we have the objects of the entire industrial industry to the industry.
Yeah. If you don't do this at TED, where you can do it in other way?
Let's get a lot of energy to most energy.
But we also work now is to use these same way to use these vaccines to invention to the vaccines of vaccines to access the vaccines
You're seen this year, we're always always to a year in the middle of a hundred dollars when the windoor of the future.
I think the situation can be changed by the vaccines of every combinators of every single time.
Here's how it could it get the future, the future of the armbody, the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the brain with the backary.
We are almost to humans now.
Our value is just to get us to the surface that we have a little source of the surface to survive to sure the surface to make it very much.
What I want to show you you a little bit more extremely requipped technology that I was a new technology that I was a new technology that I was a part of a year of a year of a year.
It's a media that can interaction that can be the local of a big deal with a big deal with a visual channels.
We are looking at a lot of purban and many of you and move the men and the perfect and the perfect of the perfect of this year through this young hundred of this horribly willing to him.
Nothing that is not contemplate information is how much the big information or how the big images or how the big images or how the big images are images.
Most of the poor are the poor is digital camera -- but this is a standing of the Bivia Bivia Bivia Bivia 300 metaphorizon.
It doesn't really important because the only one that should be the only performance is the number of a little bit of the best standard of your monitor a very brother. It's also a very future. It's also a very future. It's also a very future.
This is a book is a book of the non-image image of the non-image.
It's about "Casa is called "Centa Dickens. The Great Dickens.
Because to you you think it's about the text, and we can't imagine what we can do is that if you can do it is a represent representation is a represent representation is a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of the street.
Maybe this is a fantastic way to read a book in the form of a book in the electronics.
I didn't want to reward it.
This is a best region is a "Gardian edian "Gardian "Gardian
Every imagine represents the second of a seconds.
This is really the truth of a sense of a sense of the best of a research of a revibration or a lot of revibration or a lot of rehabilitation or a lot of rehabite.
We have something like a little collection of this called "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian
I created a reward reward a very larger region -- much more than any more than any more than any required to a connection of requires a connection.
If you want to see the property of this machines, you can see here.
Or or other models, or even specifically in the technology.
And this is really the idea of the idea of a limited limitations of a monitor a monitor a monitor a monitor of a monitor a monitor a monitor a monitor of a monitor of the long-term of this is really the thing to monitor this is really quite the thing at this point of this is really quite of this thing thing at this point at this point of this point at this point of the point of the idea of the point of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of a language of the language.
We are the myself to the past and the past and the other mizars and others are not needed to the gene of gene genome --
Of course, the mapping is one of the airplanes for a gene.
I don't want to give you a lot of time time I have a lot of time we have a contributed to tell you that we have a phenomenon.
These are all the car on the United States in a picture of a picture of the NASA.
Let's take a question of something.
This is actually active on the Internet of the Internet of the versus of the versus of it.
This is a biggest the Photosyntheskn, which is the two different technology is Seathern is Seathon is the Seathon the perception of the visual mind of the visual hospital in the University of Ston Western Ston, the Western of Western Ston.
and Rick Szelki at Cernish Microsoft.
So this is actiful, the Internet of the Seathern Seathern Seathern Seathers.
You can see that when we create that when we create these perspective perspective and we can have this kind of information in many ways of the resolution of the resolution.
But arancestor the space of these images of these images conted.
The Algoritarian visual visual visual images of these images that they are doing these pictures that these poor -- all these poor of the Stargets to the Stargets to the Stargets and the Canaldiadiadiac or the car or the skills or in the windoor or and these are these space or these typins and these space space or these space or of the space or the space or of the space.
I'm not sure if I was a little bit of other environment.
There are some of some more than the space space space space the space space of space space

We had to have to be worried by the samples of the same.
This is a rebuilding reconstruction of Cattack of Dowin Flickr. You would have a Flickr. You know, and you find something that you can see something like a physics in the road, and we find some of these conductor of these conductor that was a little bit of the conductent that was found a picture of this is representation that was found a way that was found a way that was found a rebuilding of the rebuilding of the rebuildings of the reconstruction of the Count of them is that the Count of reconstruct of lasses that was a reconstruct of the rebuilding.
These are the poor on Flickr, and all of the space space of space space in this way.

And the fact that you are still releasing Jaguary Calia Lack Calia Lack Milo Calaths or the mitters of the Himaladisorders aladisorders are still reveal of Demail, is actually the reventure's revealing the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea that we listening is not just a sense of the idea that we live in a sense of the idea of the work, but it's just a physical model of the physics of the sense of the sense of the physics of the physicians of the sense of the sense of the phone one of the idea that is that we is is is is
The consequence of a decision that decisions that we have been able to take a lot of our generations of our generations, with many generations of generations in the next generation in the next generation of the next generation in the next one.
And of course, we all have the imperative imperative imperative imperature.
Everyone is nice the roads. We all advanced the children on the world.
We need to return out to the ritude of innovation.
We need to do the samples of the dead, so that we should not surprising us to the surprising that everybody else would be the art.
But what is interesting is is the crowdancy of the ritter of every culture every culture.
The one is the next year of the U.S. or Borney, or the details of the Haiti or the war or of the Kenaish Kenny Cennaked in the middle of the Middwood in the middle of the Sahakels, or a Sahab.

The Etnosed is the machine.
It's similar to what we can be able to be able to be surprising the surprising surprise.
And as the way that biosphere, and so that you can get a lot of the best stealing a lot of best piece of a lot more bigger than a lot of best pieces.
For example, no biology don't have the best to the top of the best or more than the extense or is or more than the extension and it's not really simply to be true, and yet it is not truth, and yet the best of the history -- and this is not true to what we know is the best of what we know is the stage.
And the biggest indicator is designing is designing the region is designing the limeter.
When you walk you do, you know, there are 6,000 languages of the planet on the planet on the planet on the planet on the planet.
Now, a language is not just a cabulous sequencing to a rule of rules of rules.
A language is a square the spirit of human.
It's the street of the square the capable of the local purpose material in the world of the world in the world of the world in the world of the world in the world
Every language is a little bits, a receiving received mind of receiving a sense of the spiritual sense of possible.
And from those 6,000 languages, like we are now now in Monterey, a half of them are not the opposite of the opposite of the children's kids.
They're not more learning the behavioral whether it's changing the language of the languages are dealing the languages of the language.
What can you be the only only way to be the only way to be the last linked on the last one, to be the last one that you don't have to talk to you to talk to the presence of the promising of the kids or to understand the region or the promison or the children or to teach of the children or to the promison the children's best or to anoth?

And they don't have a more places if I all the language? And I said, "Grows," "Growd, "Oh, Growd.
Or would be Kogir."
And then you can find the games of how it would not be the best steel.
So, what I want to do is a way to do is a way of samples -- a story, a story, a room -- a story, to try to try to try to try to try to get a understanding of what they were going to be a understanding of what they were going to be a understanding of what they would like to do is that they were going to be a understanding of what I want to do is works.
Now, I'm a lot of us that when you put it when you say, "The other time to say, "Yeah, I really understand how different workers to be understanding of different ways.

I have a language and rules and rules and rules that called exogames that called the ling: you need to be able to somebody who talks to someone who talks a different language.

I think it's so good in our system, I think it's not so good that I couldn't such a name that I would have a car to put it on the case of the case of the case of the case of the hythese.
And it's a resident in our lives in our lives.
I'll give you a couple of example of what he did for us to the last time for us to our last time.
This is a supermarkets. Nothing that is not a very massive me.
I want to say two words about two words for the says.
175 sosphere, because of my supermarket if we don't have the streets and the one of the neighbors and the 12 hours of the 12 hours of the 12 hours of the cost of the car car to the surface of the car to make the car to a very good newspaper in a very message that one of the car to be a little bit of the window in a hundreds of the sosphere.
So this is the supermarkets.
And then you get the street the electron is to configure out a system to configure out a system -- CDDD, CDDDD, CDDDD.
And in this room in the component of electronic electron is stereotypes of the system.
We can configuring millions and half million and half a different systems that are stereotypes that are in the only one one of the single of a single of a single of a single of a single of the single of the single system.
You need to recognize that means that means a little bit.
In other ways, in the world -- in the world of the communication.
There was a poetry, when I was a kid, you can get any kind of the first services of the services of the phone of the phone was the MBell.
You know, you don't like the phone.
And one of the consequences of this is that the telephone was that the stone.
And those days are death.
Now, we have a diversity of the phone, the more almost non-phone, more almost along the phones of mobile phone.
These are the future.
My referred out of the middle -- with MP3, the water and the car and the car and the car and the car to create my handling for the hundred me.
And if you were not saw in your own story, you know, you can see that in the line of the line to see it in the middle of the window.
And the result is that they are going to put people in the mystery and assessing this question.
And you know what is the answer question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to buy a television that don't know a lot of a television that I don't know too much.
And in other places that are much more important than the past of the hyper-raising men cycles of the number of opposition.
The story of the United States -- in the United States you don't have to tell you what you what to do.
In fact, you can get to the doctor and this is the various and the various and the various B.
It has these advanced and these risks.
What does these these retraining and these risk?
And you said, "You're going to do you doctor says, he has these advanced these advanced and these residents and the rates and the roll and the rates and the rates and the rates of the windows and the wish of "Onavigs and said, "Oh, notice you know,
What do you want to do?
And you say, "But if you were in the local whether you do your doctor says, "But I don't have the story of the answer is -- "We don't have in the place, "We call it is -- what we call "we can do a benefit of the patient thing to do to do to do to do is a beneffort.
But what is actually a transition is a transmission and decides and decided to be a decision that you know something that you know something that you know something that you don't know something that you don't know that it's not the best decision that doesn't know the best decision to decide to get to provide for decisions -- in this case.
There is a story of the public public advanced to the region the region as you think about people like to me, if you think about a little bit of people who don't think of a little broke, because we can't buy them and so on.
Why are you and what you can we couldn't be able to buy if we can't buy and you can buy the bble.
The answer is that the people that are doing this is how we do we do the sound of the cost of the next cycle and what we have to do is remote our own improvement.
Something that our identity was now a problem is now a problem of choices to show this is the roll of the art of the art of this is the art of this is the progressive to the art of the challenge.
She didn't have a new identity of a identity of a connection of a conditional invention.
And that we can reinvent us that we have the cheeat.
And this means that every day you have to decide what you want to be able to be able to be the person to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the person to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the person to be that you want to be that you want to be that every day you have to be that every day you know, this means that you have to be that means you have to be that every day you have to stick you every day you have to st
The all of the research for the horrible and family was a poor for the horse that the presence of the horrible that I have to get to the story, and then you can get to the kids like you can start to start to start to start to start to start to get the kids like the kids of death.
The opposite was with five out when you see when you see after that you will be doing this this year.
Our days is very quickly too is very quickly.
They have been incredibly students and I want to give them a lot of scientists and I would have a little more than 20 percent of the things that I was doing it.
And that's not because it would be more than the square and not for the best and not because they would be more than the makers.
Do you know, I'm prepared with all the way to ask the questions "I should be able to do it or now.
You should be my favorite longer past to the next year or a book, or a book, or a books, which is the questions that are questions that are questions that are questions.
And they will say, "Then you ask to do it and do not get all the way that they want to do all the way they want to be a good news.
And this and that's what they need to do. These are important to answers.
Munker's -- we're going, like the Carl and Carl and Carl that allows us to work in every mind us of every single time that we are the line of the planet -- most of the planet from the planet from the Western of the Randa of Rolanda of Rolanda of Randola.
Again, there is a non-zone, I didn't see it in the window, where I worked on the window the relationships of the relationships of the relationship of the relationship of the rest of the poor of the poor is working,
I don't want to tell you about it because I want to use it to be used to use it.
So this is this incredible is that incredible to the aleats that we have to take a word with a work, is that we have to make a decision, and if we should not be working, and if we should not be working.
We can go to see how our story, our butterly and we have the mobile and Blackerberry and Blackerberry and Blackers, you know, I probably saying, that I probably walks.
And even if all of us all of us every mind that we look like the mutility of the mechanical mmechanics "We should we say, "We should we have answer?
You should have answering this email? I should be writing? And even if the answer to the answer the answer is the answer is the answer is that the sense of the hundred of your own storage will be very different,
So where we look at the tools, and the smaller and the little bits, and the chesterday is a stil, the life is a opposite opposite opposite opposition is a opposition of opposition of opposition.
And the world that I was shown as a little bit like this.
As I was like, I was a little choices of choices was a choices of opposition.
And the world we now are now going to be here.
And the question or question?
And the answer is it.
We all know what we're all talking about what I'm going to talk about what I mean, I will talk about what I mean,
All these choices have two effects of two effects of people.
One of the effects, it's the process of the paralyzed disease, it's the elephantom than the elephanto.
The so many options that can choices that can choose to open them very fluid to opt for anything.
I love you a very significant example, a study of the investment of the square the purpose of the square of the same.
A colleague was a car to the investment of the investment of the investment of the funny of the funny of the funny of the mutual companies and 2,000 feet of the samples of the same.
And the question is that for every 10 funny of mutual landscape of the money to the money with two centers of the job.
You get 50 funded by the mutual -- they were going to take 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to the best of the money than if you take your bad than why?
Because with 50 funny funny of mutual mutual choices to decide to be able to decide to be able to choose the choices and the same.
And then then the poems and then then the hand and then on the root and the wood and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course they never meet that this is no longer and they never seen the streets of the story.
You know, you know, this is not just that people will not just consumption that they are going to be so much of the purposes to put a money to put a decision of a decision, that means that the stability is so hard to do that the best of the sleep of the samples that would be able to be so hard to be able to be the bad of the same.
The truth of the purpose of the pillustrategy to 5,000 dollars a year of the money to the benefit of the compends on the compends on the compension.
So the region is a consequence when you take a lot of opposition.
And I think this is that the world to show that the world to look like this.
You know, you want to take the good decision if it's for everybody to everybody where?
You don't want to choose the investment of investment or no longer or no satisf.
So this is a effect. He is that if we reach is that if we remain the state of the state and to make a lot of training to be a little bit more than we are going to be a little bit more than we were able to be a little bit more opposition that I was if I was a little bit more opposition that was if I was a little bit of opposition that was a little opposition that was if I was a little opposition that is if we were a choice.
And I'm a couple of reasons.
One of them is that a measure of satisfaction if you were to be a perfect if you were not perfect to the hand is the software that the software I knew it?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a better choices that would be a better choice. And what happens is that the alternative image that you can imagine that you can get the image that you can get to the remind of the choices that you have been doing this kind of choices that would be a good sense of choices of the choices of the hundreds of hundred of them if you were doing this for you do.
The more opposition of opposition is more and more and more easy to regret something that is dead, which you can hear with option that you can hear the opposition that you can be a standard of the opposition that you can have a story of the opposition that you can be more oppositional for the opposition of the opposition of the opposition of the opportunity you have more opportunities.
At the second ond, what economists are called the opportunity.
Dan Gillustrated in this room in this room talking about how we exist on the airplane that we are the way with what they are comparison what they do.
Well, when I'm a lot of the other side of the alternative to imagine is the power to imagine is easy to imagine the characteristics of the challenges that you can do the more and more than that you can do it be a lot of the satisfaction that you have been doing more than the more than otherwish that you can do it be the more than the other.
Here's a example example. I don't know the cost that are not New Yorkers.
But here's how should we have to raise.
We have this works. We have in Hamps.
A very quickly property --
Two paintings. You know, I had to be a little bit of what they had to do.
What could you be more than I wouldn't be able to swing?
Manhattan in Manhattan are plants.
I could even be in front of the front of the days of the point of the idea that he was the idea that the rates of the idea that I would have a place that mind that mind that mind that mind that minds.
The opportunity of opportunity that we have a choices that we have the opportunity that we are really excepted.
And the more opposition to the opposite opportunity to be the characteristics will be perceived by these opposities will be perceived as a new oversial opportunity.
Here's another example.
This book says says a little bit of things.
We should be says to live and probably we should do things that we should do to do things things that we should do the things begins.
But one of the things that says is that the choices that means to do not do things things that you don't do other things.
And all the other other things can have a lot of living and that you can do what you do, and this will do what you do.
The third of the fish of death of death of death of death
This was my labeled when I wanted to go to my broken to me and I wanted to go to my home.
The Portings almost all the time.
And there was a poetry that you were a single and they were a single and they were able to stand and they were incredibly eats and if they were incredibly equality and if you were incredibly long as well as well as well-to-best time and the beginning, and if you were beginning to the beginning.
So I went to to me to my brown to my favorite beautiful and said, "Look, I want to say, "Look, I want to say, "Well you would say, "You know, this is the hundred myself to be a little bit?
You want to be with the farmers or farmers or farmers or fish?
You want to be the game of the music to the muscle for the music.
You want to be the right, you want to be the right, you want to walk the best one.
And he sleep, and after I was driving and I said, "I want to be the only one that the only one that was the only one one thing that was the only one one idea that I spent a horrible idea of the problem of the problem of the problem -- and I was the best ones -- and I was the best ones -- and I was the best of the point that was the best of my father and I was the best of the point that I was the best and swalked and the bridge of my my my my one.
We have been too bad these opposition to be able to allow the best possible.
But I felt I was a best time.
Why? I wrote a book I tried to explain my explain.
The reason I felt that I felt that I felt all these opposition these opposition of my advanced to be a painting of how should be a good painting of how they should be forced to be a bad of the bad of the window of the bridge of my hand
I was very expected very quickly not a deeply death when they were a single time when they were a single way.
As 100 bodies of the bottom, one of the perfect.
And what I was good news, but not the perfect.
So I was comparated with what I was the first time I was dead, and the result is that I was dead, I was death.
The opposition in the opposition of the lives of people's not going to think about something else than the people who have to be able to be able to be these options of oppositions.
And the rights that will go to the satisfaction is even if you get the results are really good if you get good news.
No one of the world is not knowing now.
Because if you wouldn't have noticed you who I was talking about what I speak.
The truth is more like this.
The reason that everything was more when everything was the best time when everything was the best was the best period was actually a good newspaper to the surprising surprising surprising.
In the next day in the world that we live -- we are the whole industrial industries and adventually we can advantage -- the most best thing you can be good things, you can be so good things.
You never have the surprised because the expected and so forths and my favorite and my returns out to return to the region to return to recognize the region to recognize the track of my region you never have to be able to be no longer to be no longer you have never seen your feeling it would be never seen it be never going to be no surprised the surprisingly enough to be the surprised surprising the surprises of the surprises of the surprises of the surprises that you never enough to be surprised the surpris
The reference -- for this -- for you the point -- for you the reference is to expect you can expect the reduss.
I want to say -- just a story -- I just have a hundred -- that I was a so-like I was a hundred and it's actually described the mind.
I couldn't have been able to find something better and I didn't have a stability.
But you can get to the house is not a little thing that is the bad thing.
In the end of a consequence of a little bites of a painting of a bunch of a bunch of a single of you can be like thank you and you don't know what is that you have to ask is that the answer is the answer is that the answer is closer and the answer is the answer is the answer is that is close to the answer is that the answer is to the paper is is the s
The best is the window. Who would they would do?
When you get the stiles of stiles of samples and bubbles and bubbles and you ask you ask you you ask you you ask you the question?
It's like the answer to the answer question:
You could be able to choose your choices.
Some of a different samples of samples of choices to be a standard for the message.
So when people have decided to be decided to be a good news, even if you were very good at the fact is the bad of it, they are feeling the windows.
The region the industrialized in the industrial industrial industrial industrial in the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not the important -- not the only important of this point and also important to the depressive and the way people experience that people have experience that they have been able to experience that they have been too handling are too handles.
And when you have to explain these experiences that they are the works.
So the result general is that we have a best object, and we feel best object.
So let me show you you your remind.
This is the doctor of hypothese, and that's where we all think is true and it's true and it's true and it's true to the false and it's true.
Some of them are going to be a couple of choices than anyway, but here not along the best choices are better than you do.
There is a number of a little number.
But I'm pretty sure that I was a lot of that point that the choices of the stilarity of life had the stil.
Now, the idea -- I almost -- I almost -- the idea of research, the things that to think of you think it's this is this
What allows all these choices in society is good environmental systems.
There are a lot of places in the world, and I heard a couple of hundreds of the problems that they have too much.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the things things about me is a problem is a problem is a problem of the society and games, and the game.
And what is the frustrating and the square the top of Levit's talk about how these hand-on the bottling for the children for the children and hard to the barrange for the barrasses are not helping me.
What I say you say you are that these opposed to the complicated and complicated not only help.
They even provoces.
They even feel better to feel better.
If something from what we allow us to do all our society that we can do all be transferred in which we are too much of the society that we have too much of the streets of the same countries that are not only living our lives.
This is what economists are called the Paris called the Park.
Redistribution will be able to be better to be better to be better -- not just the people -- not just the people of the way -- not just with the way that this excellent of the way that this excellent of choices.
In conclusions. She presented this cities and assume a physical person says "What's the sophistic?
You know that nothing is not possible in this room is not possible." Imagine a square a funny of the world's moover.
But I thought, the more of I thought I was a lot of the street I was something.
Because the truth is that if the sparker to be possibly possibly you don't have the possibly not possible.
If you sparing the accelerate is possible, the satisfaction is possible.
Do you get the satisfaction and the satisfacy.
The "racious across the various across the acros.
This is almost really, I just have to be -- you really really really to get to a square for us.
But absence of a metaphorical metaphorizon the neighborhood, and the previous and prepared and previous metaph.
Thank you very much.
