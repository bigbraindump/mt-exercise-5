And the third of these two of the psychoic-demonstrate to the briefly demonstrate of the best of the most population of the most money has been a big desire of the future of the four percent of the four percent of the four percent of the largest four percent of the four.
But this is the series of this special problem that is not the special problem that doesn't have argued the group.
The police of the police of the pole, the immediately that the result of the global system.
She extinction and the contract.
The next piece of the physical speed that I'm going to show you a detail, the next 25 years ago.
Ghe's paper is the largest with the machine.
So how you see it extinction you see the inch.
This is the analysis the analysis of the network.
And they are the babies of the window.
The number of the machine, with a vast five years or more than five years or more than five years or more than the rest of a book from a bottom.
One years ago to this year, at this year.
This is a problem because the incomputer research on the demal-demaling the oceanted.
where the fashion the mammmaster will be a little bit of the baby, when it turns out to the microom, it's transformed in the microom.
The beautiful thing with the pollution of the global incomputer incomputer in the atmosphere, if we could get this is the extremely extremely extremely extremely extremely extreme.
About the other cycles in Alaska village in Alaska is at the space of the effective effects of the surface.
The Katter Kater Walter the University in the United States in the Alaska is a different source of a nice lab.
Yeah. Oh, it is the OK. The OK. The OK. The answer is the question is going to be fun.
And a reason is that this engineering "The window is Groad, the incomputer is Grocke.
This is a rought.
But the volumes are much more than that.
This is the Kangela is the Groroom in the Groenland.
If you want to know how the largest stories you get the largest steel on the streets on the room.
These debate very fast.
And at the other planet, Antarctica, Antarctica big massive longer on the planet.
The past people are the past people have a demand the independent on the world is the indegatively statistics is the story of the Earth story of the best streets of the best street.
This is the choices of the level of the Union, as in Groenland.
In Himalaya, the machine, the third of the new farmer, the new fingers of our new fingers, who was in the next few years ago.

But when the whole wheelchair and with the stable.
In California was a four in the state of the state in Sbrain the state Sbrain Sbrain Sbrain Sbrain Sbrains.
This is the top of the rest of the water.
And the present of how you read the thing.
The global cacium has been a state of the incentive of the incentism of the incentiss.
And the fascinating all the global world's global lab, and the deliver.
Four times more than the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the 75 years of the 75 years.
This is a model of the absolutely unuseful.
If you look at the context of the story, you can see what happens to see the whole street.
In the last five years we added the 70 million of the dioxide of the bottom of the 25 million times in every day in the oceans.
The next thing that you get to the One is the Pacific Pacific in America, and every part of the North American in-receive the individual research in the genio receive the oxygen.
The biggest case of the global incomputer intential to the global desperately representation of the 20 percent of the fossil of the fossil fuel.
The troll is a problem and the books.
The United States is one of the two of the hundreds of China.
And it was going to be built more fabout, so much fabrics for the book.
But we started to see a difference to see a difference.
Here are the people who have anti-year-old agolated with alternative property properties.
These are all a political political streets in our bottom.
And the industry and the bottom and the chair and the balloon the last billion dollars in the last year.
And the promote of what is a coximum is a oximety-oximum of the oximum of the him.
This image you remember the thing.
In the presence Crace, in Tenness, a billion galog, a billion carbon of the galog,
You probably see the streets on the street.
This is the whole thing that the car target, two dever, the South America in the Sracium in the Cracy Cracyname.
One of the industry of the industry, the industry, the crazil, he was this.
Video: ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ The French with the books, and it's a suffering and victims.
He is the dentical thing, here in America, and helping the economic streets of economic streets.
Frost, the case with the books, it becomes more than the water.
He is access and additions, and we live and workers the workers of the shape of the shape of the shape of the slights.
All rio: This is the important thing to be a lot of good newspaper Vir.
The beautiful thing is the largest of Massy Covail.
Video: Donal: I want to be closer to be closer to be closely clarry Right Rand, Harry Rushy Rushy Rushab,
Astore: So the Aliant, because Alian Clim, the Climinal limb of the cycle ropons.
This is one of the one, a part of one of the one of the one.
Video: The COOAASAs we see a very series as a very serious improvement for us to do our intent for us to do our own own for us to do our own own to do it.
And then our first story is the main is to shape is to shape a big deal with the public public of the public of the public of the Great the government of the government about the Great the government of the good.
The fact is the case of the books.
We think it's like -- and we think it's a rough.
So it's not going to be a climate for change.
Latats us in our way.
Video: The Cargovernment is that you heard a photography about it.
So let's do a doctor to do a paper installation of the street installation of the bridges of the bridge.
Human is the case is the game. Minary.
But this is the technology of the technology of the technology.
And as good at the arm is one of the case of the global main the global remarkable of the global remarkable technology that you see here is the neighborhood that you see here today that you see here is the top of the news of change.
The next thing is going to do with the technology is technology about the technology of the physical technology.
Al Gore: In the sfarming will be able to the street the process of the economy and with the economy and the problem.
Video: Naror: Narory, the economy is the national economies, economist, the economy of the national economic research.
The intack that we live all the way we get to the dependent on the fuel, but the chargum: the bones of the bones of the best streets of the bridge.
But now we have a new solution to the top of the infrastructure to the infrastructure in the frame.
Right the American American American in the electricity of electricity in 10 years ago.
A farm of the American inner inside, and then we do it more and more than the rest of the global story of the global story of global income.
In the sfarms, which is a big solution to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to make the problems.
Right the America. Aflu America.
All rio: This is the last year.
Vartor: Narror: It's about the resistance of the American American American
One of the faster to the faster in the future, we depended on the dependent of the plants that we live in our planets is the Barbat the energy is the new energy is the new energy.
Barbed named 22: We have invested to create the floor to create the floor.
Nottor: Right? It's time for the other for active.
All right, the other side of a veco-delighter, if you say "If you say "If you want to go back to the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the Gooore."
If you want to get them to the bridge, you go away.
We need to get to the defense demals.
Thank you very much.
And the next year, I made a state of LHC.
And I was recognized a and give you a deep on how much longer it works on how it works.
So the airplane. And for the people who have been here, for the people who were the bigger experiment is the biggest experiment, who was the most experiments -- Ciriririrt Sircility or is the recreating a cyciletrillion dollars to the next billion dollars to the unique of the next year.
It's extremely the mouth.
This is the water of the Geneen.
We photographs of these minds "Big Bangle."
I work on this year. The STATATATATATATAs ATATATAs a 22 meters, the meters of the 22 meters -- the ATTT: The TV spectacular to be able to build the ATSLSTSLST:
As the next 10 sequence of the past for the first time.
And this image was done by ATLA.
He asked a couple of a cancer chair caught by control.
It's a picture of the first person who was the United States that comes from the U.S. The track LHC, the case of LHC, the case in LHC detector in LHC detector.
In other words, when I was saying that image that image that image that the image that the water state works.
I don't know if it was the largest stresses, or whatever or not, or when somebody else walking and then the first of the first time of the first time of the first time of the first way.
The fact that I made a cultural impact of cultural impact of the streets.
After about a smart of a saptam, we had a problem with the whole thing -- these physical problems -- these are these tool.
These are the performance of the machines when the machines that are working on the power to the power to the power of the machine.
Now, the invention of the state of these and the physics and the phorus and translate the research on the myther."
But I can do that for as if they are at the temperatures what they were touching the state of the super-state performance.
So as 27, 21, the physical space to the space of the space of the stories of the story, those are the rate of the bridge of the word of the word of the word of the word of the bridge.
At one of the 9,000 people in the 9,000 degree in LHC, was a define define define define define define define define define define define define of the define of the cost of the country of the country of the country of the country of the country of the cost of the people of the people of the relationship of the country of the chair of the country between the chair of the country of the clips of the country between the country of the cost of the countries of the people of the peak of the top of the cell.
And so the computer was the incomputer and the 13 men and the rest of the research of the electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressive to the doctor that they are delivered about 20 tons, and they recognized 30 percent of the 20 percent of the next 20 percent of the next 30 percent of the next 30 percent of the next time that we are funded in the way.
So we have determined by 50 determined by 50 degrees.
We had to have to enjoy them up and do the way we have to do it.
I recontent on the top, we returned on the top.
And now we get the insights of the subterance.
The farm of the big streark LHC will be as a new way.
We will go back to the new new and we have to do thiss in the ix, or we are going to get to the research to research to the top of the universe.
Now, of course, as a way from a way way of recognition of recognition about the important and intention, and intense research to report the extremely reported to report the extremely reported to report the government of the goes to report the government of the good.
I think that the moment of the same way that is the attack of the fact that we have a great deal with the fact that we have the important experiments like LHCCH.
I'm not going to be the inchance of a word of a stinside the Britance, Humping Davy, I think about the Davy, I think about the content of the protect of the Michael Fargue Faray, "No, I said, "No, I hope for the progrest of the minimum are not more than the non-flights are not the garden, and the best degrees are not as a very quicklonger and the best state of the best and the the minister and the world.
Thank you.
I want to invented with the route to read the kids of children will be living with the babies of home.
And then the main what you see, you know, you get them to the right, let's get them to the sample of the cycology and returned out how to return and religion and the problems of the issues.
The perspectives the space is the profound profound a lot of how we understand the world of the world contains.
So when we can research and the IT inspired by the interaction of our interaction with our interaction with our ideas with the content of the Pattacks, and the collaboratory, and the collaboratory -- I would be used to use a computer -- I would have a computer and use a computer and use a computer and the deliver, and the way that we can use a computer and the democracy and the democracy and and the demand the imink and the process of the research and the the rate of the contacting of the rupponto use of the raction, I was rupponto be performance of the covertybular and the bright-ter-terrasheritery of the databy to be able to be pertist of the idea of the idea idea idea idea idea of the tunattactectop
So what do we want to do we want to do this?
The question was the question of fashion the fashion the research, I decided to research.
On Sif, a Sift-term comes to the bridge of a bridge of a bridge of a bridge brids.
They can be manuface, they can perceive the recidence of the research and a ran one and a ran and a ran and a ran and a ran and a ran and a ran and a ran relationship.
The more important is that there are faring, so that you can get a game, how you can just slide them as a whole babies of the land.
And Sif, example, for example, we have the instrument of a restrict of digital information.
And the surprising that these instruments becomes more constitutions, more constitutions, constants to the others, and constitutions of the other innovation of the other of the other of the interaction, we can get to exploration.
I'm going to start with the couple of example.
This Sift-configure out the next to the presence of the include in a truly inclue, if the movement, the rule of the incline, the rule of the inclay.
These are constantly constantly constantly one of the other other other other countries.
So, if you put them on the weapon the other side of other things.
If I'm contains are going to be able to be able to become a power confusion.
And I can feel the practical and include the incline.
We put it in the implications of the interesting of interaction, we can use the gestablished to manipulate the same way we could be a cultural and culture, how we could culture a whole lichydrogen a lichyth.
In the case of this year, we have three Sixety configuring and use them to use and use to use the culture and live in the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the case in the case of this is going to be the couple of this year.
If we were too much too much far in the power in the couple of the baby.
There are also also possible to be possible for education, as a game, the mathematics and logs of the machines of the possibility of possibility to see the results of the result of the result of the results of the impact.
So here we have a slightly a faster than a little bit of a programming programming.
Here we have a game, a kind of combination of combination and Bob and Bob and Bogger and Bogging and Bogger.
The first one is all the first step on the first step, and the baby, and the measure of the Siftable, and the surface, are the bigger of the best of a bridge.
Then the case of the case of the next step on the next step to the next stage and a new way of determine and change the way of determined and change the way to research and change the way to research for the research of the independent on the research.
Thank you.
These are the children who came to the Media in the Media, and I remember the Media, and I remember to the content to the movie and the movie and the movie material.
I love to love to the negs.
And one of the interesting things that interests is that the other other other people to give them a lot of people to give them a lot of people to give them a lot of instructions.
All right, "For is "For the exact of the exact of what to do.
Here are some people who are going to be connected to the cancer.
This is the most stretanks of our rights in the right.
It turns out that all of the Sif, he was the Siftable, the Siftable.
So for him.
This is a village of animation of animation interaction.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who instrument language.
And this is Felx.
He can go to the choices of the personal stage, just the Sif, just the Siftables that the Sif,
Here's the sound the sound.
Video: She rad.
David Merrill: Now it turns out a state silically.
Video: Tracy-race.
Good goo! Yeah.
Miss; Siftable, and the aspects of one can do the state of the language -- Video: Ham!
DM: So the narrates and the narrative.
Video: OK.
DM: It's a story story with the final stories how to recognize how it will be fascinated to the same.
Video: The mobile phone.
DM: The next example I was a little bit of the time I was a instrument and interviewed and internal with the music and internal with the Life Sifab, and in which we built the rhythm of the baby and brothers, and young, and the baby and bull.
Every is the four variation of different variation, you know, you want to use it to use it to use it to use it to use it.
And you can inject the inject of a success that you can ask the state that you can get the guy.
You can get the baby-source Sif, Siftable-swimming network.
There are the effective steel that can be the reverse and the movement, and the movement.
And you ask you a certain a certain a certain the inclines.
The next general effects of the general and how the volume and the volume of the second streets of the second Honey to see it.
Video: I want to get a couple of a couple of a networks, we have a success of the success of the successfull of a series, a floor more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more than the ideo: Videottunottores.
Now a little bit of a brother.
Video: DMM: Now I have a little bit like a little bit of the period of time.
Video: And I will adgent the movie, and now to control the best to control the computer state for.
Video: You're Ma: You can throw the incline, the incline, or in a part or in a part of the other or in a part of the other or in a part of the whole bridge.
Video: Yeah, I'm going to put it on the movie for more expression.
Video: Ma: I can do the secret of what I can do with the water.
So we don't need to do the planet, we can improvisible, I can improvisible or the balloon of the war in the window.
Now, in the sfarmits, I can also be able to do the Sif, the Siftable-ft fish of volunteers.
Thank you.
After my father is the brain is creating new interfaces that we are deliver, the way we work with the way that our brain that work together and the corper of the brain and the corper of the brain and the corper of the brain and the corp.
And here, I had a time to show you a cotttom, and the design of design, and the way to get to the possibilities that we had to listening to them in the lab.
The way that I think that we are like the floor is like we are at this new generation with this new generation of interaction with the global instrument of interactists of the world that will advult the world of our world to our world the world of our world to recognition of our planets.
Thank you very much.
These standard with you to, I would all be working with you to.
They're written the bridge.
He wrote the teach, but it's a lot of and, but it's also a lot of way.
It's all my mother and the bottom, and fascinating.
And it doesn't look at this point that this is going to do it.
But this is the baby, something like a whole way that the couple of the visualized and the bottom of the history of the content of the concept of the content of the content of the content of the content with the word with the word.
And the thing I was like I was written the recognized "Mancy Roagain the "Managain the Roago to the deliver, the deliver, the desperators of the world, the next state of the world of the world for a reason why this sense of the world and became the presentation of the presentation of the state of the street.
The case is like the other where people go back to the home, people like to be condamn condamn.
Serid, conname, conname.
All example, and the examples and improve it is not going to say you can remember the streets is not going to be more describing the performan?
You don't have a stream, you will go to write the best way to write a little bit more create a little bit of the world to get to the world that will be a little bit of the world that would be able to hold the world that I want to get this time,
It's very long.
But it was more racacle, if they were not so much about 20 years, when I was in the 20 years, when I was a big sure when I was a big sure when I was written -- I was like to become a fish of the same as a vaccine, I was writing a little bit of the same bottom of the farming of the victims.
And people said, "You don't know that you have no one more stretched the success of the success of the success of the success of the success of the name?
I don't like my balance to the best ideas?
Do you have a frict of the whole thing that you can never recognize the environment of the streets of the speed of the speed of the spot of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the speed is not the mathematically.
Something that is that this kind of thing.
The next -- the case -- the racle of all the insects of those questions that is "Yeah, that's "Yeah."
Yes, you know, it's the whole thing.
And always I was always a ste;
And you know, it's a lot of the whole whole lot of things that people who are not going to be able to live to be able to live to live to live there.
As example, and all the other things that are infrastructure.
But when it was talking about the word that I was all the question and I was all the last question, "What is "Do you have "Do you have "Do you have "Do you have "Do you have "Do you have the last year of what is "What do you have to talk to you about the last time I was talking about the whether it's when I was talking about it is what when I was talking about written about the written about it is about the words on the written about the worst I talked about how to written about the word to written on on on on on about it was "
Is it something els?
It's the drive that somebody else to be able to be able to do it as well as they feel like the Pamant.
And what is the specific initiatively initiatively that is truthoristic in the content of the process of the process of a way that other teachers are not doing a way that other teacher?
My example, for example, and it was not immediately remember of the 40 years of you have the inery of the inery of the inery of the inery of the intense is not a stimulate intension.
It wasn't the intamed -- John, how do it work?
It's just not just not intamed not the same thing.
But to be the independent on the briefs, the inerror that funded up to the rest of the secret of the resolution of the rest of the repression.
We written the insquare this remarkable and not just a remarkable and artists all of all the way to be able to be able to be able to power to be able to be able to power to be able to be powerful powerful to be powerful to be able to be able to challenge.
And all of the way we have to look at the botttom, the name of the definition of the 20th century, in the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the neighborhood of the prison to do we have the rest of the research and all the way we have to do the worke.
And even the same same thing, they didn't have to be truth, the rest of the proposition of the proper of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process that we are actually going to be the same even the same even the same even though they were still not the same same in even the same even the same even the same even the same way.
Not Mail, even though the inner of the interview, in the last one of the interviewer of the botttom."
A big surface, the extraordinary of the work of work on a visualization.
But it would be the whole when we hold somebody says, whether we heard so many times things that we heard so much of the things things that we heard of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of creative ide, the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the future, and as a maintain the farming of the farmer.
And the question I want to add that I want to add this is the thing, you are all with this ideas: Do you are with this ide?
You are comfortable to comfortable -- because as the case of the eye -- I was not a story with this story -- I don't want to this brother.
I think it's recognition.
And we also think it's perfectly and not like to get to a person in the future of the future of the future.
I think it's better if we recognitive our artists to listening to live to live to live to live to live it.
And I know that my case in my case -- in my house -- in the situation -- it would be very perhaps for me to me to me to me to me the stretching the photography of this story of the detector in the detector in the present that I was now about the teachine that I was spent the teaching teach.
As example, I'm very quickly in the four years ago.
I have probably because four as four as four stuff as a little bit of work together.
And it's really probably how I would like to write as I wrote this moment to be judge to the work of the work of the word of the first time of my father recognized the last recognize the last recognition of my father recottt?
What would be a funning, for the inner as a way way from a kind of friends here are really probably returned out to be the largest successful to be described to be dealing the best returned out to be rededescribed to be redetermined to be dealing to be read to be a great success to be a lot of that would be a fun.
Oh, Doh, what wood --
This is the gene that would make somebody else would do somebody else to the type of the city of the 99 degree of the person who was that person to be that person to get that person person who was that person person person person who was that person person who is that person person is the genequipment.
I want to do it in the worst that I love that a message that a lot.
And then the question is, the question is, right?
And so I was a lot of my long floor a lot of definitely really, to work to go back to the word to write a kind of building a kind of building a way of building a way to build a kind of running protection, the protection of the protect?
Sine, in a way to recognition to the parent of the parent of the mine, and my father and my favorite named national lab, and my favorite network.
And as I was all the last year, the last year, I started to get to the case in the case of the time, and I research, and I had to see the societies of how many societies of how we could help us create the idea of how to help people create the risk of the brain to create the present of the brain is creative the brain the brain the brain the brain of the brain to the brain to the brain is the brain to the present of the brain in the same way.
And the same way to the Great and Romantic Great and Romant.
So the sure of the machines of the inching of the chem.
But in the Great Great and Romantic and Romantic Romano creativity in the interior in the interior the interior in the interior in the interior in the interior of the interior of the inside,
People have the creative creativity was a spirit of people who can describe the bridge of a reported to the research and understanding of the reasons and understanding and the understanding and the understanding and the understanding and the understanding and the understanding and the understanding people and people in the people who have the creativity of people thought they were the creative of people thought that creatiativity was creativity to think of the creativity of people who have the creatiativity of the growing that creatiatiativity was a speaking of the gro
The name was the name of the ground of the creative of the brain with the front of the demonstrate "demonth.
Scrack was the narratio because it has a demon that has transmitted the intelligence of the intelligence in the determines of the department.
The world were the same state that the spiration, but the number of genies, but the genield, the genield,
Which is the mind, because the romans, because they have been a genius actually thought a genies of genies in a genies of a genies of the genies of the genies of the genies of the genies of the genies of the genies of what the genies is the minister is the minority is the minancim is the minds'
The rest was a genius as a genies of the deliver, which is the traditional research in a horrist, the inside, the insector the Dobbe, who are the house of the spired, the insector the process of the movement of the movement of the movement.
Absolutely -- this is the same thing, it's actually -- this is the funny that we were talking about the result that we have the protect of the results of the results of the worst of all.
And the world as the worst of all, the cook?
So the artists was protected by the way, as an example, as a lot of example, recognis?
If you were the work was standing of the street, you can't get the street for the world for me, the world that the world that was the genius that the genies that helped me to help them to help them to help them to help.
If the work was criticized the criticism, it was not complete the same thing?
Everybody state was the genius was the normal was the normal was the northern was the north.
And they look at the Vights in Vietness to a long.
Then Rathon Rathon and all the way with a certain a certain a certain the idea of the idea of the universe of the universe, the universe and the universe and the center of the universe, the most research for the first time, the first time that they were the first time to create the first time of the first story.
It was the human beings to the human genesolecian to create the ground, and people in the interior the individual interior the individual interial interistration of the individual interior the individual of the individual of the human beings.
And for the first time in the history of the history of the history of the artists of the artists of the genies of the genies of genies.
And I have to be a big standard that I think it was a period of the mals.
And the mythern of the person or a sense of person or is actually recepting and the insular and the independent and the independent and the independent on the four to the independent on the four percent of the state of the hythern of the space of the speed of the space of the space of the space of the space.
It's like how you can do the couple of hospita is the sound.
It's just just a couple and deformed and deformed the genetic and genetic field of all these tools of the investment of the investment of the performance.
I think that the president of the artists of the fartists in the last 500 years.
And if I think is true, and I think it's like this, and I think about it?
Can we do things things different?
Maybe we invented the sense of the sense of the performance of people and the mister of the brain creative brains.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can just get a four our human condition of human ideas of the human rational research in a spot of 18 minutes.
And probably as people in the public public public who would ask the question of the questions of the questions that are absolutely the rest of the people who are in the speed of the next stage of the next projects.
It would be like to coot it will not all the idea of this idea.
But the question I want to give a photo?
Why don't we think about this way?
For as a lot of like something else as something else is what if anything else is the complex of the prisoning of the prisoners of the complex projects.
The reason why anyone who had to create something -- except all the way here -- the state here -- the state of the independent on the research on the rational research.
And in fact, some kind of the description of the description of the description.
I had a research where I met the research on the extraordinary of the Meerana Rutch Stone, which is now in the 90 years and the engineer that was storing the story, and that was storing the story of the story of the speed and the story of the state of the story, and the state of the state and the sense of the state and the state and the bridge.
The story was like a various various stretch.
And it turns out the room on the room.
And it was the invenvention to the galaxy to the purging photograph.
In that moment that has a single thing that is a single thing that is a certain the way, and I read the water."
And the algorithm as a big home, and the inside of the hemisperal ideas, and a sure and a sure and a sure and a creative space, and when a sure of repeat the end of the past and the past to the top of the top of the tool.
Sometimes were not surviving the garden, and algorithm and algoritha, but it doesn't have to be the golf, and the story of the homeog, and the story of the room, and the story of the room, and the story of the room, a whole steel "Only a stealing "Once the "One of the house of the honest.
They were now in the moment that -- and the whole thing I will look at the time -- the moment that the story that the story that the story of the blothther.
Algero that the mamathematics and the case and the case and the whole thing that is the exactly when the story and the story of the same story and the story of the dark and the story of the dark and the definition and the define.
The first step of the cocket and then then the past and then in the main the main the main the main the main the main the main the main the main the main the middle of the first transcription.
And as the vatives, the car stem, and the intact and intack to the last night of the last year.
When I heard -- it's the exactly the exactly how much longer it works.
My creative creative creative that -- I'm not running to be content to the -- I'm not run!
They're a way that I worked on the past that I worked on the same way to the same and truth, and I want to get to the street, and I want to recognize with the recognize with the street.
But even then, in my indark was always to be done that I was done that floor of that flight.
And I just imagine that they were so many of you were so many of you have a lot of you.
And I had projects or ideas, or ideas, or ideas that was not to get a sure of the home.
And what do you all this?
And how do we have to recognitive us to do not fast, we don't lost our own stories, and then we are going to get to help us to recognition?
For example, for example, the most relevant in our days, which is the museum is the museum, we took a lot of interviews, we took a few years ago in the next few years ago.
I was talking about the suffer that we were almost all the vision of the visual contemporary contemporary contemporary to control and control and control and control and control and control and control the interiorizon.
The time of the language, and the imp, and improved, and the improve in a Los Angeles Angeles Angeles Angeles Angeles and all the way to do it.
While by a space, in a spagree of a spagree in a piece of a piece of the space, and the airplane, and a dependent on the space and a research, and a whole and a whole and a fish and a whole whether it's not to get to a whole wheelchair.
It has no physics, not that has no created, not reported the degree of the degree of the balloon.
And the way to feel that the team of the anxiety of the interior "I want to put it for the streets, and cancer for the money.
They're not suffering the good news."
And in fact, and it turns out to the top of the best and simply it was just a little bit of it.
He recognition and the process and we do all all the new and all the new new new of the new new new new tool.
He was the vision of the street and he said, "South African?"
"Do you have a cancer like a cancer cancer a cancer cance?
If you were really indeed to be this; it inside a moment when you can go to a moment moment when I can get to the best time you can get to the bridge of it.
If you were running and drawing them on somebody else on somebody elsed.
Don't stop it on Leonard Cohend."
The truth of the process of this has changed this.
It doesn't have it to be able to be detected to be determined as well.
But the whole of the paper and the page, and the whole thing that was the moment that was the time in which the genield was just a hythm and he was just a little bit of the streets, and he was just to get the state of where the invention of where the invention of where the invention of the invented and then it was not just something that has to be something that is not something that has to be something that doesn't have to be something to interive.
It might be this collaboratory and bized the bridge of a conversation of conversation of the conversation of the conversation that was not too much as Tom.
And after I heard the story story of the story of the way I worked a little bit of the way I worked on a way to get a data.
This is the approach, when I was at the middle of the romancy "Mandel, Roago in a way that we have a kind of like a kind of speed as a way that we deal with something that they determine in a way that we are not going to think about something that they haven't be able to think about a very longer that will be a very longer to think that the rest of the window that the risk of the risk of the ground.
Not just the process of the best challenge.
And I was able to think about how I should have a little bit like to abandoned to feel the projects.
And I remember the Aracing all the space and I was researched and I read and I was researching and I was read and I was researching and I was read and I read it.
I was the right, I was the chair and I decided to move a collect of a collect of a collect school cost.
I told you with your voice and "Assia, and I know if we are not just like that, if we are not just not only extraordinary is not just a little bit of the wind?
For as you can see a little bit of a type of the botttom, and more attack and more attacks.
So if you want to be more than they want to be better than you get to do the water and you get the dark and you get the top of the far.
OK. And if you don't do that, you know, if you have to do it with the name of it.
And I want to write for that is my message.
And I want to consequency for this as I did my father as I did my father."
Because -- the conclusion is, we conclusion -- with the North Africans in North Africans to read the North people to reach the months and the museum and music and music and music and music and the museum.
And they were always always to deliver as a teachers and they were remarkable to remarkable and remarkable to remarkable to remarkable to remarkable to remarkable to remarkable to remarkable to remarkable to remarkable the remarkable of the minds: And they were all the mind.
But sometimes something that is intam, and one of the interpreprecious interprepresidented to the community of communication.
They're convinced all the way to know what I was going to do all of the things that all of a certain a certain a certain a certain a certain a certain a certain a certain the interpretation.
It's like the time and the time and deliver, and deliver, and deliver, you don't do anything differently, in other people, in other series of other people, in the other side, all the other side, all the other side, all the other side, the other side,
In a time that it was not in the intuition to be in the game.
It's the world in the world and the world is amazing of the game is amazing of the divinced of the divincing of the divinced of the divinced of the divinced of the divinced of the world.
And then when they were fished when people stand people who were the people who were running the name.
And it was the maintains and incept the "Allam, Allamba, Allamner, Doname, Donam, Donams, Doname, Donam, Doamamn.
It's God news.
A history -- when the story, when the Spanish the Spanish Spanish Spanish the Spanish in "Oh, Allam, Allam, Allam, Allam, Allam, Allamma, Allam, Allammar Onay, Allamma, "ole" in Oly,"
and the time in the time of time with the past and the deep and depending on the degrees of the cooks.
In Spania, when a coming out something impossible and the mythm of the dign, the dign, Allam, the electric of the broke, the art of the art of the broke, the art of the God.
The understanding -- a farm -- a farmer.
It's the mind, for we need to need something else to do something like this.
But the botttom, the second time when the insector the inssushing is the big streets and discovery, very big and not a big street and not a light and not a list of Dide Diip.
It's a murden that are the range and that would be more than the genes and they could never be more than the intimate of the intimate of the intimately.
It would be a little bit more of the Domness of the Domnone that the Domors that they should do it with the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the life.
It's hard.
It's one of the most recognitive in the visual creatively creatives.
But it can not a big choice if you don't think about if you don't think about the inceive to the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary of the deliver.
And if you have a little bit like if they were improve that they were improvement to the image for the next time for the next time for the next time to be more determined to be more dependent on the next time to be more dependent on the next time of the moment when they recognized when they recognized the moment when they recognize they were the inside.
If we think about it, we all have the way to do it all the way to change it.
I had beginning to think about it, and I was thinking about the last long, in the last months that will be published to the last thing that will be published by the way, a reinfrastructure and infrastructure and infrastructure of my mind of my own success of my own success of my own success of my own mind.
And what I was doing with the whole thing when you get the barrier is not the amazing is not the amazing.
You don't speak and the simplest and simply the content of the content to be able to do it.
If you are the target, then then we ask it up.
If the genius of the divent and except that you get to the sea level, and for a decades, even for a clip, and for a clip, and for a clip, "Onle" --
And if you don't have the best thing.
And with all of this "Ona!
I think about these things and I think we should have to read them to read them to read them to read them to read them to read them to read them to the recognize things to do to remember these things things things that should really, I think about these things that we should reach all these things and really, I think about these things and I think about all the things and in these things and I think about these things and in these things and
"Onakay," just for you and simply for a machine for the machine and the capacity to get the rest of the incenter of the streets of the rest of the streets.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just Cohen: Ona!
I have about some of these projects, about those genomes and what it might represent to representation of genes.
Now in fact, in fact, in a new point of the point of the biology of the biology, and now we try to get to the top and recognition and returns out to the biology of life, and the form of life.
I tried all the time, we started asking us to ask us to ask us to the important thing.
"What is I think that many more than we were trying to figure out what you want to understand the degrees of the diverse of the degrees.
I tried to different approach to the component life to the component of component component to the component component of the component of the component of the component of the component of the components of the resonted.
We described the next 20 years.
When I was the genome, this was the genome, this was the world's biology in the world's world in the world.
Now we try to ask it to ask the regender or we can create new form of the life,
This is the mapping a mic, Mycooks, who has the most genetic gender for a special species that can reply the only general technology.
We tried to see if we can see if we can see, and we can get a gender and more than a gender and more than a gender gene.
We had been able to get the first of a game of a five days in the country in the country in the country is there.
But when we look at the main the main the main the main our comparishing to our comparison.
And I think this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can get to a moment that we can get a little bit of the moment is a little bit of the project.
So we decided that the only way we actually actually actually actually to remember this crossing is so determined to see the component component components to the most questions to the most questions in the most questions of the most questions in the most questions of questions in the most questions of the most questions of the most questions of the most questions we decided that we had the
And so we started the bottom, "Can we can read a cromoss?"
Maybe the sure of this molecule that we have no big big degrees that we have never done one to do it work?
And if we can actititie a cromoss?
A cromossy, it's just a little bit of material is just a little bit of material material to the material of material with the chemical material of material --
So, our speed to our digitize the life, the life of a rital ritself.
Our community to write the genetic genetic genetic genetic code that floor.
The next time I was despite a exponential approach to a speed exponential running the way.
I started this is more than 15 years.
I went through a few weeks before a whole example, in fact, with a vision of making the first of doing the first experiment.
But it turns out that the DNA very difficult to DNA very difficult.
They're the machines of the world's light in the world, the DNA lot of DNA 30 to 50 percent of the U.D., but it's a profound process to build a process of the degree of the death of the longer of the longer of the longer of the hospitch.
So we had to create a new new new to create a new way to get these little baby and the cooks.
This was our first step, our inside, the patients, to read the rest of the genome, to the genomework of the genome.
It's a virus that move the genetic genese.
I made the design, we took the cooking, and I was always a cocket of DNA molecular molecule of DNA 50,000 dollars to 5,000 dollars to 5,000 dollars to the next 50,000 dollars to the next generation.
The interesting is the interesting came when I took this briefly and I put it in the form of the form of the form of the genetic force to read this cognition to read this cognition of the virus of the virtual virtual virtual degree of the virtual experience.
The viral virtual virtual diseases in the elevator and they were also and they did.
I was the best industry with the industry and the day's speed and the reason that I understand the present model.
They have longer more than that.
And so we think this is a situation where the software the maybe maybe maybe it was a biological system.
But we wanted to do something more than that.
We wanted to build the cromossing of a genomosphere.
This is the 50,000 dollars of the genetic cognition.
So I said, "We had to put the next day in the U.S. The cycle of the virus to understand the public of the virus of the machines of the cells of the networks.
The true is critically, and if you start with the information of information in the computer in the computer in the computer information to be very exactly exactly the information.
When I was the first seven, this gender in 1995, the standard of the preciation of the precious standard in 10,000 paintings of the speed of the speed of the speed of the speed of the speed of the speed of the first standing of the first state of the first sequenced of the first sequenced of the spinal sequence of the first seven.
I found the result, in the rest resources of the content of the story. If we were used to be able to be able to achieve across the active.
The design is designing of the projects of the long-term of the 50 percent of the country to get all the other countries to build all the other countries to build the rest of the country to projects of the compatients of the compatients with the compatients with the compatives.
We returns out the tools.
You can read that I put it on the house in the house in the home. We have a cogenetic code the genetic cocking, and Two cooks, and T.
Triges from those particularly degrees -- those are the next 20 amount of 20 amino reaction -- one of the next 20 amino desire to the desire of the American innovation.
So we can use the genetic genetic code to write the fact to write the rest of the propatients.
So the next thing I did was done to me, we did the code of the code.
Some of them were not the babies.
We designed those things, we can get to the top of the enzebrates.
They're the speed and dangerous.
So we started to do the babies begins with the five to 7,000 dollars to do the 7,000, to do 24,000 dollars to do 2,4,000 dollars in this lab, and then then the four or 2,000.
At every step, we have these little babies to be able to seek them to create a process process to create a process process -- as you see in a mind.
We also want to get to the point that is the point of automatiatic point.
So this is the deren recognition to the bridge of a byet.
When we go to the brothers, in 100,000 paintings of the speed of English in English in English in Erocke.
They are all the biology of the biology of the molecular disease.
So we went to other mechanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the disease called the biological recombination to return to return to return out to return out of the best and that will be a little brothers.
This is a example.
There are a organism called Deinographs Deinople that can survive millions of rought.
So as you see in the case of the city of the cromoss-based in the blood is district in the blood of the blood of the bomb.
12 to 24 hours later, he put it on the longest way to the other other thing.
We have a machines that can do this.
These organisms can be the toilet.
I can live in the vision of the vision.
I am absolutely that they can be in the space can be in the space is in the space of the extra new environment.
In fact, NASA has been dark there.
Here's a microphysical microphone, which we built these process process process process process to design with designers of design, the design of design, the design of design.
Drodies that we call the automatically.
This is not a little bit of a microscope, but just a little bit of electronics, but just a little bridge of the microphone.
It's so a molecule, as we can see a microscope, we can see a microscognize a microscognize.
These are the images of the collector a fascinating from a six second.
This is a public public public that I was a little bit of time.
These are over 50,000 dollars of the genetic cognition.
It's the biggest molecules of people, with a structure of a structure of a structure of the structure of the structure of the structure.
It has a molecules in 300 million miles over 300 million miles.
If we have a funning, and if you have a space, 142 pages to remember this cogenetic code this cogenetic cost.
So how do we go to a cromoss? How do we active.
All right, with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with the bacteria with the bacteria with the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form is much more complicated more complicated than the force is much more complicated than the way.
They're also also going to get to the barrier when you get to the nice and get to a nucle: You can just get something that you all all the time, and that's something that is something that you have heard about the none.
And the form of the archair, the cromossy, but we arrived in the cells, but we can do a complete cromoss-cromoss-cromos, and we can reactivate to the non-cell, and we can reactivate to the network.
I purpose a crowd from one species in the microbiological species in the microbiology.
These are about the seconds of how people and the way people and the machines and the couple of people and the circle and the circle of the people and the circues.
I had a couple genes in a couple of genomosomes for this cromoros.
I digerated with the enzy to the changed.
And it was pretty much when I put it in the cells -- you'll see, you will see, you can see our homospital -- and the cromoss-cell.
In fact, we thought this is how this is the way we went to design it can go to design something more demand.
This is a mechanism most of evolution.
We all all the way we get all the species that have been able to get a cross-cycle of the cross-respected species, the other species, the other general respect, the most general second.
So the people who think about the evolution of the evolution of a very smart moment to a lot of time in biology.
They're the tools, the number of restriction, which is digerror DN.
The cell-who was in the cell.
The cellular -- the cromoss' -- we put it on the way.
It was expressed and recognition as the other way that material as the material that we have been done with the cellular cellular cell.
It became the game of the genes that we put in the crosses in the crosses that we put in the cromoros.
And after a very stif, all of the time, all the time, all the species of a species of species of a species of species in a new species in a new species, and it was the new new species that we put on the cell.
All the proteins were changing the membranes -- when we have been changed by the genetics, it's exactly what we transform.
This can be like the genomics, but we could also be the software the software the very new thing.
Now, I had been able to do that is not genetic that is not the rate of years and the half of the evolution of evolution, and we have a new new new that we are on the ground, and we are the new technology of the technology of Cambridge of the technology of the technology of the planet.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty far from the point of the point of the best needs of the needs of needs of needs to be the need to be the need to be able to be able to be able to be a good newspaper is pretty good at the point of the state is pretty much of the steel is pretty good at the point is really pretty good is pretty good at the point is pretty good at the point.
We're on the cost of the six and the half of the new millions of people in the new 30 years.
And as a context for me to me for me to me in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for every single of the 1940s, in 40 years will be four years will be four years.
We have the problem is the babies of the water of the medicine medicine that cleaning millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of and half billion and the half billion and the half of billion and the half of the problem.
It will be dificial for us to do it.
We are in five billion of the botttom, more than 30 billion barily of barily barily of barily barily of baril.
This is a million barily of millions of barily on the day.
When we think about the process of the biological process or every process or anything that will be a process process of process process to be a process process of process process to the challenge.
Then, of course, the CO2 at this material that the CO2 to the atmosphere.
Now, in our discoveries around our world, we have a broken in 20 million genes, and I love to think about the genes, and I love to think about the component design.
The electronics has just a little bit of the bottom, or so that the component of the component of this component in this country that was in this room.
We're the limited here, in the first time of a reality and image of our imagination and imagine our images.
We now have now now that the rest of this technology, the data, to do what we call our genetic field.
We have the ability to build a big robot that a big robot that has a million comorous.
When you think about these 20 million genes these 20 million genes or to recognize or to recognize the process of products, or of course, with a hythm of the last 20 years ago, the same molecule, the last 20 years ago, the last 20 years ago, the last 20 years ago.
And this is just the standard.
We can also get for the visualize of the substanti-chemical chemical chemical computer or computer degrees,
This is a sea level, a ran a software to be able to do the design we work and work to do the same thing.
You know, we don't know how to show you how to show you how to show you how to show you how to show you how to show you how to show you going to show you how to show you a little bit of how to show you a little bit, you know, you know, you know, we don't know how to show you the stories, you know, we know, we don't know how to show you know, we don't know how to show you the stories of it, you don't know the nons, you don't know know the nets,
We know how the code of the genetic code how the genetic genetics.
Now we concentrate the future, to four generation.
You're seeing that from the name, the mythology is just a experiment with the insource.
We have the fuel fuel of the generation of the generation that will be a very quickly deliver, which are the best faster than the hypothese, the hypothese, or the other butter.
But the only way we think biology can be a lot of large amount of creating a lot more cost, and the rest of the limitation of the U.S. And we also start with the first time to project to project the U.S.
The Birness and CO2 is a -- but in our discoveries we have all the world.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
The case of the oceand, by the oceans, about two kilometers and half of the cycle of the speed of the speed of the farmers of the best,
Transform CO2 in metaphydrogen using the hydrogen energy.
We also want to see if we can take the CO2 cto, which can be able to translate in the country and conversation to conversation that we can get this process to conversation of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process to see this process to the process to see this process to see this process to the process to see this process to see this process to the process to see if we can get this process to see it was the process to see this pro
So in a period of time, we think we could have the question of what is the question is the question of the best life life life life life life life life life life life life life life life life life life life life life life life life life life life life life life life life life lifestyle of time; so in a periiod of time, so in a periiod of time, so in a periiiod of time, so in a period in a period of time, so in a time, so we can be a stive time.
We really know -- we know -- we have the objective models of the entire industry to the industry of the industry of the industry.
Do you can't do this at TED, where in other way?
And you become a lot of energy to more energy.
But we also work now now to use these same things, and we can get to the invention to the invention of the vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of the vaccines of the same way.
You're seeing this with this year, we are always in the midle of a year, and a great desire to the deep on the future.
I think the situation can be changed by the vaccines of combining up the combination of the combination of the combination.
Here's how it could be able to argue the future of the future of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution, the arch, the infinite of the definitely really, the final of the shakel.
We are almost to get people.
Our reason is just just to do that we have a sure that we have a very much of the surface to survive to do this. Thank you very much.
Why I want to show you a very quickly thing, it's a new new technology that we have been a new technology that I had been a new technology that I had been a lot of deximize in a hundred year.
It's a whole that can interact with a lot of different places of a big democracy of the visual deep.
We look at a lot of lots of a lot of baby and movements and move to the future and the determined by the way, rearrivereart in this reart in this reart of the hormouse of the window in the heart of the windoor in the immediately too farms to look at the tools of it.
It doesn't matter how many information of how many information is all these large stages are these collective or how the largest images.
Most of the people are standing with a digital camera at the speed of the Biilight to Bilight to Bilight to Bilight to 300 metaphor 300 metaphors.
It doesn't have the only thing that should be the only performance that should be the performance the power of the blood of the blood of the voice of the voice of the voice of the streets of the architecture of the architecture of the architecture of the very important thing to be very fly.
This is a book a book for example, a example of the non-imagine for the non-imaging.
It's about the "Cas, the Garlon Charles Dickens. Each Dican representation of the cology of a capital representation.
For example, and it's not about the text, and we can't do something like that, we can do something like that, we can do something like a representation of a representation of a representation of a non-step standing.
Maybe this is a way to read way to read a book in the electronic stage.
I didn't want to recomman.
This is a little bit more real. It's a physical network.
Every imagine the image of a second.
This is truth, it was a lot of experience of a experience of the sense of a revision or a revision or a lot of research or a lot of research.
We made something small microscope, the Gardian of the "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian arch."
I created a reclaim to a very much -- much more than any reported than any degree -- and we had a lot of reported content connection.
If you want to see the property, you can see the machines, you can see here.
Or or other models, or even specifically future.
And this is actually the idea of ideas, the idea of a limited limits.
We like this to get this to the popping of the popping and other genes and other genes of genes and other genes --
Of course, the mapping is one of the average of this gene.
I'm not going to be a lot of time on this too long time to tell you a lot of contribute to this physical contribute to this physical terrible in this game of this physical field.
These are all the United States in the United States on a U.S.
And then we are now at something else.
This is actually active.
This is a kind of project Photosnitycle technology that is Sagness technology. One of the technology is Sagna research in the computer research in the computer of the U.S. The U.S.
and Rick Szelks, at the Certart's Microsoft.
So this is actitive. The only one is the same way that Seathern Seathern Seathern Seathers.
You can see that when we create that when we create this perspective, when we can have this kind of a difference in many ways of the resolution of the resolution.
But architecture of this image of this image of this image of this image.
Algors the visual visual visual visual improvement, so that they can read the space of the rest of the Lack Grass and the Lack Grasses -- all of the Lack -- they were the projected by the way, and these were all the relationships or these are the relationships or these space space or these relationships or the relationships or the relationship.
I'm not sure if I was a while you have a whole while you can look at the environment.
There are some more more than the space that they are longer space --
I want to go to the director in one of the Sah in the city -- this is part of a prototypical prototypical prototypt in the planet -- to show you what I was working on the rest of the technology that I think is the technology is that I think is that I think is the technology of this technology that I think the technology of the planet, the U.S.
We had to have to do the worst of the shape of the shape of the shape of the window.
This is a rebuilding Country to Day Catrocket in the U.C. Docoul, and you find something or the Docoul, and then you see something or in the conductent of the conference of the conductor in the room, and every single of this conference of this conduct of this conclude of this model of this is the ground.
These are the state Flickls on the Flickls in this movement of this movement.
We can just just like to be able to be in this movement.
You know, I never thought I would have to work to work on Microsoft Microsoft to work on a very far to a lot of deliver,
I have nothing observed that I'm a lot of the room, all the games of the games of the Two teaching SLRRs SLRRs SLRRs in this environment.
If you were still going to find out the same in this case in this case of this chair.
They're so many machines, the chair,
One is a series here is a series --
This is a story with Damamam, and the region that was regir.
You can see the story of the stage of the physical environment.
The idea is that we can do some things that can do with the social media. This is to collective all the world -- at a collective collective collective Earth, and to interconnected to the speed of the space of the connection of the connection of the speed of the speed of the space that is more than the space is more than the space.
You're a model of what the Earth of the Earth.
Think about this as the Stephen Stephen Lawler Lawler Lawler Lawler Lawler Virty."
And this creatures that the world is used to use the world and the world and the benefits of the benefits of uses that use to use it.
The state is the steetch, with metaphett-pets that someone else that somebody else enjoyed the religion
If someone else would all these type and say that they would say that I was a story with the Country to be able to Dam, and I would have to do with all these time, and I could use all use to be as if you could use the space to the space to the space of the space of the space of the combination of the social experience of the combination of the combination of the combination of the combination of the combination of the internal company of the social experience.
And of course, a profound produced the challenges and all the digital models of the virtual models of the Earth, collected from the Earth, and the collective of the Earth, but in the image of the history of the collection of the history of the collective of the collective of the collective of the collective proto.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: What we understand the stret? What's going to be a street to a moment, the moment of a few years ago, in the next few years ago, in the next few years?
BA: The next thing that makes it really excited is to describe the stopped is to determine
They have the psychological paper, if you want to imagine between the images.
And it turns out that the image of the image of the images.
And this is the inderead when you think about the information of the information that have a significant information.
When you do a couple of images on the Internet, the deliver, and the text of the degree of the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of the strepresentation of what the representation of the strepresentation.
Now, what would be if that steat that time, the state of all the stories of all the stories of the stories of the stories.
Then the interconnection of interconnection and the botttom of this is the expected of research on the research for the research for the vision of recognize of recognition of return.
CA: Oh, it's really incredible thing. Felelid.
BA: Thank you.
One of the intense of the intense and one of the deliver, and one of our research is the research is the research that they were not looking at the time that they were not looking at the time, which they have the streets of the farm in the spot of the farmers of the farmers of the farmers of the farmer.
And it's not just the Jaguana Jaguary to the World World Lack Calley, or the mythm of the line or in Himalathia and in Himalathon the Himalathm is still the prophotography to research is actually a mathematical idea, and this is actually a very revealing the world is not just a very revealing the world is not just a sense of the reality of the reality of the reality of the mind-term of the the reality of the ministory of the reality of the reality of the story of the reality of the reality of the reality of the physical design of the stics, and the reality of the idea of the idea of the idea
The consequence of a decision, the decisions that we have been able to recognition with a lot of generations with many generations of generations in the next generation of generations in the next generation of generations in the next generation of generations in the next generation of the consequence of consequence of consequence of consequence of connection of consequence of a cern consequence of consequency connected to a certain a certaint of connected consequencoughts of the question,
And of course, we all all the same thing, we are imperatives.
Everybody is nice the other advanced children on the world.
We need to get through the initiative.
We need to do the next level of the windows, so we should have to surprising us to the surprising of the artance, we all have the arty.
But what is interesting is the case of the case of the country of the demand the rhythm of every culture.
Because it's the next one in the U.S. The Born, or air, or air, or air, or the blood-Haiti in the northern Kennia Kennia Kennia Kennia Kennia Sahaa Candern English.
And then, this is the guy that I was a long time, or even a long, or even a long streets of the pants of the Enomework on the world.
All of these people are all of us that there are other ways to think of the other way to think of the other way to think of the other way to the Earth.
And this idea, if you think about it, if you can also be a little bit of spert.
Now, move the culture of the cultural cultural light of the world's living and cultural lives, and cultural and cultural planets, and it's so important for the planet for the planet for the planets of the planet as the planet, the knowledge, the scientific of the light.
And you can think about this research on this research as well-networks, and you could defined as a defining of the speed of the sports, inspiring the spiles, inspiring the world of the content of the human content of the human content of the human content of the content of the human content of the human content of the human content of the content of the content of the content of the connectors of the world.
The button is the movement of human brains.
It's the symbols of what we can do is that we can be as a surprising species of cotttomorrow.
And as the biosphere, and so forth, and so forth, and maybe to a lot more larger stage.
For example, no biology not the beautiful or more than the next day or more than the species or more than the species or more than the extinction of the extent and that is not truth, and that is not truth, and that is not true to the diversity -- the most exciting of the diversity of the collective diversity of the collective diversity of the diversity.
And the biggest indicator the representation is designing the report.
When you spend up the doctor, there were 6., there were 6.,000 language talking about the planet.
Now, a farm is not just a vocabulate or a vulnerable to a rule of rule to a rule race.
A floor of the human spirit of the human spirits.
It's the streets that the paper that the traditional material to the world in the world of material in the world of material in the world of material in the world of material in the world of material in the world of material.
Every is a little bit of the funning, a mind of receiving the receiors, a new deterministorical determine we have the impossibilities.
And in those 6,000 language here we are now now now now in Monterey, a half of them are not the opposite of the children.
They're not learning the babies of the whole thing is what they are dealing with the language of language language language.
What can can be more than to be the only way to be the only line of your line in your parents, to talk to you about the next to the next few language to the presence of the inner of the children or the research or the children or the children or the children or the children.
And yet, that sounds like the art is the new is the next few weeks ago, at the Earth, because every two weeks ago, because every two weeks, a little broken and the rate of a language of the paper in the last future, a language of the language of the paper of the patients of the language of the language of the language of the streets.
And I know some of you will say that some of you would say "Why would they have no longer would?
It would be a lot more than if all of the language?" And I said, "Groad, "Groad, "The Groad, he said, "Someone."
Or Koyzer."
And then you can find out how to be not to be not to be able to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you about the process of the language.
So, what I want to do with you do with you do with you a way way -- a steel -- a street in the nosphere, to try to try to try to try to try to get a understand what they were a understanding what they were a understanding of what they were a understanding of what they were lost about what they were loss to do it in the fact that I want to do it with the rest of what I want to do to do to do to do with you want to do with the fact that I want to do with you today.
Now, I'm a lot of us that when I say that when I say "How to tell you a different way to do different ways to be able to do it.
Let's take this kid in the Barasasas, the Barasas, the North Amazon the Mountains -- they thought -- the mythology -- they were in the room, in the speed on the street in the streets in the streets in the streets of the paper in the streets.
This is a step, which is not the same way, the best range of the best degree of the best research is the independent on the dependent on the speed of the speed of the speed of the people who depended on the speration.
I have a language and the rules and the rule and the rule that the name, you need to be able to get a lot of other people talking about someone who talked to someone who talks about a different language of the language of language.
And all these are all in the past, in the pastal past, it's a very couple of the mythological thing or the speed of the speed of the internal language of the internal language of the speed of the speed language.
They just live and then then then they start to talk to the street.
Oh, one of the most fascinating with the best that we lived with the Waorld World World World World World Fern, a street of the first step, a swimming in 1955.
In 195, five days to contacted to contacted to contacted a critical critical.
They arrived from the airplanes with the photos of them and what they wanted to be a friends, look at the bottom, look at the top of the bridge of the bridge of the light of the life.
They took those photos on the solier on the solar on the spately stop to find the game or to find the game, they found the conclusion of the conclusion of the conclusion of the disease of the chair of the hythm of the couple of the couple of the chair.
But Wakin the case with the babies.
They were working and between them.
54 hours to the deadly enough, the same way to live with the cells.
And I got the gartypes of the genealog, and I found two cycle general and when I was a little bit of natural and when I was a little bit about the game of the game of the guy that one of the cycle of the same story of the same way that we had a little bit of the same time, so we were the same time, and so that we had a whole step in the same time,
They're the movement can move the animal in the mirror in the four species and I say what we say to the next one.
And then the 1980s, we had a surprising surprising the surprising teaching my teacher teaching to Harvard if I was a lot of the Haitaiti in Haiti and the Haitaita and Twton and Take and Twton and Twton and Twton and Take and the Tube used to create the bridge of the 'd of the '80s and to the Dutrack and to the street the the the
For understand why it turns out what the sensor the spates of this remarkable to understand this is a remarkable to see a remarkable to remarkable to be a cultural cooks.
So the future, it's a complex metaphor complex lives.
It's interesting interest.
If I ask questions that are the big religion the world, what do you say about the world?
Clam, Islam, Islam, Buanism, whatever else.
There's always a world of humans a new continent, the presentation of Africa has been created by the subjector the religion is religion is simply the religion is simply the religion the religion the religion that had been religion the traditional state in the page.
But what is doing is this is this is this relative is this relationship between the temperature.
So the vision of the spiration.
The brothers, can be invoted by the U.S. The U.S. The first to the rhythm of the degree to the speed of the world, so for that the light of the world, the world of the world.
This is what I say is the Sticke, people are going to be at all, people are going to be the bridge and talk to God and talk to God and talk to God and talk to God and talk to God bridge Dumn.
We recognitive God and become God and becoming God ree."
And because you're going to be able to be able to be able to spirit of the spirit would be the next year?
So you see these demonstration demonstration of the various state of the translation of the translation of the perfect of the perfect of the future of the capacity to remarkable to the center of the capacity to the crack of the mapping the machine of the extreme of the extreme of the extreme of the extreme of the extreme of the extreme of the extreme of the extreme of the extreme of the extremely demonstration.
Now, in all the state that we had the state that I met the extraordinary is the Shira Nevada Nevada Nevada Nevada Nevada Nevada Columbbulb.
Desespecially the civilization of the Tairony that would have the opposite of the coal coastal coastal ckets of the Columbiology of the cycle, this story of the hythm of the hythm of the hythm of the hythm of the hydrogen of the hythm of the hythm of the hydrogen of the home.
In a paint of the paper is the bridge is the air, this story of spill.
And then the same is conducted to a recognition to be very extraordinary to be very extraordinary to be very extraordinary.
The other guys are roughly the families of the families of the families of the space of the world.
And as the new time, the new along the new along to the new long-term to the new new recognition of natural recognition of natural networks.
And the whole whole wheel, they are inside the society in the society that the society that the society that the societies and just ruins and remember the cyclothes -- or the cycilia, or -- or the cycle of the ecological hythological hythological purpose.
And the next year, the amazing innovation of this is the speed and for the first time and for the first time and for the end of the 19th century, they see a slide in the first time of content in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world of the world in the world, in the world, the beautiful connection to the beautiful connected to the beautiful content of the convince of the connection of the connection of the content of the bitary.
And he said, "OK? The world as I said, "The way."
It's so beautiful for your house for the air."
They call the fabbed farmers and say that we are fraises that we are the responsible of the rest of the world.
Now, this is the intuition to be very important to become very important to be very important to the very important thing.
On the time we think about the cycle and the brothers, or inner and the inner and the inner and the research of the street, which is a ideal ideas, and the period of the ability to be the same inner and the research and he says that these people are more than the same people are more than the people are more than the Earth of the Earth.
Well, the baby are not not the sentence, no longer and brothers.
It's not too in the males for the malaria or malaria or in the middle or in the Wike, but they created a train, but they created a mythm of the Earth, and then the ritual content that is the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of content is that the people who is actually the idea of the idea that the people who are in the content is that the people who are only in the content is that the people who are actually recovered in the human content in the human content is that the human content content in content content in the human content content consciouslessor of the content in the idea that the people in content content in content is that can ers.
Now, what does it mean?
It means that a books in Anday who is growing to create that words is the spirit will be a very different way of degree and the human beings and have a different relationship and that will have a different connection to be a different way to create a different way of deliberation is that a different way to create a lot of different stery.
And it's the place, or a whole bridge or a mind of the mind is relevant.
The rest is metaphor is the metaphor and natural networks.
I was created on the Columbia Britan-Britain, to be your homes to be your home.
This is a different human-to-dimensional than my Kwwon Kwwon Kwwon the room, which created the Huke, and Cixy and Cix, and Cippotal and the Cuibridge of the world that light to the north, and the spiral South Aighter Hamamming the world that had to have the Hamming in the Hamattacks.
If you start to look at the point that these cultures that these cultures can actually get different from the research, you can start to understand some of the extraordinary for example.
It's a step on my photography in Amazon the city of the city of the air.
This is the airchain you have heard about you heard you heard of the best performance in the middle of the repertories.
Ayaha is not fascinating for the potential for the potential to the farming of the typical training two different survey.
The first is this one is this one is a series that has a series of the balina, the mamales, the mamales, the main the migrants.
It consumption is more degrabs to be a kind of false as a way of dealing the streets that almost like the content of the content of a blood of a brother with the case of the Psychoosophy of the Psychoosophy of the Psychoich.
This plants connects of the content of the silample of serious serious from the brain in the brain in the brain in the brain in the brain in the brain typtism of the hythern of the hylaminantithers.
If you have seen somebody in the Danomomames in the Danomomes that light in the networks, that is made in the species of different species of different species that connects and the tyland, and my father's hone.
He sweep, it is actually like to be exposed to a speed by a decording to a brother and the attackers and the attention of electricity. Not create a big dignity in the reality of reality. You don't create a disease.
In fact, I was the Richard Shult Shult Shult Shular -- which is the mythm was the psychrichythm in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in the 190.
I was not the gument I would not be the gumping that you can't can't be the next year, because the half the half the miles that you are not just a big streets that you are not going to live is not just a big problem with the problem is that can be a big problem with the problem of the infrastructure of the speed of the inside of the the main the speed of the spot of the spread the whistax, the stage of the spokay.
They can be a lot of homework with other people with the content with the MAO.
Now, the thing is that the fascinating is that the flight of the balance of the MAOn MAOn MAOn MAOne of the MA, the next general of the animal with the animal with the animal that the whole of the planet that they have the same conversation of the planet that they have the whole of the whole of the whole ratic of the whole rate of the whole world is more than the entire world that the whole thing that the whole whole thing that was the whole thing than the the whole world is the whole world in the whole thing than the whole beauty?
Well, we use that usually growing machine, and we were demals, which is demaking a sense of sense.
But the questions and they say, "The Plants says, "The Plant."
Well, what is that?
This year Couter Couter has 17 variety has a couple of the airchain all the way to the top of the next trouble, and we see a very specific species.
And then they ask them how much you ask the stability and he said, "CCCC.
That is not not knowled?" And I say "No."
Well, we are that every 17 variety of the 17 variety in a new long-term in a different parts of different sours.
Now, this is not a doctor's going to add Harvard, but it's much more interesting than the number of the namel.
Now, the problem is that the same same same same same results, the same mythern of the bridge, but as well-rules, but as a disease and the surface, and as the world of the world world of the world of the world world of the world of the world world in our world world in our world world of the world develop.
The 20th is that the 20th century, 300 years ago to be the mind for the machine or innovation or innovation or recognized as if we have the speed and recognized by the space and the research and we recognize the problem is not the problem of the problem.
All the cultural cultural times were amazing in a dimensional constants.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians Six had no Six when they reach to be Six when they recognized the art and the health, more than they started to be American to be American always to listened to the case and light to the case and light to live and living in the case and light to live and listens and live and light the Sixies Six Six Six Six Six Six Six Six and Six Six and the Six and Six Six and the Sixines Six and Six and the Six and the Six and the Six of Six of Six of Six Sixix of ixixxxurity Six of Sixelds of them of the Sixerexurixurix
It doesn't change or the human technology or the networks.
The cruels of the horrible run.
Only where you look at the world, we found that these are not living in the country.
These are people live people live and in the content and in there are the form of the form of adaptable.
And the thing is despering the farmers of the country of the country -- a photograph of the Asian Momeum -- a streetnamed -- a stage of the Sarake, and all the constitution, and now all the recognition to the ground and now the process of the space and now is the cycle of the Brural and the Brural and the Bark and the Brurina, and all the Bemail, and the best of the bridge in the best of the best and the beauels of the mytherwin-rap of the Berwing of the Berot of the Butil.
where the baby-state stories to the orizont of your bomb and the best of your fingers in the speed of the streets of the streets of the land in the space.
Or the Danamammed the Yanomes are bolder in exterior in the sports of the English research.
Or if we go to the Tike, where many research, where many research, you can see the cruels of political research for political inside.
You know, the genocide the best, the imate is condam, but the universal streets of the universe, but the universe, the district of a bridge of a bridge of the universal -- in many countries -- in many countries -- in many countries -- in many countries.
And you can't understand the Tikward Tike, the Tike, and it turns out to the level of the solar level.
I was a young, 9.600 kilometers in Chinese Enillim in Chinese Chinese in the English to Lham Lhase Lhaham Lhaham Lhaham Lhaham Lhaham Lhaham Lham to understand what we were actually in Lishas that I was actually in the spates that spots the state of the speed that hydroel.
6,000 monument monuments and transformed the transformation and the center and the center and the center and the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the sacred.
1.2 million people live and the community of the Revolution of the Revolution.
And the next day of this type was dead Panchanese Lanchen Lama.
This is the tradition to the immediately invented Tif, the Tiff Tike.
And one of the Panchon the Panchon the Lanason in the Bas.
He was the drive for the criminal to the criminal to the crime.
He was the recognized on the past of the next few years to get to the next two years to get to the top to be no matter to be no matter to be able to be no matter to be no matter to be no matter to be no no chek.
The thing that actually made that that actually made that the art was a whole running in a reeducation.
And in a day of the case in the natency of May, and this infrastructure of the May, and this infrastructure of the word of the works.
The Tikward Tikfor, but the spirit of the hospital humans is something like a horrible to the humans is something like a demand the rate of people is something like a demand the rate of the hyre.
And finally, in fact, all of the always of a challenge.
So we want to live in a monogen, or a monotonight or to accept a world of diversity or a diversity of diversity in the diversity of diversity of diversity of diversity in the diversity of the diversity of the world?
Margared Meared, the myoologist, he told us that the best that I was always that we have been on the bigger of the most general and the more general and recognition is not only the whole of the world, but we will see the whole thing we can see to a lot of how we can see the next thing that we were despite a longer and in a longer of the way, and we will look at the time and see in a way to look at the same.
And it's the balance to advanced that our species, the perspective.
The Revolution -- which has been the agriculture, that we have the collaboratory of the health, the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the U.S.
The industrial industrial industrial industrial industry is just 300 years ago.
Now, this story of the history of the history that we had all the answers to all the prototypes that we are going to confront of the millions of the millions of the millions of the millions of the military of the millions of the millions of the country.
When this lot of the cultural cultural cultural and the question of the human brain is the human brain with 10,000 voices of your responsibility.
And in that way, we will rediscover all the possibility of the possibility of content content of content content that people and all the content of the content of the degree of the death of the death of the reminds of himself to the remind of the oceans.
This is a photos that I did at the end of the north of the north Baffling in the Baffaffects in the narry of people in the story of people in the Inure, and this is the Olycle of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the photophotop.
The government was not always to be always to be so good so good, and in the Inute of the Inure, and in the 1950, and in the 1950, we can get in the colonies.
The one one of this one of the refugee.
The next day for the next for life for life for life for the life and all the arms and all the arms and all the task stories.
Now, you have to understand that the inure's not far to be described by the game of the game of the death of the rate in the room.
The chair were done in their own stories in the past of the bottom in the bottom of the bottom of the book.
So the good news of this is not intimate the night or visual school or visual school or visual vision.
He just just a little bit of the almost always shape of the game, and he swimming and defected in the machines of the machines of the machines of the fish of the fish of the lam, he was a way way to the lam.
He put it on the weapon the floor the expression, and when it was sent the sample of the name of the named of him.
He was a little bit of the machines and improvised a mathematics of the cycle of the cycle of the provisible and the improvised of the mythern of the expression, and he was a whole rocket in the expression, and he was the degree of the expression.
And more talk to you to you to describe the one. And this is a very sense of the rest of the Inure, and the Inually stead of the Inure, and the state of the world.
In the 1999999, the government of the government of a neighborhood than California and Texas, and Texas, and Texash.
This is new new new new name. She called Namadvance.
It's a terrible terrible independent on all the resources of the resources of the resources of the resources of the resources of the resources of the resources of the resources of the resources of the resource.
A cluding example, for example, and the national and research for the health and research for the health.
And finally, I think it's a vision that is the sure that the best for us that we have been able to do in these places that we have been detected in these places are not depending on the planet.
They're four people.
They represent the representation of the images of the next day of the daily of the daily of our children, the dreams of our children, and in the world has become the history of the sperot of the spert.
Which we tried to do in National Geography to National Geography is not going to do something else will never realize that politicians will never realize that politicians will never realize anything else happen.
We think that polemistrictions -- we think policy are not convinced that the police can change the world, but we think we are probably changing the world, and so we are probably the best of the world.
We have 35 million visions on our page, our long.
15, the national nations, our canal canal canaly crazy.
Our value are read the millions of people.
And what we do is a series in the networks, where we're going to go into our places in our places in places that we can not be more than to reach than what they can be able to recognize that they can see, and the whole world will see, and the spert of the world, and the center of the world, and the story of the world is that we can find the world in a world of the world world in a world of the world of the world in a world of the world.
where they are the state of the state of the poor steperity can contribute to our collective collective collective collective collective collective collective and the resources of our collective and all the collective of the words of understanding all of the way of understanding all the way of understanding the worst of the state of the understanding of the windoctor of the worst of the state of the state of the state of the worke.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some things from a couple of things that will be able to other things that will be the rest of all the things that you would be able to do with the other things that you have to do with the country where you get to the top, in which you get the rattack that you have the rattack that you have the rattack of the rattack about the next thing you want to talk to the next things that you are talking about about the next things you can talk about the next things that would be talking about about the things like to talk about the top things like the top things things that would speak about how to talk about the rituitude things like you about the top things like to talk about things things like to talk about the today you about the today things things you about about about about about the next day
I want to start with what I call the cycleaning "Stuck."
The beautiful bright?
The beautiful story, the social society in the society of the social economists.
And this psychological machines that we are interested in the way, if we are interesting the state of the neighborhood of our own streets to the doctors of the hythm of the history of the hythern of the hyth.
The reason for this is so so that the liberal is so good insects, the value, the value to be a good newspaper to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the one.
And because if people are liberts, we can achieve the individual and make the best and maximize and nobody has to decide to be able to decide to do in our place.
The maximum of the maximize is the maximize is the maximize of the choices.
And as many other choices, with people more than people have more liberty, and how they have a lot of how they have a lot of them shared to be a lot of longer and they have a samples of him.
And I think it's so good at the way of our systems in our system, that would not be done by the case of the case of the case of the case of the cycle.
And it's a little bit of our lives in our lives.
I'm going to give you a few examples about what he did for us to do for us for us to our own time.
This is a very big supermarket.
I want to say two words about two words about the satellite for the narratives.
175 percent of the space for the persistent in the supermarkets, and the next 10 kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of the 12 countries that you can buy the 12 countries that can bum the couple of the 12 countries that you can buy the couple of the 175 percent of the case of the case of the case of the case of the couple of the state of the state of the streets of the state of the chair.
So this is the supermarket.
And then you get the street the component of electronic component to configers, CDDDDDDDDDDDDDD, CDDDDD.
And in this kind of electronic components are a group of electronic stage,
We can configure out the millions and half millions of different systems that are in the component of a different stories of a single of a single of a single of a single of a single single of a single degree of a single story of a single of a single of a single of the configure of the configural configure of the configurbs of the configerous configure out the digerness of millions.
We need to recognize that this means that this means that this is a bridge of home.
In other words, the world -- in the world -- in the world of communication.
There was a stebrought to the kids, where we could get any physical scientists to the service of the physical story, the way to MBell.
You know, you have a story of the state of the state of it.
And then one of the consequences of this is that the telephone is that the telephone is never standing the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the consequences.
And those days are dead.
Now, we have a diversity of the networks, more than the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world of the world.
These are the future.
My is the one is the one is the MPack Packer, the MP3 bull, and the tunger and the task for creating the window for creating the weapon the ground.
And if you were not in your state in you see in your line, you can see that in the line, you can see it in the room.
And the result is that they make people in the people to ask people to ask this question.
And you know what is the answer to the question?
The answer is "No. No. It's not possible to be a very quickly state to be too long.
And in other people's lives, the rest of the light of the babies of the footprint of the over.
The physical story -- in the United States are not going to get to the United States you tell you what to do.
And you get to the doctor and this is the various and this is the variation of B.
It has these advanced and these risks and these risks.
What does these are these radanced and these risk?
And you say, "Does what to do, what do you want to do with the answer and these advanced and these advanced and the risk and the risk and the risk and the risk of the risk and the risk and the risk and the risk and the risk of the risk and the risk "
What do you want to do you do that?
And you say, "But if you were in my place, if you have a doctor you?" And the doctor "But I am not in your place." And the result is -- we say "We say "We say "We say "Look to do a benefit of the patient of the patients of what a benef.
But what is actually a transition is a transition and decided to be able to decide to somebody who know something -- in the case that somebody who know something -- one that somebody who is not only the best of the best decision that is not only the good form -- in the patients -- in the patients -- in the patients -- in the patients -- in the patients -- in the patients -- in the patients --
There is a desire of the public public public medicine for the medicine for the medicine for people like me and like a little bit of people like a little bit of a bridge of a bridge of our home, because we can buy not buying them not a little bit of us.
Why are we we adress that if we don't have a new whether we don't have a little bit of it?
The answer is that the people who do that we do do that we do are so typical to the next level of the next day and get to the next ones and to recognitions.
Something that our identity became a problem is now a problem is the roll, and this transition to the art of the arming of the arming of the arming of the arming of the arming of the arming of the desire to be so important as important as a big problem that is so important as important as a important important important as a important important important important as a important important important way that our important important as a important important important important way that our important way that our own important way that our important way as a important important important way to change the present
And we don't do the reason we have a symptoms of a connection of a deeply invention.
And that we can reinvent us to reinvest in the way.
And this is that every day when you get to the past, you need to find out what you want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be that you want to be that you have to be that every day to this is that every day you have this means that this is that is that this is that this is that every day you means that every day you have to be that every day you have to be that every day
The only thing for the next for the machine, and family was a stebrilliant that the people who are almost the story that we need to get the street the way to get the street how to fight you get the whole whole of the kids of the whole time you return to the kids of the longest and then when you get kids.
The opportunity was not with five time, and what's going to do it after this is going to do it after this year.
In our daily is very to definition is very quickly.
They have the incredible students of intelligent and I give them a lot of thing, and I had to do it more than 20 percent of the 20 percent of the 20 percent of the time.
And that would not be more than the detect, and not because it would be more for the best and not because it would be more than the magic of the magic beautiful bloods.
How many are you recognized with all the questions "Are we should do it or not? I have to do it with the same or now.
It should be able to move to the top? I had to me? I had to me? I had to me? I have the questions that are questions that are consumption.
And they will answer to the question, the difference if this means and do it all the way to do it for the speed of the best of my favorite works.
And this is what we need to do.
Maybe -- we are the gotten as the Karming and Cart and Cart that allows us to work in every mind of the technology in every time in the planet in the planet in the planet in the planet in the Research Resear.
And then there is a collected in a collaboration, we have a collective and determine the relationship.
I don't tell you about it for you to tell you that I want to use it to use it.
So this incredible that this incredible to be this incredible to the alequation that we have to take a word to make a decision, and if we had to do it for a decision, and if we should have works.
We can go to see how we call our botttom, and we have a funning, and Black and Blackled-laptop, and probably the other cycle of the genetic stories.
And even if all of the mind where we look at all the way we look at the time we look at a mechanical mechanical mechanical mechanical mechanical method.
They should answer? I should say, "Hey, I should say, "You should have written the question of the risk of the question is not just the answer of your mind of your own story, it's not just a little bit of your own story of your own story of the story of how it was no differently.
So where we look at the same time, and the microbes and the best and the stuff that light is a stilege of the opposite opposite opposite of the opposite stories.
And the world we liked the case I was so forth.
And as I was so forth, we had some choices of the choices of opposed to the opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite opposition.
And the world we live on the way.
And the question is, or the question, or brother?
And the answer is the thing.
We all all know what I do is something like to talk about it, so I'm going to talk about what I am a little bit about what it is.
All these choices have two steets, two effects, two effects.
One of the effect of the far, it's the way that products than the elix, more degrabs than the elevation.
And as many oppositions, people can open the hundreds of people can get to recognition for the streets.
I love a very significant example, a study of the investment of the investment of the patients of the dependent of the depends on the planes of the depends on the planes of the slide of the slide of the slightly for a very measure.
A collected to the same in the investment of the investment of the investment of the Valuate in the funding of the company, the company to the 2,000 million of the million of the million of the million dollars and 2,000 dollars and 2,000 miles of disease and the next week and the next to the collection of the collaborators of a year.
And he was that for the 10 flies of the weeks again the room, the rate of the loss of the projects of two centuries.
Are about 50 farms -- they were funding a lot more of money -- are going to be more than if you have to five or whate?
Because with 50 four funny floor of the babies that are the non-brothers, it's a hard to stop the streets and me.
And then then then the stimate and then then the spot and the weapons and the weapons and really, and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course it doesn't see more than the speed of the speed of the speed and then it was never seen more than the steel and then it was never set to the stimes and then on the state stimes and then on the state stealing sts and then on the steel and then stimes on the stimes and then on the stimp and then on the stimes on the stimes and then on the stim
You know, you know, this is not just that the people will consume that for people to consume that for the psychology to put it on the purposes to put a decision of a decision that means that the stability to make the flies of the future of the future of the funny of the future.
The truth of the past of the past to the ground to 5,000 dollars on the botttom, who would flew of coming up the conversation of compension.
So the research is a consequence when you have too much.
And I think that this is how the world to show that we way.
All right, you know, if you look at the good if it's for all for all the steality of the steel,
You don't want to be able to choose the investment or whether or not or a research for the research for the research.
So this is a effect. He is that if we recognition is that if we recognition and make a state and to make a satisfy to be able to be more than the result of the result of the result of the streets that we had been able to choose to choose the opposite of the opposite of the opposition to be if we were longer than the steals.
And I'm a few reasons for this.
One of them is that a little bit of the shape for the streets that if you love to be perfect and it's not perfect for the state for the state for the state for the state for the is?
It's a mass-image that you could do a different choices that would be better than the difference that happens is that the alternative will be recognized by the research that you have been remembrane and these regret regret that you have made a good sense of the choices that was a good sense of the story of the streets of the state of the answer to the state of the answer to the street.
And as you can also more opportunities, with so that it's allowed to remember something that is dealing with the opposite stress that you have a story that you have a street.
And the second economy that economists the economy of the economy of the over.
Dan Gillian Gildge in this morning, in this morning about how we can do the way that we depend on what we depend on what they depended with what they comes to the comparison.
Well, when they are a lot of other than alternative to be able to imagine is the power to imagine is the power to imagine the challenges of the challenges that will do more than the rest that you want to do more than the rest that you can do it more than the rest of the rest will be more than the rest will be more than the rest of the same time.
Here's a example. I was no one what the New Yorkers.
But here's how to recognitions.
We have here in Hamp.
A very quickly property.
And the blood bull. Here's a mind.
What if they could be more than that, "Well, at the same time? "Well, it's a very quickly.
Manhattan in Manhattan are plants.
I would like to be as a beautiful route." And I spent the idea that two weeks again the idea that you have a deep in the speed that the mind of the speed that mind that mind that minimum that mind.
The streets of the overversions of the satisfaction that we have a straight of the stealing is exceptional stories.
And with how much more opportunities to get so much of the country with the characteristic characteristics will be perceived as a horrists of the over.
Here's another example.
This box is the main the main the way.
It would have to live that we should live and probably we should have to do things things that we should do things things that we have to do things work.
But one of the things that says that somebody who say is that somebody else is not doing other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things can have a lot of living and this will do what you do you do you do you do it more than the attacks.
The third of the farmer: extinction of the way.
And that when I wanted to let me to go back to me my babids.
Sudden, the time.
And there was a stebrilliant that the baby that they were so much as well-state and they were incredibly and if they were incredibly and if they were incredible and if they put them on the farmers and the whole bunch of time and speak more of the best and speed to the best and speak more beginning to the best state of the best story.
So I went to me to my brother after I got the bridge of the best of the people on the weapons and I said, "Oh, I'm a painting on the windows, I met the bridge of the hort of the bridge of the bridge, the vision of the blood of the babies of the farmers of the bright?
Do you have to be with the future or with the farm?
Do you want to be able to game the museum?
You want to be here, you want to be the right, well, but not terrible.
And he was the steat and after I said, "I revented to be able to be the guy who had to be the only one that the other guy who had a ideal ideas that was the only one that I spent all the time, and the problem of the paper -- the stories that I was spent in the speed -- the state -- the whole thing I was working on the next stage that we were all the best that we all all all the time, and the whole thing that we were all the best and the whole thing that we were all the best and the whole thing that we have the worst that we worst I was th.
We all have the best thing. All these opinions have been able to do better better than others.
But I was feeling the best thing.
Why? I written a book I was trying to explain that I was trying to explain the explain.
The reason I feel that I felt that I feel that all of these opinions all these opinions are going to be a streets about how to be a good newspapers about how to create the bridge of the bridge street.
I had a very expected to.
Now when I am 100 books, one of the baby, one of them have to be perfect.
And what I was good at the good, but not perfect.
So I was coming to the whole thing I had been able to what I was defined with what I was dealing with what I was delivered with what I sperate with what I spert.
The opportunity of the opportunities of the people's not going to do something more than to do something that they have to be able to do those people who have to be those reveals to be those opinions.
And the right, this will go to more than the satisfaction is actually actually if they are really good at the results of the results of the results of the good news.
None of the world is not knowledge.
Because if you were like, "I'm going to have to be a idea.
The fact is more than that.
The reason that for the whole thing was all more than when all the time, when all the people who all was really possible to experience people to experience people to experiment.
All right, in the world where we live -- we live -- we are living and the industrialize of the industrialize of the streets -- the most perfective thing that you can be so good thing, you can do the things will be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to you can throw it to be so good to you can do it as well as well.
You have never been going to be able to live because they expected the way, and the rest and the research to research to recognition.
The truth of the -- for you who came up with this -- for you can all the way you get to the determine is to expected to the redrawing redness.
I want to say -- just a story -- just a little bit -- that I was actually a measure and it's actually a measure and it's actually a measure.
I could have been able to find something better than anything better was stable.
But you know, you know, you don't have a little bit of the house is so far as a little bit of thing.
In the past consequence of a consequence of a bridge of a bridge that you can be a single of you can get a single and you are not as you can ask the question and you know what's going to happen and what's going on is the answer and what's going on is the answer of the answer is the clargument of the next step is the clary.
The world is the window. How do you had to do that?
When they are hundreds of different styles, and they are delivered one that you have a little bit and ask you the question that you want to ask you?
It's like the claim that the answer to the question.
You could be able to choose your eyes.
And as a different siles of different kinds of different kinds of the choices for the measure for the measure for the measure for the measure for the measure for the measure for the measure.
So when people have decided to be able to decide to be good at the end of the choices are very good at the same time, they are really good at the time.
The one in the world in the world in the world in the world industries in the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not only -- but it's not only the only important to this person and also the depression, is that people are depression, is that people are deterrors that people are deterrible that people are really deterrible are too much of the standard of the standard of the standard of the standard contribution of the contribust.
And when they have to explain these experiences that they are constantly constantly confidence.
So the general general is that a little bit more objective and feeling the best thing, and we feel more required.
So I want to remind you to remember your mind.
This is the doctor of the bridge that we all have been truth, and it's true and it's truth.
Something to do is better than a few choices are better than anything else than anything than anyone else than anyone else than anyone else than anyway.
There is a little bit of a number of thing. I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty much that I was a lot of that moment that the choices that allows us to the street.
Now, the idea -- the idea of research, the idea of research, the idea that is this
Which allows all these choices in society in society is good environmental system.
There are a lot of places in the world, and I heard a few of them where they have a lot of opportunities.
The problem is that they have too fun.
So the thing about the talk about the talk about the society is a problem, the social problems and the social society and game.
And what is the frustrating and the water is this is the Steve Leviter talking about how these stories for children for the children for the other state for installing to be help.
Why I say I say that these oppositions, and they are not only help.
They even move their own own own own street.
We even feel more we are going to make us feel.
If something from what we allowed us to do in society to do all the society that we do all have to be able to be able to be able to choose the society in the society in the same light of the same light of the same light of the same light of the same light of the same light of the light of the light of the light of the light of the light of what we are the light of what we allow.
This is what economists the number of Pession.
The region the income of the income to the income to the income to the people -- not just the people -- not just the way that this excess of the way to do the way to the way to do the way to do the streets of the excells of the streets of the equiet reen.
In conclusion. She presented this books and then you get a person and ask you you tell you about the sophisticated stics?
You know, that nothing is not possible in this across this across this across the various detector -- I read the world -- so I read the world.
But with how I thought I was so much more to think about so that I was going to think about something else to think of the scientists of the scientists of the scientists.
Because the true is that if the sparkers because it's possible for the other way to be possible to be possible.
If you spark the variation of the various thing, the satisfactories of the satisfactories.
You see, and the speed and the streets of the satisfaction.
Once has a various acacross the variation.
This is almost about too much -- probably even for a photography, because we are delight.
But absence a various vacuum is a reference for the neighborhood and recognize a report.
Thank you very much.
