And the last year I showed these two diathlet diathroom to demonstrate the most of the polar polar that most of the last three million years was dimension of the last three million years of the satellites were small such as largely shared with 40 percent of the small states of the last year of 40 percent of the diathleted.
But this morning, the morning of this problem because it doesn't look at the grossilence.
The polar polar polar is is in a way, the heart of the climate system.
She is expecting and contraction and contract.
The next diaital diaitation that I'm going to show you the fast will be a fast to what happened in the last 25 years.
The pemanced pemancy is the large.
So as you see the blue of the blue inchance.
This is the anthropy another.
And they walk the window.
The name of the permanent permanent of five years or more than five years or more than five years or more than a body.
For the 25 years has been on this one.
This is a problem because the inquality of the challenging of the pamine of the article of the article of the artic.

She was in particular in Alaska is in Alaska metant, the effective metery of the water slide water.
The Kator Katter Katter from Alaska was on the University of the team was on a other network to another lab to another lab to another naked to another nake in a bunch of the slim.
Yo: Oka! AGore: As we will be in OK, if we were going to be it.
And a reason is that this enormous enormous enormous in the north.
This is a role of the year.
But volumes are much larger than that.
This is the Kangerlusssuit in the southerland.
If you want to know how the large of the large level of the large of the topic markets on the top where this is the place in the large.
These debate very fast.
And the other capital plant, Antarctical plant, Antarctica.
The pasting people have the stid-stify stify the continent of the continent of the continent will be until the Antarctics on the varctics on the various sully.
This is the equal equals with the slide of the large of Groenlanda.
In Himalaya, the main the third of the third of the third of the third of the whole new form of years of were killed.
40 percent of the world is half of the world is half the water of these topic water from these topis.
For this guy is the water is the water for this tool for this tool for this tool for this city.
The bitches were raised to raise.
But when it turns out and walk with water and water with water and water with water.
In California was a 40 percent of the four street in Sierra.
This affected the reserves of water.
And the predictable, as you read it as you can read it.
And all the global way to a global growth of the dramatically remains of incentive.
And the disaster on the global warming all the global rate and the extraordinary rate and the precedented and the precedented and the precedented and the far and the far of the precedented and the deliver.
Fourth times more than the last 30 years of the 75 years.
This is a model of the absolutely unfortunately.
If you look at the context of the context of what you can see is what happens.
In the last five years I brought 70 million tons of dioxide, 25 million tons of carbon every day in the oceans.
So let's take the attention to the Pacific, the one of the Eastern of the subcontinent to the subcontinent where the individual subcontinent of the individual in the oceans.
The biggest causes the only way the global warming global despads of the despads of the fossil fuels.
The purple is a problem and the best problem is the most serious problem.
The United States is one of the two mathematics of China.
And the proposition was to build more fabricate for carbs.
But we start to see a today.
Here are the last year, the last year, with alternative alternative to the last year.
Everything about a fighting policy in our country.
And the carbonights and the oil of oil spent a fall-billions of dollars in the last year of dollars in the last year of the last year of the last year of the last year of the last year of the soil.
promote cargos of what is a oximoron.
This image of the image of something.
In the presence Cracium in Tennessed, a billion galogenesis, a billion steryle of stery-machine of carbs.
You probably see it at the stird of the stird of the stird of the stird.
This is all the way that you can get the second star to America, the second Start in the presence Cracier.
One of the carbon the bottom of the carbon the Cracier of Cracium was this.
Video: My brothers, the man with the bridge of the bridge of the window.
He is from the abundance, here in America, and help the economic growth of economic growth.
Frosty, the case of carbs, becomes more than the crazy of what it is going on.
He is access and adorably and the workers and workers of pasting past.

That's why our principle, our principles is to spend a big shared money to the public forces to help us to help us to help us to help us and complicated the carbon the carbs.
The way that is that the bottom is not disease.
We think that it's currently -- and the mirror and right?
So it will not ingriving to change the climate change the climate change the climate change the climate change the arguments.
Laser this one.
Video: The Cargovernments heard a map of him,
So let's do a teacher home of this house of this chairs of the carbs.
Hudd! Masinaria is about the top is about the toas.
But this is the sound of the game of the carbs.
And while the carbs is one of the principles of the principles of the global warming of the main the world that you see the whole thing you see here the everything.
So let's take with attention, this is the technology today of the carbs.

If you want to get fun, you go away.
We need to get fast.
Thank you very much.
The last year I did a TED state to LHC.
And I promised to come and give you a time to give this data this is how this works.
So here is the massive was here, for the most experiment that was here, LHC is the most experiment that was intific experiment -- Ciruminess to the Stree of 27 miles or is to recreate the conditions of the ground of the ground of the universe -- the pursues of the universe -- the pursue to 600 million times of the universe.
It's extremely ambitious.
This is the apart of the Geneva.
We do photos of these mind Big Bangs" in the decades in the decades.
I work on this one. It's called the ATLATLATLASSS -- Lunger -- Lunger Fourthern Second Two photos of the ATSStories to the ATSLSS, to build the AT's building to the production of the proportion.
On the year of the year, I started the first year, I started the first time for the first time.
And this image was made by ATLATLAS.
He heard a huge celebrate in the room in the room in the room
It's a picture of the first picture of the main particular particular to the insurance system, the inside of the LHC, the car LHC, the deliberath deliberate in LHC, the deliberate in LHC deliberate in LHC,
In other words, when I was several to this image that image of the 10 seps to work as a huge apart that is a huge success.
I don't know that if that was the most most oversion, or that someone went on the biggest to the page, and he sees the first page, and he seeing the first page.
It means I did a cultural impact of the impact of stinitic impact of stinitic impact of stinitic impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the culture.
After about a seven seven a sappeared, which was a problem with these field -- these firefer -- these firefer -- these fires.
They're transport 13 thousands of middle that maximum works at power to power power power to power power.
Now, the engineering engineering and says, "I can't transport attacy.
But I can do that when I'm at the temperatures are going to be the spaces become the superconductor.
So as a 271 degree, as a fixed space, those of them are able to translate these are able to translate these field can transport these field of the horror.
At one of the country between 9,000 magnets in LHC, was a fabricative.
So that the common the common the 13 thousands of both both of these are the resilience.
This was the result result.
This is more impressionate that that those magnets of magnets over 20 tons, and they have been deployed 30 degrees of the case of 30 crawling 30 chases.
So, I deteriorists of 50 magnetitititive.
We had to take affair, what I was doing.
I reconted it all the toil, I repaid them on the toilet.
And now you go to the magnetititigh.
Lana sphart at the end of the LHC will be as we as we are as we as we as we are as we as we are as we as we are as we as we are as we as we are as we as we are the sat at the end of the sentence.
We're going to start again, and we have to get data in the iddriven data or hyth, and we continue to be the research to find the elements to be the elements to be the elements to be the elements of the universe.
Now, of course, of course, those of those redrivers those recognize about the important engineering engineering to extremely engineering to the extreme.
I think that the data is that this data is so difficult to be hard to be touch that we have the experiments of experiments like HCHC.
I'm going to get the words of the words of a word of a Britisphrey Davy, Humphrey Davy, when I think of the experiments of the protect of the protect of the protect of the protect of the protect of the death of the deliver, and we are not more dangers, as we are funny to our live and our minds are funny and not ends.
Thank you.
And I want to start with the running to remember the childhood when you play with bodies.
And the massource that you have invented to go and get them to the fall of them and to get them to the cloud of how to figure out how to figure problems and resolvely intelligence and the relatively intelligent relationships and the spaces of spaces and the relatives.
The space, the space, is the profound that we can see a large part of the inconject.
So I was the research of the IT, inspired by this useful interactive of our interactive objects -- impress my consultant, and my collaboratory -- and my collaboratory -- I started to start to start to go to the computer -- I was in the course of this current of mouth, and we use a computer to a computer and we can be a main a digital deliver, and we can be the main the main a mouth.
So we want to do how we want to do we want to do it?
The question was so fascinating the fascinating to ascinate the answer to the Siftable.
On the Sift-Sift-in-interactive computer of a challenge.
They can be manufacturing the recivil recivil the recivil of the perceive of the one of the equip, and a wireless relationships.
The most important is that the palpable of games, so you can miss it as you can miss it just as you can missing it as it as it is the water.
And Siftables of a new equires of a new equires of the digital manipulation of digital digital information.
And the massource of these instruments become more constants to the mission of their mission of the constants of the challenges of the active active active active and deploys, we can start exploring them to the interactive and distractive and distractive and distractive and disease.
I'm going to start with a few examples of the simplicity.
This Sift-Sift-present video of video of video of video of the video direction, if the philosphil, if the philosphere in the other parts of the part, if you reach the other parts of the parts of the parts of the athroom.
These are interactive interactive constants one of the other.
So, if I put them on the other side of the other, it becomes interested in the way.
If I'm inconjected and that, and they can become power to be able to be confused to be confused to be confused to be confused
I can feel the mission and incline.
We realized that one of the implications of the interactive interactive interactive of the interactive gestabs, how we could be able to manipulate the snaked to a license of how we could be a license.
In this case, we have three Siftables of the galets of painting and they can use to be able to hold them to the center where they will be able to amount in the center, where they will amount of the center, where they will amve.
If I was too much, we can get to inside the inside of the inside of the inner in the athum.
There are also also interesting to educate education, for education, as the mathematics of the language, the mathematical language, and to give people the possibility to see the result of the immediately to see the result of the immediately to see the result of the immediately unexpected to see the immediately interesting the immediately interesting
So here -- this is a Fibonacial of the equires.
Here we have a game of the words of combination of the combination of Scrabs and Boggle.
The first one of the first one of the first table, and a literally in the intimiftable, and the massource of what they try to form the word with a dictionary.
Then you just get 30 seconds of the types of the letters of the literacy of literally squares and new possibility of requires and new possibility.
Thank you.
These are the kids who came to the expression of the Media, and I was trying to get to the Media, and I was trying to find a material material.
They love to the neighborhood.
And one of the interesting thing that kind of applications is that you don't have to give them a lot of instructive.
All of you have to say, "For the Stage and they know what to do.
Here is some other people intrip.
This is the most tanar there, our game in our right.
It turns out that everything was to do was to take Sifts: it was to put one over the other.
So to him.
This is a application application of animates.
We wanted to build a top of the instrument to the language.
And this is Felix.
He can get new characters in the scene, just ridiculous, just the Siftables that affold.
Here is the soils of the soil.
Video: The bridge of the race.
David Merrill: Now a traction in the stage.
Video: The brothers.
Good woo! Yeah.
Miss Siftypes and assessing one can do the challenges to interact -- Video: Ham!
DM: I create the narrative.
Video: High!
DM: It's a final story of open, and he decided to deliver how it will draw the story.
Video: Zarara, pis!
DM: The next example I showed you today is a time to create and interpretation of created and interpreted the music that I built the music and the Siftables that Siftables of sounds like Siftables and bas the rhybas and bas well as well.
Each of these four different variations of different variations that you want to choices that you want to use it.
And you can inject sound in a successful that you can assembly you can do it.
The street sounds like Siftable-Siftable Siftable to be successful to a success.
There is effects that you can control the live and the philosphere and the philosopher.
Is it a certain sounds of sounds to get the same inclinical and then it to the help of it.
It makes the effect of the general effects like the tempt that applies the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of it.
Video: DM: M: MVery Siftables Siftables of successful successful and I arrits, I was a seriously rhyth.
Now I put a line.
Video: DM: Now I bring the percutting perceived percutting perceive the perceive of percus.
Video: DM: M: And now I'm going to bring the movie, to control the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the Videoto: DVideoto: DVideoto: DM: DM: DM: M: M: M: M: M: M: M: M: M: M: M: M: M: M: M: M: My motor no
Video: M: M: M: My grabbing inclining inclining in a part of the inclinical or something.
Video: DM: Now I'm going to attack for more expression.
Video: M: M: I can do the second to read while the amount of while the amount of while the amount of while the quantance.
So I don't have to do the plant, I can improvise, I can improvise, maybe the melodia in the wall.
Now, in the sample, I can estomatically, to use the Siftable-second Siftable-volunteer state.
Thank you.
And as I see my passion is creating new interfact new interfaction of new interface, which is the way that it works that works better with our brain and our body works and our brain and our body and our body of our brain.
And today, I had a time to show you a time to do this new space, and some of the new space, and some of the possibilities that I try to get out of the laboratory.
The one that I was the retinier to retinier is that we are at this new generates of instruments of instruments of instruments of the digital rules of our world.
Thank you very much.
Astep, with you to go to the toilet.
I'm writing.
He wrote the book is my profession, but it's more than that, more than that.
It's all my mother love and fascinating.
And I don't have this today to change this is to change it.
But, these fires, something like the best thing happened in my life, and in the life and in the bottom, which was my father determined me of my work.
And the thing I wrote is like this book, this book, "Manca, Ragain "Manca, Ragain Iubest," which is Iubestyle of my cartoon the world, and he was the world to desire the world, and it became the world, and it became the motivation of the world, and it became the worldwired, and it became the way to a bycle, and it was the way to be this important shared to the balancy of the book,
The reliable is that the original thing that I go now, people to treat the park of the park that I was condamn as I was condam.
Serior -- damnature, condamnaturedamn condamn it.
Are you in the ingrives and say, "You don't have the him, you don't have -- you don't have the themselves you like that you can't even more depasests you could not get the performance of this?
You don't have the themselves to write your insight to the top of your life, you know, a book that time, which is to take a book that to the world that they ever seen the world on the world that the world that the world on the world that the world on the world of that time.
It's very linest, in the truth,
But it was also more running if I was not the way for 20 years ago, when I was a great street about 20 years ago, when I was a great street -- I want to become a bridge of the same -- I want to get the same basis of the same basis of the same based on a bunch of the kind of bymous requires of the bridge of the best by-based if I was a byard.
And people said, "Not your father you never have to be able to never have to success?"
Do you don't mean that the humilination will kill yourself will kill you?
You don't have the front of the word in this field and nothing about this field is not going to be dead, and nothing to dead, and I'm going to dead, and I'm going to dead, and you can get the middle of the middle of the middle of the midddle of the middle is the front of the middle of the mathematics of the intraction of the top of the top of the top of the top of the intuition to be the inside of this field of the farm of the whole thing that is it is it out.
Something like this.
The answer -- the assessment on the street on the questions is "Yeah."
Yeah, I think it's themselves.
And I always stand on my hand
And the mythm is the themselves that people who can't get the people who can't get them to the people who can't get intuition.
As a big example of the big example of the large things that are infruit infruit of the infruit
But when it's about written about the thing I was thinking about the last time I was all the last time I was "Why is I was "Why is I was "Why is I was "why?"
Is it something rational elders?
It's logic as anyone to the top to be themselves to be the working on this was a lot of work that were in this Pert.
And what is so so that the initiatively creative initiatively that seems like the projection of the health workers are not doing the mental teachers not do it in a way that other professionals don't do it?
Tatal example, was engineering, and not remember of the 40 years of the 40 years of the engineering engineering somebody who is not a question of engineering to be a engineering.
It was not intamed -- John, how do it go to the chemicals in the chemicals in the chemicals of the chemical?
It's just not just the same thing happens.
But to be honests, engineers, engineers, they didn't have too closer to the century of the century of the remarkable to be alcools.
We write the insands of the reputation, and not only writors, but the artists of all sorts of the sample of the slide of the lab.
And everything we do is to look at the bottom of the morning of the morning of the morning of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the young died by the young and the young of young people.
And the same same same that they didn't seem to be the same thing that they really seem to be really bad the distracted distract.
Norman Mail, inindeed to die, in the last year of the interview, said, "Each of the both of my both both of me kill."
A great extraordinary extraordinary mountain a life of a life life of a life life of a life of a life of a life of the mountain the mountains.
But we never clips when we hear somebody says, that we've heard that I heard of these things that I heard of things and I have been able to collective and and they have a complete and suffering the creative of the creative and suffering and suffering the art, and it will lead to the end, and it will lead to the suffering to the end.
And the question I want to bring it today today is this: you all of the type of all of this idea: you with this ide?
You are comfortable to comfortable with it -- because it is not to him, I don't mean with this hypothese.
I think it's odias.
And I also think it's dangerous and I wouldn't see, and I wouldn't see, in the future of the future.
I think it's better if it's a better if we incure to the artists to live the artist.
And I know the sure of the case -- in the case -- in the case -- it would be very dangerous to me to try to get the indefinition to the carry of this storytells the circumstancy of the circumstance.
As a stuntant, I'm just a 40 years.
I was probably because we have four decades before.
And it's very likely to write everything to write the moment to be judgment of the mountain the late of the late of my money success of my last success of my last last last last year?
What would I say to myself, because everybody is the kind of like the one here are already -- is very likely to be the largest success to be intamed to be intamed already.
Oh, Good -- what gand!
This is the kind of like somebody could do somebody to get to the best to the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart of the morning.
I want to do this work, I keep this message.
And then, the question becomes the question, the question, right?
And so I put my mother and a lot of meditatives, like manid, to work now, to continue now, to continue to write a kind of building psychological buildings of building psychological buildings of the psychological protective, right?
I have to get a way, to find a way to pastrally a way to me, the floor to me, the one that I wrote to me, and the absolutely until that will be able to active.
And as I was looking for the last year of this sense of the last year of the time, I started to find other society to see other society to see other society to see other society to see the ideas and more sanity's ideas of how to help us create the art of how to help people create more creative to the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the audience of the last year of the last year of the year.
The way this was in Greection and Roma and Roma Roma and Roma Cantic Roma Cantic Roma Cantic Roma
So the main the main the case of the case is inching.
But, the time Great and Rome, and Rome, the Romantic Rom, the beginning of the beginning of the home, okay,
People thought that creativity was a spirit of the helps that can be the people in a source of people in a source and needed and needed and needed and needed and needed and neighborhood and unfortunate to the street and needed to be able to creativity and they were a creativity to creativity creativity.
The best call these spirit of creativity, the term of the term of the term "demonstrath with the thermal "demoni."
Socracies because it was a demon that has a demon that the shape of the slide of the department.
The same shared the same samples of creatives, but they call the creative creative creatively creative dit.
What is wonderful, because the romans, because of a genius was a genius was a genide individual genide individual individual individual individual did.
I was a genide geniage, the magictic end, the enefit of the travels of the artist, and the wall, and he said, "Dobby, he said, "Dobby, and he insessisisize and insession of the work, the artist of the work, the model of the work, the mountain the work, the work, the model of the work, the mountain the workers.
Absolutely -- this is the ones that I was the distant that is the delivers that we were to protect the mountain the works.
And everybody knows that that the work?
So the artist was protected by particular for example, as for example, too much narcism, right?
If you were the mountain the street was not the street to her, everything that the world as the world that the world that the genide that the genide that helped the square the same.
If you were criticized criticized the criticism was not the wind?
And everybody knows that the genies were pretty unfortunately unfortunately.
So they look at the West creativity of the West period of time.
Then came to the Renast, and everything has happened with a particular idea, the idea of the big idea of the main the universe as individual unique to all the days of all the days of all the days of the disease of the disorders that they get the horrible to divince the diverse of the divince of the divery,
It was the human beginning, and people start to create the people came up with all the creative of the creative coming out of the individual beginning.
And to the first one of the history of people were starting to get to one of the artists of artists as a genies, in instead of the genius.
And you have to make a massive heritor.
Permitmite, to create the simple simple to create that is actually receptacy, that is actually the speed and the source and the source and the source of the myth, creative is a little bit of the brother is a little bit of the fragile physics of the fragile physical and the challenging of the psychology of the psychology.
It's like you to get somebody to get someone to get a so-like soil.
It's just the incovoid and deforms of equires all these asteptily inimages of all these inimages inimaging inside the performance.
I think that the presence of this artists of the last 500 years of the last 500 years of the last 500 years of the last 500 years of years.
And if I think is true, I think is the question is, the question is asking the question, what do now?
Can we can do things the other things?
Maybe we go to the sense of the sense of the relationship between the brain of the creative mystery.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't just stand in the way we stering 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes.
And it probably as the audience that would be the question that the question of the street assumption of the street on the theme of the people that are the people in fact, which is that people prearted and all the people and all the way they sure and all of their square and all of their same.
It probably will not be cooperated to the right point.
But the question I want to put it -- why don't I want to put it -- why don't you me?
Why don't we think about how we don't think of this?
Because it has send to the way that we heard about whatever we heard about the complete of the complete of the creative process of the creative process of the creative procrazy.
So to create that everybody ever tried to create something -- you know, all the people here -- you know everyone here -- you know that it doesn't behavior.
And in fact, sometimes can put the right side the paranormal.
And I had a bunch of where I mean, I knew extraordinary poet Mauth Stone, who has been poettons, which now has been poetry, and that was poetry, and that was postory, and that when he was a story to work on the country to work on the wintam, and I just feel the ropp.
The story was like a vantage of the air.
And they practical waits.
The sense of the sense of the pamtown of the purpose pursuit under the ends.
So at that moment that moment that has a single thing to do is, "let's take a single water as a apata."
And alerging as as water home to the house of poem, and the engineering of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map to the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the water to the map of the water water to the house of the water to the house of the water of the water of the water and the map of the water and the water of the water of the water and the water and the water of the water and the water water water of the water of the
Sometimes was enough enough to alergy and alergy, and alergy, but not the rough, and the poem, and the poem, and the poemissions and the poem, and the poem, and the poemetry, and the poetry, and the one of the room."
They were also in which -- and I was not going to look at this moment -- when the story of that story -- when the story of lose.
Alerga home and the map of the map of the map of the creational creational exactly when the story of the exact of the top of the other, and the story of the other's story.
The first poems of the poems and then in the masssource of the masssource of the mamap of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the masssource.
So in this situation, the poem, the map of the map of the map of the map of the first to the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word.
When I heard -- it's the surprising of the own creative works, the exact of the own creative creatives.
My creative creative is not limited to this -- I'm not drive -- I'm not drive -- I'm not drive.
I'm a catching and the way to go to the same way, I go to the same way to the same transpirit and to travel and to travel and to travel and travel with hard and travel with hard and travel with hard and I am a hard way.
But even me, I really was indark in my indark was indark of that phenomenon.
And I just imagine that they were and so many of you were and many of you were and many of you have it.
And I had the projects or ideas that I was projects that I don't know that I know that I don't know it to hold it to hold it.
And what do you always get this?
And how do we support we should be reported to him, we wouldn't lost our minds to the mind of the mind to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to lose the sanity?
For me, the most relevant days, which is the most relevant of how we can do is the musician Tom With Wits, carry with a few years ago, the caruate of the review of the review.
I was talking about this suggestion was almost everything was almost everything to get the contemporary artist contemporary artist to control the contemporary of these impulse of creative incontrols these impulse impulse of creative incontrols the completely incontrols the completely incontrol of the completely incontrol of the completely unable of the subjected of the suffering of the subject and the top of the top of the contemporary
The time the time the line of the line of the story of the story of the story of the story of Los Angeles Angeles and then the same thing has happened.
And as a leader, from a fragment of a bagent of a piece of the piece of the piece of the desire and the athroom, and it's splending and the inspiration and the inspired and it has no water and a splendy, but it doesn't have to go to her, but it doesn't have to go to the water.
It doesn't have no food of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the ma
And it means that everything to do that the old anxiety of the state of "You want to lost the money to lose the monkeyboard for the monkeyboard.
I'm not enough to reach the best to reach it.
And instead of the panic in the panic stoppond.
He recognized the process and made a new mental and made it all of us and everything with all of us.
He was a look at the catching and said, "Sorry, you don't see that I'm not seeing like I'm volunte?"
"You know, you know, I could write a cantest cante?
If you want to be really excited to exist, intook a moment of a moment when I can stop to hear you to stop you.
If you don't don't even though you do it on somebody else.
To and both it on Leonard Cohen."
The entropy process has been changed by this.
It doesn't operate that it has continued to be as intunately unintor as intor.
But the process, and the engineering, and the agnosed in the time that took the time that he took the hyridge of what he saved his heart in the cause and he was the cause and he had to go back and then he realized it was not only something that he didn't have to be interiorized and he wouldn't be interied and Chinese and Chinese and Chinese and Chinese and
It could be this collaboration and the bizarre and the bizarre of the conversations of a conversation that was not too and the exterior of the exterior of the Tom.
And then I heard the story of the story of the way I was working on a piece of how I was working on a data.
This approach to the middle of the middle of "Manca, Rool, Rool, I, I, Ilove the case of the way that we couldn't all the way that we couldn't all the way to think that I was not going to think about something that I was going to think that it would be the more product to be the more product to be the more product to be the more product to be the more product to be the more product to the book to the best to the best rise of the book of the book
Not only project, but the most process of the book
I was to think about to think that I should be abandoned to abandoned the project.
When I remember the Earth on Earth and I was talking about and I was trying to get and I tried and I was trying to him.
I went to my view on the manuscrips and I brought a collar collapse comments.
I said to hold with voices, and we know that if we know that if we know that if I know that if this book is not just the extraordinary is not just the silence is not only the window is going to be just wine.
Because you can see me to see me to take a battle to hate everything I have to hear it.
So if you want to be better than it is to do it to do it to do the apart and you get the parts of the extra street of the tree.
Okay. And if you do that, you know, the street to get it to the baby.
I'll just write because this is my message.
And I want to conmit today to me today I did my park on my side my way."
Because -- the Concluding -- with hundreds of years ago in the hundreds of North Africa, North Africa, they get to the barbage and the music and the music and the music and the music and the music to sack hours to slide the racy to the racier to the racy --
And they were always wonderful for dancy and the delivery, and they were remarkable to addance and were remarks?
But sometimes very run, something is happening, and one of the interpret of the interpret of the common the common common common common common common the common common common comes to common commitments, but one, it took one, very run, a very running, and a very runnels, and very running and a very running of the common the common the
I'm convinced to all of me to everybody to all of the vas, because everybody sees to all of the interpretation of interpretation of interpretty interpretation of interpretation.
It's like the time is stopping and dancy is in a kind of opportunity of the opportunity to do nothing differently, in the other 1,000 series in the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the alinias.
On one time, it doesn't seem to be in invery,
It's the lights and lights and lights is the end, and the lights of the divince divince.
And then when they were intamed when they were standing what was the people were saying what was called the name.
They were the mainly impress and they were to scanne, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Alllah, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doamnes."
It's God.
A historical historical -- when they have invented the Spanish Spanish Spanish and the pronuntil this obices was the pronounced to Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, when they were a bridge -- when they have
and they hear the time to fight and dancy and dancy dancy and dance.
In Spain, when a interpret interpret and magic interpreted and magic magic and the magic arguments, Allah, the arvoy."
So unintelligence -- a Good of God.
It's wonderful, because we need to need something like this.
But the parts of the past of the morning of the insuspect to the insuspect is and discoveries that are not a lipiece of 11 lipiece of Divin.
It's a discoveries that are the danger that would be done to be the drivers and also the intimately unintimately.
It could not be able to not just invoice the name of the name when he was a room that he had to do it with the rest of his life life with the rest of his life life with the rest of his life life life with the rest of his life life of his life.
It's hard to be hard.
It's one of the most painting in the lights of creative creative creative creative.
But it may not be a chance of the largely under the inside of the inputs of the most extraordinary parts of the most extraordinary parts of the interior of the interior of the interior.
You can just create that you just create that they were impractical impractical source for a few source of the street to be delivered to be more than the right point of the street when you get more than the other states.
If we think about the way we think everything beginning, everything to change it.
So I was so sent to think of the last months and I thought, I was safety in the last long thing that will be published to the book and excessive and infruit and infruit and infruit of my successful and infruit of my successful and infruit of my success.
And what I do, repeated when you repeated when you lose the courage isn't it?
It doesn't be speech. I just get the content to the Continute to the content to be it.
If you dancy dancy dancy dance.
If the genide divine divine is repair is repair to the decision, even to the extraordinary to the extraordinary fortunately, and for a clipping through your effort."
And if no, no, dance.
And with all of these "Ole!
I think of these things and I think I should predress them.
"Ole." "You know, just for you, just for you to have a love dragoes and inside of the course to the participate in to participate in to participate in continuation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just Cohen: Ole!
We speak about some of these projects, about the genome of the genome and what it could represent new settled new settled new setts.
Now I start from a new point of view point of view biology, and now we're trying to start to start to this code this code and to this code and to get to a new flies of life and to the branching and shaping the life of life life life for.
We tried to ask us to ask questions.
"What is life life life is something that I think many biologists have tried to understand the diverse to diverse different levels.
I tried to different approach to the live life component to the live component to the basis of the basis of the basis
We already already already for 20 years.
When I was the squared of the world, this was the world's world of the world of the world of the world.
So we try to ask the question, maybe we can create new form of life life form of life life form digital universe, from this universe digital digital digital digital digital today,
This is the map of a miccovery, Mycoplasma genome for a species that has the most most of the most in the laboratory.
We tried to see if we can come with a genome and more than a genome and smaller genomome.
We were able to suddenly the order of a hundred hundred of 500 that are there.
But, when we look at the map of the map of the map of the map to our comparison.
Right? That's simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can suggest time, it's a little bit of the time, it's a little bit of the cell.
So we decided that the only way we decided to be interested in the top of the cromosome, so we can see this component to the most fundamental component to the most fundamental questions.
And so I started on the way, "We can expand "We can see, a cromosome?
Maybe the chemistry of these molecules that I never ever did the best molecules that I never ever ever ever ever ever ever be?
And if we can active. If we can active.
A cromosomome, is just a chemosomosome.
So, our speed to digitize of life raised to a life raised to a ritys.
Our grandmothers wrote genetic code and movement, but it raised it raise.
The last time has got to a cure to a curve exponentially.
I started this is 15 years ago.
I went through a few ethaper, you start with a few examples, before the first experiments.
But, you want to be the State DNA is very difficult DNA is very difficult.
They're thousands of machines in the world that are doing little bits of machines of 30 to 50 literally 30 to 50 literally degenerative process to 50 little, so that what's built a longer piece of the apart.
So we had to create a new way to put together to put together these little bits and the rights together and rights.
This was our first tenth of the tentation, beginning from the digital information digital square the 174.
It's a little virus that killing bacteria.
We did the best of the piece of the window, I got a molecule of the herror DNA molecule molecule of 5,000 literacy.
The interesting thing came up with this piece of chemical material that we took this material material and I put it into bacteria begin to read this cogenetic bacteria has been able to produce this room to produce the parts of the virus of the virus of the virus of the virus of the virus of the interesting of the exciting of the interesting of the interesting of the exciting of the material material was when I took this per of material material material
The viral viral viral diseases were back and returned out to the cells and they were homorrified the cells.
I was talking to the oil industry and the samples of course, and they were able to get this model.
They run longer than you.
And so we think that's a situation where this is a situation where the software in a map of the map in a system.
But we wanted to do something bigger it.
We wanted to build the cromoss of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 literally code genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic is the range.
So we said, "We would put the walls in the house to the size of the size of the size to the size of the home to understand that are component to understand that are component to understand the component of a cells of a cell.
The critical is critically, and if you start with the information of the digital information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly exactly the information.
When I was the first sequence of the first time in 1995, the standard was a herror 10,000 windows in 10,000 walls.
I found the result resones, 30 hers, 30 hers. If we were used to be used sequence the original sequence could never be activated to be activated to be activated to be activated to be activated to be activated to be activated to be activated to be achieved,
The design is the project of the top of 50 little, which has to be 50 little, which has to be 50 literally 50 literally to build the best to build the best to build more than the building to build the bones to build the compatible compatives.
We project tools.
You can read that I put the "floating "fish watermarkets. We have a genetic code to this: we have a literally choices: As C, CE, C, and T.
Triplef from those literacy cess -- those literacy codify acier acier acid.
So we can use the genetic code to write the word to write the potential to the word of the position.
So the thing I did was to hear the code.
Some of them were disappeared.
We designed those benefits, so we can dignose to ends.
I'm ensand, and I get them and tools and they took them.
So we started doing the piece of five to 10,000 literally flowing to 7,000 literate these 24,000 literally literally to do the settled to make settled to the settled to 7.2,2000.
And every single street these pieces of the abundance to be able to create them to create a process of the extremely extremely recreate a mind.
We try to get to the authoring point of automatic automatic point.
So, this looks like a basket.
When we get to the market very large pieces of the basic weapons of the basic weapons, not growing in East.
It slips all the tools of the molecular biology of modern moleculation.
So we went to other mechanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the mechanism that biology to reward the DNA DNA DNA DNA and that under the best bone.
This is a example of it.
There is a organism called Deinocock Deinococks, which can sustained millions of radiation.
As you can see in the painting, the cromoss is the distrus is destruction.
12 to 24 hours later, he put it out of us in the new ladies of how was the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be drawing today.
I can live in the life of it.
I'm absolutely safe that life can be able to exist, to be moving the extraction of the extrack, to find a new medium of the medium environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is happening.
Here's a micro-molecule molecules that we build these process process -- using the mechanisms of the mechanisms that we put the baby of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the microroro-molecule.
Drodia together together automatically.
This is not a picture of a microscope with electronics, but a photo-micro-micro-micro-micro-micro-micro-micro-micro-micro-micro-micro-microscopro-microscope of a microscope of a microscope of a picture of the microsroscope of a microsroscope from a microscope of a microscope of a microsco
It's this molecule molecule molecule.
These are images of collecting over a six seconds.
This is a public public public public public public public public public public time
These are over 580,000 literally code genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic disease.
It's the biggest molecule makes people with a definition of the definition.
It's a mother of molecular molecular molecular molecular molecule.
If we get a funny funny 142 pages to practical spaces this code code this code code code code this code code code of genetic code and you get this code of genetic funny of a funny funny funny of a funny funny of a funny funny funny and a funny funny funny of the funny of 142 page.
So, how do we go a cromosome? How do we active.
And I think of a virus pretty easy virus to do.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
They also also also also easy to get to ekay, you can just get nuclear and you just get nuclear and to put the otherwise and you get heard about -- and that's something that you all of you heard -- clone.
The bacteria of the archa, cromoss is the integrate of the cells of the cells of a completely transplant to a completely transplant to a cells to the other, and we can activate it.
I pursued a crozen crozen microbial microbial microbial microbial microbial microbial microbial crobes.
These are the second is as much distance as as people and the machine.
We added some genes in the way to do this for this cromosomes.
I digested with enzymous tools.
And it was pretty amazing when I put it in cells -- you will appreciate our very sophisticated -- and our cromoss -- and the cromoss of cell.
In fact, we thought that this is how this is how we can go to design the project of something more than we were trying to design the project.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are all sorts of the species of species that have the second cromoss of cromosome, or a third of new respective, thousands of new caracteristics in a second.
So those who think of the evolution of evolution changes just change the only gene of the moment of the biology.
They're enzymous restriction, which is actually digest, which is digers.
Cromosomes that was in cells not a cell.
The cells -- the cromoss that we put together.
It was expressed and recognized the other cromoss of the material material that was just with the cells of the cells of cromoss with cromoss of cromoss with cromoss of the cell.
It became the blue of the genes that we put in cromoss in cromosomes.
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristics have lost a whole species of a new species of the software in a new species that I put on the software in the software in the cell.
And all proteins were changed the bottom of the genetic code -- when we transfertilized the code of what we transferred is exactly what we transfer.
This can sound like alchemistry of genomics, but we can change the software to change the things pretty dramatically dramatically dramatically dramatically dramatically dramatically dramatically dramatic.
Now, I was not the genetic that is not the genetic -- but to build three billion years and a half of years and a half of the evolution of evolution to create a new version of the Cambridge of the Cambridge of the massive digital digital design for the massive digital design is the massive of the massive of the massive of the massive --
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obviously obviously of the point of needs to be the needed to be the needed to be the one.
We're going to go to six and half of the six billion people over 40 years of people over 40 years of people over 40 years.
To to put this in context for me to me in 1946. I was born in 1946.
There are three people on the planet for each of us that there were four years of us in 1946, they will be four years ago.
We have the problems of the issues, the floor drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half the issues of the issues of the issues of the issues of the issues of the issues of the horrible issues of the shape of the hundred of the six billions.
It will be difficult to do it for us.
We use over five billion books of books, more than 30 billion barily barily of oils of oils.
This means a hundred millions of barily barily on day.
When we try to think about the process of the process that would be a challenging challenging challenging challenge.
Then, of course, it's the CO2 from this material, which is the material that is the atmosphere.
Now, from our discoveries around the world, we have a data of data from the world, and I love to these kind of thinking about these as a component of the future of the future of the future.
The electronics has only a painting, or that is just a painting, and the diversity that came from this.
We're limited here, at the first one, a biological reality and our image.
We now have the technological technological data of these types of smart sacred what we call the genimic of genimic genimic genimic combinators.
We have the ability to build a large robot that makes a million cromoss on day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of genes or to try to choices to choose the optimize to produce the octan, or to produce the diseases, or we can change our team, we can change our biology molecule of the young molecular than the last 20 years of everybody in science.
And that's just the standard standard.
We can selection for viability, production or the chemical chemical chemical chemical diseases, it makes a vaccines,
This is a screen capture of a massive software we worked on these software to be able to work and work and work to these species in computers in the computer species.
You know, we don't know how to show you how it will show you how to show it.
We know the exact of their genetic code the genetic code the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code and know their genetic code to know their genetic code how they know their genetic code how they know their genetic code how their genetic looks like their genetic code how their genetic code how their genetic lood looks like their genetic code their genetic code the code of their genetic code of the genetic code of their genetic code
Now we concentrate the fueling four generations.
You saw that recently that from the stumb is just a black experiment is just a experiment experiment.
We have the fueling of the second generation that will applies the third that are the sample of the fuels of the fuels of the shared fuels like the ocean or different kinds of disease.
But the only way we think that the biology can have a major impact of the challenges of the limitation of the limitation is if we start with the CO2 as the first time to the first to the first to design the first to design the first generation of the first generation of the first generation of the ground of the fueling of 18 months.
Light and CO2 is a mythertom -- but in our discoveries around the world.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
They live in the middle of the ocean to two miles and half miles and half miles and half of the deep of the windows of fibers to be errunning of the fibers of fibers of the fibers of the fibers of the peratures.
Transform CO2 in metanthantic metanth-molecular molecular as well.
We try to see if we can take CO2 capture CO2 capture that can be easy to be able to convert that CO2 back to the CO2 back to the CO2 back to the combat this process of the product to lead this process process to lead to the same.
So in a period of time, we think we could die that we could die that the question of the question of the question of the question?"
We actually know -- we have the objective models of the entire industry industry industry industry industry.
Yeah. If you don't do this at TED, where in other parted?
She become a major energy.
But we also work now is to use these same way to invent these same source vaccines to invented vaccines of vaccines.
You saw this year, we are always with a year in the middle of the vaccinated when it comes to the right right of vaccine.
I think the situation can be changed by the combinator can be changed by the combinators.
Here's how to show you how to show the future changes the future changes the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the excitement, and the ariott's evolution.
We're almost to improve people.
Our button is just to do that we have a chance to survive that we have a long enough to survive it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you the more quickly, is a very fast, is a new thing, a new thing, a new technology that I had Microsoft Microsoft Sdragon. This is a year.
It's a medium that can interact with a local amount of data with a largely amped by a visual amount of data --
We look at many gigables and many gigables and digital photographs and on the continuous and the perfect of perfect driver.
It doesn't match the information of how much information is how largely these large collected images are these images.
Most of the picture of the picture of a camera digital camera digital camera from the Bibrary to the Bibrilliant Congress of 300 mmeths 300 mmen of 300 metaphes.
It doesn't important to the only thing that the only thing that the only thing that the only thing that the number of the sky of the monitor of your monitor your monitor at a very bridge architecture.
This is a book is a book of the non-image example of the non-imaging.
It's about "The "Shy" to Charles Dickens. Each Dickens. Each one of the crowd of a capita capita capita of capita
To give you the text that it's about text, and we can't do that. And we can do that, to show that it's a represent representation of a text; it's a picture.
Maybe this is a way to read a book in the form of the book in the form of electronics.
I wouldn't recommend to the bad it.
This is a more real. It's a lot of the "Gardianul," "Gardianul,"
Each imagine represents the beginning of a second.
This is really what you really do is really pay experience of a experience of the experience of a vision of a vision or a vision of a vision or a lot of the top of a lot of the environmental environment.
We did something small color a little bit of a cold of "Gardianul."
I created a false reclaiming to a very larger solution -- much more than any clamic requires -- and I remember a content content condition of a content condition.
If you want to see the properties of this car, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specifically the technological specifically of the technological specifically things.
And this is actually the point of a limitation of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor.
We hope this to endrive pop-upon pop-up, and others and others of this gene of the gene of gene gene -- which are not necessarily to the best of the gene.
Of course, the mapping is one of the applications for a kind of like this.
I'm not going to fall the time to do this for a long time to tell you that we have contributed to this field.
These are all the roads of the United States to NASASASASASASA.
So let's go to the other.
This is actually active active active on Internet now.
This is a kind of like Photosynth, which is the second different technologies of different technologies is Seadragon the other side of the research of the visual research in the field of the visual University of the University of Washington, and I sat Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Stosytosynth, and the Stosynthesth, and the Steve Steve Steve Steve S
and Rick Szelki to Cercetor Microsoft Cercetor.
So this is activists on the Internet.
You can notice that when we create these kind of perspective, when we can have this kind of experience in many resolution of experience in many resolution.
But the arching space, the space, contests conteaching these images.
Other perception of perception of perception of the perception of these images together, so that it corecial space, so that the picture of the Lacs -- all the Lacs and the Canadience -- they were made these elements of a projected of a projected or the panelements of the spaces of the space, and these elements of the space, and these elements of the space.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There are some more spaces that have a lot more space.
I'd like to go to one of the original stories of the original stories of the Stosynth Photosynth Photosynth that I think it's the piece of the resilt of this technology, the technology of the resist of this technology, the technology of the technology, the vision of the vision of the vision of the vision I put the projected to the vision that I put the projection on the website.
We had to do the aspects of the laws of the lawyers of the laws.
This is a reconstruction of the Catter of the New Dock of the Good from the Flickr. Okay? And you find something pictures on Flickr, and you find something pictures in the room, and in the room, and every one of these conditions of these models that he was found a picture of this model.
These are the pictures on Flickr, and all of these were relationship in this way.
We can just get to navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I would never get to work to work on Microsoft is very measure to a lot of measure to a lot of a very first here.
I guess that notice that I noticed that there are a lot of cameras: all the games of the phone to SLRs SLRs SLRs SLRs SLRs SLRs in this environment.
If I can find it in this bad thing.
There's so many men such mass of the mass of the machine.
So here is a series of photographs --
This is a poster poster with the Dock that was recognized.
You can get to the environmental environmental environment.
The point is that they can do things with the social media to collect the data from all the data -- from all the world -- from the whole world -- from a whole visual visual visual -- and to interconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconnected something that is the rather than the lives of the lives of the lives of the country.
You have a model of what you have a model of what the Earth.
Think of that as Stephen Lawler Lawler Lawler "Earth."
And this creates in complexity as the world as the world is used to be the benefits as the benefits as well.
The pictures of the pictures of the meters that someone else enter that someone engineer.
If someone would ethichetthetthetthett-stand and the picture of the Catdrala Does would be able to improve with all of these data with all of these data that could use to be, to make it like this space, to make a kind of experience of experience to make a kind of social experience.
And of course, a produced produced second, and all of these models and diseases of the model of the Earth, collected is not only from the satellite and from the satellites and from the satellites, but from a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood what you can allow your best moment is like you to give you a few years ago, is like all the photos of the pictures of someone on the photos of someone on the glob of someone on the glob of someone on the glob of the state of Anderson:
BA: Yeah. What does is actually do is really to descend.
It creates the hyper-to-to-to-imaging.
And it makes this basis on the content of images.
And this is becoming information when you think about the information that have the information that have the image.
As when you do a look at the Internet, caught on the Internet, clearly the text of the page, and the text of the Internet of the Internet of the picture.
Now, what would it be if that picture with all of your pictures with all your picture?
When the amount of interconnection and disease of this is huge of this is huge of the classical effect.
CA: Blaish, it's really incredible to be incredible. Fellow it.
BA: Thank you very much.

A colleague of my data had access to the investment of the investment of the investment of the investment of the funny of funny of the hell of the hell of the hell of disease.
And what was that for every 10 funny mutual mutual that they help the window, run by the participants.
Do 50 funny funny -- they are getting to 10 percent less than 10 percent more more than if you give you a little bit more five than if you are only five of you only have five home?
Because with 50 funny funny of mutual choices to choices to be hard to choose your hand to choose that a hands.
And then on the poems and then on the hot and the hands, and on the hands, and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course it comes to never be more coming out of the spots.
You know, you know, that that is not only the people will consume that those people will consume because they don't have enough money to get a lot of money to put a decision, that means that the stability to make a decision, that is so hard to do that under the slide of the bonds that would be able to do that the compensation that would be able to do it to the compensation that would not just be able to do the best thing to do to do that it is not just engineers.
Neparticipantly, they give up to 5,000 dollars on the left of the partner on the beginning of the windows of the compensation.
So the main the consequence is a lot of opposite.
And I think that this is to show that the world to look like this.
You really want to make your decision, if it's for everybody is for everyone is it for everybody is it?
You don't want to choose the investment of investigate or the sossil for the sossil to save the sossil for saving wrong.
So that's a second. Al second. Al second is that if we do, we can represent the state of the state choices to get a little choices to the result of the satisfy of choice to be less more than we were less less choice than we were less choice to choose the choice of choice.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that we had a bunch of sossil to save the choices that you buy -- and it's not perfect to save the sound for saying establis?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choices that would be better choices that would be better choices that you can imagine that you can imagine that you have the regret of choices that you do and these regret that you get a screening that you can actually do not good for a bad decision.
The more options, the more options, the more options, so it's harder to regret something that is deadly in the option that you have a choice.
Secondly, what economists call the opportunity.
Dan Gileppy demonstrated in this morning in the morning of how we evaluate the way we depend on what we comparison what we comparison.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative alternative to take a lot of characteristics to imagine the characteristics that you have a little bit of the alternative to make less choices and that you have a little bit of choices that you have a little bit of the alternative will be able to do it.
Here's a example of the best example. I am New Yorks.
But here's how should we rather to radiations.
We have here here here this couple.
A very expensive propertive.
Spected superber. They've got the wonderful thing.
What could you want to do you more than the dracuiss? "Well, it's honest: "It's hear the "It's hear riright.
Everybody from Manhattan in Manhattan are plecture.
I could actually pay in front of the front of the point of food that two weeks, the idea that they were the window, to have a place to have a place to be a place to be a place to be a place to be a place to be a place to be a place to be a place to be a wonderful place to be able to park right in front of the right right in front of the front of the bridg."
The opportunity to opportunity of opportunity that we have on the environmental choices that we have is exceptional exceptional choices.
And the more options of options of options to take the challenges of these options attaches of these options will be perceived to be perceived by us as we were perceived opportunity.
Here's another example.
This books says a lot of things.
We should be living to live the baby and probably we should do things beginning.
But one of the things that says is that while it's that while you call to do not do to do not do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of living with a lot of living attracted and that will do you do what you do you do you make less attractive attractive attractive.
Third of the third extenders of waiting for waits.
This love me when I wanted to get my brother to replace.
Port the black of the time.
And there was a poor that the black of a single and they were able to stand and and they were able to get out of your comfortable and if they put them on your common and if they put them on a long time and they were under and spend the best and story.
So I went to replace to replace to replace to lead the best years of the old of the old of the old and I said, "Look, I want a pushing painting." And I want to be the street to be the street to be streets of "I want to be strange to be streets of the fungit to be the streets of me to be replaced to me to replacement my brands?
You want to do with nastonish? You want to prespeak or fall?
Do you get the music.
You want to avoid the best bunch of the blah baby." And you don't want to be throom." And I don't want to be throom."
And he picked up and I was saying my father and I said, "I want to be the only kinds of the guy who were the only thing that I spent the problem that I spent all the walls of the best-to-best-slide -- and I lead to the storm -- with the blueding of all the best -- with the best of all of the best that I had the best that I had to have my best to all of all of everybody I had to myself.
We have before. All these options to choices have been able to choices to choose the best challenge.
But I felt long.
Why? I wrote a book I was trying to explain that.
The reason I felt that I felt that I felt all these options are expecting these options that I should be a bridge of how should be a bad of bridge bad well.
I had expected expectations of it. I had no way. I had no way.
Now when I'm 100 sorts of them, one of them must be perfect.
And what I did was I got a bad of it, but not perfect the perfect of it.
So I comparised what I was expected with what I was expected and the result is that I was desperate with what I hope I hope with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope was the comparison.
The options of options in the lives of the people's lives of the people who expectations that people who have to create those options that people have to be the opposite of the opposition.
And the rights that will lead to less satisfaction even if it gets good at the result results of the result results.
Nobody in the marketings don't know that.
Because if you wouldn't have this idea, you never had to talk about what I'm talking about.
The more than the one thing like this.
The reason why everything was better when everything was better when everything was more than when everything was more possible was possible that when the people to experiment.
So the day day we live today, in the world we live -- we live and the industrialized and advice and the perfection of the perfection of the things will be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good for it.
You never never pay the surprised because you expect the teaching and my samount of my sky.
The street -- for this is the excited -- for this secret is expecting is to expect the expectations of expectations to have a reduse.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- I just want to -- that I was actually a wide and it's actually a wide and it's actually the right right right and it's actually the wonderful right now.
I couldn't find something better than I couldn't find a better thing.
But to you like to hear you not to hear you not the best thing.
Finally, a consequence of a bunch of the blood of the best bunch of the best that you can't buy a single that when you can't buy and you ask and ask you why is that that you couldn't come and ask the answer is the answer, the answer is the clar.
The world is the wine. What could you do you have to do it?
When they're stills of style style of different siles and bad you die and ask you why, and ask you why, and ask you why, and you ask yourself and ask yourself and you ask yourself and you get the wind?
It's as a clear that the answer to the question is, yet.
You could have better choices to choose the best choices.
And you have a different silk of different kinds of different choices for the choices.
So when people have decides that the results of the choices are very bad of them, they are feel disappointed by them, they come out of them, they come out of them,
The depression, the world industrialized in the last generational world industry.
I think a important contribution -- not the only thing -- not the only thing to depression, but also the people have experienced to hear the experience of experience that they are disappointed because they are the delivers that are too ridicated because they are too ridiculous.
And when they have to explain these experiences that they are the beginning.
So the general result is that we can get better to better objective objective and feels better and feel.
So let me remind you to remember it.
This is the doctrine, and that's what we all believe that we all think is truth. It's not truth.
Without the talk, you have a few choices of choices are better than not the choices are better than just a little bit more choices than a few choices than a few choices than a few samples of choices of choices of choices to have a few choices of choices to have a few choices to have a few choices of choices to have a few cho
There is a magic. I don't know that I don't know what it is.
But I'm pretty sure that I was a lot of that point that point that point of life.
Now, the idea -- almost though I was almost end, the idea that is to think of this is this thing.
What allows all these choices in society in society is good in society is good material.
There is a lot of places in the world, and I heard some of them where their problems is not that they have too many of them is not that much options.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the thing about me thing about me is a problem is a problem of the Western society and disease.
And what is frustrating and the shared and the shape of the Levitt talked about how these shared for children spot and wrong. I'm not going to help not help.
What I tell me is that these options, and the complicated and complicated not only the complicated and complicated not help.
They actually do it actually product.
They actually do really feel more than we feel more than we feel more than that.
If something from what allows us to do all of our choices that we do all the choices that we have too little choices that people have too little stock of the same lives of the same lives of our lives of our lives of our lives and our lives of our lives and our lives of our lives would be improving to the lives of what we would allow us to do it.
This is what economists called the Parto.
The revenues the income will be better to be better than everybody -- not only -- not only people -- not only -- because this excess excess of the choices of choose.
In the conclusion. It's the city of this cartoon-bridge cartoonists and the sophisticated person?
You know nothing that nothing is not possible in this acvarious various various various several to the world, a several story.
But the more than I thought I was a more about it with the land to think that the fish knowledge something like this.
Because the truth is that if the charges to be possible to be possible to be possibly under the liberty to be able to be the liberty of the liberty of it.
If you spark the various various way, the satisfacts is possible the satisfacy.
You think of the satisfaction and satisfacy.
Anyone need a various various acier.
This is almost safety -- probably not even to a fishing for a fish.
But absence a metaphor is a metaphor is a bridge and unhappy and suddenly deliver and suddenly deliver the deliver.
Thank you very much.
