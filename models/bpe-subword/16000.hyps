Video: Yeah, the Great the bottom, it's a future.
He is the beautiful thing, and helped to create the economics.
The Great the bottom with the bottom, what it was going to be in the house of what it was going on.
He is access and advertising and words and worked on the shape of satellites.
The Gore: This is to most of the challenges of the Gird.
The most important thing on the most important of the biggest charge of Massy Coal.
Vototype Blanken: I want to be closer to be closer Pelososososphere, Harry Rower Rower Rowood wall.
His Gore: So the Alian for the Climate for the Climate of the Climate of the two camp.
This is one of the hundred of it.
Voice: The COPAL: The COOP: We see a very serious improving to our intack for our home.
And this is our own tropy is to make a big big big for a little bit of the public of public public public public and recomplicated to remind us and really, we really have been able to show about the goal about the government of the book.
The case is not the challenges of the challenge.
We think it's like this is -- and my mother and my mother and my mother.
So it doesn't matter to change for change.
So this is our house in our way.
Voice: Carri: You heard about a paper to a paper to him.
So you want to do a paper to do this paper of this paper of the bottom of the botttom of the challenges.
Hinarry is the crowd is the game.
But this is the technology is the human brain the human brain.
And as the characters is one of the involved in the global incomputer of the world's biggest technology that you see the challenges of the challenge.
The next thing to do with the issue of the technology is the technology of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the hundred of the hospital.
The Gore: The Gore: The power will be the right thing to do with the process of the economic of the economy and problems.
Vooty: The Narrator: The economy is the economy of the national economics of the nature.
The inevitable that they were all the dependent of the computer of the computer of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the challenge.
But now we have a new solution to the new issue to the hypothese.
Right? The American American American 100-year-old 100 years ago.
A fly in the American American American American involved and to help the opposite of the involving of the world's global incomputer involution of the world's global involvements.
In the art of art is a solution to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help the problem.
Right? The America. The American America.
His Gore: This is the last year.
Vooty: Narroris: It's about America.
One of the way to go to to to the future, I have the dependent of the floor of our plants that are collective -- the lecture of our planet is the future of the energy is the same energy is the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy.
Barbith ness, you can remember the investment to create the best of the shape of the bridge.
Narrator: Right? It's time for across for across the same time.
His Gore: The trick of a proverse of a death, "Does you want to go to to go to the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one.
If you want to go to the define wish.
We need to go to the democracy.
I want to thank you very much too.
The last last year, I did a LH.
And I wanted to give you a little bit of how they worked on how it works on the water of how it works
So the amazing amazing for the people who didn't have been here, LHA is the most experiment that was the most experiment -- the Ciriririrird -- the Ciririrird of the recreating a little bit of the second of the second of a billion dollars -- a little bit of the unique of a billion dollars --
It's extremely under disease.
This is the air of Geness.
We have the photographs of these minds of minds."
I work on this thing. It's called ATLATLATLATLET, Ladiameter of 22 meters -- a team of a 22 meters here -- the team of the ATASTAs the ATASTAs the ATASA to the ATASTAs the TAAt of ATAs the proposition.
The 10 sequence of the team of the atmosphere.
And this image was about AS.
It was a couple of a square of the shape of computer.
It's a very first picture of the first person who was the cycle, the average of the attention of the intuition of LH, the includes of LHS in LHS is detector.
In other words, when I wanted this image that images the next 10 sequency that the water was a success of the word of works.
I don't know if that was the first time of the first version of the most powerful or not, or whatever it was a staging of the first pages of the first time of the first time.
It means that I did a culture of cultural impact of the impact of the intension.
After the next thing about a paper to a problem with the water of the water -- these are the atmachine.
These are the conventional connection of a little time of a little bit of the attention to the machine.
Now, the inerror of these are looking at these types and said, "I can't be the myself of myself me.
But I can do that when they're going to do the democracy of the degrees of what they were challenge.
So as 27, you know, about 27, and I think about the statistics of the storytelling the cities of the hormous of the hormouse of the horridge.
At one of the people of the 90,000 people in LHC, was a was a define define define was a defabrical.
So the computer was involved a little bit of a young hundred of the myself of the region the electricity.
This was the result.
This is more involved when they do the meters like the teacher and the second of 20 percent of the second of the 30 percent of the faster than 30 percent of the time.
So I remember the rorists of 50 percent of the content of the research of the research.
We had to get to hear the hunger and I do.
I receive the conditional one.
And now we have invented to the substant.
The late of the shape of the HHHHA will be as a little bit of the HHHHA will be as a little bit like this.
We will be able to do it and we have to do it in the new hypothese, and we will research or to research to research to research to research the universe of the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, as a way of representing of representing the accidents and inevitable to reach to extremely requirement and inevitable to reach to reach it.
I think that the rest of the digm of diversity, the end, the intimive of the inincome of the experiments like LCCA.
I will not be as a whole word of a wind-in-in-Dio Dady Dady Dady Dady Dady the extraordinary of the first experiments of the Michael Faraims of the potential to the myself of the myself is not that we don't have the best of our minds are not that the best way of our minds are not as our minds are not the best of our minds are not as our minds."
Thank you.
I want to go with the kids with the kids of children will remember the children, as you want to move with the hundred of him.
The measure of what you were trying to do and they go to to to the hypothese, and to make the shape of the challenged and to reach and to solve the problems of the problems of the problems of the connection and the relationships.
The first perception is the extra profound of how the Internet of the world in the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the connection.
So I can remember the Dide IT inspired by the interaction with our interaction with my objects -- the improval connection with my Pattant, and collaboratory -- and the collaboratory -- I would be able to use a computer -- I would be a computer -- and when we were doing a computer and if we can use a common to a common the demachine, and we can be a common the deeply of the home, and I could make a common to be a common to the re-air and we can be a measurprprpracticing of the re-adivert of rupper and make that we be a who-like the re-athering of the per in in the myselvely dependent of the myselvanced pert of the mitted to be be be be be be be be be be be per-mach
Carl we want to do that?
The question was the question of the past, I got to read the research, I raced to research the Sift-built Sift-built Sift-fish.
The define of Sif, a Sift of the interaction of a bridge of a bridge.
They can be able to be able to be perceived to the recicivil of a deeply of a re-team and a ran and a ran and a ran and a relationships.
The most important thing is that the most important thing that you can get the games, you can only be as a little bit of the water as a little bit of the water.
And Siff course of a new opportunity to a new historical instrument of the digital digital information.
The measure of the instrument of the instruments, more constantly constantly of the shape of the other other other other other other other people in our cells and connected to explore and we can explore and we can explore and we can explore and we can explore and we can explore and we can explore and we can exploring new actions.
I want to incept with the simple example.
This is the Sift is conft to predict the image of the include of a little bit of the include in a case of the include of the include of the includes of the incluels of the incluels.
These paintings are constantly constantly one of the other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other of the other of the other of the same same same same same thing.
So, if you were a little bit interesting of other language.
If they're inconnected to that, you can actually become confuse.
I can feel the include and including the incline.
We realized that one of the implications of the interesting of the interesting of the interaction is like to use the window is to use a book that we could use a book like a license like a licen.
In the case, we have three Sift of you conft that configuring and can use them to use the books and they can use it in the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the case of this --
If we can put it too much of the hundred of the inairs.
There are really interesting for education, as a lot of education, as a language of the language and the machine, and we want to know how to do things like to be the same results of the results of the results of the impossible things.
So this is a Fibonacaculous fon-funded by a program with a program of project.
This is a game of the convention of the combination of Scrabs and Bob and Bob and Bob and Bob and Bogger.
The first one of the first one of the first one was at the intimify of the Sift of the Sif, and the research of my mind of the democracy of the democracy of the determined of the extra bad of the first time.
And then the paper to 30 seconds of refected to a new type, and you have a new way of research and we can also have a new way of research and new research and we remember the inctive of inctive active access of innovation.
Thank you.
These are the kids who came to the expressive to Lab, and we recognize to the Media, and we remember a material to the movie.
They were working on the government to go.
And one of the interesting of this interesting is that the air of this kind of people don't need to reach people to give them a lot of people who don't need to restructure.
All right, "To you have to do what to do, and they want to do it.
This is going to be people to concert people to cancer.
This is the most anthropy of our floating in the right,
It seems like he wanted to do it was to do it was to get a Sift of the Sift-one square the other other things.
So for her, for him.
This is a animal is a animal applied by animals.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who invented the language.
And this is Felx.
He can go to the challenges in the hundred of the Sift of the Sift of the Sift of the personal challenges.
This is the shape of the shape of it.
Video: The race.
David Merry: So this is a traction,
Voice: Trace.
Good good. Yeah.
My Sift Sift and ashion a language can be able to interact with a language -- Video: Hamp!
DM: The process and proposition.
Voo: Bony no.
DM: It's a story with the final story of how to recovering it will be fashion.
Voice: The painting?
DM: The next example I would show you the next example of the time is a beautiful and internal restricted and internal recognized and we build the Sif, and we built the baby and they all are the bridge.
Every has been four future, you want to be different types that you want to use it to use it.
And you can inject the inject of a successful that you can have a little bit of the typt of the other guys.
You can get the satellite Sift Sift Sift Sift Sift Sif.
There are the effective that you can use the language and the modern and moving modern and moving modern and mother.
The guy is a certain a certain the include for the include for a little bit of a little bit of the cline.
The power of the general effects as the general effects that the air of the second of the second of He'll see it.
Video: We want to get to a Sift of Sift in the second of Sif, a research of a complex expensive, a expensive expensive extremely deliver with a lot of expensive extremely dead.
Now a little bit of a little bit of it.
Video: Mad: I love a little bit of the period of time.
Video: And I will add to the movie, to the best to the top of the power to the power the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the rest of the object.
Video: You can reclinical includes of the second inclinical inclinical incline.
Video: You're going to do the modern of the mountains.
Video: I can do to do the second time to do the second while as a second while I was going to do it.
So I don't have to do the planet in the president, I can improvision or bridging the bendly.
Now, in the paper, I can really be able to use the second second to use the Sift of Sift of Sif, include the include of the fatal including to the flight of the fuel.
Thank you.
As you see my father is the power of the international computer that is the power that the way that they worked with our brain that works.
And here, we had to show you a cover of this new process of this new design, and the way to reach to the possibility that we recognitive to live in the lab.
The Gandand's safety is that we are at this point is as a generation of the new instrument of the restricts of the digital region the world that will be able to move our world that will be able to the world of our world that will be able to the same thing to do to the rule of our world of the world to our lives.
I want to thank you very much.
Astand, with you to talk to you with you to talk to you with you notice it.
I'm written him.
He wrote is my teacher per of my teacher and more of it.
It's all my mother's mother's broad.
And I don't think that this is what it means to do it.
But these are the hands, something like the hammed and the gamed of my mother and my body, who was my own home, which was a remother, which was a very quite of the condition with the condition with the connection.
And the whole thing is that I wrote this challenge, this is the "Mano research of "Mano Roy," Royal God, Roverty, very well to the democracy of the world, and this is the important thing that is become a real sense of the real sense of the real sense of the Internet.
The case is like the science is that people were not as people who wrote the people like to be condamam.
Servillage -- connameless.
Do you can prevent for example, and you heard is not the pamming is not the past is not the stream, you can't be able to be performan?
You don't have to go to to to write to write the best of the past piece of the best way to make a little bit of the world that will be the same thing to do to the world that they want to have this work?"
It's very long the way of really indeed.
But it was more and more reminded if you were not a lot of 20 years ago, when I was a lot of people who were going to be a little bit of the people -- I was like to become -- I want to become a little bit of the same thing, I want to go to the same way of reaction of reactive reacted as a little bit like a little bit like a little bit of reaction as a little beautiful kind of reactive reactive reaction of reaction as a little bit of the same thing.
And people say, "You know, they didn't have never seen as you never had never seen a lot of success?"
I don't like to myself will be able to do you want to talk to ide?
You don't have the most important thing you can see in this way, and nothing that is not not to be not going to be not going to be able to deadly on the hundred of the vision of the hundred of the center of the city of the cycle,
Don't you do this.
The slide -- the racing of the question of the questions of the question.
Yeah, you know, it's all of these things like these things.
And always he was a street.
And you know, it's a little bit of the inside of the other things that people don't want to be well.
The fear of examples of the great things that are infrastructure.
But when it's about the word I thought about my work and I thought about and I thought about the last question I was "Why is the last question?"
Is it something of it?
It's the disease to be able to be able to be able to be able to be very quickly as they were very quickly to do a little bit of this Pame.
And what is the specific of the species of creating the initive that the inive of the inive of the inive of the attention of the attention that other people who don't do a kind of teachers who are not doing a kind of teacher?
My father was invented for example, and not immediately reminded to remember of the 40 years of the inerror of the inery of the inery of the inevitable of inerature.
It wasn't involved -- John, like John, how do you go to the engineering of the inerric?
It doesn't really get inside the hamming of something.
But to be able to be the inevitors like the group of the babies of the second of the second of religious disease.
We were written intentional to be this remarkable and not just read for all of the way of all of the way they have the challenges that they have to be possible to be possible for the power of being possible to be powerful powerful powerful to be powerful powerful to be powerful to be able to be able to write the ridgers.
And what we have to do is to look at the number of the number of region of the region of the mind of the mind-region of the mind of the mind of the challenges of the challenge.
And even the same thing that they didn't have to be able to be able to really be able to really be able to really hard to be able to travel of the project.
Norman Mail, even though the last year of the last last year, he said, "The Each of my body, a lot of home."
A big big big challenging the word of works.
But it doesn't mean when we hear the house when we have heard that I heard that we heard so many things like a lot of things like the complex and reacted to complex and received the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the infinite of the infinite of the infinancial connection, and the infinite of the infinancing of the infinfinancial infinancial infinfinally conductor of the infinfinfinfinancial infinancial infinfinal and the infinancial conductor of the infinfinfinfinfinfinfinfinfin
And the question I want to add this guy is the type of here is you are with this is: you are you with this idea with this idea of ideas with this idea of ideas with this idea of ideas with this idea of ideas of ideas of ideas of ideas of ideas of ideas of the ideas that ideas I want to ask the question of questions that I want to ask the questions of the questions that questions you want to ask the questions the question question.
You are comfortable to -- because it is to the hundred of the eye -- I don't like this is not the best stop --
I think it's like this is over.
And it also believe is that the person and not to be to to be able to do the future.
I think it's better if we involved in the artists of artists to live it.
And I was a deeply of my hythm -- in my situation -- it would be very performance to go to to to me to go to to the right of this painting-street stood that is now the teacher that I found the teacher that I think about the teacher of the teacher that I was now now now when I was now now now when I was now when I was a teaching teachers.
The example of example, I'm just very clear about 40 years.
I have probably indeed as four words of works.
And it's very probably probably what I want to do with this moment to be a little bit of the moment of the last time he came to the last call the way of the last last year, and the research of my mind?
What would would be a fun, because of the machine, because the other people are described -- it's very probably not just as the most successful thing -- it's very larger to be involved to be involved in the best successful thing.
Oh, Does you know, what I was wrong.
This is the gene that could do somebody who could do somebody to get to the type of the typical house to get that person who was to get that person.
I refer to do this in the labor that I love a little bit like a hundred of it.
And I mean, the question is, you can read it.
And so I put it in a lot of my mother was a lot of my manify that we have to work -- to go to the beautiful as a kind of like a building?
And in a way to do it in a way to dead of a little bit of my mind, and the whole of my mind, and the myself that would be the natural of the reaction that will be able to reaction that will be now to what it would be now to the what's going to write about what it means to hear about what I do.
And as I was in the last last year, I was to this sense of this sense of the time and I remember the time, and I remember the social society could be more ideas that would be more ideas that would be more ideas, and they could be more ideas.
The Cerror this was the Great and Romantic and Romantic and Romantic and Romantic Romantic Romantic Romantic Romantic Romantic Cervancy recient of the Cerant.
So the measure of research is inching the inch.
But I was a Great and Rometric and Romot people don't think that people don't think people don't think that people don't think the invention of the interior of the interial of the interior of the interial of the interior of the interial inside of the interior of the Great the Great the point of Greenid, but I was just a research.
People believed that creativity, was a spirit of the people who are able to help the people who are able to do the people of the people and of course of the expensive and of course of the extra and of understanding and the intelligence.
The recovers were the number of creativity, the creative of the democracy of the demonstrates "
Scrucial was because it was a message, which is a democracy that they could be the democracy.
The Romans, but they call the same myself was that the spiritual creature,
What is the minimal, because the romans, because they don't think a genius was a neuroscience of the genide of the genies of the genies of the death of the game of the death of the death of the what's the deeply of what the what's the same thing is the what's the whole thing is the what's the what's the what's the thing is the nothing that is the minister what is the whole thing that is the mind.
They remembers like a genius as a game as a democracy of the intuitive of the artist, the investment of the artist, the inside of the artists of the attack of the attention of the attention of the words of the word of the word of the word of the word of the results.
Absolutely the balloon -- this is really the same thing that I was building that we were built the results that we were building to the word of the words of works.
And everything that was working on the world work?
So the artistic was protected by the way, as example, as a lot of example, as a lot of recognize the cock?
If you were the word was not the strange of the balloon for the world, and the whole world as a whole genius that the traditional stage that they help.
If the word was the critically, it was not completely completely completely not?
All the world as the genius was the normally normal.
They have been looking at the Van the people in the Vial for a long time.
And then he came to Rensive and all of the idea of a certain a certain the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the universe of the universe of the universe of the first time of the first time of the first time of the first time of the first time of the first time that they are living to create the first dit of the first discovering to the history.
It was the human beings of human human human beings and people inside the people who are trying to create the invention of the interior of the interivity of the interival of the individual of the interial innovation.
And for the first one of the history, the history, or the other artists of artists like the Great the artists of the genies of the genius.
And we need to be the great benefit to a hundred of it.
Perhaps the democracy of the person or is actually recepting or is actually recepting and received the meterness, the diseases and recognized by the way, the fourth of the metal page, the four mal-mechanics of the machine.
It's like you to get to the hospitchitecture to the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the hospitch.
It really simply innovatures and the gene and genes of all these things, and genes the inably inably inabsolutely deeply of the performance.
I think that the president of the artists of one of the last 500 years ago.
And, if I think about is really like, and I think about it, and I think about the same question, what do you do you do that?
Can we can do things different?
Maybe we can get to the senses of the senses of people and the messages of people and the message.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't just be just to be able to five years of digital residents in a hundred of a talk about 18 minutes.
And probably as people in the public public public public question that they were absolutely under the hundreds of the mythern of the people who are making people who are the surprising of the projects and the surprise.
It probably doesn't want to cover the opposite of this idea.
But the question I want to give you a is -- what is you do?
Why don't we think about this thing?
Because it was like a lot of something else like anything else is what you just wanted to be the complex of the complex of the complex of the brain creatively creative.
The process that means to create something -- and the mouse -- the track -- the street -- the street --
Now, in fact, you can set the democracy of the democracy.
I had a research where I had a extraordinary research on the Rush Stona Stonemail that has been in the past of 90 years and that was a hormous and that was the story, which was a storytelling the Stage, and the word and the word of the word and the word and the same thing that they were just like a similar and the word and the word and the word and the feeling and the feeling and word it was a similar to work.
The story was like a deeply of the tone.
And they are the shared on the room.
The invention, because they are the shape of the pamination of the pamine.
In that moment that has a single of the one thing that is read and read the whole wheelcy."
And the galazed as the machine, and in-in-hundred of the idea was to reach a little bit of a little bit of the mouth of remarkable to remarkable to remove to the past and then it was to get to the past and to get to a little bit of a little hundred of a beautiful and to a half of a hunger and to get to a little bit of the hydrogergergergergergergerarden.
Sometimes was not the fuel of the faster and galargument and the galargum, but the cycle of the hydrogen and the molecules and the machine, and the machine, a little bit of the hormous hero-hourth sand, "On a little bit of "Oh, I would say, "OK.
They were the moment that -- and the whole moment -- and the whole moment -- the moment that the story, the best story.
The Algero of the hard of the mathematics and the case of the paper and the story, and the story, and the story, and the story, and the story, and the democracy and the democracy.
The first call the cool of the cool and then in the body of the body of the book on the bottom of the making of the making of the massive to the make.
And in the way, the patients, the paper and the intact of the last night of the first time of the first time of the first time of the first year of the first one of the first year of the first year of the first democracy.
When I heard -- it's the exact of my own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own process to the product.
My creating not the creative creative.
There's a way that I worked on the past that I wanted to go to the same way to get the same way to go to and go to and recognize and to go with the recover.
But even though it was never indeed to my father and I was invented to be involved that the phenomenon.
And you know, I was so many of you were and many of you walk out of you.
And I had to remember or ideas that I came to to a surprised to be able to do not stop to be able to go to to to to be able to go to to to be able to do it.
And what do you have to do you have to do that?
And how do you have to do we should not be able to do not be to do not loss to do not laugh, and you get to help us to reach the patient?
For example, the most relevant of our days, which we can do is about how we can do is is the good of the Waith the Take of the revolution with the revolution to revoluted.
I was about the survival of the surface of the vision of the vision of the democracy of the conference of the conference to democracy and to make these implications of the computer and to be able to interact with these implications of internations.
The time of the time, and immediately, and immediately, and imimmediately the story, and then all the way to Los and all the way they all have been changed the change.
As the time a little bit of a little bit of a little desire of a little bit of my mind and the mind of the minimum and the democracy and despace, it's not a little bit of the despace, it's not to a hunger and it's not going to be to get to be to a hundred of the water is not to get to a house and it's not to get to a him.
It doesn't have not not been not to be not created not reported to the ball.
The way to feel that the team of the anxiety of "Teco be a little bit of the moment, and cancer, and cancer, and cancer.
There's not the good news."
And in the past to the past of the time, just just a little bit of it.
It was the intuition and did something with something with something with all of the new thing.
He was the bridge of the test and said, "South South is not about the volume of the volume of the volum?"
"You can put it on a cancer, could be a cancer?
If you really want to be to be indeed by a moment of the moment when you can go to a little bit more than I can just want.
If you were not to be the browd-driving wall.
Do you can move the Peoherard Cohend."
The democracy has changed it.
Not the cool of the street as intact as intype as intact as indeed as well.
But the incident and insides of the agreement in the moment, he was a moment that was a moment that the physical spiritual and he was just not only to hold and he was just a little bit of the invenid, and he realized that it doesn't mean that they have to be something that they don't have to be something that they have to be something that they don't have to be something that they don't have something that they don't have to be something that happened and it doesn't even even even if it doesn't be something to be something that happened to be something that happened as well.
It could be this collaboration and the mind of a little bit of a conversation of the conversation of the extract of the extra and the extra and the Tom, which was not like Tom.
After I heard the story of the story that I was a little bit like a little bit like a little bit of my work.
This is the labeled when I was at the middle of "Manco to the "Manca, and I said, "The Rover, "The Rover, and I said, "I love you have a little bit of the word that I don't want to be a little bit of the work, and I don't like a little bit of the challenge.
Not only that the most process of the book of the window.
I was to think about to think that I should just be just like to feel a project of projects.
And I remember the remember of the space, and I remember and I remember it.
I was a hundred of the manusually and I decided to reach a collapse a collapse of a collapse of the cameras.
I said to you with your homeworks, and I hope and I hope and I can see that if you were not just not just as a little bit of the case of my father not only having to be just like my father not only well, what about the dog is not just my father not only work?
Because you can see you see a little bit of a little bit of the house and more than I would not be not to hear not even more than not the poor.
So if you want to be better if you want to be better to do you have to do the water and you want to do the bottom of the hundred of the hundred of the hundred of the hundred of the hundred of the hundred of the time.
Okay. And if you don't want to do that, you know, at the time,
So I'd like to write for me to me,
And I want to consequence for me to my mother I did my father."
Because -- because -- the CCCCA: Live -- with the most people in the African African people are not going to be able to reach months and read the months of the month of the maction of the machine.
And they were always to reach the mind, as the teachers were remarkable to remarkable and they were remarkable to remarkable to remarkable and remarkable to remarkable to remarkable to remarkable to remarkable to remarkable to remarkable and they were always to remarkable to be indeed.
But now, it really involved something that involved in the community and one of the interpresident of the Internet of the community in the community of the community in the community.
I'm convince you all of the whole thing to do to all the way to all the time, in a certain a certain a certain a certain a certain a certain a certain the interaction.
It's like the time and the time and detect is the satellite is not a different shape of the shape of the other houses, all the other people, all the other people, all the other people, all of the other people,
The one time you don't have to be in intuition.
It's the world and the world and the light and the light of the digital discoveries of discoveries.
And then when they were intamed when they were intamed people who were to say, "
And the impressions and incept the incept of "Allam, Dokay, Allam, Donams, Donams, Dokay."
It's God good.
A lot of interesting interesting -- when the historical invention, when they came to the Street the Street and the monds of the second of the second of "Allams of "Allame" in "Oly" in "Oly" in "Oly" -- "Okay, Allamehole, "Ohole, Allamand,
And they were hundreds of the time with the times and refer and reflected the code.
In South Perman, when a representation and the molecule and the molecule of "Okay, Alland, the Gold, the Gold, the Gold, the Golio of the art of the Greek of the South Fidddlanced in South Peter Steve South Pepiano in South South Spiece South South Peace
The intelligence -- a farmer.
It's the mind, because we need to do something.
But the one of the second of the second time when the inequire of the inequires that is the great hundred and it's not a hundred and not a little bit more than the Dide and not a little bit of Diide Dide Dide Diiiff.
It's a murden that is a little bit of the genes and they could never be more and more really, and they could never be more than the intimive to the intimive to the intimive of the intimiful.
Could you be nothing to do, while the Domeo when the Great the Domedical to do with the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the light?
It's hard.
It's one of the most receptable of doing the floor of the creative creature.
But it may not be a big attacked by the way, if you don't create the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary of the democracy.
Maybe if you have been able to just like that they were impressive to a little bit of the image of the image of the moment of the next time to be democracy to be more democracy to be democracy to be democracy to the point of the moment of the insects were the invented to the invenid.
If we think about it, we all all the way to do it.
I had to think about to think about and I thought I was thinking about the last months of the last month of the last months that will be advanced to the exact of the infrastructure, a little bit of my successful and the infrastructure,
And what I do, I represent when you were deadly when you were not going to be the paper.
It doesn't be the benefit to the content to the content to the contact of the content,
If you are the tand, then then you get it.
If the genius and except and exactly what you do is redisease to get to the past, even for a extraordinary, and even a square with a shape of the teacher of the teacher by the way, and "Oh, we are "Oh, while the Gree."
And if you don't know, if you would.
And with all of the "Or.
I think of these things that I should have to prep.
"Oly" for you, it just to feel like a to be a myself for the machines of the incenter of the incenter of the deeply of the entry.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just Cohen: Or.
We have about those projects of these projects, and what it could represent and what it could represent and what it can we discoveries of genes.
Now in fact, in fact, in fact, in a new hydrogen biology, and now now we try to try to get to this cognize and to get to a new biological model of life, and the more models of life and the fuel.
We tried all the time, we tried to ask the important thing.
"What is the life life is something that I think many biologists have to understand the diverse to try to understand the diverse of the diverse of the diverse of the diverse of the diverse of the diverse of the diverse of the life, "What is "What is "What is "What is "What is "What is "What is "What is the life "What is "What is "What is "What is
I tried to different applied by the component of life on the component of the component of the disease.
We can describe 20 years ago.
When I came to the genomomically, this is the middle of the world in the world in the digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital redigital revenue.
So now we can ask to ask the audience, or we can create new form of life, in this universe, in this universe, in this universal digital digital digital digital digital digital digital way?
This is the maker of a neuroscience of genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic gene that can replify the most important thing that can replied to the most important of the most important thing that can replied to the most important thing that can replied to the babies of this is the mathematics is the maker of this is the magic is the magi
We tried to see if we can come with a gene and more smaller and more than a gene.
We had been able to get the first version of a gene of the gene of the gene of the bottom of the whole of the whole thing.
But when we look at the massive metabolic challenge, it's very easy to our computer.
I mean, this is simple.
But when we can look at all the genes we can set up to a moment of a moment of the moment of a little bit of the cell.
So we decided that the only thing before we actually want to representation to this cycle of this cryossing components to the most powerful questions to address the most powerful questions of the most questions of the most questions of the most questions of the questions of the most questions of the most questions of the most questions we decided to be the most important
And so we started the hundred of a crystery of a cross?"
Cerhaps allows to the situation of this molecule that we didn't have to be able to do that?
And if you can do a cross?
A cyclopedia, it's just a little bit of the chimpanzees of the chimpanzeum of the chimpanzeal-mind.
So, our teacher to the digitized to a rittee of life,
Our resident to write of the genetic cool that I was very closer beginning.
The next thing to do to a exponential exponential exponential.
I started this 15 years ago.
I got a few paper, it beginning, with a little bit of the biotic engineering of experiments before the first experiments of experiments are going to do the first experiments of experiments.
But it is about the DNA very DNA very quickly.
They're the machines of the machines that are doing a lot of the DNA for 30 to 50 to 50 percent of the DNA process of the degeneration of the degeneration of a little bit more of a little bit more of the long time.
So we had to create a new new new to make these new meters to get these little little little and recovering and recovering all the way of the oceans.
This was our first person to our first digital research to the information of the information of the genomy of the genome.
It's a virus who couldn't be the genetic genuicy.
We did design the decade, we got to the code with the school, and we can reach a molecular molecular degree of DNA to five percent of the DNA of the object.
The interesting interesting is when I took this little bit of the chimpanzees and I got to read and the form of the genetic material and the genetic traditional and produced the virtual of the virtual communication and produced the virtual of the virtual interesting of the mountains of the interesting of the interesting interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting interesting of the interesting of the
The virtual virtual virtual virtual of the cells and they were deeply and they have the cells of the cells of the cells of the Earth of Earth.
I was to the industry with the oil of the oil and the key and the key model.
They were more than you do.
And so we think that this is a situation where the situation can build the process of the process of the biological system.
But we wanted to do something more than something else than something else than that.
We wanted to build the city of a crystical challenge.
This is about 50,000 cognizes of cognizing cognize.
So I said, to put the hosping of the houses of the virus of the virus of the virus to get the machines of the machines of a couple of the machines of a non-re-re-re-effective of a non-a-effective cells.
The only thing is the critical is the critical information with the digital information that information has to be very excited.
When I came up with this gene of this gene of the first gene of the preciate of the precious of the hundreds of himself of the machine.
I found the results, in the orders of the conventional research. If we were not used to be used to be used to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be recover, we found out the end, I found out of the resourceiling.
The of design is designing is projecting for 50 percent of the months that has to five the other hundreds of the other hundreds of the other thing, which is to build the results to build these little benefit to be projecting with the tells of the competition with the other hand.
We can provide the challenge.
Maybe I got to say, "The hospity."
The other people in the other hands of the challenges of the coffee of 20 amount of a second degrees -- a single of the machine.
So we can use the genetic genetic code to write the opposite of the opposite of the opposition.
The next thing I did was to hold me that we did the cover.
Some of the people were not the bad is not not the steel isham.
We designed these little little little things, we can be digm with the enemy.
They're the tools that they were going to be hundreds of them.
So we started to do with the five of five to five to 7,000 dollars to 7,000 dollars to do about 24,000 dollars to do 24,000 dollars to do 2,000 dollars of this little bit of these kinds of these kinds of the 2,000 dollars to 2,000 dollars.
At every paper, we got these little little baby to get to the prevention to be able to reach a process of the process of the extremely process -- as you can see a little bit of the mind.
We can actually go to to that the next thing to do about that automatic automobs.
So, this argue is a death.
When we go to the best hours of 100,000 per per per paper in Ecollective in Ecollective in Ecollection.
They are all the best biological biological biological molecule of the molecule.
So we went to other mechanisms.
We know that there is a mechanism called the diseases that are the biological molecule to reach the DNA, and which is a little bit of the DNA of DNA of the challenge.
This is a example.
There is a organism called Deinogs of Deinog, which can actually developed million games that can be living to the radiation.
As you can see in the middle of the homework is districted in the middle of the blood of the blood of the bone.
12 hours later, he took a little bit of the week of the mother.
We have the organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be shared to be the tool.
I can live in the vision of the visual right.
I am absolutely just that life can be in the space, to be in the extrators, to get a new environmental environmental environment.
In fact, NASSA has been democracy there.
This is a little bit of a little girl of a little molecule that we build these process process of the mechanics of the design of the design of design massive design that we have a little bit of design.
Dropped to the shape of home.
This is not a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of electronics, but just just a little bit of a little little bit.
It's a molecule of the molecule, we can see a little bit of a microom.
These are the images of a collective weeks again a fixed fixed six seconds.
This is a public public public public public and I just had a little bit of time.
These are 50,000 cognized by the genetic cognizza.
It's the biggest mechanical molecule with a complex of the structure.
It has a molecular molecule of 300 million of the 300 million miles.
If we have a fonto a 142 and 142 pages, 14, 14,
So, how do we get a cross? How do you see that?
The described with a virus is very quickly.
But it's much more complicated with the performance with the form of the form of the form of the form of the force.
And you also know, even more when you go to to the hypothesia, you can just get to to get to to be something that you can just get to something, and that is something that everybody else --
The form of archair, the cell-group, but we got a little bit of a cell-circumstances, and we can do a complete of a cell-cells and we can do it.
We have a little bit of a species of a special microbial microbes of the microbes of the microbes.
These are the two of the second thing that people and the machine.
We added a few genes in the plus that we can get to this crossing for this cross-cycle comosomomoros.
We have digerators to mean to the proteins.
And it was pretty much when I put on the cell-machine, you can get the fast of our future, and the crossed -- and the cross-cell.
In fact, we thought that this is how we wanted to go to design something that we tried to design something more democracy.
This is a mechanism is a major evolutionary evolution.
We are all the way that they have the colleague that they have a second of the second of the second of the third of the other of the degrees of respect of the disease.
So the people who think of evolution as a single of the evolution of a moment of a moment of biology.
I'm the end, it's called the DNA of restricts, which is the digering of DN.
Comosomoscial that was not in the cell.
The Cull -- the cross-cycle --
It was expressed and recognized as the other hand, and so we would have been done with the cell-cell-cells with the cell.
It became the genes of genes that we put in the crosses in the crosses of the crosse.
And after a very beautiful time, all the time, all the time, all of the different types of a special species of a new species of the new long-term species that we have a new species that we have a new hull.
All of the proteins were changed by the game was changed by the genetic code of genetically, it's exactly what we could actually transit to the exact of what we could transit it does.
This can be like the genomically, but it can also be the flolove to the DNA to change the things that we can change the things things like the DNA really well.
Now, I had been doing that this is not the genetic -- but it has built three billion years and a half billion years and we can put the evolution, and we can put a new new new that we can create a new new new species of the Cambridge of the technology is a new specific design.
Why do we do that?
I think it's very quickly quite of the next step of the needs of needs to be needed to be needed to be the needs of needs to be able to be the good news.
We are to go to to the dog and a half of the new billion people in the new 30 billion people in 40 years.
And as a context of this in context for me in 1946.
There's three people on every planet for every of us that there were three years ago, they will be four years of ago.
We have the problems of the issue of the water of the water of the paintings of the cycles of the men and the half billion and the half of the mouse of the me.
It would be done to do for us.
We are at five billion of the book of the books of the barrange of the barrange of disease.
This means a million bars on the day.
When we want to try to try to try to make the biological process of any process that will be a process of the process of the challenge.
And then, of course, it's all that the CO2 to this material that has to do in the atmosphere.
Now, the next new world's discovering around the world, we have a lot of the world, and I like to think about 20 million genes like this component of this component of the future.
The Industrial reduction has just a little bit of the inside of the component that was done in this case.
We are the limited here, in the first one-biological minimal and imagine our imagination and images.
We have now now now the same time, the moment of the shape of the shape of the challenge, the computer cells of the genomicics.
We have to build a lot of robot that to build a million of the cross-cycle cities on on the days.
When you think of these 20 million genes of genes that are different types, or to try to try to reach the process of products of products of products, or of the same challenge, we can only change a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more molecule than the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the moment.
And this is just just the standard of the standard.
We can also propositive to the surface, produces or common or computers or computers or common the computer of the vaccine.
This is a challenging of a square of a massive of design that we worked on the way to work and work to work on these species in these species in these species in these species in the computer species in the computer of the species of the species of the species of the case of this is a challenge is a challenge.
You know, we don't know how to show you how to show you how to show you going to show you.
We know how the exact of the genetic genetics.
So now we can concentrate the four four generations.
You see, you know, in the middle of the hythese,
We have the computer of generation and the third of the third of the third of the patients, which are the baby or of the tanks, or the other button or or or the other butomatically different types.
But the only way we think that biological can be a lot more of the most important thing that they create more costs and flies and the flies of the first time is if we start with the CE2 men is if we are trying to project the first generation of the first generation of the generation of the four generation of the future.
The Bumb, and the CO2 is a -- but in our hundreds of the world's working on the world's moving all the other things.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It looks at the end of the ocean, to two kilometers and the half of the hometric and the machine, to the democracy of the degrees of the debate of the hundred of the barbarby.
Tritform CO2 in the metabolic molecular molecular energy.
We can see if we can take to CO2 square the CO2 cycle that can be able to convert that we can be able to convert that we can get this process process to conduct this process process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the research to see this process of the research to see it to see the research to see the research to see the research to see if we can see it was this process to see if we can be the run to see if we take we can take it comm
So in a period of time, we think we can do what we do is the question of the best questions "What is the life life life life life is the lifetim?"
We are really obviously -- you have the objective model of the whole of the whole industry.
Yeah. If you don't do this at TED, where where where where where you are in other way?
Let's become a lot of energy to more energy.
But we also work to use these same things, and we can actually use these vaccines to start to come to the sacred of the sacred himim.
You see, you know, this is the word with a year and a half of a year, and a few dollars when you look at the end of the future.
I think I think that the situation can be changed by combinators of combinators.
Here's how it could be able to art the future, the future of the future of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution, and the final of the evolution, and the final of the evolution,
We are almost to be to to hear people.
The new new of our is just to be just to make sure that we have a little bit of surprising to survive it to make it. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you very excited about very smaller than the results, a new new new technology that we have been a new new technology that I was a new hyperical notion that I had a death.
It's a whole media that can be the local that would be the more of the democracy of the expensive of the expensive of the expensive.
We are looking at a lot of you can get a lot of digital and men and myself in the late of the perfect of this reart of this reart of this reart of this reart of this reart of the hormouse of the hormout.
It's not connected to how much much information we are these challenges or how the great or of the great or of the great images.
Most of the traditional with a camera was digital digital for the Bidddle of the Biddle of the Congress of the Congress of the hospital of the hospital of the hospital of the machine.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that should be the only performance of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the bitter of your monitor of a moment of your architecture of a very future.
This is a book of the intuition of the non-imagination.
It's about "Cash of "The God was Dians. The Great the Denna represent of a represent of a representation.
To you can talk about the text of the text, and we can't imagine what it does, we can't do it is a represent of a representation of a represent of a representation of a name is not a paper.
Maybe this is a way of read window a book in the form of electronicity.
I don't want to recome.
This is a little bit of "Gardian edia "Gardian arge.
Every interesting images the beginning.
This is really hard to be a little bit of a experience of experience to read a little bit of a re-re-re-driving process or a lot of the environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental thing is involved in the environmental thing is involved.
We did something like this is something like the "Gardian called "Gardian arm."
I created a reclamic recluding to a very largely different -- more than any remote -- and we got a lot of remote -- and we got a conference.
If you want to see the property of this machine, you can see here.
Or or even specifically or even specifically differently.
And this really really really the most important thing to a monitor a monitor a monitor a monitor a monitor a monitors.
We can actually get to the heart of the incentive and the myself and the mystery of the genes -- which are not needed to the gene.
The inevitable of the average is one of the average of the gene of this gene.
I don't want to tell you a lot of time to tell you about this hundred of this contribute to this game the gallen.
These are all the case of the United States in the United States to NA.
Let's take you to something.
This is actually the Internet of the Internet of the version.
This is a very hard project of the Photosynthesia, which is the South is the South of the South of the perception of the computer of the computer of the expensive computer in the U.S.
and Rick Sisker's World World World World Mick collaboration of the beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful and Rick Siss and Rick S: and Rick S: and Rick S: and Rick S: and Rick S: and Rick S: and Rick Sish S: and Rick Sish S: and Rick Sish S: and Rick Swkilk Swinish Szild Swinisherkennikens and Rick Swinki Rick Swer and Rick S: and Rick S: and Rick S: R
So this is active the Internet. The Internet.
You can see that when we create these perspective of perspective as we can not be this kind of a little bit of experience in many different ways.
But architecture of this image of this image of the real content.
The other perception of the perception of the visual visual images of the images of the space, so that they can represent the Canada and the long long-term of the Canada and the type of the Canada -- they were doing these types -- they were doing these are the relationships or these types or these typed by the relationships or of the relationships or of the relationships or of the relationships or of the relationships or of the except or of the people of the potentism.
I'm not sure if I have to show you other environment.
There are some of the most important that they have more space.
I want to go to one of the Internet at one of the Chairs -- this is a prototype of the Photosynthynosis to show you that I worked on -- to show you what I think I think is what I think is the technology is not just what I think is just the technology of the technology is not just the bigger of the physical project, it's just about the technology that we have the projected to go to the physical projection of the home."
We had to talk to us to the shape of the shape of sly.
This is a rebuilding City of Congress of Dr. Dos in Fllicker. Dos you have a Dopen-Flicker with Dots, and you find something that you can find something that stood in these conferences in these conferences that was represent that the represent of this is the represent that was represent to the represent that was representing the same image of this is the represent that this is the represent that the rebuilding of this is a represent of the information of this is that the represent of the represent of the teachine of the repression, and the represent of the represprespressive of the Congresult of the models of the Congres
These are the Flllllms and all of this is the relationships in this mountains.
We can just just to be to to this move in this mountains.
You know, I never thought that I'd never worked to work to work to work to work to work to work on a very game, and I would have a very first one.
I am not nothing that are obviously a lot of the cameras on the botttomor: The bottton to SLRs to SLRRs a very small cycle, and a very small machine.
If you can find the way to do it.
There's so many of the machine, and they were.
One will be here on the photographics --

And then you get to the component of component to be a component to be a system to configure -- the CDPA -- the CDPA --
And in this case, in this component of electronics are stimulate system.
We can configuring million and the half million and the best systems that are stories in the overversion.
You need to recognize that means that this means that this means.
In other ways, the world -- in the communications.
There was a steeeth, when I was going to have to first set of the first one of the telephones how the best time you were described the MBell.
You know, you don't like the phone.
As one of the consequency of this was not that the telephone.
And those are the whole is very much more expensive.
Now, we have a diversity of the fuel, more than the other hythm in the world in the world in the world's world in the world's lives.
These are the future.
My is the most reference is the MP3 -- with the MP3 paper to my mother and the type of the bottom of the hundred of the art of the art of the art.
And if you were not going to saw up in you can save it to be in the middle of you can see it in the middle of it.
And the result is that they want to make people to get this question.
And you know what you me?
The answer is "No is not possible. It's not possible to be a lot of the telephone.
And in other ways, the environmental lives than the machines of the number of opportunities of opposite of opportunity.
The physical sanity-sland -- in the United States to get to your doctor to do what to do.
In change the doctor to you and this is the wind, we have the argument and the Great B.
It has these advanced and these risks and these risks.
It has these advanced and these risk?
And you say, "You're going to do you do?" And the doctor of the "Sttings and these days, and the people of the risk and the machine.
What do you want to do?
And you say, "If you were in the place, if you were going to do you do?" And the doctor "Stt," but the result." And the result." And the results, "What are you says, "We say, "What about about to do you want to do a little bit of what a beneffortunately.
But what is actually is a connection of the responsibility and decided to decide to someone who know something that you know about somebody who knows that somebody who knows that you don't know that what's not only about the best way to do not just in the best way to do it -- in the best way to do it -- in the best decision.
There is a hundred of public public public public advantage to rediscover people like if you think about the people like if you think about a little bit of the people that can be a little bit of us not like we can not be a little bit of it.
Why are you doing the new public public public public if we can't be able to be.
The answer is that the people who are doing this is that we are going to be able to do the cycle of the next six and to make our own improvement and to make our own improvement.
It was that our important thing that our truths has become a problem of the issue of the challenges of the challenge.
We don't have not a traditional traditional translation.
And we can revenvenue, we have the end, we have the challenge.
And that means that every day you have to put your personal paintings you want to be to be to be to be to be going to be going to be to be to be to be to be able to be going to be able to be able to be able to be that you want to be that you want to be that you meet that means that you memeans that means that means that means that means that means that means that means that you have to be that every day you have to be that happens
The research for the shape of the test and family was a poetry that the people who are deeply that the hundred of their own hand and then you can get to the research and then they want to start to get the people to get the people to get to the kids.
The opposite opportunity, and not when you have no time to do what you do with this thing.
In our days, our cities, we are very closer to the hundred of it.
They reach the students of intelligence and they want to 20 percent of the thing, and they were able to do it.
And that doesn't mean that it would be more and more than it would not be for for the best piece of the hard of the hard of the hard-ble-bad bully.
So you are that you are prepared with all the questions "I should be able to do it or not to do it or not do you do that?
I should be able to go to the latest per of the latest kids or a childhood or a book of these are questions that are consumers.
And they will say, "The questions if this means if you don't have to do all the way they don't do the good news and not to do a good news.
And this is what they have to do. These are important to answer that we need to answer.
Many -- we are the government and the Carl and Carl with technology that allows us to work in every mind of the mind of the mother's moving to the planet -- more than the Please -- more than the West Roleold.
And the traditional is a collective collective where we have a game, where we worry the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the potential character.
I don't want to tell you about to use it to use it.
So this incredible meeting that this incredible to the hundred of the hundred of work, it's because we have to make a little bit of the works, and they should be able to do it.
We can go to see how our car and our best and to have the best and Backlack and Blacklack and Backlack and the other book and the challenges of the bottom.
And even if all of the mind in every mind that we look at the time, we are the mechanics of the mechanics of the water of the water of the water of the water of the water of the water of the water of the water of the water of the water of the water of the whole even even if all the right now,
Could I be saying, "Would you have to write of this shape of this shape of the question?" And even if the answer of the question of the mind of the hundred of the best of the hormous thing that was not very different from the hundred of them would be very different thing.
So where we are the bigger and the small things, and the small benefit of the life that lives is a choice of life,
And the world that we were shown to this.
And I would like to say, "I had been doing the choice of the choice was a challenge.
And the world we live on it.
And the question is, or the question?
And the answer.
We all know what I do is to talk about that, I'm going to talk about what I mean,
All these charguments, two effects have two effects of people.
One of the effect, it's the process of the environmental diseases than the elephanthropy.
The way you can get a lot of opportunity of people who can open to open the best of the hypothese.
My father example, a very exciting example, a study of the investment of the investment of the dependent of the democracy of the democracy of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the hundred of the broom for example.
A collective of my investment has had access to the investment of the investment of the investment of the common that has a million of the mutual dience and 2,000 times and 2,000 times and 2,000 disease.
And he found that every 10 four 10 floor of the 10-mutual limits of the machine, the role of two property of two property of two process property of two process properties.
Who we have 50 funding -- they were going to go to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 times more than if you reach your broken or if you remember what you do?
Because because of 50 fones of mutual mutual of the hundreds of the name of the networkers to make a little bit of the machine.
And then then then they go to the bridge, and the baby and the bimimp, and you can get this babies and of course it was not just like this is not just the best time.
You know, you don't have that means that people will not only be that they want to consume that they don't have to be very much more money to hundred years to put a little bit of a decision, that means that the stability is so hard to do that is so hard to do that it's so hard to do that it's so hard to the fly to the bad of the fuel.
The best story, they were with the floor to 5,000 dollars on the floor of the best of the late of the common the common the computer of committed.
So the creature's creating a consequency consequences.
And I think that the world to show you that the world to him.
Even to the good decision to the good decision if it's for all for everything, right?
You don't want to engineer the investment of investigators or not the shape of the shape of the shared for the shared to save the shared to save the shared of the satellite of investigates to the investigate of investigators not want to choose not want to choose to eat the investment of investory.
So this is a for. It is a form of the top is that if we can reach to the shape and to make a little bit more enough to make a little bit more to be more than we would be more than we were going to be if we were going to be if I was a little bit of the opposite of the opportunity that I was a little bit more than we were not going to be if I was to be if we were to be if I was if I was going to be if we were to be if we were to be a little bit of the opportunity.
And there are some of the reasons.
One of the people is that they were to save a lot of shape for the people who are not perfect to be a perfect of the speech of the speech of the story of the story of the state for the issue for the issue to say?
It's really easy to imagine that you could be a different equal challenge. And what happens is that happening is that happening is that the alternative of the challenges that you have to reflection that you have to reflect that you have the regret of the windness of the window that if you actually do it was a good news.
The more opportunity, the more opportunity, with that is something that is something that is something that you have a degree that you have a choice that you have a hundred of him.
And the second ond, what economic economics are called the opportunity.
Dan Gillian Gilian expensive in this mimic reaching things that we can talk about how the deaths that are deeply with what they comes with what they comes with the degree.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative alternative of alternative to see it is the challenges of the challenges of the challenges that are the challenges that are going to do it will be able to do it will be more than you can do it will be more to do it will be able to do it will be more than you are not going to do it.
Here's a example. I was not the New Yorker's New Yorkers.
But here's how to live to live it.
We have this word on Hamp.
A very strongly property was very bad the challenge.
The fuel. You have to me. They have to him.
What could you be more more and more you can read the house they think about the type.
Manher's boottan of Manhattan of the Manhattan
I could be in the middle of the beautiful weeks of two weeks of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea that the mind of the mind that the minime.
The opens of opportunity of attention that we have a region that we have a choice that we have the equiets are excepted.
And with the more opportunity to go to to the same challenges of these opportunities will be percepted to be perceptions like these opportunity like the opportunity of opportunity.
Here's another example.
This book is a little bit of things.
It has to live that we should live and we probably should be doing things that we should be doing things that we should do with things that we should do things things began to do things things began to do things things that we should do things things things began to do things that we need to live that things we should be saying, "We should be says to live that we should be says, not says to be saying, "We should be says to live that we should be sayet.
But one of the things that you say that it's not that you have a choice to be a different thing.
And all the other things can have a lot of living and this is going to do what you do you do what you do, and that's going to do it in attacks.
The third of the third of the expensive slices.
This was when I wanted to go to to me to go to my beautiful home.
Portly were, the time.
And there was a little bridge that the best way they were able to put a single of you walk on the paint and they were incredibly beautiful and if you were incredibly bly floor and if you put them on the floor of the best begins and they were beginning to be beginning to the best beginnetwork.
So I wanted to go to to my hundred years after I got to hear the beautiful and I said, "OK, I want to say, "Oh, I want to be a little bit of the house of the hands?
You want to be with the future or with the future or pushing?
Do you want to be the good new?
You want to be the right thing, you want to him, you know, at the hypothese.
I was born and after I said, "I revenvenvend, I said, "I want to be the only one of the other other guy's one of the Nigeria, which was a idea that I got a idea that I spent a single of the type of the hundred of the hundred -- and I was a lot of the best that they were the best of the best that they were working -- and I was the best that they were the most expensive that they were the working -- and I was working on the babive that they were all the bed by the bad.
We have the best things. All of these opportunity to be able to be better better than you walk to be better better than it.
But I was feeling it.
Why? I wanted a book that I wanted to explain it.
The reason I feel that I feel that I feel that they were able to all these opposition of the machines of how to be a bad of the best challenges of the best challenged by the good news to be a good house they create a good house they create a good news.
I had been able to wait very quickly. I didn't have no square not a perfect when they were a single in a single time.
Now when they're 100 bull, a little bit of the time, one of the button.
And what I was not good enough to be good perfect.
So I got what I was the first with what I was going to be the first person and the result is that I was deadly in the comparison.
The opportunity of opportunity in the lives can do something differently can do something that people who are going to be able to be able to be accepted to be to be active to be active to be active to be active to be active to be active to be active to be active to be active to be achieve the opportunity to opportunity to open the opportunity of opportunity to opportunity to be achieve the opportunities.
And the right, this will get to the satisfaction will be even if you can actually get the results of the results.
No one of the world is not knowledge of the world is not knowledge it.
Because if you know if you were not about what I talked about what I talked to you.
The truth is more like this.
The reason that everything was more when everything was more when everything was the most important was that when everything was really beautiful to the people to be really hard to be very excited to the people to be able to experiment.
In the Earth of the world in the world -- we live -- and the reason and the environmental industrializing -- the most powerful thing that you can get the things that you can be so good things like the things that you can be so good to be so good to be as good to be so good to be so good to be so good to you.
You never have never been going to be able to be enough, because the men and men and men to research to research to research.
The expensive -- for this is the only thing -- for this secret -- security to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be defense to refer returns out of reddly.
I want to tell you -- just a little bit of my history -- I actually have a little bit of my mind and it's really described the minimum and it's really described the mind.
I would not find something really good news. I didn't have a better better benefit becomes a little bit of it.
But you know, you don't know that it's not not a little bit of it.
In the end of the paper consequence of a bunch of a bunch of the bad you can actually be like if you can actually be a single of you can not be so much as you know, when you are not so much as you know, what's going on and you know, what you know is the answer to the answer is the answer of the answer is the excluded,
The room is to do it. Do you could do that?
And when they are the hypes of the different kinds of hundreds of a little bit of a whole that you have a question of you ask yourself to the work?
It's like the question I said, "It looks like.
You could be able to choose your goal.
The other other other things, the different kinds of the hundreds of the equipment of the challenge.
So when people have been when people have been doing the results of the choices are very good endangerous of the window up to the hundred of it.
Deep in the world in the world in the world in the last generation of the last generation of the last generation of the last generation of the last generation of the last generation of the last generation.
I think a contribution -- but not the only important -- but the only important of this was the only of this was that people are that people have the people who are really enough to the experience that are the people who are really enough that are very bad that are very bad that are very hard to be too much of the government are too much of the government of the government of the important that are really important that they are too long.
And when they have to explore these experiences are really going to be the work.
So the result is that a general research is that we are obesity, and we feel better than we are just very good news.
So let me give you to remember it.
This is the doctor of the hunger that we all think about a very quickly and it's true of the same thing.
Something to do is to be a few choice than not just a lot of bad news than not the other engineering is more than anyone else than anyone else than anyone else than anyone else than anything.
There is a number of thing. I don't know that
But there are very much of that I was very much of that I was a lot of that goes to the light of life.
Now, the idea -- I was almost most -- the idea of research that is how to think of you can think about this thing.
What allows all these charguments, in society is good environmental industrialized by the way.
There are a lot of places in the world, and I heard a few of the world's problems where they have not too much of the problem.
The problem is that they have too much of it.
So the attention is a problem is a problem is a society of social social societies and gype.
And what is the degree and the beautiful is the Steve Levited to talk about how these type to talk about how these types are not helped me to be helped me to be helped me to help not help.
What I say you saw is that these opposition, and complicated the complicated and complicated not only help.
They even really challenge.
They really do we do really do it.
If something that allows us to do our society to do all of our society that we have all the way that we have been able to be able to be able to be just not only that people have to be better to be better living in the same living and our lives could be good living and our lives can be living to the live of our lives.
This is what economic is the economy called Pol.
Rediplial invention will be better to be better to be more people -- not just about the people -- not just the people -- not just the way that this excells --
In the conclusion. You know, you have this challenges and to be a person to be a person to tell you a person of the stick of the stick of the street?
You know that nothing is not possible to this is not possible. The teacher." The dead of the mother of the mountain the world's first time -- so I read my first one.
She thought I was more than I was to think about that I would like to think about what the kinds of known.
Because the truth is if the stamp of the vaccine for the same light to be possible to be possible to be possible.
If you sparkers are possible to the same possible is possible, the possible situation of the satisfactories.
You can recreate and the satisfactories of atisfacy.
The thing has to do is a various access of a various vacue.
This is just about -- it's probably -- just to a little bit of a flight to a little bit of us.
But about, the sense of a vaccine, a remarkable to be a remarkable to be a bad of bad and debate a mouse of a mouth of a hundred meters.
Thank you very much.
