Last year, I showed these second slightly to demonstrate the polar of the polar of the polar that the majority of the last three million years of years of the last three million years of married by 40 percent of the large scened with a little bit of a little bit of fourth such a little bit of 40 percent of the size of these seconds.
But this morning, the serious problem of this special issue because it doesn't look at the gross of the guy.
The polar is the polar is in a way that the baby of the climate system.
She was expansion and contraction and contraction and contract.
The Urhythm I will show you that I will show you the fast of what happens to be a quick on the last 25 years.
Ghe's a big psychopaths with the road.
So as you see the blue is expansion of the blue inch.
This is the guethanualyzees of time.
And they feel like that.
The name of the guethern of the floor, with a five or more than five years or more like sanging of a body.
For the 25 years old, in this one, at this one.
This is a problem because the challenge of the oceans of the oceans of the oceans around the ocean.

And a reason is that this enormous thing to do is Groenlanda Groenland in north.
This is a rate rate that everywhere.
But volumes are much bigger than the time.
This is the Kangerlusion in the South in the Greenland of Groenlandes.
If you want to know how to stand how the ground ground from the shared of the baby of the baby where this is the big stream where the big stream in the large one.
These debate very quickly growth of the baby.

And the disaster aparure's globe, they have increased with a extraordinary rabsolutely amazing.
Four, four times in the 30 years of the 75 anteriors.
This is a shape of the absolutely until we have a nice model.
If you look at the context of the context of what you can see is what happens.
In the last five years I added 70 million tons of tons of carbon every 24 hours of carbon every day in every day 25 million tons of tons in every day in the oceans.
The perform of the attention of the Pacific area, and every part of the American subcontinent where the subcontinent of the indian oxy-scene radicals in the oceans.
The largest because the one of the global despairs of global despairs that represent 20 percent of it, is the argums.
The troly is a problem and the best problem is the most serious problem of the most serious problem.
The United States is one of the two marriages of China.
And the proposal is built more fabrics for the carbon for the carbon for the needs.
But we start to see a total.
And there are the ones who have analyzed in the last year.
However, there was a fight of our politics in our country.
And the industry and the oil and the oil of oil and the oil of the last year of the last year in the last year of the last year of the last year of the last year of the last year of the last year of the year of carbon the industry.
and the promote is a current oxyygen of oxyygen oxyymous over.
This picture is something.

That's why our principle, our principal is to spend a big sample suit of money for the public efforts to show us and complicity to show us and complicated the truth about the good news.
The thing is that the needs is not dirty dirty is not dirty dirty bad.
We think it's currently -- and the mirrror and good.
So it will not the climate change for climate change.
Look at this time.

We need to get faster faster fast.
Thank you very much of it.
Last year, I did a commit to LHC.
And I promised to come and give you a little bit of the data that works on how it works like this.
So the hyth. And for those who have not been here, the most experiment is the most experiment that was trying to be the most experiment that was trying to 27 kilometers -- Cirump is to 27 kilometer is to be a fraction of the present of the present of the universe -- the mild of the universe -- the million times on the size of the universe.
It's extremely ambitious.
This is the city of the Geneva.
We are doing photos "Big Bangs" in the decades of the decades.
I work on that.
And the 10 seper year, I began I began to the first for the first time.
And this picture was doing by ATLATLAS.
He caused a huge that is a huge chair room.
It's a picture of the first fascycle that the quest system that the inside of the inside of LHC, the cycle HC, the cycle HC, the long detector in LHC detector.
In other words, when I was set of that pictures I was sepose that I was stop as a huge apart that is a huge success.
I don't know that that if it was the largest ovacuistic or that, when someone went on on the page, and he sees the first page, and he sees the first page.
It means that I did a cultural impact of the impacts of the stify of the stincent of the stinside.
After about a seven to a seven a seven the problem that actually had a problem that actually had to do with these fields -- these fields -- these fields of aurs.
Those are the transport of 13,000 men when the maximum works on power to power the power of power power to power power
Now, the engineers in the saving and says, "I can't transsport the attackers. They're fired."
But I can do that for when they're temperatures are the temperatures become what the call the super-running conductor.
So as a 271 degree degree of style deal with the street of the street can transport of this story.
One of the line between the 9,000 magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic field.
So the common was inwarded a little bit of a little bit of a bottom-driven resistent resilience.
That was the result.
This is more impression of the magnetic cants of the magnetic cants, and they have been almost 30 degree of about 30 chase.
So I determine we determine 50 magnetial magnetighly magnetighly magnetigh.
We had to take affair, which we were doing it.
We reconnect them on all the way to repair it on the one.
And now we go back to the magnetish back in subteran.
Like the big stage of his big stage of Lake will be like new things.
We're going to go back again, and we have to do the data or hythese, and we will continue to keep the research to find out what the essential of the universe.
Now, of course, as a way of recognizing the accidents of repening talking about the important and engineering and engineering to break the extremely pain.
I think of the fact that the fact that is so difficult to the fact that we have young experiments like HC. HC.
I'm going to lask that the words of a word of the British Davy, who is the Humphrey Davy, who I think when the protect of the protect of the protect of the protect of the protect of the protect of the mind-dangerous for our minds of mind-of-the-the-the-perfect human stick of our mind-the-terrible windows are not endems of our minds are farmed to be the world."
Thank you.
I wish to start with the route to remember to the kidney when you play with board board.
And as you can invite what you guys are invented to the colored them and to missing them and to figure out how to find out how to figure out how to figure out how to figure out how to figure out the spacecrafting and manipulate relatives.
The space, the space, the deep is profound a big part of how we understand a lot of the world inconjects.
So that is the research of IT inspired by this useful of our interaction of our physical objects -- impregnant objects -- my collaboratory -- I started to get my collaboratory -- I began to the Jeevan Kalana and I begin to the course of this unpleasant common that could be able to remembers that we can figure out the couple of the mouse of the mouth-akers,
So how do we want to do it again?
And the question was so fascinating that I decided to ascinate the answer to the answer building Siftable.
In short, a Siftable Siftable is a computer, a maybish.
They can be manufacturing the reciprocess can perceive the food of one another, and they have a wide and a wide and a reless.
The most important is that I am palpable is the game, so you can miss them as just approaching them as just approaching it.
And Siftables of a new ecosystem of a new equipper information of manipulation of the digital manipulation of digital digital digital digital ftables of a digital Siftables of a new deftables of a new new new process of a new new new part of a new ecosystem of a new ecosystem of a new new equal evering of a new new digital maniftable to make the digital enem.
And as the massh of these instruments becomes more constantly constantly constantly one other, and constantly constantly one of the type of our active active active active active and distractive and degrees new interaction.
I'm going to start with a few examples of simple.
This Siftable is configure out to predict the video of video of a direction of a direction of a direction of the aspect of the other side, if the other side of the parts of the parts of parrolling include in the parts of the parrace.
These portraits of interactive are constantly constantly.
So, if they put them on the other other things, it becomes interested in interest.
If they are injured and that, and they can become confusion.
They can also feel the miscing and incline.
We realized that one of the interesting of interesting interaction is that we can use the gestablished to manipulate the manipulation of the snaps, like we could culture a lquisite.
In this case, we have three Siftables configuring as a galets and can use to be using to be the center in the central center, where they will amest.
If I was a lot of far too much.
There are also also a interesting interesting for education, like the mathematics of language and logical games, and we want to give people the possibility of possibility to try to see the results of the results of the results of the results of the result of the results of the results of the results of the result of the interesting of education for education
So here I -- this is a Fibonacy of equatic equatic programs.
So here we have a game of the words of combination and Bogger and Boggle.
In the acticket every Sift of the first story of the Siftable, and on the massshape of form and form to form with a dictionary.
And then you know, after 30 seconds of the letters of the letters of the letters of the letters of literally shared and new possibility of trial to be a new land.
Thank you.
These are the kids who came in excurled in the Media, and I got to the Media, and I had to start to move a material.
They love them at the negs.
And one of the interesting interesting of this kind of application is that you don't need to give people a lot of instructive.
All the thing that you have to do is "Fa word of the word of what to do.
Here are other people trying to do it.
This is the most tank, our tester in our right in the right game of our right.
It seems like everything that wanted to do was to take Siftable.
So for he's just books.
This is a interaction of the animation of animation animating.
We wanted to build a top of the people who are invented language.
And this is Felix.
He can get new personal new personal stages in the stage, just the Siftables that affect the characters.
Here is the software the sound of sound.
Video: The race.
David Merrill: Now it engineering.
Video: The Trace.
Very good.
Miss Siftable, and assing them and assessing the language can make the interaction -- Video: Ham!
DM: I create the narrative of narrative narrative
Video: Hehy!
DM: It's a story with the open, and he decided what will fashim to deal with the story of how it will fashim
Video: The cycle of the cand!
DM: The Ul: The last example I showed you is a instrument instrument of creating the music and interpreted the music and in which Siftables that Siftables and in which Siftables and tobas well as and bas well as well as and bas a role of sound and bas well.
Every one of these four different variatiunds, you have a different variation that you want to use it.
And you can inject the sound of sound in a successive you can assembly assembly you can assembly walking.
You know, the sound sound Siftable-Siftable Siftable Siftable Siftable Siftable to be successful for the success.
There are effects that you can control the live and filter, like the filter.
You know, you can get a certain sound and then it sounds to help it to him the help of the just.
It takes the general effects like the tempt that the comes that the stream of the screen stream of the Hlet to see it.
Video: M: M: Well we start with a Siftables in the second succession, aranjured them in a series, we have a series, a more common a series more common far.
Now I put a base.
Video: May a little bit of percus a little bit of percup.
Video: M: Ma: And now I'm going to add the movie to control the listen to control the light.
Video: Ma: Maybe the clinical section of including in a part or in a part or in a part or in a part or in a part of a part of a part of the window.
Video: Ma: Now I'm going to attention to more expression for more expression for more expression of the expression of the expression of the expression of the expression of Video: Video: Mr: M: M: M: M: M: M: M: M: M: Mawkward M: M: M: M: Maybe I'm going to go to the bas a mostly atto.
Video: Maybe I can read the secventure of what's the amount of time as a plan.
So I don't have to do the planet in prealign month, maybe improvise, months of the wish.
Now, in swapping, they can estomb the include of Siftable-volume Siftable-volume, included in the stanga.
Thank you.
As I see my passion is creating new interfact of new interfact that we are right to the way that it works more with our brain and our brain and our brain and our body and our body and our body is working.
And today, I had time to show you a coordination of this new space, and the cost of design, and the couple of possibilities that we tried to get out of the lab.
The Gandwish that I would retina granted with this new generation of the new generation of instrument instrument of the digital instruments that will bring our digital rules in our world of our rules in our rules in our rules in our rules.
Thank you very much.
I met with you the nerable of talking to you all the way to talk about you,
They're writing.
He wrote my book is my teacher to me, but it is, of course, more than that.
It's all my mom love and fascinatory and fascinating.
And I don't like this is to change the way to change it.
But these are the button, something like this: something like quote in my life, and in my life, and in my life, who determined me of my relationship with my work.
And the graduated is that I wrote recent this boography of "Manca, Rography and Iloan of the attack to anyone of my career to anyone of my cards of my cards of my cards in the world for a kind of a sensation of malterial method, and it became this important mega-seller metho-seller mazzzzo-seller mega-seller mega-seller international work.
The reulate is that anywhere where where I go back to the people are condamner.
Seriod, the condamnature, condamnature.
In fact, for example of the limb and I say, "You don't have the teams of the team, you can't depass that you could never depass the performance of this?
Do you don't have the team is going to keep your life, your lifetime, your book a book a book a book that would ever get this time?"
It's very link is very link of true.
But it would be more run if I would not remember 20 years ago, when I was 20 years ago, when I was a great deal of people -- as I was bring people -- as I was brought -- I like to become a very exciting such a fear of the same based on a fear of the same based on a fear.
And people said, "Not you don't know that you have no success?"
Do you don't mean that humility will kill you will knew ideas?
Do you have the fear of the worker of your life, and anything else in this field and anything will not hold on a dream of a dream of a dream of a dream of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the environment?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the answer on the short questions is "Yeah, y."
Yes, I mean, I mean, you know,
And it always stopped to me
And I mean, I am in a lot of other things that people can't even even intuition.
As a big example of the big algorithms that are infruit are infrution.
But when it is about writing the word that I was all thinking about the last time I was a whole question?
Is something rational rational ration?
It's the logic as anyone to the worker to be the demand they felt that they feel like it was a Pamant.
And what is so so specific initiatively that seems us as a nelinists of mental health of mental health in a way in a way in a way in a way that other professional professional professionals don't do?
My father, for example, was a chemist and not remember of the 40 years of his 40 years of engineering to the chemicals that would have asked to be asked to be a chemical engineer.
It wasn't happened -- John, how do we go with the chemical?
It just doesn't exist it doesn't matter the way.
But to be honest, engineering chemistry of the century of the century of the century of the reputation of the maniaco-depression.
We write a writers of the inside, and it doesn't only writors, but artists like this artists like this remarkable reputation that they have this reputation of labor of the lab.
And everything we have to do is look at the number of death, the basis of the death, in the 20th century, in the mind of the mind of the mind of young creative, and opening on the own handle and open.
And even the same same that didn't even get the process of the process of the process of your own talent about the talent of your own talent about the talent of your own talent about the providing of the process of the own story.
Norman Mail, even indeed to die, in the last interview, he said to me, "Every books a little bit more than my book."
A great extraordinary extraordinary mountains about a life.
But it doesn't even get a while we hear someone saying someone saying that we heard of all of the things that we heard of these things so that we have absorsorb and a complete and suffering and suffering and suffering and suffering and suffering and suffering as art, the line and as art is always going to be inside of the suffering and the end.
And the question I want to admit today is this: Is you all of the impact of all of this idea: Is you all this idea of ideas?
You are comfortable to comfortable as you see how to the live eye of the light of the light of this speech of the ipotton.
I think it's odias.
And I think it's also a danger and not want to see it in the future of the future of the future.
I think it's better if you incure if you get the marriage of artists to live the marriage of living in the room.
And I know that I safe that my case, in my case, in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start to come up to me to the indeed of this ipotuned to this hypothese, especially in which I find out the hitting of circumstances.
As a tance, I'm pretty much in 40 years ago in 40 years.
I have probably inside the four decades of the work.
And it's very likely that everything I will write the moment to be judgment as a judge of my mountains of my monkey to the last last few of my last monkey to the last last hermen to my father?
What would it be to say the far of mention for a way of all the way of here are already -- is very likely that the largest success of my success of my success of my success to be intamed already.
Oh, God, right!
This is the kind of gender to be able to do somebody to get the horrible to the hour to the hour to the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I would like to do this on this message that I love it.
And then the question becomes indeed, right?
And so I think it turns out a lot of my way that manify to work on now, to go back to the home to write a kind of a kind of building a kind of psychologics to build a kind of a protective protective, right?
I have to find out a way, to find a way to find a way of flight a distance, and my father who writing the natural teams that will be able to do it before it is now long ago that will be writing about what I written up.
And as I was looking at the last year of the last year of this sense, I started to find out the time of time and I tried to find out if you could have a better society if you could have a better ideas and more sanitation and more sanitation about how to be helping us creatively wantage of the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the time of the art of the art of the exact of the art of the excitement,
This is this led me and Roma Greece and Roma ancient of anti-hand
So the mash of the caccident, the city is the city is the couple of name.
But in the Great and the Rome, and the Rome, and the Rome, the human beings in the home, okay?
People believe that creativity was a spirit of people who can stop the people who are deparated and needed to the indeparation and needed to enable and needed and needed to be news.
The Great called these creativity spirts of creativity comes to the term "May "May "May "May "Maw."
Socrats was faimed for a demon that the sepchair of the intelligence in departs.
The rest of the same parents, but they called the creatively creative, but they call the genius of the genius genia.
What is wonderful, because the romans, they didn't think that a genius was a genius was a genius in a genius in the hands.
I thought that a genius was a kind of a magicity of magicity in the wall, the truth of artist, in a way of Dobby, and he said, "Dobby, he said, "Shusiridge and insession and insession of the worker works.
The Absolutely strallowed -- that's actually distance, the building that we were building psychologics that we were to protect your work.
And everybody knowledge that work?
So the artist was protected by certain things, like for example, too much narcism, right?
If you could be the straluism, you couldn't ask the worker for it, everybody else for it, everybody else this genius that you have helped you to help you you to help you to help you to help you
If you think it was criticized, it wasn't completely completely right?
The everybody knows that the genius was like ignorance.
So they watch people in the West creativity for a long time.
And then he came up with the Renaste has changed the idea of the idea of the big idea of the big idea of the big idea as the Indian individual as the individual as the universe and mysteries and mystical digital and mystical orytells that they get the horrible for divving.
It was beginning to the human rational human rational and people have begin to creativity the creativity of the individual interior of the individual interior.
And for the first story of people have began to one or the other, or the other, or the other, in the artists of the game of the genius of the genius.
And you have to marriage a huge of mass.
And the permyth of a simple person to create as a simple person or she is actually receptaculation, and the essentially and the essential of mythern, and the enemies of the mytherness, the fourth of the feeling of the home.
It's like you who are you to get someone to touch the software to keep the sound of sound
It's just the incovocation and deforms of ethics and gender all these inimaginables inimaginable inimaginable inimaginable inimaginable inimagination.
I think that the pressure of the artists of the last 500 years ago.
And if I think is true, and I think is, the question is, what do we do right now?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we can get to the more of the relationship between the people and the mystery of the creativity.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't just stering 500 years of human thinking about 500 years of human gaps through a 18 minutes.
And it probably as the audience that would be the question that would ask the question of the question of the stintype of the people who are prepared in fact that we prepared of their days, and all the people and all the people and all the people and so on.
I will not be going to cooperate to all of this idea.
But the question I want to put it -- why no?
Why don't we think about this?
Because it has a sense of as anything else as anything else in the crazy of the creative process of the creative process of the creative process of the creative processe.
It was trying to create something that was trying to create something -- I mean, everybody here -- I mean, I always have always behavior.
And in fact, sometimes can seem to be the paranormal.
I was a religion where I had a street of the American poet American poet American Ruth Stone, which now has been in 90 years ago, and that was the story of 90 years old, and that he was story as stored as a story of the type of the type of the type of working on the ropp.
The story was like a val vantage of the story.
And it is the practical rows.
The sense of the gugalted, because the pament of the legs of the leg.
So at that point is that moment is a single thing is, "let's go like the apattach."
And the alerga is the water of the urban house of poem, and the engineer and a piece of a sustaining and a creation of a sustainable for a sustaining for a little bit of a little bit of a map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the house of the map of the map of the house of the house of the map of the map of the house of the cost of water and the water and when the water and when the water and the water and the water rolder of the water gar
Sometimes it was not enough to alerga and alerga and alerga and the alergy, but not enough and she walked through it and she would lose and she lost the rostog, and she would keep on the room, and he was a poetry on the room."
There were also now and moments that -- and this is not going to look at the times that story -- when the story story of the story story that story alone is almost lost of the loss of the death.
Alerga home, and the map of the map of the third and the water when it was a story to hear the story of the other, and the story of the other, and the story of the other, and the story of the others.
The first poems of coads and sit back in the body, and then in the massland then the masssource on the masssland
In this kind of situation, the poems of the map of the map of the first and intack at the first one, from the first word at the first word at the first word at the first words.
When I heard -- it's surprising -- it's exactly the process of my own creative.
My creative process is not limited to this -- I'm not drive -- they're not driving the leagues!
I'm a catching and how I worked on the same way I walk every day and to sit and to sit and to sit and to sit and to sit with greater and slightly butterly stand back to the hard and stream.
But even I actually mean in indark of the touch of that phenomenon that phenomenon.
And I just imagine that they were also in the same way of you.
And I had the projects that I had projects that I had a source that I don't know that to be an identify identify of hone.
And what does it always mean?
And how does it must be report that we should not lose our minds, so we don't lose our minds, diminate our minds, to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to the anatosy?
For me, the most relevant example of the new we can do about how we can do is the musician to do is the musician to do with a few years in a couple of years in the review of the review.
I was talking about this subject was almost everybody else was almost everybody else the contemporary artiststs of the modern of the modern of the modern of creative impulse these impulses these impulses these impulse impulse of the inables of creative impulse of the inables of the completely interiorbly contract.
With the time of again and you get the story of a day lead to the story of the lead to Los Angeles Angeles Angeles and then everything has changed it.
And while from a short time, from a short piece of a piece of a piece of the piece of how it happens to inspiration and the inspiration and the inspiration and one, it's not like to her, but it has no water to her, but it has no water.
It doesn't have no food has no creations, no reportofon.
It is to feel that the veck that the veck of the "I can lose the "One moment, and the cannot lose for the month, and this is going to always the money for always to always the money for always to always the money to always the money to always feel like the window of the veck of the vection of the vecsize of the veck of the veck that veck that vecture of the veches of the wild
They're not good enough to reach a good enough."
And instead of the panic in the panic stop.
He stopped the process and he did something to do with all of us and all the new thing.
He taken out of the question and said, "Sorry, don't see that I'm not seeing as a volance?"
"Do you can seem to write a cantest a cantest now?
If you want you to really exist, there is a moment moment you can get a longer moment of yourself to you hear it.
If you don't know about it, and it revolves somebody else today.
You know, you and it up to Leonard Cohen."
His his process has been creative to that.
Not operates, it was the operated to be as intunneled as a very intense as well.
But the process of the inner process, and the engineer around the time that he took the hyriduse, the geniriduse, and the cause and the cause, and the causes and he gave them from where he got to come back and then he gave them something that was not going to be so Chinese are not going to be a chinside.
It could be this collaboration and bization of a conversation of a conversation of a conversation that is not too and the exterious ancestors, the strancestor of the Tom.
And then I heard the story of the story that I was working on a little bit of the way I worked and already saved me a data.
This is what I was saved to the middle of the romancy "Manca, Rots, and I was about a kind of a kind of a kind of a sense of a kind of deaths in a kind of death, and when we were working on something that doesn't get all be the process of the product of the product of the case that will be the risk of the book to be the risk of the book
Not just progressed the best book
I was trying to think of I should think that I should just be able to abandone.
And then I remember all of my space and I tried to spoke and I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried to me.
I was taken to the manuscripped and I brought a collapse comments a collected collaboration.
I told with your voice goes, "Oh, and you know, and you know that if you know that if you know that if this book is not just window, I mean, who's going to be amazing myself, right?
Because you can see you as I put one to the batain everything that I could put it in the way.
So if you want to be better than you want to be better than you have to do it in your way you do the part of your job.
Okay. If you don't want to do that, you know, at the naiba whole of all.
I'm going to write for this is my message of my message.
And I want to connect today I did my part of my job."
Because -- the Conclude is, in the hundreds of years ago in the world of North Africa, they have to shape the months of North and the month of the long dancing and music and music and music and music and music to the rack of the rack of the racing racle.
And they were always wonderful for dance, because the dancer and they were remarkable and they were remarkable to remarks?
But sometimes, very rarely something is happening, and one of the interpret of the common coming from the common common common common
I'm convinced that you all the way to know what I mean, because everybody else is in a certain a certain this moment, like this kind of interpretation.
It's like time in the time is stops and dancy is in a kind of opportunity is different, and they don't do anything difference is different, all the other ones of the other ones of the other ones of the other engineering is alinias.
And in a time of a time of inside of the training of the training of it.

The understanding -- a God of God -- a God of God bess.
It's wonderful, because we need something like that.

I was so much as I started thinking about and so I thought about the last months of the last months that will be published in the book that will be published by the way, a continuation of asteptath and infrution of my grandmother.
And what I was doing, when you get a losing when you get the courage is not teama.
It doesn't be spiracy. You just can expand simply you can do the parteam of the parthem, whatever you do.

Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I still spoke about some of these projects, about the genome of the human genome and what it could represent new discovering new setts.
Now it start, in fact, in fact, in fact, we are trying to get biology, and now we try to get from this code and we try to get a new far and pinside a new fashion and smart and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing the life of it.
We tried always to ask questions.
"What is life life is something that I think many biologists have tried to understand the diverse levels.
We tried to different approach to the component of the basis of the basis of the basis of the basis of the basis of the basis of the basis of the basis of the basis of the different approach.
We already have already about 20 years.
When I was a human, this guy, this was the world of the analogy-world world's world.
Now we try to ask question: Can we can create new form of life forces of life, in this universe of this universe of a digital universes?
This is the map of a mice, Mycoplasma genome for genomics that can replasma species that can reply the only one in the lab.
We tried to see if we can see if we can come to a genome and smaller genome.
We had to get the order of a hundreds of genes in the hundreds of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of the map of metabolic in our comparison with us to our comparison.
And think about it, that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can suggest moment at a moment at a cellular cells to produce a cell.
So I decided that the only way we decided to smart this cromosis so that we can see this crome, so that we can see the component to address the most fundamental questions.
And so we started on the way, "Can we synthesize a cromoss?"
Maybe the chemistry of these molecules that we ever made them more we ever made them more to do it ever made them ben?
And if you like, we can active?
A cromosome, by the way, by the way, is just a chemical pic piece of material.
So, our speed speed to digitize the exponential rhythm of exponential.
Our human cost to write code code is the genetic code of the beginning, but it growth.
The last time he got exponential curve at a cloud of the exponential curve
I started this is 15 years ago.
I went through a few stage, begin fact, with a bio-stage examines before the first experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult is very difficult.
They're such a car, the world that are doing little bits in the world, months of DNA months to 50 literally degenerative process to 50 literally, so why we built a piece of building a piece of hermen in more erapart.
So we had to create a new way to put a new way to put these little bits and the right and right-bulb.
This was our tentatively the tentatively received from the digital genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the 174.
It's a little virus that killed bacteria.
We made design, we went through the corectleck through the corectling of the IDNA molecular DNA molecule of DNA is only about 5,000 literacy.
The interesting is when I got this piece of material material and I put it in bacteria and I put it in bacteria begin to read this genetically, and to read this genetics, and to produce the viruse.
The viral rates were then elidents in cells and they were homorrible and they kill the Eastern cells.
I was talking with oil industries and zero and zicicon-cost model.
They laughter more than you walk than you do.
And so we think this is a situation where the software in which software maybe built into a system system in a system.
But I wanted to do something bigger than we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the cromoss of a cromoss of a bacteria.
This is the over 580,000 literally code of genetics.
So we said, "We would have to put the walls of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the house that are the size of a house that are components that are the research components of a cells of a cell.
The reason is critical critical critical information in the computer, that information has to be very exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the critical is critical critical critical is critical critical critical critical critically, and if you start to the digital information is critical information of the di
When I was a first time of the first time in 1995, the standard of the precise was a 10,000 walls in 10,000 walls.
I found it in the next 30 of herrors. If we were used sequence the original sequence, this would never have to be achievement of the original activity.
The design is designing design is designing the long-term that has long 50 literally long--tech bars that we have to build subjects to build subjects that are the little bit of the other type that mushroom to build the little bits of the other tells us to each other.
We project the elements of one.
You may have ready ready read "watermarkets. You can take a genetic code of genetic code from four genetic code from four literally C, C, and T.
Tripledes from the literally codiffee -- those are the amino acial acial acnovel -- one literally openid.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, thinking,
The immediately everything I did was to hear the code.
Some of them were disappears.
We designed those baby that we can digness them so that we can digness.
These are enzymes and they give them them.
So we started doing the piece of the piece of five to 7,000 literally literally in the 24,000 literally literally setting them on this sets of 24,000 literally literally sets in this rock to 7,2000.
Every every stage of the baby of the abundance to the abundance to make them sequence to create a extremely rocket -- as you can see a extremely rocket -- as you see in a mine.
We try to get the authoring point of automatics.
So, this is like a baskets look like a basket.
When we get a very large piece of the best base of the basis of basic weapons in E. collapse in E. collapse in E.
It takes all the tools of the modern molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular tooleculation of the tools of the tools of all the tools of the tools of all the tools of the tools of the tools of the tools of the bolling of the modern.
So we were able to other mechanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the DNA that biology that biology that DNA to reward DNA and that too.
This is a example of the example.
There is a organism called Deinococcus that can sustained millions of radiation.
As you see in the paint of the sland his cromosis of his piece of the piece of the piece.
12 to 24 hours later, he put it back back to the new laws as it was beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be open.
I can live in the vid.
I am absolutely safe that life can be in the extra new space to find a new media new media new media new media new media new media and environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is what happens in there.
This is a micrograph of a micrography molecule that we build on using these processes -- in fact only using the mechanisms of the adecisions that we put it on the adequate of the ath.
Drodie them together.
This is not a picture from a picture of electronics, but only a photo-microwave picture.
It's so big molecule that we can see it with a microscope of a microscope of the microscope of the microscope of the microscope of the microscope of a microscope of a molecular molecule is so a big molecular molecule that is a big molecule of molecular molecular molecular molecular m
These are the images of collecting over a six seconds.
This is a public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public publishation of a public public public public publishing a little public public public public publishing a little public public public public public public public
These are over 580,000 literally code of genetics.
It's the largest molecule of people, with a definitely defined structure.
It has a mountain the 300 million over 300 million over 300 million of it.
If we do it with a 142 pages and without space, 142 pages to practice this genetics.
So, how do we go a cromosome? How do we active. How do we active.
Obviously with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
It also gets easier when you get to the eking: you can just get nuclear and you just to put the nuclear and that is something you would have heard -- clone.
With the archain, the cromosis is integrated in chain chain chair that we can do a completely transplant that we can do it in a cellular to a cell.
I pushed a crowd crowdon one in microbial species.
These second are about as a distance of the distance of the people and myself.
We added a few genes in the genes of genes that can select this cromosis for this cromosom.
We digerated with enzymes to kill all the proteins.
And it was pretty amazing when we put it in cells -- you'll watch the grain -- and our cromossed -- and the cromoss -- and the cromoss of cell.
In fact, I thought that this is how far is how far is how we can go to design something more far as well.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are all kinds of species that have a second cromosis the second crome, or a third of the third of new cars, in other parts of a new cartoon a second.
So the those who are thinking about evolution just as one gene of the gene of a moment moment of biology.
They're enzymes called DNA restriction, which actually digers' digers.
The Cromosome, which was in cell.
The cellular -- the cromosome, we put them --
It was expressed and recognized the other cromoss like material that we digerate it with the cromosis and so we got just with the cromosome.
It became blue because of the genes that we put in the cromossed cromossed in cromossed in cromosome.
And after a very short of a very short of a very short species have lost a new species of a new species on a new species on a new species on the software that we paint in a new species that we put in cell.
All the protein was changed -- when we have been changed -- when we received the code of genetics, is exactly what we could transfer the code.
That can sound like the alchemistry, but we can get the software to change the DNA to change the way we can change the way.
Now, I had a new kind of like this is not genesis, but in half billion years and a half billion years and a half billion years and we can find that we can be on creating a new version of the Cambriance, in which is a new specific new version of a new specific design.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obviously in the point of view of needs of needs of needs of needs to be needed to be needed to be a needed to be a pretty much of the needle of that is pretty much of the obviously obviously obviously obviously obviously in the obviously obviously obviously obviously obviously obviously obviously obviously obviously obviously obviously obviously unne
We're on the way we go from six and half the new billion people over 40 years.
So as I put this in context for me to me in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each of us in 1946, they will be four, they will be four.
We have the problem of the issue of the cost of water, drugs, fuel fuel of the six billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half the problems of the issues of the issues of the issues of fears of the issues of the issues of feeding weapond,
It will be difficult to do it for us to do it for us.
We use over five billion books of books, more than 30 billion barily barily of oil oil oil oil
This means a hundred million barily barily day.
When we will we try to think about the biological process that will be a challenge to be a challenge challenge to be a challenge challenge to be a challenge
Then, of course, it's all that CO2 from this material, which is the atmosphere.
Now, from our discovers around the world, we have a data of 20 million genes, and I like to think about 20 million genes, and I like to think about these designs in the future of the future of the future.
The electronic electronics is just a pain, or so component that was a diversity of that.
We are limited here, in the first time, a biological reality and image of our imagination.
We now have the technology, the data of these data data of the synthesis, to do what we call the genimics.
We have the ability to build a big robot that to make a million cycles on day.
When you think about the 20 million genes of genes different genes of genes or try to optimize process to optimize the octan, or products of new farmaceutical process of new molecular team of new molecular than the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the science.
And that's just the standard standard of standard.
We can select the substance, production of substancestors or fuels of vaccines,
This is a shared of a software designing of a software we working on and work on these species in these species in computers in computers.
You know, we don't know how to look at what it looked like.
We know exactly how the genetics.
Now we are now focused on fuel fuel fourselves.
You see that recently is that from the ethanotic is just a unnenered.
We have the fuel fuel of the second generation that will come up in the course that are the classroom, which are the cost of the opportunity or guard as the octankly such as the octanks.
But the only way we think that the biology can have a major impact of making more cost-growing and far away and far is if we start with the CO2 men is that we are going to start to project the first time to project the project of the generation of the fuel fuel cells in about 18 months.
Light CO2 is a solar and CO2 is -- but in our world, we have all kinds of other ways around the world.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
They live in the deep deep deep in the ocean, about two kilometers and half the deep of the land half of the land of the farming of the farmed of the landscape.
Transform CO2 in metan uses of the molecular as a source of energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 capture, which can be able to be able to convert that CO2 back in the CO2 back in the fuel, to leave this process of the CO2 back in the process of the process of this process of the process of the O2 to the process of the O2 and stop if we can take a process to take a process of the O2 cap.
So in a short of time, we think that could be able to die what is the question of the base of the baby?"
We actually know -- we have the objective model of the entire industry industry of the entire industry of the chemical industry.
Yeah. If you don't do that in other parted?
It becomes a source of energy.
But we also work now is working now is to use these same sources to invented vaccinimedid.
You have this year, this year with a year ago, we are always going to be a dollar when it comes to the right comes to the right right of the right right now.
I think the situation can be changed by the combinatory of combinatory before before before before before before before before before before before before before before the before I think about the situation of the situation can be changed by the situation can be changed by the situation can be changed by the situation can be changed by the combination can be changing the vaccines of combinators before the combinately change before the combinately to be changing before before the combinatord.
Here's how it could it start to show the future of the evolution of evolution, the evolution of evolution with bacteria with bacteria and finally argue, and finally argue archy, and the end, and the end, okariots.
We are almost to improve people.
Our biectively is just to make survive that we have a chance to survive enough to survive you can do that.
What I want to show you more quickly is a fundamental working, a new thing that I had a new technology that I had a new technology that I had a whole part of a proximately now a year. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon.
It's a medium that can interact with a big amount of data, is a big amount of data.
We are looking at a lot of the gigables of the giant and digital and moving up almost perfect, the rearranging through this one, rearranging to wish.
It doesn't matter how much information is how much information is the big data or how large images are these large images.
Most of the world are pictures of a common the usual camera at the Congress in the Bibration of the Congress of 300 megapixelds.
It doesn't important because the only thing that should let the performance of a way of such a way of the skills of your skills in your skills in your skills at a very flexible architecture of the feeling architecture of the flowering architecture of the flower because the flowering thing that should be flowering the only thing flower.

BA: Yeah. What does is really doing.
It creates the hyper-left hyper-stick.
And it made that based on the picture of the picture.
And that becomes independent when you think about the information that we have the significance.
As when you do a cool of pictures on the Internet, and the text of the word on the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of what it is the Internet of what it is the picture.
Now, what would you be if that picture is the picture of the picture?

And even though there are all the way we look at every life in which we look at a mechands of football of us asking ourselves?
Do should answer this email? You should write circle this short of this writing is "Not the answer is not safe that experience is not that your feeling the feeling of what it was a little bit difference will be very different from what it was a different thing.
So wherever we look at the big things, and small, and the stuff that you have a life of the opportunity is a chestie chestie chestie chestie chesties.
And the world that we live in this way.
So as we were able to say that we had some choice to do, but it wasn't all a chesteck of option.
And the world that we live now looks like this.
And the question is, why is it well?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what it is the good at this point of what I am is the bad.
All these choices have two effects, two effects, two effects on people.
One of the effects, the paradox, is that produce products than eliberately release.
And so many of the option of option that can choose to their own optest for the optest of optest.
I give you a very significant, a very significanced in the plans of the pension of the pencil.
A colleague of my colleagues had access to the West of Vanguard, urchasing the company, the average that has almost a million common and almost 2,000 sedic sedids.
And what it looked like for every 10 funds of mutual weapons of the employer rators of the participation of the participants.
OK, 50 percent of the funding -- they are about 10 percent of the lessons of the landscapes of only five him?
Because with 50 funds of mutual funding of the choice of choices that are determined to choose to choose to choose to choose that a hands.
And then the post-st-stream and then on the background, and then of course, and of course, and of course, the extent and of course, it comes and of course, it comes to never come.

The weird of the left of the sample of the sample of the waste of the employer in the employer of the compening funding funded funding funding fun.
So the trust the forest is a lot of options.
And I think that it makes the world to look like this.
You know, you really want to take the good decision if it's for all the eternity, right?
You don't want to choose to choose to the baby of the soscar for saving the soscar for saving the soscar for saving a wrong wrong time.
So this is a second effect. The second is that we can do the second state of the trust and make a choice to make a little choice to make a little bit more choices than we were less to make a little bit more option than we were less choice than we were less choose to choose choice choice.
And there are a couple of reasons for that.
One of them is that we had a lot of soschair of sossil if you buy a and not perfect -- and it's not perfect for saving is?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choices that would be better choice. And what happens is that alternative you imagine the alternative that you have been doing is regrets that you have made of choices that you have made out of the choice that you get out of the choice that you have been a decision.
The more options, the more options, the more option to regreater something that is disappearing with the option that you have ales-state option that you have aless.
Second, what economists are called economists the opportunity.
Dan Gilepped in this morning, in this morning, what we are depending on what we eat the way we depended with what we do with what we do with what we do with them.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative alternative to be in considered in consideration is easy to imagine the characteristics of the alternatively alternatively that you have a little bit more alternatively chalese.
Here's a example of the example. I mean, I am New Yorkese.
But here's what we should raised to raise.
We have here in Hamphotographs.
A very expensive properties.

I could actually park in front of the office of two weeks of the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the channels of days, to have a lot of parking place.
The overall the opportunity of opportunity that we have the choice of choices even though we have the choice of choices.
And the more option of the option of options of the option of the attention of these opportunity will be perceived as a costs of opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon says a lot of things.
We should live the clipping and probably we should be able to do things begin to do the things begin.
But one of the things that tells is that you say is that while you have to do not other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things can have a lot of attracting and that will do you do what you do you do you do what you do.
Third of the third expanded, extinct expanded.

We have a better choice. All these options have made that possible to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose the choice.
But I felt best.
Why? I wrote a book that I tried to explain it.
The reason I felt worse is that I felt that I felt all these options of options about how to be a bad of my grandmothers of the best broken goods of best brothers have increasingly good.
I had expect very well. We didn't have any expect of the demand when they were a single way.
Now when there are 100 sorts of the time, my mother has to be perfect.
And what I got was good, but not perfect.
So I comparated what I was expected with what I was expected and the result is that I was deeply with what I hope.
The option of options in the lives of people's lives in the lives of people who are expectations that people have to grow up the option that people have to be the option of options.
And the right-bulk will go to less satisfaction even if they get a good results.
Nobody in the market world.

And the day in the world in the world in the world in the world that we live and advanced and we add and we add the best thing you can spit was so good things, you can spit was so good thing that you can expect it is so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good at it.

But you know, you to you in your house is not always the best thing.
Finally, a consequence of bars of a black of blindness that you can't buy when you can't buy a single as you can't be a single as a single as a single and you are why certain is clear and somebody else is clear and somebody is clar.
The world is window. What do you could have to do?
When they're hundreds of different style of black and bubbles and bubbles and you buy and you ask yourself and ask you?
It's as clear as a question of question: You're going to ask the answer to the question of the question of the question of the question of the question of the way it is as a clear as well-like the answer is as clear as well.
You could have better choices better.
With a hundred different kinds of different kinds of choices for the equiet.
So when people have decided when people live ve in the choices are good at the bad of the choices are feeling of them, they are getting out of them,
The presensus of the world in the world industrialized in the last generation.
I think that a important contribution -- not almost important -- not almost important in this eruption of the synucians, is that people have disappearing experiences that are disappears that are disappears that are too right.

And what is the fear and suddenly and sustainable to talk about how these chair of state talking about how these chair of state and hard to the kids of installing and hard to help the geak. I'm a money to help the geap.
What I tell you is that these options, and complicated the option, and complicated not only the help of it.
They actually challenge the challenge of challenge
They even do the better to feel better at all.
If something from what we allow in our society to do all the choices that we are able to do all of the choices that we have too a little bit of the option of that people have not only improvement of that life would be improvement of that our lives would be improvement of our lives would be improvement.
That is what economies you call the Paretomorrow.
