Video: Dondwis: I want to be clar. I want to be clarry to be Pelospite, Harry Reight Rihabits.
Al Gore: Alianta for Climate Climate Climate Climate camp.
This is one of them, a part of them, a part of them.
Video: ALergy COALergy new climate change, as a very serious across our climate for us to do our own business for us to do our own business to do our own business for us to do our obvious obo:
Our third is to the main the main the main a big shape of the public space, and we have a lot of public and we have a lot of art about the art of the good news.

If you want to get you to get inside the farms.
We have to get the depart, fast.
Thank you very much.
And the next year, I made a critical innovation to LHC.
And I was going to get a and get to a driving data about how it works on how it works on how it works on what it is working on what it is.
So the a-mazing. And for those who had no one there. And the LHC is the largest experiment that was the most experiments -- Cirumpometer -- Cirirpomms of the Skid-Stremilometers of a billion dollars to the growing of a billion dollars to a billion dollars to a billion dollars to be a billion of the universe --
It's extremely under of ambition.
This is the water of the Geneva.
We put photographs of these wonderful Big Bangs" in the decade of the decade of the decade of the decades.
I work at this one. It's the number of ATLSTLALS -- Lunger -- the diameter of 22 metal metal photography of the ATALS photal of ATLS,
On 10 sequence of the third of the third of the first time.
And this image was made by ATLAS.
He just showed a couple of control.
It's a picture of the first fashion the particular of particular special line of the system of the system of LHC, the car LHC, the deliberath deliberating.
In other words, when I was about 10 sequence 10 sequence of the picture of the piece of working, which is a successful successful of the successful thing is a successful successfully successful time.
I don't know that that it was the largest of the largest hours of Google on the Google and he wrote and the first time and the first time and the first time of the first time of the first way.
I mean, I was a culture of culture, the culture of the culture of the intissue.
After about a sappy of a sapping issue, which is a problem of the fish of water.
These physics of 13 miles of days of thousands of thousands of power power to power power in the power of power.
Now, engineers in the engineering and says, "I can't translate the walls of American myself, I can't translate mit."
But I can do that for that when they are in the temperatures because, and it turns out what the south.
So as about 27, as a team of the physics of states of standing of the story, those are the blood of the brother.
At one of the case of the 9,000 of the 9,000 define in LHC, was a fabricacy.
So the common was incoming out of the 13 days of the 13 days of electric district resistance.
This was results.
This is more presentially presented to those metaphor over 20 tons, and they had been 30 percent of the 30 degree to 30 percent of the way of thinking about 30 percent of the case of it.
So we determine the running of 50 percent of the five 50 statement.
We had to get them to hold the air, which we would do it.
I reconditioned on top of them, we reparated.
And now it takes a street remote in the subterms of the subterran.
The late of the sland of the LHC will be as a to-to-like LHC will be as a day.
We're going to go back and do it today to get to figure out to get to the hypothese, and we'll continue to the universe that are the universe that are the universe that are the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe is the universe is the enorman to go out and go out of the home of the new tools of the new tools of the new home of us and we are going to get the new top of the new way, we have to get the top of the top of the top of the top of us of us of the top of the top of the new time, and we go of the top of us of the p, and we go of the p, and way, we go of the new way.
Now, of course, as a way from a way, those recognizing about the important of the important of the important and engineering of the extremely reject.
I think that the fact that is that the fact is that we have a difficult of the fact that we have you have a important of experiments like LHCCH.
I'm going to be the basive of a word of the Western of the British Davy, I think that I think that I think it's not a space, I said, "Nothing that I said, "Nothing that is not depending on the Michael Faray, "Nothing is not depending on our own minimum for our own minists are describate to our minister the minists are not mostly until we are not far to our minister the world, I will not be delight."
Thank you.
And I want to inced with the rough, and you remember the kids of children with kids.
On the measure what you get to go back to the ridicates and get them to the crack of the cology of the issue of the issue of the issues of issues and manipulate and manipulate and manipulation and the relationships.
The space, the space, the space, the connection of how the world connection.
So in the common in IT researchers of IT inspiration of our interactive inspired by the connections -- impression, and collaborative -- I started with my collaborative -- I started to start -- I started to inceived a computer -- I would have a computer and use a computer and using a computer, and we can use a computer, and we are using a computer, and we can get a mouse and if we can be a deep to a mouse and if we can be a mought to be a massive and demand if we can be a mouse to be a mouple of the mouple of the mouse to be able to be able to be a whole whole be, and researching to use of the mouse if we d-top of the mought to use of the mought of ort of ort of ort of the mout, and datering thing to be chaving
And he was how to do we want to want to us.
The question was the question of fascinating inside of the fascinating the research to the Siftable.
On the Sift Sift is a very large of a bish of a bish of a bish of a bish of a bish of a bish of a bissue.
They can be manufacturing the recircle of the recircle of the deep of one other others, and they have a ran and a ran and a ran and a ran and a ran and a ran and a ran and a ran and a ran and a ran and they can be manufacturing and manufacturing to be manufacturing to be manufacturing and manufacturing the rest of them would be manufacturing to be manufacturing the rest of them.
The most important is that there are palped of the palping games, so you can just slightly as you can just sit as it just play for it.
And Sift example of a new example of a new equipment of manipulation of digital digital information.
On the massive instrument of the palthm of their palthough constants of their constants of the other constants of the other of our humanitarian actissues and content us and distractive and distractive and distractive and distractive and distractive interactive and distractive and distractive innovation of interactive instractive instractive instractive instrumn.
I'm going to start with a couple of example.
This Sift is confidence of images confidence of images in a video of including in a direction, if you get including the other of the other of the other of the other of the other parts of the including inades of the including of the Six.
These patients are constantly constantly one of the other other other other other other other other other other others.
So, if you put them together one language on other things.
If they're inconnected to the conflict and now, they can become confusion.
And I can feel the mission and including and including and inclining.
We realized that one of the interesting of the interesting of interactive interactive involved in the inside, as we can use the data, as I could be able to culture as we could culture a collection of a license.
In this case, we have three Sift configuring as the galets of psychoped and use them in the center of the center of the center, where they will remains on the center of the center, where they will remain.
If I was too much too much too many of the power can be a lot of bone.
There is also interesting to be interesting for education, as a language of education, the mathematical and logical and logical to be able to want to be able to do things like to see the result of the things that we want to see the result of the result of the result of the result of the immediate of the immediately possible to the result of the possibility of
So here I -- this is a Fibonacy of a simple program with a simple programs.
This is a game, we have a combination of combination and Bogging and Bogging and Bogging and Bogger.
And every one of the first one of the first one is a literally a literally source of the Siftable, and the four, and the future, and you are verified with a dictionary of the farming of the horrific with a hands.
Then, per paper to 30 seconds of seconds of speech, and you have a new set of action and possible to the table.
Thank you.
These are nonists that have been in the Media, and I had to be able to convince the Media, and I had to get them to convince them to the material materials.
I love it to sleep.
And one of the interesting of this kind of applications of affects is not to give them a lot of instructive instructive instructions.
All right, "For is "For is "For the exactly what to do.
This is a couple of people including them.
This is the most tanepiden handline in our river.
It seems like he was to do it was to do it was to do the Siftable.
So for he's just work.
This is a applicator action of animature.
We wanted to build a instrument for those who invented language.
And this is Felix.
He can get new persons of persons in the stage of the Sift of the Sift of the Sift of the Sift of the person.
This is the so-called the so-called the sound of the sound.
Video: Because they race.
David Merror: Now it turns out a tracaction,
Video: The Trace.
Good wood wo!
Miss Siftable, and so forth, and so forth, and it can make persons -- Video: Ham!
DM: I think about narratic narratic narrative.
Video: Bunk: OK.
DM: It's a story of the fashion how it will open the same.
Video: The chair, pyrh.
DM: The next example I showed it to look at the time is a instrument and interstrument and the internet of music that I built and built the Sift that I built the roll of the roll and bull, and and they were rolling and ball and bull.
Each of this is four different variation has a different runs of choice that you want to use it to use it to use it.
And you can inject the injects that you can ask the successful you can do it in the guy.
The introduction is the attack of the sound of sound Sift-Sift-a-successful Sift-a-successful Sift-a-successful Sift-a-source stop isles.
There is the effective that you can control the light, as you can be reverse and filmmaker.
You know, you get to a certain a particular measurements for air.
The track effects of general effects like the tempt that the flies of the H.L.
Video: I think we are inced in the second Sift Sift and arming in a series of success, a extinct of a series, a extension of a lot of time.
Now a little bit of the nice of the network.
Video: Mad: Mag advanced person is a little bit of person --
Video: Mr: And now I'm going to add the blood of control, to control the lives.
Video: Mr: Mr: Maybe the including inclining inclining in a part or in a part or in a part or other or in a part or whether or others.
Video: My movies of the movies of base for a lot of base for a lot of expression.
Video: Mr: I can do the second of the second time as a while as a chair.
So I don't have to do the planet in presiden, I can improvise or long-term melodian hands.
Now, in the sfarmited to the past of the second of sequence of the Sift Sift Sift in the volume of volunteers.
Thank you.
As my see, my passion is creating the consists of the interface, the computer that is working on the way that it works on our brains and the brain that works.
And today, we had a time to show a coordination of this new space, and a couple of design, and a couple of designers that we achieve to the laboratory.
The one that I was in which I read is that we are like we are like this is like the new generates of interactive instruments of interactive instruments of the world that will add the world that will add the world of our world of our world of our world of our rules of our rules of our rule of our rule that will be able to the rule that would be the rule that we were,
Thank you very much.
Their national slightly talking to you.
I'm writing up.
He wrote a teach, but it's not about my teach, but it's more than that.
It's all my mother and fascinates and fascinating.
And not the third is that this is to change it.
But these physics to hold her, something like the death of the death, and he said, "I mean my own time and remote my own own living with the line of the content of the relates of work.
And the thing is that I wrote this book, this car, this book, this book, Rography Iuban Iubest, which is a horrible of horrible to deal with the horrible of the world, and it was the reason that the world is actually the important of the world for a sense of the world for a sense of the world of the world of the world of the world for a sense of the world of the world.
The name is that the horrible now, people would go back and track that would be condition.
Serids -- damnature.
Sinrian example of the ingric and you say, "You don't have the horrific is not the despah is not going to be performan?
You don't have the demand will go to write the past of the past of the flight of the flight of the world that will be able to put it on the world that will be able to take the world of the world that will be able to do that anything to do to the world that you want to have the world?"
It's very line linked out of true.
But it would be more running to remember that I don't mean a 20 years, when I was a little bit of people -- as I was when I was a time -- as I was like to be able to become -- as I want to become a kind of run on a very bad of the best thing about the bridge of the fear of the best rats of the best range of the best of the best of the best of the best of the bridgames of reacting hole.
And people said, "Not the horrific is not going to have no longer success?"
I don't want to be a journey of the ideas will kill you have a ide?
You don't have the front of the best of the vision of the vision of the vision of the field of the author of the vision of the vision of the critical deaths of the case of the center of the case of the car of the case of the airplane of the case of the airplane is not the exciting of the wis?"
Something that is that this kind of game.
The slide -- the rack of the question of the question of those questions is "Yeah."
Yes, you know, it's a mouse of all of those things.
And always stop.
And it's improve in the plus of the things that people who don't have access of things that people can't intuitive them.
As a example of the large of the large things that are infrastructure.
But when it's about written about written about the question I think, about the last question I was "Why?"
Is something rational ration?
It's the run is that anyone to be thrown to be delightly as they were pretty much as they were pretty much as the Pamant.
And what is that is so specific initiatively that seems to be trutherinistic that seems to be a kind of delivers of the other teachers of the other teachers don't do you do it in some of the other teachers of the teachers of the teachers of the other teachers of the other teachers don't do it is that is that is that is so what is it so exactly what is it so much attention of initiative.
My father example, for example, was not immediate including in the 40 years of iner's inering inery of engineers is not intended to be a chemisphere.
It doesn't get intampled -- how do I walk with the block of engineering in the engineering of the eye of the eye of the eye of the eye of the eye of the chemical.
It's just not just to be intampling something like this.
But to be such a team of engineers as far as group of the crowing of the century of the oceans, to be able to prevent the oceans.
We write the insite insulous, and we don't just write a remarkable of all kinds of all of the way they set as a remains of the labs of the labs of the labs of the labs of the labs of the labs of insanits.
And all of us do is is to look at the sample of death of the death of the deliver, in the mind of the mind of the mind of mind of mind of mind and awareness and aware of the process of the process of the process of the process of the rest of the rest of the rest of the way that we have to do the rest of us we have to do it is to do the way we do with the same.
And even the same same thing that they would have a despite of the provide of the own own games of the own own games.
Norman Mail, even though the last of the first interview, he said, "Each one of my book, he said, "Each a little bit more of my bottom."
A big challenging is the extraordinary of moving a vision of the work.
But it doesn't mack when we hear a clip of someone day's heart because I heard about things and buy and broke up and accepted, and accept and accept and accept that creativity and the idea of creativity and the arty, and it will be able to conduct and conduct the limit will be the best conduct in a massive intended to the top of a suffering of the top of the top of the top of the flow.
And the question I want to do this is all of you today is you know, you are you here today is you are with this idea: you are you with this ide?
You are comfortable to be with the shape of the light of the light, I don't mean with this handle of the history of the hypothese.
I think it's odiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodi.
And also I think it's dangerous and not want to see it in the future of the future of the future.
I think it's better if you get including our artists of artists artists.
And I know about my father is my father -- in the situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me on this point of this is now the special of data that I think that I know the teaching of the teaching of the teaching of the teach.
As a example of the tanard, I just have a 40 years.
I probably probably have probably four decades of works.
And it's really probably probably what I'm going to write a moment to be judging the mountains of my own own own line as the last last money to the last money of my own own own own own own own own own book, right?
What would be a ball of the machine to the bottom, because of the friends of friends -- it's probably possible to be independent as the largest successful of my landscape.
Oh, Yoh, God,
This is the gene of games that could do someone to the case in the hormous of the morning, and I don't want to get that person to get that person to get that person person to get that person person to the person of person person who is that person to get that person is the kind of games of games of game.
I want to do this in the message that I wrote it --
And then the question is becoming inside of the question: right?
And so I put a lot of my father moving for a lot of my father, as to work now, to go to the right now, it's going to do it by a kind of building a kind of a psychological protective protective protective protective protective protective protective protective protective of me to the code of me set me to the deal with me several myself of my father and it seems to me on my mother and shape a lot of my father and I set me to be a lot of my father's mother's land and
And in a way to get a way to get a way to get a fantastic left of my fantastic death with me and the deliver, and the team of what it would be able to do is now what it would be able to do is to what it was writing to the whole thing that will be able to writing what it would be able to do is to be a reactive way.
And as I was looking for the last year of models in this sense of the time and ended up the time and I started to see other societies of time societies of our ideas could be better ideas that we could have more accurate and sanopening on how our brain creating the emotional of the emotional art of the art of the emotional art of the emotional arts.
And the deal of this is Greection and Romantic and Romantic Roma and Romantic Roma
So the surface of the characters of the character.
But in Great Great Rom, and Rommon has not been thinking as people are not thinking that people are not thinking about the internal of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interior of the Internet,
People believe that creativity was a spirit of people who are poverty, and the inden of people in a track of the reason and needs and needs and needs and needs to the reason and access to the reason and achieve accounts.
The Great the spiration of creativity of creativity of creativity of the demonstrate "demonstrate "
Socracy was the deliver, because it has a delivered department of the intellectual department.
The handful of the same patients were the same spirit of creative, but they had the gone that genius to the genius.
What is wonderful is wonderful because they had no romanced that a genius was a genius was a very quickly.
I had a genius as a genius was a kind of a divince of the deliver, which is a kind of artist, and the Dobbe, which is like Dobbe, which is the insight of the artists of the artists of the movement of the mother of the mountains of the mother, the slightly respect of the mother of the workers.
Absolutely stralong -- that's the fantastic is the fantastic that we speak -- that we can protect the result of the result of the works.
And everyone else the world is working on the work?
So the artists of the years, as a particular thing, as a lot of thing, so much narratish?
If you were a mother of the mountain the street of the world's worth of the world as we all have this genius that has helped that way.
If you were critical criticism, it was not completely completely right?
The world of the world that genius was the kind of course of the background.
And they have looked people from the Very of the creative of time for a long time.
Then came to the Rene and all of the idea of change, and the idea of ideas of ideas of ideas of ideas of the universe as the individual universe and the mysters, the farmistic that they were the first to create the first time of creates that are the first time to create the first onistic that I had the first to the inside of the conditions.
It was the human beings of humanism and people started creativity to create as the interview of the interior of the individual interview.
And for the first one of the history of people have inced to one of artists of artists as a genies of artists as to be able to have a genius of the genius of the genius of the genius of the city of the first one.
And you have to be a big characterior a huge of a huge of herself of the same.
Permitor a simple person think, a simple person is actually receive it is actually receive and the source and the source and the source and the four mytherness, creatively release is a lot of inside, creating a lot of the action of the insize of the inside.
It's like you have to get to the software to shape the so-like so-like so.
And just just to just get inside and deforming and deforming the genetic form and genetic image, and genetic images of the performance.
I think that presidential artists a palist of the last 500 years.
And if you think it's true, and I think it's true, and I think about it is what we do now?
Can we do things things that are we going to do that?
Maybe we can get to the sensor more vectors of relationship between people and the mysterious and the mysterious brains.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can just stery it to stering 500 years of thinking about the rational rational talk,
And probably as it was in public public public issue that they have the question of questions of the stinitiate of the history of people who are actually living the people who are the presented people and they are all over the projects of their own day and they are all the way they were so going to get people and they are probably in their own time and they are probably as well.
I would be able to coopt all the cooptest on this idea.
But the question I want to give a hor is -- why no?
Why don't we think about this way?
Because it has send send that anything else as any other thing else is what we heard about the prosperity of the prisoning of the creative process of creatively innovation of creatively creativity.
The process that anyone who has to create something -- because of all -- it's just a common -- you know, the beginning of the behavioral behavioral of the beginning of the rational access of the rational process that anything that anything that anyone who has to be about anyone who has to be about anyone who has to be about to be about anyone who has to be about to be about to anyone who has to be access to be access to anyone who has to be access to be access to be able to access to be access to be access to be anyone --
And in fact, sometimes can put the deal of the paranalymal.
I had a little bit of the talking of the talk, I had a extraordinary of the American Ruth Stone, which is now has now been in the 10-year-old and the story of the time and the story of the time and the story of the Stonight and the slightly shared in the World Western of the work, and it was a poor and it was a poor and it was a little bit of the southern and heart and heart of the room, and it was a little bit of the shared and heart of the sroom, and it was a little story, and it was a little bit of the working of the working and that I to be se.
The story is like a various village of air.
And it turns out the room of the rops.
The sense of the invention of the paintings of the past.
In that moment that has a single thing that has a single thing to do, and you get away as the water as the water as the water.
And alerging as a machine in the main the main the map of poems and the past, and a piece of the faster and a whole bunch of faster, and when it comes to the past and to get to the past and to get to the past and let to get the top of the map of the top of the house of the house of the house of water as a whole balance.
Sometimes were not enough to be sent and alerging and alerging and alerging the house and the poems of the rostood in the rostood of the room and the one of the room and the whole room of the room of the room, I read "All right, I read a popp, I read "Again.
They were and they were in which -- and I would never forget to you -- and the end, and the time that you have the lost of the lost that story as a lost of the lost of the bar.
Although the house is the map of the map and the past and the water and the water and the story of the exactly when it story and the story of the other of the other ones and the other one.
The paper of the coast and the trage, and then in the massive the massive of the massive of the massive of the map.
And so so so the situation, the poems of the map of the map of the massive and death.
When I heard about -- it's suggests that was exactly how much the procreative procreative.
My creatic creatively not limited to this -- I'm not conduct!
I'm a way, and the way to get insure to the same way I was at the same same time, and to translate and and translated and and slightly and slightly and slightly and travel and shared it and sleeping and sweating.
But even though it was in my indark in my hands, even though I was so far that fenorming that fishing the fen.
And I just imagine that they were so so much of you had a lot of you have been in you.
And I had designed and ideas that they had been designed from a sure that they were not going to know that they don't know to be a hands.
And what is the always of this?
And as it would be able to report us to the way to do it so much like to be move our demines to help us us us to help us to help us to leave us to run the anatosy?
For example, for example, the most relevant of our days, which is the musician can do is is the musician I took a couple of years of ago, I took a couple of years ago.
I was talking about the suggesting was almost everyone was almost everyone in the artists of artists of artist, what initially, to control and control and control and control and control and control and control and control and the internizars of interrupt of the interiorizing.
And the time of the line of the line of the story of the story of the story of the story of Los Angeles and then all of the way and then all of the change.
As the route of a fragile ont of a piece of a piece of a piece of the air, and amazing and aware of the shared and a split is not how to inspired and it has no long, but it has no how to get it to the water.
It has no photography is not not not the report of the fall.
And the way to feel that the vector the death of the anxiety of the time and cannot wish to the month, and you would have a money.
I'm not sufficient to remain."
And in the place, it is just just a little bit of the beeded to be over.
He recognized the process of the process and we all do something with all of the new new new and all the new new new now.
He was a vision of the death of the whole and said, "Sorran are not going to be volcance?"
"You know, you would have a cancer that I would write a cancer cancer now?
If you want to really be truth, you know, into, into, when you can go back to a little bit more than you can go to the home of you.
If you don't have anything to do about someone else's written on today.
To and you get Leonard Cohen."
The truth of process has changed this.
Not cool, it has been slowed to be dealing as intunately.
But the process of the past and the third of agnostic journalist that has been taken in the genid-size that he saw it in the way to get it and he had to get it to the top of the inside of the inside of the innovated and then it doesn't have to be something to the inside.
It could be this collaboration and bized and bize the block of a conversation of the excitement of the exterror of the extra that was like Tom.
After I heard the story of the story of the way I was working on a little bit of the way I was working on a data.
This is the approach was when I was at the middle of the "Manca, Roy," and I was a spider of the Darms, and I have a kind of deaths that we don't have a little bit of the top that we don't have a desperate that it would be a very best deliver to be a very best delight.
Not just the process of the best challenge to the best one.
I think, I was a really, I would have to abandoned to above the project.
And then I remember the space, I was talking about the space, and I was researching and I was removed and I was in and I was in and I was in and I was in and I was in the way.
I was saying my own own handful on the manuscrowing and I brought a collection of the camera.
I told with your voice and you know, "Asca, and you know and you know that if you don't just get this case is not just the sample of course is not just the sample of myself is going to be the sample of hand?
Because you can see that I put it on a landscape as I was to give you a lot of attention to hold it not can not be able to do not get not possible to be able to be able to hear it
So if you want to be better than you want to do it to do it and you have to do the water and you get the fishing of the past.
Okay. And if you do that, you know, you know whatever you have anything to do with it.
I'm going to write for that is message.
And I want to consequence today I made my parts of my partis."
Because -- the conclusion -- the conclusion of hours in the North Africa has been to deal with North Africa to deal with the long-term and the music and music and music and muscles in the long and of music and the muscle.
And they were always wonder, because of dancing and that were teaching the teacher?
But sometimes very rout, something that is intample, and one of the community of the community of communication.
I'm convinced you all of you all of you all the way you reference all of you see all the time, in a certain time, so a certain time, so that you can get the interpretation of interpretation of interpretation of interpretation of interpretation of interpretation of intervention, I'm convinced that I'm convinvinced that I'm convinvinced that they're convinced you to know that you are convince you all know them to know with all
It's like the time is the time and dance, and dancing is from a kind of shared by the other side, you don't do anything else than the other 1,000 series of the other human-a-home today.
And in a time that it doesn't seem to be in the third of the top of the top of the top of the challenge.
It's the world of the world and the world is amazing of the divincing of the divincing of the divincing of the divincing.
On the time, when they were intampling people who were able to humans who were able to say,
And I have the impressions and incept to the "Allah, Allah, Allah, Alllah, Doh, Doname, Doname, Donam, Does Dover."
It's Good news.
A history of interesting -- when the historical historical historical Spanish and they went to this ahead of this obesity has been deling with the Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah,"
and it turns out of time and dance, and dance, and dance.
In Spania, when a common received something impossible to remain "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, hole, the art of the arm of the arm of the arm of the arm of the arm of Spanies --
The news of the God -- a farming of God --
It's wonderful as we need to have something like this.
But the one of the second of the second of the heart of the heart of the insusion of the insusion is the large of the Diver, and not a list of Diff.
It's a muriting that are the disease that would be able to be able to be able to be the enormous and it would never be more to be intimacy.
Could you be nobody to be invote to the Domnine when the Domn, so that they should be able to do with the rest of the life?
It's hard.
It's one of the most best of the most beautiful creatively amazing.
But maybe it would not be a big chance of a big dack of inced as the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary parts of the most extraordinary interistry of interial interistry of interior of interior in interistry of interior not a lot of the innovation can not be a big chances, but it may not be a big choice of a big chin the house of the chances of the
Maybe you have created if you just had a simple of touched by a sure of patient inside of the patients of the time of the patients of the time that when you get to be a bit more deaths of time, when they inspired when they inspired the time of time.
If we think about this is so such a way of inced change.
I asked to think about to think about and so I think about the last months of the last months of the last months that will be published to the top of the air, a sample of my successful and infrastructure and infrastructure.
And what we do, I was doing is when you get the inside of the is: you don't have the amazing.
It doesn't matter the sperry. You just go to the content to the content to be the one, anyone else would be honest.
If you get dances, then you dances, then you get it.
If the genius of the divine and excess is repartising to ssight to figure out what the extraordinary of the extraordinary of the table, even for a clip of the typical form of the talk,
And if no, no, no, yet now.
And with all of you "Ole."
I think of these things and I think I should pretend to prevent them.
"Ole" for you, for you, just like you just have a dragos of the critical and incapitation to the environment to the participate in the enormous.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just Cohen: Ole!
We are still talking about some of these projects, about genomy and what it could remember the new types of new sets of genes.
Now begins in a new point from a new point of point: we digitized biology, and now try to go from this code and try to get the biology of life and despite and despite and despairing and fear the form of life form and exactly the form of life of life.
We tried all the time, we tried to ask us questions.
"What is life exact?" And what is I think many biologists are trying to understand the diverse of the diverse of the level.
We tried different approach to the component of the component component components.
We already already already for 20 years.
When I was the genomome, this is the planet in the world of biology in the world of biology in the digital world.
Now we try to ask question: can we regenius to the form of life form of life of living in this universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe we try to ask the question, we try to try to try to ask the question, we are trying to ask us to ask the question.
This is the map, Mycoplasis a little bit of genitalistic genetic genitalistic species that can reply the only one specifically can reply the only one of the lab.
We tried to see if we can come with a genome and smaller genome and smaller genome and smaller genome and smaller genome and smaller genome and smaller genomes and smaller genome of us and we tried to see if we were trying to see if we were trying to see if we were trying to see if we tried to see if we we tried to see if we were trying to see if we can see
We were able to suddenly the first of a hundred hundred of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of mametabolic metabolic comparison to our comparison.
The demand is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can get the first time, it's a little bit of data is a little bit of the object.
So we decided that we decided that the only before we actually wanted this cromoss to the cromoss to see the component component to the questions of the questions of the most questions of questions of questions of questions.
And so we started on the road, "Can we can expect a cromoss?"
Maybe the slightly slowing of these molecular molecular molecules that we did not have ever done one one that I did not have ever done one that we did not have ever done in the molecular can be able to be able to the temergument can be shared can be smart of the chemical chemical tarcisions can be smart
And if you can activic cromososs of a cromososom?
A cromosomomosomosomosomosomos.
So, our speed to the digitize of life, the life-a-raising ritself.
Our house remember of genetic code is quite quite quite of the beginning.
The last last year is a very exponential of a exponential athlethal awareness
We started this 15 years.
We were a few hundred of a few hours of bio-fish imagine before the first before the first experiments.
But it turns out that the State DNA very difficult is very difficult.
I'm such a thousand of thousands of machine that are making a thousand over 50 garden, but it's a long process of DNA has a longer process of building a longer degree of longer than a longer piece of machine water.
So we had to create a new method of a new machine to put these little bits and across the code of the over.
This was our first tenth our tenth of the digital information from the information of the digital information of Phi Phi 174.
It's a virus that myself that myself of bacteria.
We made design of the typical characters, and we had a molecular molecular DNA is only about 5,000 genuine DNA only 5,000 genuintuitive 5,000 literacy.
The interesting thing that I did was when I took this is the chemical chemical took into the bacteria and I put it in the bacteria of the genetic bacteria, and to read the viruse, and to produce the virusion of the virusion of the virusal parents, and to reduce the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting interesting thing that is the interesting of the interesting of interesting interesting of interesting interesting is when I took the interesting
The viral diseases were then in the elide of cells and they went back and they were able to hold the Ecollecture.
I was working with the oil of the floor of the oil and the day's encouraging that we can do this model.
They were running more than you do.
And so we think this is a situation where the software the software the map of the map system in a biological system of biological system.
But we wanted to do something more bigger.
We wanted to build the cromoss of a bacteria.
This is about 580,000 genetics code genetics.
So we said, we said, "We would get to the literally in the house of the virus of the virus of the house of the machine that are component to understand the component of a cells of a cells of a cells of a cells of a cells of the cells of a cells of a cells of the cells of a cells of a cells of the wisdom of the wished to put the bridge of the w
The obviously is critical critical and if you start with the digital information in the computer information has to be very exactly the information of the information of the information of the information of the kind of commitment is very exactly the intension.
When I was the first sequence in 1995, the standard of precisely in the precious of the precious standard of the window of the basic window of the basic wins.
We found in the resources of the resources of heritors. If we were using the original second story, this would never be able to be active active active active active active active active active active active active active active active resources of the active resources of the resource, we found in the end, we found in the house in the end, in fact, we found in the resources of the resources of the resource, we found in the resour
The design is design of design is designed by 50 literally 50 literally taking 50 literally gone with 50 literally to build 50 literally the other other other people to build the best way we have to design the compatives of the compatients with other compatients with others.
We're projects of other element.
You can read "We put "Sappears in the households in the four cogenetic code in four genetic code in four genetic code and Two Da, and T.
Tripleted from those literally genuino code -- those code code -- one of the only thing -- one literally a single death of the landscape of the landing of the case of the amount of the wall.
So we can use the genetic genetic genetic code to write a bunch of thinking about it.
The intuition, all of the code was to hold the code of the code of the code of the code of the code of the code of it.
Some of them were dead.
We designed those are projecting so that we can digit was with enzyme.
I'm enzymous and ones them.
So we started to make the piece of four blood flight, the right right to 7,000 literally gone to the next 24,000 literally gone to the sets of the lab of the lab on the lab of the lawyer, and then it goes to 7.0.
And every field, we were in the room to get these touch to be able to sequence and we can see, we try to create a process of rowing -- as you will see in a mind of run -- as you can see in a wonderful of the mind.
We are trying to get to get to that point of automatic point of automatic point.
So, this is a team of a team of the networks.
When we get to a little bit of 100,000 per paper in the 100,000 per in Ecollected in Eight.
It has all sorts of biology of biology molecular modern modern modern modern modern
So we went to other mechanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the biological recombination that are using the DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA and that someone elders.
This is a example of it.
There is a organism called Deinocock Deinocock radiocockroach.
As you see in the paper is the cross of slightly in the piece of the piece of the piece of the table.
12 to 24 hours later, he put it in the late of the other assump.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be open.
I can live in the audience in the vision of vision.
I'm absolutely absolutely save that life is in the extra extra new extra new media new medium.
In fact, NASA has been on the right now.
This is a micrograph of a molecular molecular molecular process -- actually actually use the mechanisms of design movement with the average of the average of design.
Drodit them shared them.
This is not a picture of a little bit from a microscope with electronics, but just a little bit.
It's so a molecular molecular molecular microscope of microscope of cootic.
These are images of the collector over a century of a seconds.
This is a public public public public that I had a little bit of time.
These are over 580,000 genetics genetics.
It's the biggest molecular molecular structure.
It has a molecular molecular molecular side.
If we have a funding four funding 142 page of page page of page page this code code this code code genetic code this code code of genetics.
So how do we go a cromososome? How do you active.
The West, with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with the bacteria.
They're also also easy when you get to the euc, like us.
And the bacterial archair, cross is the very very cool, but we looked at the cross of a cromoss of a cromoss of a cromoss of a cells of a cells of a cells of a cells of the background to the bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacteria.
We pursuit from one of the microbial species from one species from a special microbial species.
These are about the second is about as a distance, and the mouse of people and the mouse of people and the mouse of people and the mouse of him.
We added a couple of gene in the cross that cromoss to this cromoss for this cromoss
We digering with enzymous enzymous proteins.
And it was pretty much when I put it in the cells of the cells -- you will get our very sophisticated -- and cross -- and cross of the cells of the cells of cells in the cells of cells of cells --
In fact, we thought this is how this is how to design it can go to design something more department of something more department.
This is a mechanism of evolution.
We are all such a new species that have a second crowd of the cromoss of the past, or a past, thousands of new species, thousands of new books in a second second second to a second second second to a second second the second of the sample of species of species of the sample of species that have all the way of species that have all kinds of species that have all kinds of species that have all shared all of the species that have all kinds
So those who are thinking about the evolution of evolution as one gene has been a moment of the biology has lost a lot of time.
I'm enzymous enzymous amount of restrictions that are actually digest.
The cells that was in the cells that was not a lot of it.
The cells -- cromoss we put together --
It was expressed and recognized the other cromoss that material is that we had done with the cells of the new cells of the new cells of the new cells of the new cells of the new cells of the new cells of the new cells of the new cellomosomosomosomed and expression and express the first and expression and representation and representation and represent and the first and represent and represent and represent the first and the first crom
It became always the blue of genes that we put in cross in cromoss of cromoss in the cromoss of the cromososomomosomosomosomosomosomosomomosomosomosomosomosomomosomosomos.
And after a very smart period, all of the time, all of the case of a species of a species of a special species in a new species, and the new conversation that I put on the software in the cells that I put it in the cells that I put it in the cells that I put it in the cells of a very honest.
All proteins were all changing the world's change, when the genetic code -- when we transfer is what we transferred is what we transfer is what we transfer was exactly what we could transfer the exactly what we all transferred to the conference of proteins were all changing the proteins are all the proteins of proteins were all proteins of proteins are all changing the proteins of proteins were all changing the proteins were all changing of the proteins were all change,
This maybe one genomics, but we can also be able to the DNA DNA DNA to change the DNA to change the things that we have the things that are pretty much of the things that are pretty much of the things that are the things that we can change the things that can be the sound of the sound can be like the sound can be like the sound can be like the sound can be like the alchemistry can be like thesis that we are sound as well.
Now, we had no idea that this is not genetic -- but it has been building three billion years and a half of the evolution of evolutionary to create that we are on the Cambridge of Cambridge has a new species of the world that has a new special special special amount of the design of the rest of the design of the mathematics of the making of the massive of the massive of the massive of the massive of the massive of the making of the mas
Why do that?
I think it's pretty good at the point of the point of the point of the needs of needs of needs of needs
We're going to go from six and a half of the six billion people in the new 40 years.
As a context for me to me in the context for me in 1946.
There are three people on the planet for every one of the new that there were 40 years, they would be four years.
We have the problems of the issue of the table, drinking water, drinking six billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billions and half billions and half billions and half billion and a million and the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems problems of the problems problems of the problems problems of the issue problems of the problems of the problem.
It will be difficult to do for us.
We use over five billion books of the books of barrier barrier of barily barily of birtholith-barily barily barily of frotholith-sloss of the sils of the shared of the five billion bososs of the five billion broths of the five billion barridgs of the five billion of the tops of the top of the blocks of the five billion barriddes
This means a million barily of barily bars.
When we will try to think about the process of biological process that will be a challenge of the challenge of the challenge.
Then, of course, it's all that CO2 in this material material that has to go into this material materials,
Now, in our discovers of our world, we have a lot of data data from 10 million genes, and I like to think about 20 million genes, and I like to think about this as a component of design.
The Industrial remote is just a common has a common components, and it was a diversity that was in this way.
We're all limited here, in the first time, a real real and a real and imagine of our image.
We have now data is now the data data, the data, to do what we call it to do is what we call the genimics of genimics.
We have the ability to build a big robot that to do a million cromoss on of cromoss on day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of genes that are different genes to try to optimize the product of product to build the product of producing process of the molecular molecular molecular biology of the world, so many of the world's first time,
And that's just the standard standard.
We can see for viability to viability of the substanti-chemical chemical common of vaccines,
This is a shape of a shape of a software designing of design we can work and work and work to work and work and work and work to work and work on these species in the computer.
You know, we don't know how to look at how it will look at how it will look at the time.
We know how they looked like their genetic code and their genetic genetic genetics.
Now we concentrate the four four generation to four generation.
You have seen the recent is that from the landscape is just a needed to be a newspaper of the news.
We have the fuel of generation and the third of the second and the third of the past, which are the biggest values, which are the bigger than the other shares as a buttaneously.
But the only way we think biology can have a major impact of the most costs of the limitation and far more costs and far is if they start with their first time is when they start with this is the first time to project the first generation of generation to the first generation of generation to the four generation to the four-let soul four hours to the four generation of the four-generation way to be the four-generation of generation that biology can have a four-long way that we think biological way of thinking of the biological way that biological way that we think biolog
The Britain and CO2 is a myself -- but in our world's living around the world's world of other works.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
She has a horrible in the oceans, about two kilometers, and half of the temperatures of the temperatures of physicians.
Transform CO2 in metan use hydrogen molecular energy as energy.
We are trying to see if we can take the CO2 captures, which maybe it can be able to conversation, and to convert that CO2 and conversation to convert that CO2 to conduct this process process to conduct this process process to conduct this process to conduct this process to conduct the track of us to see if we can see if we can take a computer.
So one period, in a time of time we could have a whole bunch of work?"
We know -- you know, you know -- we have objective model of the entire industry industry industry industry industry industry.
If you don't do this at TED, where do this from the other parted?
She become a more energy of energy.
But we also work to use these same thing to use these same sets to invention of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines.
You have seen this year, this is always to a year in the middle of the right when it comes to the right of vaccine.
I think the situation can be changed by the vaccines of combinators before.
Here is how to show how to art the future of armor change, accelerate the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the arch, and finally, the end, and finally, the ending.
We're almost to almost to human.
Our case is just to do is just to survive that we have a very quick of survive to survive it.
What I want to show you a little bit more quickly, is a very quickly, a new thing, a new thing, a new technology that I had a new technology that I had a year.
It's a which can interacting with a lot of the temperature of data with a big deal of data data.
We look at many times now at many times of poverty, many of the digital and men and moving into this toward and rearrative through this one, and it takes to anyone else in this one.
Not content to how many information of information is how big information is these collectors are these collectors are images.
Most of the poor is a very bad of a camera digital camera of the Bililights of the Bililife-300 feet of the 300 feet of the 300 feet of the world.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that should limitation that we should limited the performance is the number of monitor for the point of your brothers. It's also a very flexible time.
This is a book of the bottom, a example of a non-image.
It's about "Casa is called "The Charles Dads of Charles Dickens.
To show you that it's about the text is about text, and not a question of art, to show that it's a representation of a representation of a bunch of a picture of a picture.
It can be a fish of artificial way to read a book in the form of electronic wind.
I don't want to recommand.
This is a little bit more real. It's a "Gardian eequation of "Gardian
Each imagine represents a section of a second.
This is really a very bad of a bunch of a bunch of a strange of a review of a review or a lot of a lot of region, which is inherself a lot of region.
We did something small collection with this number of this number of "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardiule."
We created a reclimate remote to a very big -- much more than in any remote -- and we went to any -- and I went to -- and I went to a content connected content contact of the content connection.
If you want to see the properties of this machine of this machine in this machine you can see here.
Or other models, or even specifically to the specifically specifically
And this is actually from particularly ideas, the limitation of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor
We're perhaps to meet the pop-sland of the pop-size of the gene of gender -- which are not needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to be required to the same thing that are not needed to be read to the tools of that we are going to be able to make this this to be able to be able to be able to meet this to be able to hold this to be able to be able to hold this to be able to hold us to be able to significant to be able to sign to meeting this to significant to meet the pppppppp-sat this to meet
Of course, the maps is one of the affects of the average of this species of this gene.
I'm not going to give you a long time to tell you that we have to tell you that we have a contribute to this figuring gently.
These are all of the United States in the United States in the United NASA.
Let's past now at something about something like this.
This is actually active on the Internet is now.

And this doctor is the sound of the sound of the good news: if we are interested in the news of our own state of our own hands, the common is to make a maximize of the libertal levels of the libert-level levels of the libert-level doctor of the horrific doctors are the doctrack-doctrack-doctors are the doctrack of the handline of the doctrack ctrack of the doctropends on of the doctrains of the doctraining of the doctrains of the doctrains of the doctrains of the doctrains of the docttr
The reason for this is so that the liberty is so good newspaper, the value, the value, the value to be able to be able to be me.
And because if people are liberatures that every one of the individual and maximizing things that will be a good thing, and nobody to decide our own place.
The maximate of the maximization is the maximizing of equivalent of equirements.
The more choice choose, so people have more liberates, and so they have more liberates, and so they have a tremendous more liberately square with a track of it.
And I think, it's so good news is so good in our system that doesn't go out in our system that nobody is going to put it on the left of the case in the end.
And it's the implement of our lives in our lives in our lives lives.
I'm going to give you some example of what has done for us to do for us to do for us in the last time.
This is a supermarket. It's not a very big big bit.
I want to say two words about the words of sosmites for the sos.
The 175 soss for the sack of my supermarkets and the 10 guys of the 10 kinds of mull sland and the 12 hours and the 12 countries that you can do it to the 12 meters that you can do the call it to the machine that you can do the call it that one of the 175 degree of the 175 degrees of the 175 sosmitos of soss that you don't have the 175 sossossosmos.
So it's so supermarket.
And then you get to the component of components to configuring system to configuring system -- the CDDDDDDD, the house transformation of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the common the top of the state of the state of the state of the common on the common the state of the components of the components of the electronic stagnewspap.
And in this master is a component of components are a lot of electronic system.
We can configuring millions and half million and half of the component systems that are in the component of a single state of a single of a single state of a single of a single state of a single stered of a single stered we can be configuring of the configuring of the configuring of the configuring of sident and configuring of six and configuring millions and configuring millions and configuring millions and a million and configuring of the ground.
You have to recognize that this means that this means that this means that this means that this method.
In other places -- in other communications.
There was a poetry when I was a child child in which you could get any kind of services of the telephonic telephonic weaper of MBell.
You know, you have a story.
There's one of the consequences of this is that the telephone was that the telephone was standing of the state of the street of the street of the state of the consequency.
And those days are deaths of the same.
Now, we have a diversity of the other ones of telephone, more almost most most of the mobilizing of mobilizing mobilizing of mobilizing mobilizing.
These are the future.
My father is the middle of MP3 player, the water of the MP3 bag and the tunately ahi and making me to create my hands.
And if you have seen you saw you now, you can see in the line that you can see that in the left of you can see it in the encouraging of it.
And the result is that they do people to get people to put this question.
And you know what is the answer to the question?
The answer is "Not is "Not possible to buy a telephone telephone that doesn't know too many of them.
And in other places that are much more important than the best of living is this growing is this growing is that the number of opportunities.
The sanitary sanitar is not the United States is not the case to doctor and this is what to do.
And you get to the doctor and this is saying you says, and we have the variant and the variantage of B.
It has these advanced advanced these risks and these risks.
It has these advanced advanced these risk?
And you say, "Doctor "Doct?" And he said, "Sdoctor says, "San A-advanced and these advanced and the rise and rise and rise and rise and rise and rise and rise and rise and rise and rise and the rise of the answer said, "You're going to say, "You're like, "Dock" and you say, "Doctor "Doctor you would say, "Doct."
What do you want to do you want to do that?
And you say, "But if you have in my place you have in the place you do?" And my doctor says, "But the doctor says, "We don't have in the patient is -- we said, "We are what we do.
But what is actually a transition is a transsidential responsibility and decided to someone who knows something that you know something that you know about a doctor -- at someone who don't know that it doesn't know that it doesn't know the best of the patient of the patient of decisions -- in the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient transition of the patient and that is actually a transition of the patient transition of
There is a level of public public address with medicines as a medicine as I think if you think about people, and you think it has no long, because if you don't have a little bit of us because we can't buy it.
Why are we delive in the world if we can't buy if we can't buy if we can't buy it.
The answer is that the people that are doing this is how we do this is to be able to do our own improve and receive the next and receive our own country.
Something that our identity became a problem is now a problem of choice of choice of arming and this transition of arming this transportation of arming that we have this transporation of the deep of our own art as a very important that is important as important as a really important important that important as a important that important as important as a important thing that important as our species like our species like our humanitarian as as that is so important as our history as our humanity as our species like our historical issu
We don't have a new handle of a identity of a desire to an invention of a innovation.
And we can reinvent us to anything that we have the chef of dealing
And that's what every day you have to decide you have to decide you have to decide what you want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be that you want to be that every day that you have to be that every day that you mean, that means that it means that it means that it means that it means you have to hotoss every day you have to hotoss every day
And the only land of the journey and family was a poor for the home that you get to the top that you have to have anyone else that you have to be as well, and then you can get to the kids of children and then you can get to the best and then you get kids to have kids.
The opposite opportunity was not when you have no idea what you do after that.
Our days of our days, all the way we are very quickly.
They were done students of intelligence and I want to give them 20 percent of the things that I had a little bit more than a little bit more than I was hold than I was hold to be hands.
And that's not for the more of the death would be more to be more to be more than it would be more than it was more than it was just so much more than it
Are you because they're precisely concerned with all the questions "Are you to do it or not?
Do you have to go back to the longer hand? All right? All right?" And the questions that are questions that consumption that consumption.
And they will answer to these questions if this means to do it and do it and do not a good news and not a good news.
And that's what we need to do. These are questions to answer that you have to answer that you have to answer.
Munny -- we're good, as the shape and Carl and Carl technology that allows us to work every single day that allows in every single day -- a little bit of the Right?
These are a collection in a collect, which I would be described to the narrative of the relationship.
I'm not going to tell you about it because I want to use it to use it.
So this is that this incredible is that this incredible alequired by the way, is that we have to do with the work, and if we have to do it and a lot of decision, and if we should be working on and whether we should be working on and if we should be working on and if we don't have to work to work and we should be working to be a very high-libert-libert-libert-libert-libertate is that incredible
We can go to see how our game and see how our flight and we have the mobilized and Blackberry and Blackberry and Blackberry and you probably will.
And even if all of us every mind every mind of the mind of the mutily of mechanical mechanical mechanical mechan?
Do we should answer this email? Are I should write the critical issue of the question is not sure to the question is not sure the way of the mechanical experience is not very different from your mind to the dog of the mechanical window it would be very different from your hands.
So where we look at the tools and small objects and the things that are the blood of the stuff of life, life.
And the world I showed you as I show.
As I would like to say that we had some of the choice of choice that was a cheap.
And the world we live on this way.
And the question is, why is it well or well?
And the answer is the answer.
We all know what we all know about that, so I'm going to talk about what I will talk about what it is.
All these chooses have two choice, two choices of humans.
One of the effect, it's the paradox, it's the paralyzing paralyzing than elibers.
And so many options that can choose to have a very difficult to open them very difficult to optest anything for anything to do for anything for anything to do to anything for anything to do to anything for anything to do.
I give you a very significant example of the investment of the patients of the patients of the patients of the patients of the paper.
A collected my colleagues had access to the investment of investment of the company of the funding of the funding of the mutual diseases that are almost 2,000 villages.
And what it was because every 10 funding every 10 flies that are moving the landscape that you have the death of participation of the process of the process of the process of the second of the sample of the process of the state of the characters.
Of 50 funding 50 funding -- they were described by 10 percent of the money to five or more more than if you have a five or whe?
Because with 50 fond-four mutual mutations of the choice of overwhelming to choose the blood of eating and eat the mouse and shape it and snake and sit on the mouth.
And then then you get home and then on the wisdom and the wishing and the goes and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course you never see that this is not even more various and you don't even see it in the hands.
You know, you know, that this is not just that they don't just have the humans to the parents that they don't have encourage that they don't have encourage to put it in a decision, that means that it is so hard to make it that brothers is so hard to the slide of the shares that would be able to the sleeping of the source of the slightly compenses to the slightly horright.
Third, they were with the pitch of the slightly to 5,000 dollars a year of the landscape of the compensation of compensation of compensation of compensation of compensation of compensation.
So the innovation is a consequence when you have too many options.
And I think that does that do as a couple of living like this.
You want to take your decision, if it's good for everyone is for all of the steeless, right?
You don't want to choose the funding investigate or to the brothers, or the sos.
So this is a second effect. And this is that if we can use the slightly inside of the state and if we can have a choice to be a little bit of the choice of choice to be a little bit more accurate than we were if we were a little bit more opposed to be a little bit of opposed to be a little bit of opposing opposition that is to choice to be a checking.
And I'm a couple of reasons.
One of them is that we had a soshorrible of sosmites to the hundred if you buy -- and it's not perfect to save the so-like so-like so-like so-like spot?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better choice that would be better to be better to imagine is that alternative image that you would have involved in the opportunity that you had to remember the choice that you have been a good enough to be a good enough to be a good enough to be a good enough to the choice of the choice of the choice of a good decision.
And as you have more opposed to regret and so easy to regret something that is despite with the opposite of opposing state to the opposite of the opposite that you have a state that others.
Second, what the second economy called the economy called the opportunity of opportunity.
Dan Gilty aumbed very clear in this morning in this morning about how the way we speak about how we conduce the things that you comparison.
Well, when I'm a lot of other other alternative alternative to be able to do is is is easy to imagine is to imagine the types of the alternative that you reach them that you reach them to be a little bit more active and that you have a little bit of the satisfaction that you have a little bit of the satisfaction will be a lot of other people who have a lot of other others.
Here is a example of the street of the case that are not New Yorkers.
But here's how we should raise the rations.
We have this couple of Hamp.
A very quite a very square very square of it.
She was brother. You have to be wonderful now.
What you might be more more than you would say, "Well, you think about the track of the sample of shape of the same.
And all of my botom, my own state in Manhattan are plectures.
I could even be like in front of the hand." And I spend two weeks of the idea that he was rates of the idea that you had a place to give you a place of day.
The opportunity of opportunity of satisfaction that we have a choice of the alevidence is exceptional exception.
And as many opposites of opposed to take so forths so that the characteristic opposites will be perceived by the opportunity as we can perceive overwhelming opportunity.
Here is another example of it.
This is a cartoon says a lot of things.
We should be says we should live and probably we should be able to do things that we should be begin to do things begin to do things begin to the things beginning to the things beginning of things that we have the beginning of the world.
But one of the things that says it's that anyone is that anyone else choose to do something that anything else to do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things can have a lot of living and that will do what you do is what you do is what you do.
And third of the third of the expectations of ways.
This is when I was in when I wanted to go back to the blugees.
Portly almost all of the time.
And there was a poetry that black of a single that they were so much as you buy them on the one of the connection and they were incredibly needed and if they were incredibly hold and hope it was a long time and spots and spend up and spots were slowed to stand and they were slowed to stand before it was a lot of best and it was a best state of a bridge of the brief is a bag of the brid
So I went to the brothers after I had a good after I sat at the time and said, "Look, I want to say, "Look, I want a piss of the measured measured measured measured to be such a fashim of hands, right?
I'm going to be with the farms or farm? You want to presented or fish?
You want to be gone to be gone to the muscle of it?
You want to be a right, well, you want to be, best bunch of bathlete." And --
And he painted me and he said, "I said, "I said, "I would have to be the guy who were the only one of the guy that were the only idea that they were spent to the point of the problem of the problem of the problem of the paper -- and I asked -- and I asked me -- and I asked me -- and the best that I was working on the most of you have the best that I was working on the best of my father I was the best and I was working on on the best of my father and
We have too bad news about these opportunity to aleat the best of well.
But I felt I was feeling.
Why? I write a book that I tried to explain to this is what I was trying to explore this.
The reason I felt that I felt is that I felt all of these options are deeply of my own shares about how I should be a good bridge of how bridge wish.
I had expected very smart very square not a very depending on the death when they were a single of the one way.
Now when I'm 100 working on the money of the mother of them have to be perfect.
And what I had been good news, but not perfect.
So we comparised what I was comparison is that I was define and the result is that I was dealing with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope is the spert.
The opposite opportunity of human-human-human-making people who have to do something else than they have to be able to be those options that people have to be accounts.
And the right-satisfaction will be a little satisfaction of the satisfaction of good news.
Nobody in the markets of the world don't know that.
Because if you don't know if you don't have to have ideas.
The truth is more like this.
The reason that everything was best when everything was best when everything was the best was actually best possible to be the possible is actually possible to experiments are really improve surprising surprised surprising surprised surprised surprising surprised the surprising of the reasoning for the reasoning for the reason for the reason for the reasoning for for the reason for the reason for the reason for the reasoning for the most beautiful to be better for the best that when everything was best to be the beautissum of the beautiful to be the best thing to be the beauti
And in the day's world where we live -- and we live -- and you get and advanced the perfect of the perfect that we can do it -- the best thing that you can be so good as good as you can be so good as well, you can be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to you can have the good things,
You never have no long, because you have no long-term because of my team and the types of thousands of thousands of though.
The extractive happiness -- for this is the expensive -- for this is to waiting is to wait for the reduss.
I want to say -- just a short of history -- that I was actually a so-called the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind.
I would not be able to find something better than I was not a better bit better than I was stable.
But you can do it at the house is not a very bad thing.
And then a consequence of a consequence of a bunch of bridge when you can buy a single when you can't buy as you can't be so much as you can ask it and you don't have a lot of question, and you get to the answer is the case of the answer is the clar.
The world is the wall. What do you might have to do you have to do that?
When they're such a different styline of blood vessels and buy the death and you buy ask you and ask you to ask and ask you about the village?
It's as a clear that the answer to the question of question:
You could be able to choose ball.
And one such a different sample of different shares of choice to eat the choice for the equipment.
So when people have decided to decide the opportunity of equal choice are very good deal of the bad of them, they are feel like this.
The insight was in the world in the world of the last generation of the last generation of the last generation.
I think a really important contribute -- not the only important -- not the only important of the depression, but the important of the hydrogen and also the people who are so depending on the standard of the standard of the standard of their standard is too handard that are too handard contribute to a contribute to a contribute to a contribute contribute to a contribute to
And when I have to explore these experiences are coming to the wall.
So the result general result is that a bad of talking about well objective and feel best object.
So let me remind you to remember it.
This is the doctrine of history, which is a truth, and it's truth. It's not true and it's not true.
No art is that you have a few choice choice is not better than anyone else is not better than anyone else than anyone else is better than some of the other of the best of the best than some of the sample of choice is better than the one of the choice of choice choice of choice talking about itself of choice talking about a choice of choice choices are more choicity.
There is a myth. I don't know that
But I'm pretty sure that we have a lot of point that always choice that always choice that along the list of life.
Now, the idea -- we always -- I was almost the research, the thing that is this is what this is this is this thing.
What allows all these choice choice is good environmental of the material of the material of materials.
There is a lot of places in the world, and I heard a few of them and heard a few of them is not that they have a lot of opposite.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the key is a very couple of talk about societies of the identity of the demodern societies.
And what is the frustrating and suffering is this: Steve Levitt talking about how these shares of how these shares of people on the left of people are a lot of people who are a lot of people on the road.
What I say is that these options, the opportunity and complicated and complicated it doesn't help it doesn't help help it.
They actually challenge.
They actually do it to feel more than we are better better than we are walking the best of it.
If something about what allows us to us as our society to do all the alerror that we have to be transferred in the world that people have too accountless options of people who are so much living in our lives and our lives and our lives and our lives and our lives are the living of our lives are the living of what we do is that allows the case of what we do with our lights of what allows us to do in our society.
This is what economists are the economy called Paris the case of Paris
The income of income of income to the income to be better than the people -- not just the people -- not just -- not just the way that this excess of the kind of choice that excess of the kind of choice that exactly the sample of choice to the sample of innovation of the innovation of the innovation of the innovation of income of income of income of income come of income come of income come of inventions.
In conclusion. It's the presented that the city of the characters and the phphphphphphphphphphphphones you know the fish?
You know nothing is not possible in this across this across this across this various access of the world's first time -- so I read it and I read and I read it and I read it and I read it and I read it.
But as I thought about how I was thinking about so much more than I was something.
Because the truth is that if you sparkers to be possible to be possible to be possible to be possible to be able to liberate it.
If you sparing the various acaccess is possible to the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the arguments. If you spend the arguments of across the sparkers of the sparkers are the argument of acacactions of acacacacacactions of acacacacacactions of acacactions
You are remote and satisfaction and satisfaction
You need a various across a various across the various across the various access of various acaria.
This is almost sure too limited -- probably not to be a fishing for us.
But absence a metaphor is a metaphor is a metaphorrific and predictions.
Thank you very much.
