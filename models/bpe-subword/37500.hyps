For the year, I did a inside to LHC.
And I promised to go to and give you a data on a data on how it works works.
So here are the mass of the one who have been here, LHC is the largest experiment that was the most experiment that was recreated by the 27 kilometers -- Ciruminess is to be able to do the Strem's conditions -- the bars of the world's unique of the universe.
It's extremely ambitious.
This is the city of the Geneva.
We make photos of these mind Big Bangs" inside the decades of the decades.
I work on this one. It's called the ATLAS -- Loke ASTLAS -- Lungarian foot photos of 22 feet photography here detectors here detectors in building to the ATLLATLATLATLATLAS,
On the year of the year of the year, I went to the first time that I started the first time.
And this image was made by ATLAS.
He causes a huge celebration of control.
It's a picture of the first fasck the first particular particular particular line that the intuition of the LHC, the LHC, though by deliberately deliberately deliberators in LHC deliberators in LHC deliberators in the first picture.
In other words, when I saw that I saw that I was set about 10 seper seper like the appeared, which is a huge success.
I don't know if that was the largest ovative, or that someone went to the biggest page on the page of Google and the first page of the first page of the first page of this way.
It means that I did a cultural impact of the stiintific impact of the stiintific impact of the stiintific impact of the street.
After about about a week of a week of the apart with the problem with the appeared, which was doing these fields -- these fired.
Those are the transportation of 13 thousands of the mountain power works in power of maximum and maximum
Now, the engineering of the rock and says, "I can't transportation of the hormous myself. I'm being myself myself."
But I can do that for when I'm at the time when I'm at the temperatures are called the super-hundreds of the super-conducts.
So as a 271 degree of the collection of the collection of the street can transport of the cooks.
In one of the country between the 9,000 magnets in LHC, was a defabricatic defabricatic defabricative.
So that the common was inwarded the 13 thousands of both and the resilience of electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressive to the magnets of magnetwork, and they fly over 20 tons, and they funny about 30 to 30 to 30 to 30 to 30 to 30 to 30 to be a 30 to be presented to this is more intentional to be presentially presentially presentially presengnant to those retie that those retie to those magnets that those magnets.
So I deteriors about 50 percent of the magnetighly.
We had to take you to get affair, which is what we do.
We reconnecting it all the way to repay it out.
And now we go to the magnetissue in subteran.
Spain, the mart-bathrow of LHC will be like new HC will be like new one.
We're going to go back and waiting us and we have to get data or hythese, and we will continue to be able to keep the research to find out the elements of the universe.
Now, of course, of course, those accidents accidents reopen talking about the important sense of the important sense of the important engineering to break up to break the extreme to break the one.
I think that the fact that is that the fact that is so difficult to the fact that we have inside of the fact that we have the important of the experiments like LHC.
I'm going to be the brothers of a bunch of a bunch of a Britain the experiments of the experiments of the inner of the inner of the protect of protect, this is not more dangerous for the progress of our minds of human minds for our own minds are finding to our own stiff, and we are finding to our own stiffnick in the lives, and they are fine, as well as well-final winness of our lives, and as well-farmistakes.
Thank you.
I want to start with the running to remember the running of kiddneys, when you play with bodies.
On the masssource you invented them to the brothers and get them and square the way to think about how to figure out how to figure out how to figure out how to figure out how to figure out what to do is intelligent and manipulate and manipulate and manipulate them out of the invention of the invented to including them to the top of you invest them to inventional inventions.
The space is the space is deeply of how we intellect, and we have a big part of the world conject.
So that is the research of research inspired by this use, and we have the inspired of our physical inspires -- my physical consultant Jeevan Kalana Kalana Kalani Kalanii -- I begin -- I begin to the computer in this until we can see if you can use a computer flured, rather than a computer remembers that we could be inspired out of the mouths of the inspire and inspired by the mass of the innames of the mmal and the mmaps of the reambition and we could be the reames that we figure of the mones that realize of the reames of the rer rer reambitiondgital read if we could be bridgital ret of IT cushing thing to be dgital gital g
So what do we want to want?
And the question was so fascinating by the fascinating that I decided to research the answer the answer to the Siftable.
Before the shortable Sift-in-interactive computer of a biscy of a biscy.
They can be manufacturing the user and perceive the food of the food and a ran and a ran and a radio ran and a reless.
The most important is that I'm the palpable of game, so you can miss the game, you can miss the gaming as just approaching it as well.
And Siftables of an example of a new equipper of a new driving information of digital manify information.
On the masssource becomes more palpable to be more constantly constantly one of the other constips of our other active active active active and deal with us and deal with us and degrees of interactive and degrees to interact with us and degree to interact with interactive and degree to interact with interact.
I'm going to stop some example.
This Sift-Sift-presented images of video gorgeous video and if you put the philerates into a direction, if you put the physical movie in the other parts of the part, if you release the inclues.
These interactive portrait is constantly one of the other.
So if they put them on the language, it becomes interest.
If they're injured and notices and that, and I can become confuse.
You can feel also feeling and inclining and inclining.
We realize that one of the involves of interesting interactive involves is that we can use the babies of manipulate the data like we could be a lyellow of a license like a lyme.
In fact, we have three Siftables configuring as galets like the galets of painting in the center of the center where they will remember the center of the center where they will remember the center of that will be amestablish.
If we went too much, we can actually take a lot of inaverage.
There's also possibilities for education, like education, like education, like the mathematical games, and logical logical players, and to try to see things quickly to see the results, and to see the results.
So here -- this is a Fibonacial smart that I do with a simple program I simply do a simple program is a simple programs.
Here's a game of the words of the words, a kind of combination and Bogger Scrababs and Boggle.
Finally, every single target a literally in the intimate of the Siftable, and the masssource of the word of the word and a dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds of 30 seconds of the letters of the letters of the letters of a slightly new possibilities of research and research and read to recognize it.
Thank you.
These are the babies that came into the excurately in the Media, and I had to try to make them convinced them to try to move them a material to try to move them a material to me.
It lived in neighborhood
And one of the interesting of this interesting applies of this kind of applied people to have many instructies.
Everything that you need to be "For word," and they know what to do.
Here are some other people trying to read the cancer.
This is the most tanary, our tester on our right, play in the right right right in the right right now.
It seems like everything that he wanted to do was to take a Siftable,
So for him to hold it was just the bottom of it.
This is an involvement applied by animation.
We wanted to build a top of the people who invented languages.
And this is Felix.
He can get new characters in the scene, just ridiculous, just the Siftables that affess,
Here's the sounds of sounds like this.
Video: The mouth of the race.
David Merrill: Now he got a traction of the scene.
Vo: The Trace.
Good goo!
Miss Siftables and Sifty-source and the language can do the interactive of the interactive -- Video: Ham!
DM: I think about narrative.
Vo: Okay!
DM: It's a story, and the final open such as it will draw the way it will draw over.
Video: Zboara, pis!
DM: The universe that I showed you today is a today is a today and interpretated the music and interpretated the music that we built the role in which we built the role and whether they were rhythm, bas well as and bas well as and yellow and bas well.
Each one of those four various various various various that you want to use it to use it and use.
And you can inject the sound of injects in a successful that you can put that guess what the guy down.
You put the sound to the sound like Siftable-Siftable to be successful by a successful Siftable to be successful to the barras.
There are effects that you can control the live, like the reverberative and filters and filter.
Here's a certain a certain the sound and then inclinical to him it to him it to him it with him and help.
It takes the power of general effects like the tempt that applies of the Sintreme sequences of the Second to see it.
Video: MVides begin with a second rhypes in the Siftables of a series, we arrhythm in a series, extinct, and we have rhythm of Videas.
Now I put a line line.
Video: My I add a little bit of the percups.
Video: Ma: Make I'm going to add the movie to control the live of the live of the lives.
Video: Maybe M: Maybe the second inclining inclining in a part or someone else.
Video: My go: Now I'm going to attack the base of the base for more expression.
Video: Maybe I can do the secure.
So I don't have to do the planet in preallion, I can improvise, months and mass slightly bridge in the walk.
Now, in the sfars; I can estomat inside the Siftable-second second Siftable-volume, inclined in the stangle.
Thank you.
As my passion is my passion is creating new interfact of new interface, the way that future that works more and more than the brain that works and our brain and our body and our body and our body works on the brain and our body brain in the body.
And today, we had a coordination of this new space, and some of the design, and some of the possibilities that we tried to get out of the lab.
The one that I would retinate your retinets is that we're at the granted to this new generation of instruments of instruments of instruments of the world's information in our world.
Thank you very much.
I have a nerable nerable to talk about you to talk about you to talk about you to.
I'm writing.
He wrote is my own teacher and it is, of course, more than that.
It's all my big love and fascinating.
And I don't like this to sit is to change it.
But these figure out something like that, something like the recent of the struggled and in the book, and in my book, which has determined me me to my work with works.
And the stranger is that I wrote this book, this book, the autobiographer's intitled "Manca, Ros, Road to deal with any of my books of the world, and it became this important mega-sensor that reason that is the important mega-sense.
The relim is that anywhere where I go now, people go now, people are going to be damn as a condamn as a condamn as a damn of the result of the network.
Serioiod, condamn -- condam!
You see for example of the labor and I say, "You don't have a fama -- don't you have a team, is you can't depass that never will be performance or performance you could be performance this?
Do you will not be going to go to the end of your life to write your life on your life, you know, a book that time to someone who ever before, and someone who ever ever before?"
It's very linest, until it goes up.
But it would have been more running if I had all of you ever ever began to go to 20 years, when I was a great time to become a great deliver -- as I was a writo-reacted reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive fears on a kind of front of the best fear.
And people say, "Don't you have no more likely to have never been like, you would have never been successful part of the successful one?
I don't have your humilient to break your idea?
Do you have to work like you will be your life in this field and your life in this field and not going to be deadly deadly deadly deadly to deadly deads the center of the center of the center of the brain in the center of the essentially you are the es?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the answer on the short of the questions is "Yeah."
Yes, you know, it's the themselves.
And always he was always stiff.
And you know, it's teama lot of things that people who are not macross the other things that don't have macross the macross the bone.
To example of the big examples of the big things that are infrastructure of things that are infruit
But when it was talking about written the thing I have all thinking, and what I all thought, "Why?"
Is something rational of the rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational is? Is it something rational is something rational of rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational of rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational?
It's the love to anyone to be the way to be the right to be the right thing that feeling that they feel like that they feel like this Pamant.
And what is so specifically is that initiatively initiatively like non-inists as well as well as a way in a way that other professional teachers are not doing it?
Tatal example, for example, it was the chemist and not remember the 40 years, you don't have the inery of the 40 years of engineer is not to be an inerror is not a phrase,
Not before he was -- John, how do it goes with the chemicals in the engineering engineering engineering engineering engineering engineering to the engineering isn't inering -- John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John,
It's just not just intament not that something.
But to be honest to be honest to the chemists like the group of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the maniaco-depressive.
We write a writers, and we have this reputation of the reputation of all kinds of all kinds of all sorts of all kinds of the labor labor lab.
And all we have to do is to look at the number of the super-based diseases of the same, in the earth of the mind of the mind of the mind of the young people, and often drawing and open.
And even that didn't have honest to be honest seems to really be really straight to be really straight in your own own own tons.
Norman Mail, even inside to die and die, in the last Inview, he said my books in my books in my book."
A great task of extraordinary work.
But it doesn't even even when we hear someone day-hearing because we heard that we heard that we heard about so many times and somehow many times and somebody so that we have a collective idea, the idea that is just like creativity and suffering and as art, the idea of the art and like art and like art in a final armacier to the suffering until we alone.
And the question I want to add all of the today today is is: Are you is: you're all the idea of is: Are you is: Are you going to do this ide?
You are comfortable with it -- because the same, so that you see how the light of the light of the light of this ipotter.
I think it's odias.
And also I think it's dangerous and not want to go and not wanting to see it dangerous.
I think it's better if you including artists to live artist us to live the artists of living in the hypothese.
And I know that that I think about my case, in my case, in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to myself, to start my insights of this ippot-in-indeed scientists in which I find out in which is now in which I find out that is now teaching now is in fact,
To example, I'm pretty much for 40 years.
I probably have probably inside the four decades.
And it's likely that everything I will write the moment to be judgment of the human work of the manufacturing of my work for my last successful strange of my last name?
What would I say to mean the barrasses, because of the friends here are already -- is very likely to be intamed to be intamplied to be intamed to be intamed already to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be to say the far far from the menaging far far far far far farming the far far far far samples of the body, because of the best way to be intamed to be the biggest way to the best way to be the largest way
Oh, God, what gand!
This is the kind of a guy that could do someone to get the horse to the horse to the horse the morning, and I don't want to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person person to get that person to get that person in the kind of a kind of like someone who could do on someone else to do someone who could do on someone to get someone to get someone to get someone to the hold someone to the inequip.
I do do this on this message that I keep going.
And then the question is becoming the question, right?
And so it seems to myself, as a meditative meditative that I need to work on the home to go to the hold me to make me a kind of psychological buildings that are building to protective, right?
I have to find out of a way, to find a way to find a way to be a safe of me, and my team, and my team, and my team, and my team, and my team, and that will be able to do it write what is written about what is writing to what it written about what writing is in a way.
And as I was all looking for the last year this sense of the last year to the time and I started to find other societies and try to see other societies if you could have better ideas that if you could have better ideas about how people creative ideas about how people creative ideas about how people creative people creative art of emotional emotional inherent of art inherent inherently people are making people who are beginning to be able to find the art of this sense of the last year of exactly the bure-behind this sense of the time in this sense of the
This is what this has led me in Greece and Roma and Roma ancient of Roma
So the massive cacross the cack cess of the couple of insand.
But in the time of Great Rome, and Rome, and Romantic creativity is not that people don't believe that the human inside of the human inside of the human inside of the humanity of the human inside of the humanity of the time,
People believe that creativity was a spirit of the people who can be able to humans the inside of a source of a source of reasons, and unintelligent reasons.
The babies have named these creativity, the term of creativity-term of the term of the term of the term of "demonth."
Socrackers because it was a demon that has a demon which is the shape of the spring of the department.
The researchers had the same parents, but they call that spirit creative, genius creative, genius --
What is amazing is awesomes were not really believed that a genius was a genius was a genius of the individual herself.
They thought that was a kind of a genius was a kind of magics of the divince of the study of the studio of the wall, in a kind of like Dobby-hyridge and insession and insession of the work, and insession of the work, the model of the work, model, modeling of the work, the model.
Absolutely straltered -- this is the distantuish that we were talking about -- that building psychological to the work of the work of the works.
And everyone knows that that the way that it work?
So the ancient was protected by certain things like this, like that, for example, like too much narcism, right?
If you could work was the stralucted, you couldn't all the worker for it, all the way to her, you know, all the way you had this kind of slightly helped you to help.
If you work was criticizing was criticizing your windness, right?
Everyone knows that the genius was about ignorant.
They've looked at people in the West periods of the time for a long time.
Then came up with the Rene and the time with a certain the idea of the birth, the idea of the big idea as the individual as the individual in the center of the universe of all the day's heritage, the weapons, the windows that they get the horribly horrible from diving.
It was begin the research of the rational rational, and people start to creativity as the creativity of the individual inside of the individual inside the individual inside the individual inside.
And for the first history in history in history to the one or one of the artists of the artists of the game as a genius of a genius of a genius.
And you have to marriage a huge of massive herting.
Permitage someone who is to create a simple person or a simple person is actually the recepting and the source and the source and the source of mystern, creative active and a little too much to the responsibility is a little bit of the human responsibility of the human beings.
It's like you to take you to someone to touch the soil.
It's just incovocation and deforms of equipping and genuine all these expects inimaginable inside.
I think that the pressure of the presence of one of the last 500 years old.
And if I think is true, and I think is, the question is, the question is the question is, what do we do now?
Can we do things different?
It can come to the sense of the more old sends of the relative senses of the brain and the mystery of the creatively and mystery.
You may not.
It may not just like we can stery sterring 500 years of human rational thinking, by a talk of humanistory.
And probably as the people in the auditories that would be the question of the question of the question of the task on the task of the task people to do the other people in fact, which is that the people across their projects and all of their own day.
It probably not going to coopt all of this idea.
But the question I want to ask is -- why not?
Why don't we think about it?
Because it has send send to something else like anything else to something else explication of the completely unexpected by the design of the creative processing process of the design of the design of the design of the design of the design of the same.
It designs that anyone in order to create something -- the all of the -- the one of the one -- the whole thing -- knows that it's always like the rational behavior.
And in fact, sometimes it can put the right side of the paranormal.
I had a Recenth where I had a extraordinary of the extraordinary poettone, which is the American Ruth Stone, which is in the inside of the intuition and that was the storytelling me that when the storage to work on the told of the told me and feel the story, and it feels a story, and it feels up to the rope.
The story was like a val vantage of the air.
And they have the samples of the rops.
And I feel the income, because they are smart the paper under the legs of the legs of the legs of the legs of the leg.
In that moment is a single thing that is a single thing and do is to choose as well.
And the already is the water to the house, and the trage, and the trage, and the purposes of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map map map of the map map of the map map of the map of the map of the map of the house of the house.
Sometimes was not enough to be a quick and alerry and alerge, but not the role in the house, but not the rost, and the bottom and the poems of the rost, and the poet on the room, I read a "another poet."
They were also at the moments in which -- and the part of the -- and I will never look at the times that story like almost loss of the loss of the losing of the loss of the loss of the loss of that --
One home, the case of the map of the map of the map of the credit and the exactly when they pregnancing and the story of the other's home.
The first of the coads of the coads and then in the body, and then in the massource on the map of the map of the map of the map of the massnail.
In this situation, the poems of the map of the map of the map of the map of the first house, from the first home, from the first home.
When I heard -- it's surprised -- it's exactly how my own own creative.
My design is not limits of this -- I'm not drive -- I'm not drive -- I'm not driving o!
I'm a way to go and do the way to go and go on every day to go on every day and true, and to send the same way and smart me and smarter and stretched and stretched to be great.
But even no, in the indark in my inside to me, even though I was tought.
And I have imagine that they were also in the same way of you.
And I had been projects or ideas that came from a source that I had not been honest to be a identify to be a identify of the handle.
And what is it all of this?
And how do it just like you should report us report to the way to do not lose our minds, and we don't lose the right to live our minds?
For me, example of the most relevant days, which is what we can do is the best musician Tom of the Waits, the caruage of the reviewing of the reviewing of the reviewer of the reviewing of the reviewing of the reviewing of the relevant example of the most relevant example of the most relevant for me, the most relevant of the days, the most relevant chasing of the days, which
I was talking about this and Tom was almost all of the contemporary artist of the contemporary artist of the contemporary artist of the inure, to control these inably involved, and to figure out the inably interiorizing.
With the time of again and the line story, and the story of a day driving to Los Angeles Angeles Angeles and then everything has changed the time.
While it is driving a baggle of a brothern piece of a piece of the beautiful and desire as a desire and a desire and a wall, and it's the samplenda, it's not to look at it, but it doesn't look at it, but it doesn't look at it doesn't look at it to water.
It doesn't have no founder the map of the map of the magic reporto.
It is to feel that the old onto the old anxiety of the inside of the moment "I will lose this moment, and this is going to be the money to always my money to always the money to always the bone.
I'm not good enough to reach a good enough."
And instead of it in the paintings has stopped out.
He stopped the process and made something like all the new and all of us and all the new one.
He says, "Sorry and said, "Sorry, you don't see that I'm not going to be like volunteer?"
"You can see you like to write a them?
If you really want to be really excited to be a more future more future than you can go to your brothers.
If you don't do it and you read it on somebody else today.
Two and deranjet it on Leonard Cohen."
The true process creative process has changed this.
Not opera has continued to be desperately as intunning.
But the third of the aggering of the agnosed around his way around his hyridge in the time that took the hyridge and the cause of the genidal and the cause of the top of where he came up with the Chinese and then to be something that he has to be something so that they don't need to be something that is that they need to be something like this:
It could be this collaboration and bization bizarre and bizarre the shape of the exterior the exterious exterious that was not like Tom.
And then I heard the story of my story, I started to have a little bit of the way I worked and already saved me a data.
This is what was saved to be when I was in the middle of the middle "Manca, Ros, and I was the kind of a kind of like a kind of despair, and I was like to do with something that we don't go to something that doesn't get your best rise to think it will be the more process of the book will be the most process of the book will be the most product.
Not just prove that the best bridge.
I had to think about thinking about to think that I should be abandoning the project.
And then I remember to me Tom Tom talking about the space and I read and I researched and I research.
I went to my view the way on the manuscrips of the manuscrips of a collection of the cameras.
I said with your voice voice and you know and you know if you know that if you know that if that is not just the extraordinary is not going to be just walk, is going to be just walk?
Because you can see as a myself to be a battland, and more than so that I can do not do this:
So if you want to be better than you want to be better than you have to do it and you have to do the part of your view your part of the work.
Okay. And if you don't do that, you know, the street, at the naid to all of it.
You will go to write because this is my message.
And I want to consign that I did my part of my head of my work on my hands down."
Because -- the Conclusion is, in the way, the hundreds of years ago in the Earths of North Africa, and they bring people to get the beautiful and the music and the music and the music and the music in the race,
And there were always wonderful for the dances, because the dances, and they were remarkable to remarkable and remarkable to remarkable and remarkable to remarkable and they were always remarkable to remarkable and they always were always wonderful and they always were always wondering the wonderful thing.
But sometimes, very running, and one of the intament of the common the common really indeed from the common in the common the common
I'm convinced you all know what I all the way to do is reference, because of all the time you see the interpretation of a particular interpretation of the interpretation.
It's like the time is stops and dancing is the password is by a kind of dancing by the other 1,000 seriousness of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other ones of the other ones of the other ones is like these.
Suddenly not the whole thing to be in the ingum.
It's the lights and light in the interior of the divinced of the divinced of the divincing divinced of the divince of the divince of the divince of the inside.
By the time when they were intamples in people stand they were saying what was the name.
They have the mainly and incept to scanners "Allah, Allah, Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, Alland, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
It's God.
A history -- when the history -- when the mapped the Spanish Spanish and the pronuntil this obices has been the pronuntil "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allahistorian -- lawyer's history --
and they hear as a fight of the fights and dances.
In Spain, when a interpret of recognizing something that is the male and magic magic and the magic weapons."
It takes us -- a farming of God.
It's amazing for something like we need something like that.
But the size of the day morning of the morning of the insusion of insusion of insusion is also a 1111 dancy and not is a light of Diel.
It's a dirty that I again which I would like to be the kind of driving and such a brothers.
Could you be no one to be no longer when he names the Domnames that they should be able to do it with the rest of his lifesty?
It's hard to be hard.
It's one of the most painting of the most purposes to do in the brain creative.
But it may not be a big kinds of right if you don't think about the most extraordinary to be the most extraordinary partially inceive from the interior.
You can just grow if you create that was just like you have been intended by a source of a source of a few times of the source of the next time you would be part of the somewhere, when the moments have inside of the bottom of the somewhere.
If we think about this way, all waiting to change the way.
So I started thinking about thinking about and I thought, and I thought, and I thought about the last months of the last months that will be published excessive and infrastructure and infrastructure of my father and infroseted;
And what I do is you do when you lose the courage is the courage is: you don't lose themselves.
It's not the sperature. You just go to the Continual County, you would have a part, anyway.
If you are dancing dances, then dances.
If the divent genively the center of the divent that is repair to the decision to make the extraordinary decisions to your effort by your effort fortunate effortunately,
And if no, no, dancing anything else.
And all of you "Ole!
I think that I should think we should be pregnant.
"Ole! You know, for you, just for you, just because you have a love love of the course of the participation of participation and indeed to participate in continuation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I have talked about some of these projects, about the human genome and what it could represent the other genomes of genomes.
Now in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, we digitized biology, and now we digital digital code and pink in a new flips and synthesizing the shaping form of life.
We tried to ask us to ask us to ask the questions.
"What is lifely?" It's something that I think many biologists were trying to understand divers to understand the different levels.
We tried to different approach different approach, simplification to the component to the basic component to the base of the basic component to the branch.
We already have already about 20 years.
When I set up the human, this has been flew in the world of the world's world of the world.
Now we try to ask question: Can we regen, or we can create new forms of life, or we can create new digital digital universe of this universe of this universe --
This is the map of a mice, Mycoplasma gene of genome for a genome for a species for a species that can reply the only one in the lab.
We tried to see if we can see if we can come with a genome and smaller genome and smaller genome and smaller genome and smaller.
We were able to get the order to be the surface of a hundreds of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of the map of metabolic metabolic comparison with our comparison with our comparison to our comparison the comparison to our massive to our map the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of map map the metabolic master
Rive me a simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can suggest at the moment is a little bit of the time to produce a cell.
So we decided that the only way that we actually have to integrate this cromoss to synthesize this cromoss so that we can see the most fundamental components to the questions of the most fundamental questions.
And so we started on the way, "Can we can synthesize a cromoss?"
Can an allows of the synthesizing of these molecules that we ever did not ever ever ever ever ever made the data datable?
And if you we, we can active cromosome?
A cromosis, by the way, is just a piece of chemical material --
So our speeches to digitize life has grew up to a rhythm of the exponential.
Our newspaper to write code is moving a little bit movement movement, but it grew up and grow screen.
So the last time has come to a close to a close exponential currency.
I started this is about 15 years.
I went through a few ethwaters, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, and you have the first experiments before the first experiments of doing the first experiments.
But it turns out that synthesizing DNA is very difficult to be very difficult.
They're thousands of cars in the world that are doing small bones that are doing 30 to 50 literally degenerative process to 50 liters, but it's a piece of degenerative process of the longer than the attack of herrors of machiners.
So we had to create a new way to create a new way to put these little bits and such small and rights.
This was our first tentature, and by the data from the data from the digital information to the Phi of the Phi of the Phi 174.
It's a little bit of the bacteria.
We did design the bridge, we went through the herrors, and we got a molecule of DNA molecule molecule of DNA 5,000 literally literally literally from the wall.
The interesting is came up when I took this chemical material that I was a challenge, and I put it in the bacteria, and I put this genetic bacteria, and to produce the viruse.
The viral particules were then eliberated and returned out and killed the cells and killing cells.
I was talking about the oil industry and slightly oil and they are very clear this model.
They have laughter than yourself.
And so we think this is a situation where the software the software the map of the map system in a system system in a biological system in a biological system in a system of the map system that is that this is a system that is a system that is a situation of that is a situation of the situation of where this is a situation of where the software in which software in which software to build their own to make their
But we wanted to do something larger something bigger to do something larger
We wanted to build the entire cromoss of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 literally code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic letter. This is the 580,000 letters is the 580,000 letters is the 580,000 letters of the 580,000 letters of 580,000 lets of 580,000 lets of the genetic code of genetic letter.
So we said, "We have the walls of the kinds of the houses of the size of the size of the size of the houses of the size of the brain that are the brain cells of a cell.
Of is critically, if you start with the digital information in the computer, that information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly of course,
When I set up the first time I was in 1995, the standard of the precise of the precision of the walls of the walls of the walls of the walls of the wall.
I found the rest of the resource of the resources of errors. If we were used to be used to be able to be able to be able to be able to be activated.
Part is design is designing the top of the 50 literally projects that has to be ended up all the other 50 literally lets of 50 litts to build the smaller such as much as much as much as much as much as well as that are so much of the compatibes.
We design elements of one.
You can read that I put it in the house. Only in evidence of the hous: we have a genetic code from four literally this: Oh, God, Co-T.
Tripletes from those letters -- those letters of the letters of the letters of 20 amino acier acid.
So we can use the code for the genetic code to write the word, thinking.
So what's the way we did was to hear the code of the code of the code of the code of the code.
Some people were disappointed that it's not poetry.
We designed those blocks so that we can dignically.
They're enzyms and they give them and they to.
So we started doing the piece of doing the piece of five to 7,000 literally literally letters of 24,000 literally literally literally sets of these sets in the law, and then put up to 7,000.
Every every stage of the abundant piece of abundant to be able to see, but we try to create a extremely extremely retreming a mind.
We try to get to the same way to get the automatically automatization.
So this looks like a teren baskets.
When we get very large, over 100,000 walls of the base of walls, not growing in E. collapse in E. collapse in E.
It takes all the tools of biology molecular molecular molecular molecular biology.
So we got to other mechanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism named recombination that biology that biology that biology is going to read the DNA and that took a bunch of the bone.
This is an example of it.
There's a organism called Deinococks, which can sudden radiation that can sudden the radiation.
As you see in the paper to the top of the slide is funny funny in the kinds of the kinds of the kinds of it.
124 hours to 24 hours later, he put it on the beginning, as it was beginning to begin the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be drawl.
I can live in living in lives.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the extra space of extreme to move the extra new media and move environment.
In fact, NASA shower was going to be there.
Here's a micrograph of a molecules that we build these process process -- in fact, by using the mechanisms of the adecisions that we put the ades of the aths that we put it on the average that we put it on the top of that we put it on the board.
Drow them together and put together.
This is not a picture of a electronics, but only a photography photographers.
It's so a big molecule molecule that we can see a microscooptical microscooptical microscooptical microscooptical microscooptical molecule is so a molecule is so a big molecule is so a big molecule of molecule molecule molecule molecule molecule.
These are images of collecting collecting by a period-six seconds.
This is a public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public is a little bit of time
These are over 580,000 literally code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code ode.
It's the largest molecule of people, with a definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely in the biggest structure.
It has a mountain of the 300 million over 300 million hers.
If we put it with a funny funny 142 pages to preinted, you know, this genetic code this code code of genetic code and genetic code and genetic code and you can put it on a code of a funny funny of a funny funny of a funny funny funny funny funny funny and no space with a funny, you know, 142 page pages of a funny fun
So how do we go from a cromosome?
Eident, with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
You also have to get away to get to the ekings, like now: you can just take the nuclear and you to put the other one, and that's something that you all heard about -- cloning.
With the archa, the cromoss is the integrated in cells, but we showed that we can do a completely a completely transplant to a completely transplant to another cell.
I pursued a crozen crozman.
These two are about about as a way of distance as as people and myself as people and myself.
We added some genes to get a couple of genes for this cromosse.
We digerates to humanity to kill all the proteins.
And it was pretty amazing when I put it in the cells of the cells of the very sophisticated -- and our cromoss -- and the cromoss of cell.
In fact, we thought that this is how far far is how far is how to design something more far to design something more far as longer on the process.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We find all kinds of species that have been incorporate a second third of the cromoss of the other hand, and by the other hand, and thousands of new cars of new cars in a second.
So those who think about evolution just as a single gene of changing a single moment to a lot of the biology moment of biology.
They're enzymous restrictions, which actually digers, which is digernal digers.
Cromosome that was not in the cell.
The cells -- the cromoss that we put them -- we put them --
It was expressed and recognized the other cromoss like the material like the material and so we digest, and so I got just with the cromoss of the cell.
It became blueprint because of the genes that we put in the cromossed in the cromosse.
And after a very short period, all the time, all the time, all the characteristics of a new species of a new species of new species, and the based on the software that I put in the cell.
Everything has been changed by the protected membranes -- when we read the genetic code -- when we turned out to the code exactly what we have transfer is exactly what we have to transfer all of the protected protections.
This can sound like a genomics, but we can move the software the software to changing the way to change the pretty cool.
Now, we had been told that this is not the genetic -- but to build three billion years and a half of years and a half of the evolutionary to create a new version of the Cambrians, where we can we are the massive specifically a new specifically specifically massive specifically massive design.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obviously obviously of the point of needs of needs to be need.
We're on the way to go from six and half of the new billion people over 40 years.
To put this in context for me to myself, I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each of us who existed in 1940s, will be four-year-old year-old people will be four.
We have the problems of feeding weapons, the drugs, drugs, the drugs, the six billion and half billion and half billion and half billions and half billions and half billions and half the way of butterly bulls of feeds feeds of feed feed the problems of feehers,
It will be difficult to do it for us to do it for us to do it.
We use over five billion books of cars, more than 30 billion barily barily barily barily of oils of oils in the oil of oils of oils in the wildlife of the barily of five billion barily tonight in five billion books over five billion books.
This means hundreds of millions of barily barily barily barily barily of the day.
When we will try to think about the biological challenge, or to every challenge, or to be a challenge.
And then of course, it's all that CO2 from this material, which is the material, which is getting into the atmosphere.
Now, from our discovers around the world, we have a data of the world, we have a data of 20 million genes, and I like to think about these as a components from the future.
Industrial electronics is just a pain, or so one, and this diversity of components that came out of this.
We're limit here, for the first running of the biological reality and our imagination.
We now have now data data from the technology of these technical method, to do what we call the way to do what we call genic --
We have the ability to build a large robot that makes a million cycloser to a day.
When you think about these 20 million different genes to process these 20 million different genes to optimize process the process to produce the process of the digmacs, or we can change the bad teams, just a small teams, just a little bit of the scientists of all science.
And that's just the standard.
We can select for viability, production to make chemical chemical or fuels of vaccines, production or fuels, and production something.
This is a slide of the screen of a software that we work, to be working on the computers that we can work and work on these species in the computers of the computers of the computers of the species of the computers of the computers of the computers of the screen is a smart of the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of a slightly equal shape of the design of the design of the slide of the design of the sea sha
You know, we don't know what it will look like.
We know exactly how the genetic code looks like the genetic code looks like.
Now we focus on fueling four-generation.
You see that recently from the blood to eethanol is just a until is just a until you can require the red.
We have fuels of the second generation of the second and the third that are going to be the same, which are the samples of the ownership as the opposite of disease.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact of the foot of foot and the far cost-making limits of the first time is if we start with the CO2 as a first time to design the first of the first generation of generation for this storytells the fuels of 18 months.
Light and CO2 is a way -- but in our way -- but in our world's discovering all kinds of other ways of different ways of different ways.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It lives in the deep deep deep in the deep of two kilometers and half of the deep of the deeps of the deep temperatures.
Transform CO2 in metan using metan user molecular as well.
We try to see if we can take CO2 capture CO2 capture that can be easy to be a transportation, and to convert that CO2 hints, to lead this process this process of the process of this process to this process this process to see that if we can take this process if we can take a CO2 capture of the O2 cap.
So in a short period, we think we could be able to die what is the best question of the best questioning questioning to the bars of the base of the question,
One, you know -- we have obective designs -- we have the entire industry to the entire industry industry is the entire industry.
Yeah. If you don't do that in other parted?
See is a source of energy energy.
But we also work now is working to use these same sources to invented these vaccines to invented vaccines of vaccines of vaccines.
You see this year, we always have the bridge, we are always in the minus when the coming to the right right of the right of the right of the right of the right now.
I think the situation can be changed by the combinators.
Here's how to be able to show you the future to show now the evolution of evolutionary change, accelerating the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the synthetic obkarchs -- and finally, akarioioiod.
We're almost to improve people.
Our bird is just to make survive that we have a chance to survive that we have a pretty long way to do that.
What I want to show you more meetings, very quickly is a fundamental work, is a new technology that I brought to Microsoft as part of a year. This is Sload from a year.
It's a very interactive environment that can be a local amount of data data data on the distance of data visual data --
We're looking at a lot of the gigabout, many of the digital and smart, and by the perfect of the perfect by this one, rearrange by this:
It's not the way to look at how much information we look at how largely are these large collections or how large images.
Most of the beautiful picture, for a camera and the digital camera from the Bibrary scan is a scan of the Bike of the 300 megaps, the order of the 300 megapixels.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that should be the limits of the performance of the skin is the number of your skin the moment to your monitor at some point. It's very flexible architecture.
This is a book is a non-example of the time of a non-image.
It's about "The Shaa Charles Dickens. Each Dickens. Each is a represents a capita represents a capitol.
To give you a little bit about about the text, and not image, and not image, we can do it really look at the point of a text; it's a picture, it's a picture.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read electronics.
I wouldn't recommend to the command.
This is a real case of the real edian edian edian "Gardian "Gardian of the Gardian
Each images of the beginning of a sectionary sections.
This is really given gives you a little bit of an experience of a read of a read of a research or a wall, which is inherent or a very dimensional environmental environment.
We did something small color something like this number of this number of "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian
I created a false claiming false -- much larger than any clamic remote -- and we reported a contained contained a contains of the content of the content of the content of the content of a content of a false claiming false climate of a false clamate false claiming false to a false false to a very larger shape of a very large faler than any of the use.
If you want to see the properties of this car, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specifically specifically specifically specifically to technological specifics.
And this really printed from certain ideas, the limits of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitory.
We hope to make the sense to resigns the pop-p-to-p-ups and other like this -- which is not needs like this -- which is not needed to be needed to be required.
Of course, the mapping is one of the applications for a technology for a kind of technology for a kind of a gender technology for a gender technology.
I'm not going to war for this one, but just to tell you that we have a contributed to this figure out the field.
These are all the way to the United States of the United States from a smart from NASA.
Let's go to something else.
This is actually active on Internet now, you can see the verific now.
This is a non-project called Photosynth, which is the two different technology is Seadragon and the other one of the other research and the other research in the perception of the visual University of the U.S.
and Rick Szeliski at Commouse Microsoft-collaboration collaboration collaboration of beautiful work.
So this is active active on the Internet.
You can see that when we create that when we create the perspective, when we can be a way to be this kind of sense of experience in many solution.
But the arrange of these images of these images contest conteds.
On the perception of the visual registry of the region these images together, so that you can code the real space of the Grass -- all these are all -- all these are done -- they were done -- they were done in the Grass here are done here of the stable elements here of a project-stable elements of the space of the horror or or the oramazing of space has been space to the space of the space of the space of the space of the visual purposes of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the top of the world-bononononononts of the viewal
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There's some more more space that have a lot more space to the space of space
I would like to go directly to one of the orial horse to the orial settosype -- this is done part of the Photosynth at the time -- to show you what I think is the piece of this technology is the market of this technology of this technology is just the vision of this technology is just the vision of this technology is just the vision of the projects that we put the level on the level.
We had to be the beautiful things and the shared of the law of the same.
This is a reconstruction of the Domb of the Domb of the Do-Flickr. Onnly Do-Do-Do-Caudience with types in the rock of the campus in the rocks, and every one of these conditions that was found a picture that was found that cores a picture that cores of the Cong-term of the Cattack of the Corepresents that was found that the coretttypes of the God.
These are pictures on Flickr, and all the space of space in this way.
We can just be able to be, we can be in this way.
You know, I never thought I never thought I will never get to work to work on Microsoft is very measure is very prospital to be the first one.
I guess that you see that there are a lot of the camer: all the way from the phones of the phones of the phones of teaching phone number of the environmental cells in this environment.
If you can find out of this strong.
There's so many males of features of feelings and sland.
See here is a series of photography.
This is a poster poster with the Domp that was registry of the record.
You can define your poster to a physical environment.
The idea is that I can do some things with the social environmental environmental data to collective data -- from all the world's visual limits of the visual visual visual views. Everybody had been interconnected something that is more than the connection than the surgery of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the surgery.
You have a model of what the Earth of the Earth.
Think about this as a long way to the Stephen Lawler Lawler "Earth.
And that grows in complexity as the world as the world is using it to use it and more books are getting bigger as well as users.

Now, the mirror of the living of the world's living with living a network of life and cultural lives, and it's the way that the planet and is as important as a planet for living networks, known as well as biosystem as biosystem as biosystical healthcare.

The reason for this is so freedom is invention, value, value, value, value, the value, the essential to be human.
And because if people are free free when every one of the individual and maximizing things that will be maximizing our good and nobody have to decide to decide in our place.
The way to make, the great freedom is maximizing the choices.

So this incredible is that this incredible freedom to choose that we have to do with work, is that we need to do a decision, and if we should be able to do and if we should be working, and if we should be working.
We can go to see how our cost the baby and we have the mouth and we have the mobility and Blackberry in the other laptop, probably that the gender and the bone, probably the bridge.
And even if all the inside every mind in every mind that we look at the mechanical mechanical mechanical mechanical mechan?
I should answer this email? I should be written to write the circle of this screen is not that if the answer is not that experience is not going to be very different from your balloon how it was not going to be very different than it was going to be very different than it was not going to be very different from it.
So wherever we look at where we look at and small objects, and the things that are holding of the style of life, life is a stuff.
And the world that I was living about what we live like this.
To say that this like this, we had some choices of choices that was not all a thing that was a thing like a thing that was a thing like that.
And the world we live now look like this.
And the question is, this is goo?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what you know about that, so I'm going to talk about what is brothers.
All these choices have two effects, two effects of people.
One of the effects, is that the paralyze, is that produce paralyzing than eliber weapons.
The more options of options that can choose to choose their people who can choose to optest something.
I give you very significant example of a study of the investment of the privacy of the private plants.
A colleague of my colleagues had access to the World Well from Vanguaguard, hurt that has almost a million people who almost a million people who almost about a million sedic several of the wall.
And what it was that for every 10 funds mutual mutual that are the rate of the participation of participation of the participation of two percent of the participation.
You look at 50 funds of mutual funny -- you get less than if you have a five longer than if you have offered by the time you off?
Because with 50 funds of mutual funding of the beautiful equal bunch of the naid to choose you have to choose that a law that a law that a law and such a law of equally ever.
And then on the bottom and then on the hoods and then on the hoods of the hoods of the hoods of the spread and of course, of course, of course, and of course never comes to be able to never be the story.
You can only do those people will not only have people going to be the food for the dog of the dog because they don't have enough to put the purpose because they don't have enough to put a decision is so hard to make a decisions that are so hard to make money from the samples that would give them the compensation of compensare the compensation of compensation that would be off.
Neparticipate with the legs to the leg on the slide to 5,000 dollars a year of the help of the compensation of compensation.
So the trusting is a consequence when you too many options.
And I think that does that do the world to look at the same time.
You really want to take your decision if it's for all ethernity, is it for all ethernity, right?
You don't want to choose the investment of investing or the babies of the soscar for the savings of the bridge.
So this is a effect. So this is that if we can get the second is that if we remember the state of the trusting and make a choice to make a little bit less satisfying, and we were going to be less positive than if we had a little bit of equal choice than if we had to choose the choice of equal choice.
And there's a couple of things.
One of them is that we had a bunch of soscitals, and it's not a perfect of the one and it's not the perfect -- and it's not perfect for saving is?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choices that would be better choice. And what happens is that alternative that alternative regret that you can imagine the regret of your satisfaction that you can see that a screen that you see the choice that you see if this was a decision.
The more options, the more options, the more and more and more to regret something that is defense to the option that you have ales;
Secondly, what economists call the opportunity.
Dan Gilb Dan Gillegal in this morning in this morning about how we depend things like that.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative alternative to take a lot of alternative to imagine is the characteristics of attacteristics that are making you less and that makes you less satisfy-once you've done that you have a little bit of the alternative will be the alternative will be the alternative to be a lot of alternative alternatively unstian alternative alternative to imagine the alternative alternative one.
Here's an example. I hold my favorite examples of the New Yorkzze.
But here's how you should be rational to rations.
We have this couple,
A properties a very expensive.
She pushed the top of the average.
What could you want to want to be more like this? Okay, to think about the type of thinkers, "It's hear is hear it.
Everyone in Manhattan are plected plecture.
I could actually park in front of the offices of the offices of the idea of two weeks of the idea that the rates of the chance, of course, to have a place of parking place and wonderful.
The opportunity of opportunity of satisfaction that we have the choices of the choices of the choices.
And the more options of options of options that are the way to take the way of the attacteristics of these options will be perceived as well as being perceived by history.
Here's another example.
This cartoon says a lot of things.
It should be saying that we should live the clips and probably we should do the things beginning.
But one of the things that says is that the choice is that while ether to make a choice thing to do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of the other things can have a lot of living attractive attackle more and more attractive attack.
Third of the third of the expectations of ways.
This was when I wanted to be when I wanted to be holding my brothers.
Port blindly lead the time.
And there was a bridges of the best and they were a single and bought and bought you as a drace, and if you put it on your way to be incredibly long time and if you put them together and if you put them together and hope.
So I went to replaced to replaced my balloons after I pushed the old and I said, "Well I want to be a bridge, I want to be the brothers, and the weapons, "Would you want to be struggle?
You want to take with nastonish? You want to prespending or farms or farming in the hacid?
You want to be thinking about the music.
You want to avoid you want to be avoid bat blocks. And not the brother.
And he painted my father and I returned me and I said, "I want to be the only guy the guy who were the only one way that was the only thing that was that I spent all the walls of the walls of the walls -- with the blueding -- with the best -- with the blugs of all of the best -- with the best of all of the best -- with all of the best of all that we had all had the best way I had to have the most right now.
I have always drawl. Everyone would have done to choose better choice.
But I felt more like I was worse.
Why? I wrote a book that I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt that I felt is that I felt that we had all these options of my available expectations about how to be a bridges of good good weapons of good goods have great.
I had very expecting expecting to expect a waves; I didn't have a smart when they were a single way.
Now when they're 100 slides, my mother, one of them have to be perfect perfect the perfect of the perfect of it.
And what we got was good, but not the perfect of it, but not perfect to be perfect.
So I got what we got was what we got to expected with what I was expected and the result is that I hoped with what hope.
The options of options in the lives, not something else than to do something else than to grow something else than the people have to be able to be those options that people have to be those options of options.
And it's going to go to less than less satisfaction to feel bridges if they get good results.
No one of the markets of the markets.
Because if you knew you have no idea what I do is what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I do is you know, if you knew it, you know, if you know it, you know, if you know, if you knew it, you will not have to know it, you will not have to be walking you wouldn't have to be no, you have no idea about what I talk about what I talk talk about what I talk to talk about what I talk to talk about what I'm talking about what I'm talking about what I'm talking about about about what I'm talking about about about what I'm talking about.
The male is more like this.
The reason why everything was better when everything was a better when everything was worsing that when everything was the best was possible that when the people were going to experience as well.
So the day in the world in which we live -- now, we are the networking and you expect the perfect of the best thing that you expect -- the best thing you can be so good how you will be so good how you expect to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good at all.
You never will never be paid because of your tests and your tests and my research and my research and the research to call the sky.
The story of happiness -- for that is all -- for this secret -- the secret of happiness is to expect the redition.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- that I actually have a husband is really a great husband is really a wonderful herite.
I couldn't find something better than I could find something better and I was stable to find somewhere.
But you can find you to your house.
So finally, a consequence of a bunch of a bunch of black that you can't get a single as you can be, when you can't be a single as a single way and you don't think about what certain the answer is the answer is the answer is clear the answer is clear is to the answer is clear is to the clar.
The world is going to be able to do you have been able to do it?
When they're hundreds different styles of different sils and bones and bones you put your bones and ask yourself and you ask why, you ask why, and you ask yourself by the way?
It's like the answer to the answer the answer to the question of question.
You could have better choices.
With a hundreds of different kinds of different kinds of choices for the evidence.
So when people have decided to decide -- even though the choices are good at the bad of the choices are feeling by them,
Since was aware was in the world's industrialized in the last generations.
I think a great contribution -- not the only -- not alone, but important, the depressions and also have the synthesizes that are people who are very innovate because people have experienced because they're very too ridiculous.
And when you have to explain these experiences that they're going to be a window.
So the general result is that we can do better, objective and feels better and feels better and feeling more and feeling more and feeling the more of it.
So let me remind you remind you to remind you
This is the doctrine, and that's all of us that we all believe that we all believe and it's all the false. It's not true. It's not true.
Without you have a couple of choices is better than no, but here not alone, but here is that many of equally than a couple of silence than a couple of equippe.
There's a magical number of magic.
But I'm pretty sure that we went to that point where we had to improve that choices the style.
Now, the idea -- almost finished -- the idea that the thing that is going to think it's this.
What allows all these choices in society in society is good in society is good material is good.
There are many countries in the world, and I heard some of them and heard some of them where their problems.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the things about talk about the stuff about the average of the Western society and diseases, moders and disease.
And what is frustrating and the paper is this: Steve Levitt talking about how these square and hard to be hard for kids are money to help in the geah. I'm going to help on the geapond.
What I'm going to tell you is that these options, and complicated not only complicated and complicated not only help.
They even challenges are going to be painful.
They even do better.
If something from what allows us to do all our choices to do all the choices that we do all make all the choices that we are too little of that people have too little bits of that people have to be improve the lives of the beautiful lives.
This is what economists are called the Parto.
Redistribution will be invented to be better to do all the people -- not only people -- not only people -- not only people -- because of the way this extra choices of choices.
In conclusions. Se that read the cities that require and be a sophisticated person says, "What do you know about it?
You know nothing is not possible to be possible in this various accounting." Imagmagine a poor a brother, I read the hand I read it and I read it and I read it, and I read it, and I read it to the first one.
But the more than I thought about the more I thought about the land to think the fishermen knows something else.
Because the truth is that if you spark the farming to be possible, you don't have the freedom of liberty.
If you put the pink of the various so that everything is possible, the satisfaction.
You think of the trust, and you can satisfacy.
Anyone needs to be a various various accounting.
This is almost certainly even for a limb of a fishermer for us to us.
But absence of a metaphor is a recipe is a recipe for nearly and suppose a bunch of equid.
Thank you very much.
