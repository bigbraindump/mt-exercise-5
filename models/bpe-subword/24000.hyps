And the third of these two diaffects to demonstrate the demonstrate of the polar polar that the majority of the last three million years of the last three million years of the four percent of the four percent of the large state four percent of the four percent of the large state of the four percent of the four percent of the four percent of the four percent of the square with 48 percent of the second.
But this morning, this special problems that the special problem because not the farmer.
The polline polar is that the heart of the heart that the broken the global system.
She was extended and contracts and contract.
The mass of the diaffect that you would show you a faster will be a quickly on what was intampled in the last 25 years.

This is the ancestor on the line of the time.
And it goes the window of the window

In 25 years of this year, at this time.
This is a problem because the challenge of the deep of the death of the article on the oceans.
where it is a massive measurement, when it comes out that it is transformed in the metan micro-organisms.
The pollution of the pollution of the time, the global income, the global incomes in the atmosphere we could go to the extremely the extremely extremely extremely affected this point of extreme that point of extreme with the point of the pollution.
Only in certain a certain the Alaska metand, the metal metaphor the water of the water.
The Kater Kater Walter from the University of Alaska was on the other side of the team of the death.
Here you go. OK, you have the question of the question is the question is dacross us is the dacross us is the daction.
And a reason is that this enormous enormous income, "Groenland in the northern of the north.
This is a rich rate of the year.
But the volumes are much more store.
This is the Kangerlusion in the Groenlanded.
If you want to know how you create the large levels of the large on the market on the market on the market where it goes es to the massive in the massive in the massive of the massive in the massive to you want to know whether you want to know how you get you to want to stop you want to know how you want to know how you create the stick of you want to stop the st
These debate creeps very quickly.

But when it turns out and water and water and water water.
In California was a 40 percent of the fourth of the sland in the Sierra.
This affect today the reserve of water water.
And the predictions, so I'm read about what you want to read it.
On the global land the global rest has been going to get the incentive.
And the disaster all the global labeled over the global rate of the extraordinary range and the far.
Four times more in the last 30 years ago, the 75 years of the 70-year-old terrible ft.
This is a shape of absolutely uncomfortable.
If you look at the context of the context of what it is happening.
In the last five years we add 70 million tones of the dioxides of the books every day, 25 million tones in every day the oceans.
The one of the window of the Pacific issue from America, and every part of the subcontinent on where the subcontinent where the opportunity where the oxygen, and every one radics of oxygen oxygen.

The trolls is a problem and the most serious problem is the most serious.
The United States is one of the two mastery of Chinese China.
And the proposal to build more fabrics for a lot of fabrics.
But we start to see a change.
Here are the last year, the last year, the last year, with the proper proper prop.
All the political policy in our country.
And the industry carbon and the farmers of the farmers a farmers of the last year, the last year of the last year.
The promote carbon what is a cool of what is a oximoron.
This image you remember something.
In the report Cracia, at least in Tennessed, a billion galogyms of stery stery's imprise.
You probably see the stird of the stird.
This is all the works, the second deverse, two deversation in the South America to the Cracium Cracia.
One of the building industry of carbon the bottle, the one of the Cracium of the Cracium was this.
Video: Okay: Oh with carb, is a flet of the far.
This is the abundance of America, here in America, and help the economic growth the economic growth.
Frostom, the book, it becomes more than the right day where we go to the right now.
It is accessible and adorably adorably and workers of pasting the slugates of silence.
Al Gore: This is the most surface of the window in Virgin.
The large on the largest degrees of Massy Coal.
Video: Don Blankend: I want to be clar. I want to be clar. I want to be a Pelose, Harry Reight Reight Reid Reiddy.
Al Gore: So the Aliant for the Climate for the second Climate the second campaign.
This is one of them, a part of them on one of them.
Video: ALergy COALergy new art of a very serious to make very serious to make our business to do our business to make our business to do our business to do it.
That's why we are our principle, the principle is to spend a big deal of a money to help us us look at the bottom.
The thing is that the books is not the carbon is not dirty the bad of it.
We think that it's the flight -- and moving the mountains.
So it will not be driving to change the climate climate change the climate change the climate of change.
Later you do it in our lives.
Video: The inne: Cargood at a point of him.
So let's do you do a test of this cooky of this cooky of the carbon the bottom.
High! Masinary.
But this is the sound technology of the carbon the bottom.
And while the carbon is one of the principles of the incoming out of global income.
So this is going to this: this is technology is technology of today.
Al Gore: In the sware of the positive of positive to the economic challenge of the security of the security of the national problems.
Video: Narator: Narrator: the national economy, the security of climate climate climate climate climate climate climate climate climate climate the climate of Videoice.
The myself that leager all the way to be a fuel of the fuel bone: the carbon the bottom, the carbon stretch.
But now we have a new solution to the new innovation to the involvement to the incurators of incurators.
The energy energy of American electricity in the 10 years ago, over 10 years ago, over 10 years ago.
A plan to the past of the street in the way, and the opportunity to help us to help the stopping of global initial income.
In the shape that is a big solution that is a big solution to help us solve our problems.
The American energy energy America.
Al Gore: This is the last last year.
Video: Narator: It's about re-energy energy re-energy.
One of the faster to the faster to initially initially dependent on the fuel of the fuel of the Barband is the Barband is the energy is here on the energy is the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy.
Barbed nr.2: We get the shares to create the well-brother and well.
Narrator: The American energy of America. It's time for active.
Al Gore: There is a fear of a defrict of the African that you want to go to go to the bad of wilds."
If you want to get you to get the far, you go to the well.
We need to get fast, faster fast.
Thank you very much.
The next year at TED I did a walk to LHC.
And we got to get to the window a data on how it works on how it works to the water of this apart.
So the fish. And the most people who were not here, LHC is the most experiment is the most experiment that was the most experiment that was incoming to the 27 kilometers to the Street or is to be concrete a far to a far billion dollars to create a billion dollars on a billion of the universe -- the sequencing of the universe -- the universe -- the second.
It's extremely ambitious.
This is the water of Geneath Den.
We put photos of these mines "Big Bangs" in the interior of the decades.
I work on this one. It's the number of ATLS -- Lake -- Lunger -- Lunger -- the diameter of 22 meters of the ATALS photos here to be seeing the ATALS to build the proportions.
At 10 sequence I got the third of the last last for the first time.
And this image was made by ATLAS.
It became a huge car a huge of control.
It's a picture of the first fashion the particle of the particles that the trading system that the system in LHC, the LHC, the deliberate of LHCC in LHC deliberath determined in the LHC particles.
In other words, when I wanted that image that image that image that image that the water that the water that is a successful of the successful work, which is a successful successful for the successful thing.
I don't know that that it was the largest over, or the largest over, when someone else on the page, and he had the first page.
It means that I did a cultural impact of the street impact.
After about a seven seven a saptarana with the art of the water -- these fish-air, which was actually making these fish.
These physics of 13 miles of both of the bottom.
Now, the engineers in the room and says, "I can't translate the myself. They're not transport."
But I can do that for that when I'm on the temperatures becoming what the stage is the super-super-super-super-suggest.
So as a 271 degrees more hope of the stories of standing of the stories of the stories of the stories of the works.
One of one of the other of the other of the 10,000 define in LHC, was a fabricatic fabricative.
So that the computer has has been a little bit of the 13-mile one-driving electricity.
This was the result of it.
This is more impressive to the respect of the stone, and they have a 30 percent of the other 20 tones, and they have 30 to 30 to 30 to 30 to 30 to 30 to 30 to 30 ways.
So we determined by 50 deteriors to 50 stream.
We had to take them to the affect that we were doing.
I reconditioned all the top of the top of it.
And now we go back to the street back in the subteran.
The line of the market on the market of LHC will be as a new thing.
We're going to go to the purpose to see us in the iddle or hydropping to the research to the research to the universe that are the elemental to be the universe that are the elemental elementary to be the affected to the universe of the universe is going to go to the wear of the bear.
Now, of course, as a kind of a sense of accidentists of recognizing about the extremely important engineering to read the extremely deliver to read it.
I think that the fact that this is that this is attention of difficult to be the real of the fact that we have a lot of the experiments like LHC.
I'm going to be the word that the words of a stify of a British Davy, Humphing Davy, I think that the insite of the protect of the protect of the protect of the protect of the protect of the minimum is not performing the minimum of minimum is not performing our minimum for the minimum of the minimum is not the best consumption of the world, as we are not the best worse of the world,
Thank you.
I want to start to start with the ramination to remember the children will remember.
On the mass of what you have to go to the ridicates and get them to the square themselves, actually invented how to do it and solve the issue of issue issue and the relationships and the relationships.
The space is the space is the project of how we understand a lot of what we are concerned about the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the inconnection.
So as a common research, and I can research the Internet of the interactive -- the inspiders of the physical objects -- my collaboratory -- my collaboratory -- I started to go back to the collaboratory -- I would be able to get a computer and we can use a computer to the computer, and we can use a computer to a computer and a common the digital data, we would be a farrived,
So what do we want to do we want to walk right?
The question was this fascinating fascinating to figure out what I decided to do the Siftable.
At a Sift Sift is a great computer is a bished.
They can be manufactures, I can perceive the rest of the other one, and a perceiving and a ran and a deep rate network.
The most important is that there are the palpable of the palphas, you can only the water you can only watch it up.
And Sift example, we have the evidence of a new instrument of digital information of digital information.
On the masss that these instrument flower fish of the other of the other other other other other other other other other other other other other people on the other other other people, and we can inities the other other and new connections, we can inceive to explore new interactions.
I'm going to start with a few examples.
This Sift is configuring is to predict to predict the video of a video in a direction, the rule of the philosophy in the other hand, running in the other hand, running of the parks.
These are the interactive of the other of other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other people's coming to the past of the pasts of the pasts of the pasts of the pasting of the pasting of the past-in-interactive interactive
So, if you put them on them together in another one, it becomes interested in the interest.
If I'm inconjected to the contain and that, and I can become confusion.
You can feel the miss and inclining and incline.
We realized that one of the interesting of interactive interactive interactive is that we can use the gestures of inside, how would it be able to be able to a culture how we could be able to a license.
In the case, we have three Sift configuring as a galeous and you can use them to be able to hold them in the center where they will be on the center where they will remember.
If I was too much too much to be a lot of inath.
There's also the possibility of the opportunity for education, as we would be played by the language and the humans to be able to do the possibility to see things that are researching to see the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the possibility of the possibility
So here -- this is a slide Fibonacibonacium with a simple program.
Here we have a game of the word of combination to Scrabs and Bogging and Bogger and Boggll.
every single one of the first first one at the intimate of the Siftable, and on the measure that you try to form the ftable, are verify with a dictionary.
Then the next time you get 30 seconds of seconds to the letter of the test, and you have a new smart and we can be able to recognize and new ways of incisions of research.
Thank you.
These are the children who came to the trees that have come to the Media, and I had to get them to the movie, and I had to take a film to the film to move a material that and moving a material that and moving a material that
It lots of love to the news.
And one of the interesting of this interesting application of this kind of application is not to give them a lot of instruction.
All right, "For is "For the Free," and they know what to do.
Here are other people are going to get a few people are trying to get it.
This is the most tanar there, our far in the right, play in the right.
It seems like that he wanted to do it was to do was to get one of the one of the other one of the other one of the other one.
So for he was just to hear the work.
This is a applicator across the animation of animating.
We wanted to build a instrument for the language.
And this is Felix.
He can go new person, the character, just the site of the Sift of the Sift that affects the characters.
Here is the so-west soar.
Video: Stypes of it.
David Merry a track of the scene.
Video: The second common the bear.
Good well! Yeah!
Siftable, and Siftask and a language of the characters to interact -- Video: Ham!
DM: I think the narrative.
Video: Okay!
DM: It's a story of the final open open as it will open the way it will open the bad of what it would be draw of what it would be fashioned to the fashion DMMM: DMM: DMM: DMM: DMM: DM:
Video: The fish.
DM: The next example I showed you for the time to look at the time, is a live and interpretated and interpretated music that I built the music that I built the role and in which Sift and all the role and all the role and all the role and all the role and all the role and all the role and all the role and the wheelchair.
Each of this four different various various various various you, you want to use it.
And you can inject the sound of the sound that you can asask you can asask what you want to do.
You get the sound sound the sound of the sound of a sound Sift-up of a successful success.
There is the effective that you can control the live and philosophy and filter.
Is a a certain a certain a certain the a-held inclue.
The second effects of the general effects like the floor of the square the intugs of sequences.
Video: DM: Well we will start with a second Sift in the second successful of success, we argue in a series, a floor more and more available to a lot of the south.
Now a line line.
Video: Yeah, I put a little bit of the period.
Video: And now now I'm going to bring the film to the movie, to control the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the lives.
Video: You're going to be the intuition of the second inclining in a part or someone in a part or someone else.
Video: Yeah, I'm going to move the far to move the expression for a lot of the expression.
Video: You're going to read the second time as a while as a canta.
So you don't need to do the planet in presentially improvise, I can improve the melodia in the work.
Now, in the sfars; I can get intretree the second of the second Sift of the volume, inclined in the stangle in the stangle in the stangle in the statement.
Thank you.
As you see my passion is my brain is creating new interface, the computers that are deeply that works that works.
And today, we had time to show you a coordination of this new space of design, and a few of designs that I wanted to give them out of the lab.
The one that I would have the retype is that we are at the granted to this new generation with this new generator of the digital instrument with the digital digital research in our world of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules that will ads the rules.
Thank you very much.
September with the nerve you to talk to you with you,
I'm a written
It wrote book, but I mean, but it is more than that.
It's all my mom and fascinating.
And it doesn't that this this is to change that this is to change it.
But this is that I said, something that I was intampled in my life, and in my book and in my own book, which I deliver my own inside of the line in the way.
And the thing I wrote is that I wrote this car, this book, this car, Rosia "Mandeeply Rosia deeply of my book, whether the mouth of my bottoms of my bottom, and he became the world, and it became this important sense.
The research is that everywhere I go now, people are going to go to the condamnature.
Seriors -- driver, condamness.
At example, and you have to improve and improve you would not be themselves to be depassed that you could never be depassed to be performance this?
You don't have it as you will continue to walk to write the dead of the far of the far that would be able to make the world a book that would be the world?"
It's very lints, in fact, from the true.
But it would be more running not, you know, I don't mean that 20 years ago, when I was a big standing when I was a great standing -- when I was described to become a writer -- I want to become a kind of reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive kind of reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive fuding the same time.
And people said "Not that you have never have to be more successful for success?"
I don't don't mean that the balance will knew ideas will kill you would knew ide?
You don't have the fear that you will be the fear of the street and no own, and nothing to deads on a death, and you will not be deads on a farming of the screen of the middle of the middle of the mas?"
Something that is that the gene.
The line -- the rack of the question of the question of the questions is "Yes."
Yes, you know, it's a themselves.
And always he sat me photograph.
And it is in the flight of the things that people don't get a lot of other things that people can't inture.
As example, the large things that are infrastructure that are infrastructure of the infrastructure
But when it goes to write the word that I was all working on and I was all the the last time I was ""Why?"
Is something rational ration?
It's the logical logs to be thrown to be themselves to be pretty much like this was pretty that was pretty much to do it on this Pamant.
And what is that specific initiatively creative that seems like the non-driving produced to the provide in a way that other teachers are not doing a kind of a kind of busines?
Tato me, for example, was the inchemist and not improve that in the 40 years of the 40 years of the inery of the inery of the chemistry of the chemistry of the inchemistry of the inchemistry of the inch.
It was not -- John, John, how do it go to the block of the eye?
It just just not just the right is not intampling whatever it is.
But to be able to be a chemistry of chemistry that group not too chemistry of the seconds.
We have the insite writers have this remarkable remarkable reported to all the site of all the site of all the samples of all the slide of being powerful to be powerful to be powerful to be powerful to be powerful.
And everything we have to look at the number of the dead deads of the dead of the deads of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the brain dignosed and deal with the money and deal with the product and open.
And even though that they have a whole thing that was not to be really far to be really far to be the provide of the provide of the own own ways.
Norman Mail, even the beginning of diseases, he said that "Fif, he had a little bit more like "Every long."
A great extraordinary of the work of the work of work on the work.
But it doesn't macain when we hear it on someone day-up because I heard of that I heard of things that I have absorsorbed and accepting the complex and accepting and suffering the farmers of the creative and the inherent of a massive insight of a long inside.
And the question I want to add today today today is you are them?
You are comfortable to the comfortable of the light of how the light of the living of the living of the living with this ippost.
I think it's odiodiodiodi.
And I also think it's dangerous and not going to be a person to see the future.
I think it's better if we including our artists artists to truly the traditions.
And I know the sure of that, in my case, in my case, in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to try and get to start to start to try and get the card on this paintings of this data that I find out the tests that are now at the time.
As for example, I'm just pretty example, just a 40 years.
I have probably insight as four decades before the works.
And it's very probably that everything I wrote with this moment to be judging the mountains of my own own own state as a long way of the last money success of my last character?
What would you be saying is the measure, because of us are all the way of us are alreading the most successful -- it's really probably the largest successful as the most successful to be intampled to be intampled to be intampled to be intamed to be indeed to be a great successful to be a lot of people would be able to tell you the foreign it would be a far to be the shape of the sourselves.
Oh, Does you good.
This is the gene of garden, which could make someone to the bridge of the 9th of the 99 morning, and I don't want to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person could do that person could do that person is that the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene gene gene of the gene of games could make it on the shape someone could do someone else to make that person at the one who could do it on the run to make that person to make it on the person
I think about this message to do this message that I love it.
And then, the question becoming question?
And so I put a lot of my mother movement, like manify right now, as I have to work on the way to go to the build a kind of building a kind of building a kind of building a kind of building that building a kind of building a kind of building that we are going to be able to build a kind of a fudge of my own story,
You have to be able to give a kind of fuel a way to be a deep deal of the future, and the physics that will be solved in the law of the law that will be able to what it would be able to what it would be able to the wheelchair.
And as I was all in the last year of this sense of the last year, I started to get the time to go to the other society to see other society would be a better society could be a better ideas and more than how to be able to be better ideas that people are creative, and the more likely to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to creativity.
The rest was this in Greeccient and Romantic Romantic Romantic Romantic Romantic Romantic Romantic Romantic Romantic recient me that was the recircle this was the recipe that this was a recircle of this was a recircle this was in Greek in this way's this was in Greection in Greection in Greecond.
So the surface of the extra remains of the inch.
But in fact, Greator Roms and Roms and Roms that people don't think that the creativity of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interior of the time,
People thought that creativity was a spirit of the people who are potentially going to be department in a fourth of the reasons, from a funny and needs and needs and needs and needs to be able to the needs of course and humans think about the insights of people think of the people who have the people thought that creatiatiatiativity was a creative of people think that creatiativity was a creative spire that creatiatiativity was a creative spired democratic creatiatiativity of the growth of
The name was called these these spiring divity creativity of creativity, "I walk."
Socrats was the fact that it has a demon that has transmitted the square in the departs.
The same shares were the same paintings, but they call that spirit creative, genius of the genius of the genius of the genius.
What is the wonderful is the wonderful thing that a genius was not a very much individual genius was a very very quickly.
I think that a genius was a kind of a deep death, which is a cheap of the window of the artist, the deep of the house of the house of the house and insession and insession and insession and insession of the works.
Absolutely staled -- this is this is the distance of the psychological degrees that we can protect the result of the works.
And everything that the world is working, right?
So the artist of the years, as a certain things, like a lot of things like this?
If you could have the strallow, you don't have the strallows to the world all the worker of the world that we helped us that they helped them that helped them to help that helped them to help that helped them to help that he helped it to help the works.
If the work was criticized criticized the wind?
All the world that the genius was just like ignorant.
So they look at the West creativity of the period-period.
Then Rast, and it was all changed and everything has changed the master of ideas of the mammmyself to the universe as individual in the universe and the mysters, the mystical rest from the grounds that the first creatures.
It was the human beings of human rational rational and people have began to creativity as the creativity of the interior of the individual interior.
And for the first storage people have started to be refer to one or one of the artist, or one of the gene of the gene gene genuine that is to have a gene genius.
And you need to have a huge of a huge person I did a huge error.
Permite, a simple person to create the person is actually create that it is actually the receptable and the surface and the surface and the source of mystery and the source of the mystery is a lot of the mystery is a lot of the sackers.
It's like you would have a few you to get a few hitting to help the so-
It just simply invoidle and deforms of evidence of all these today inimages all of these inimaginable inimaginable inimaginable inimaginable inside.
I think that the president of artists one of the last 500 years of the last 500 years.
And if you think about is true, and I think is, the question is: what do you do now?
Can we do things like this?
Maybe we can go to the sensources more various and the mystery of the people and the mystery of the creative creativity.
It can be not.
Maybe we can not just stering to stering 500 years of thinking about the rational rational rational discuss of a 18 minutes.
And probably the people in public public public public means that the question of the question, the deep standing on the test, the people in fact, that people are in fact, and they surprising their own parts and their surface and their shapes.
It probably will not be cooperating all on all of this idea.
But the question I want to put it -- why do you don't mean -- why do you not?
Why don't we think about that?
Because it has the sense of the sense of something else as any other completely explaining what the completely completely completely of creatic processing the process of creatic process.
The process that anyone else of the time -- you know, everybody -- you know, everybody -- you know, everybody -- you know, the beginning of the inside.
And in fact, sometimes can put the anormous anormal.
I had a bunch where I met a extraordinary of American extraordinary American Ruth Stone, which now has been in the 10-year-old and that it was the story, and that was the storage of the storage of the storage of the works, and that he was just a simple root in the West and it was just a simple root in the ropp.
The story was like a fish of the tunger shape.
And it turns out that over the rops.
The feeling the feeling the fish of the painting-on the painting.
In that moment that has a single thing that has to do to do it," and I read the water that water as a wheel."
And alerging as as the water of the large person and the past of the ideas was to get a piece of the map of the map of the faster and a faster and a faster and a firefer and to get the past and to give the one of the past and to give the past and to get the past and the past of the water and to get the water.
Sometimes not enough to be faster as a white and alerg, but not the game, but not the window in the house and the poems of the loss of the loss of the loss of the roog, a whole rooken on the ropps, a whole steel "another rop," a poet."
They were in which -- and the point of -- and the one one of the story -- the lost that almost like the loss.
Other acades, the map of the maps and the poems and the water and the water and the story of the exact of the exact of the top of the other and the story of the other and the story of the other and the story of the other and the surface and the principle.
The person of coads and the trage, and the tree of the masss on the mass of what the masss of the massive moving the masss of the masssive of the masssive the first of the masss of the cool of the first cool of cool the first of the cool of coads of cool the cock of coad.
So in this situation, the poems of the map of the perfect and intack at the last to the first first of the first one.
When I heard -- it's the surprising is exactly how it works that works.
My creatic creatively not limited to this -- I'm not going to leave it -- I'm not going to get the wind!
I'm a deeply that I worked on the way to go to the same and track and to try and translate the same and to get the street and to go to the street and to sleep.
But even though I actually mean, I was so far as I was so fence that phenomenon.
And I have imaged that was as a lot of you were and a lot of you would have a lot of you do.
I had a project or ideas that had designed me to be a sure that I would not know that I don't know what it would not know to be identify of being a identified in the field.
And what do you always this?
And how do we have to do that we should report us do not works, so we don't lose our mind, you know, to help us to help us ramand,
For me, the most relevant of our days, which we are about how we can do is is is the musician to do is is a musician to a few years ago, in the revider of the revidence of the revidence of the revidence of the revior.
I was talking about this suggesting was almost everything was almost everything was almost everything to be the contemporary artist, to give them and to control and control and control and figure out the impulse of the completely comfortable and running the completely coming to create these completely inabsolutely coming out of the completely coming to the completely coming to the completely coming to the top of the completely commonly coming to the
The time the line of the line line, and you have the story of the story that is the conduct on the Los Angeles and then everything has changed the whole thing has changed the change.
While one of the time I hear a fragt of a deep fragment that would be in the mind of the mind of the deep death, and the airplane and the split with inspiring and a split is not to get a bridge and a wheelchair, but it has no long, but it has no long-term water.
It has no photography, it has no creations, no matter has no matter.
So the one feeling that the deep deaths of the deep inside the "I'm going to lose the time to lose the money, and can, and the money.
I'm not enough to be a good enough to remember.
And instead of the paintings, it just got to be over.
It has the intuition of the process and we all do something with all of us.
He was the watching of the deep and said, "You don't see that I'm not going to be volcancer like this volcancer volcance?"
"Do you can put a cancer in a canted?
If you really want to be truly to be inside a longer moment in a little bit more than you can go to the bad of you.
If you don't have any of you and write on the other one.
Don't be able to deranjy Leonard Cohen."
The process of design design, it changed this.
Not the opera, it has continued to be deeply as intun.
But the process, and the tragnostics around the agnostick around the time he had been taken in that he had the hope that he saw it in the room that he had to get it and he had to get it to the today and then he realized it has to be something that they have to be something that they don't have to be something that they don't have to be inspired and Chinese and gotten by the interiorize and gotten by the way.
It could be this collaboration and bized the mind of a conversation of a conversation of the exterior of the exteriority that I was that I never was that Tom.
After the story of the story of the way I was working on a little bit of a whole wheelchair that I had a data.
This is what I had had the labeled when I was at the middle of "Manca, Roddynam, and I have the kind of a kind of like a kind of a kind of a while I was not going to be in a kind of a little bit of that couple of course that we are not going to be the most product that it will be the most product that will be the most product that it will be the most product.
Not just provide this is the most coming to the best write.
I would think about what I should be able to do is just like to abandoned the project.
And I remember my space on all the space of open and I was asked and I got a bad and I was asked and I was a home.
I was a ridiculous, and I brought me and I brought a combination of a room.
I said to you with your voice and you would take the blood and you'll stop it is not just the screen is not just the extraordinary will not only be the extraordinary will be the wind?
Because you can see you can see that I one at the landscape, and more than it is not to go to the her.
So if you want to be better than you want to be more attention, you have to do the water and you have the floor of the flow.
OK. And if you don't want to do that, you know, the street from the naid to all of it.
I'll have to write because this is my message for my message.
And I want to consumption for today I did my park on my do."
Because -- the -- the conclusion -- with hundreds of years ago, in the North African to be able to shape the people are trying to sleep in the dancing music and music and the music and music and the museumb.
And they were always wonder, because of the death and they were teaching and they were the remarkable of the remarkable of the remarks?
But sometimes very running, and one of the interpret of really interpret with really coming out of the come.
I'm convinced that I all stick to what I want to do you all see all the vazine of all the interpretation of interpretation of interpretty interpretation.
It's like time the time the stop is the proper is the very sick is not doing nothing is do nothing differently-driving other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series are otherwise to the other 1,000 series of the other other 1,000 series are others.
One time it was not going to be in the trick.
It's the world of the world of interior and light is the amazing of diving.
As the time, when they were intamples people have stuck that was and they said to the name called
And I have the mammmachines and incept to the "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Doamn, Doamn, Dog, Dogamnes."
It's God.

In Spain, when a coming interpret and magic myself and magic myols, Allah, Allah, the Allah, the Fif, the farmers of the wall."
The intelligent -- a God.
It's wonderful, because we need to have to have the same thing.
But the second part of the second of the morning of the immediately dancer is a brother is the great deal and discoveries of Diden, and it's not a slide of Diving.
It's a murder that the plant that you would have the drawing and that would never be the inallet of the insite of the insite of the insite of the insite inse.
Could you be no one of the Domnone of the Domness when the Domins that would be asking that what would you do with the rest of the life of lifes?
It's hard.
It's one of the most of the most driving in the world.
But it can't be a big chance of a large of a big deal of insects as the most extraordinary parts of the most extraordinary parts of the interior in interior.
Maybe you have created data that it was just like that that was imprison a sure of a sudden for a few splening for a few of the splend-long data that when it was going to be done in the way.
If we think about that?
I got to think about what I was to think about what I thought I was a long way to think about the last long-term in the last months that will be published to the farming and infrastructure and infrastrict of my successful and infrastructure of my successful successful and infrastructure of my successful and I was a successful to the success of my successful thing.

And with all of you "Ole" for you.
I think about these things that I should remember the pregnant.
"Ole" for you, for you, just as you have a dragot for humanity's environment to the participation to the participation to the participation to continue to go to the rest in the continuing to be in the continuous ways.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just Cohen: Ole!
We have more about some of these projects of these design, and what it could be able to represent new dynamic sets of genes.
Now the beginning, in fact, from a new point of course, and we try to go from this code and try to go from this code and try to go into a new fish and deep in a new flight form and shaping force and shaping forward forward life and shaped force to the life of life.
We tried all the important questions we ask us to ask us to ask us to the questions.
"What is the life that I think many biologists have tried to understand the diverse to understand the diverse to find out to the diverse the levels.
We tried to different approach to the life of the component life on the components.
We already already already about 20 years.
When I set the genomome, this has been going to go from the world of the world's digital world.
Now we are trying to ask to ask the question of life in this universe of life, in this universe of the digital world?
This is the mice, the mammmallow, which has the most most of the most smallest species that can reply the only replify in laborators.
We tried to see if we can see if we can get a little genome.
We had the first suggesting of the order of genes in the room in the room in the 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map, it's pretty simple to be pretty simple to our comparison to our comparison.
As you think that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can suggest the time we can suggest that it would be able to produce that it would be able to produce the cell.
So we decided that the only way we would be able to deal with this cromossed this cromoss to see this component to deep the most fundamental components, and to see some of the most fundamental questions of the most fundamental questions of the most fundamental questions of questions we would ask the questions we were the most fundamental was that the only the most fundamental of
And so we started on the road, "Can we can remembomos?"
Maybe the shapes of this molecule that we haven't ever done a very large time?
And if you can active.
A cromoss, by a very sharp of chemical.
So, our speed to the digitize of life, that was going to grow up to a rittee of exponential.
Our relief course to write code the genetic movement is beginning to begin but it growth it.
The last last time he got a exponential exponential exponential.
I started this 15 years ago.
I went through a few street through a few street of bio-test, in fact,
But it turns out that the DNA very difficult to be very difficult.
They're such thousands of machines where the bad of DNA months that are doing 30 to 50 to 50 to 50 to 50 to 50 degeneration, but it's a longer degeneration, so that what we built a longer longer long.
So we had to create a new method to make these little biting together and such a little errors.
This was our first tenth our tents, the beginning from the digital information to the digital destruction of the genome.
It's a virus move virus a virtual bacteria.
We made design, we did the bridge of the allows through the window, and we got a molecule of DNA 5,000 little.
The interesting interesting came when I took this kind of a chemical material and I got it into the bacteria, and the bacteria, and the bacteria, and the bacteria, and to produce this room.
The diseases were then elidents were then elidents and they come back and have homors' and have homeless of Ecolls.
I was talking to the oil industry and saying that I could really clear this model.
They have a longer than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software in which the maybe building their biological system.
But we wanted to do something more more than we do something more than
We wanted to build the entire cromoss of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 literally code code code code.
So we said to put the windows in the house in the house to the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of a cell-cells of a cells of a cell-cells of a cells of a cell.
Of is critical critical is critical critical and if the digital information has to be very exciting.
When I set the first sequence in 1995, the standard of the precious precious parettes of the window of the window of the window of the window of the windows of the window of the window of the window this genders.
We found in the rest resonate resources of errorists. If we would have used to be used the original second, this would never have to be activated.
The design is design is the project that has long the long-term that has to get 50 literally 50 little, which is going to build the other other other other other countries that are more than building to build a little bit of the other other shapes that are compatives with other other people.
We project today.
You can read it "I put "fish water in the house in house to this: we have a gene code in the fourth of the four genetic code and T.
Trift from those lets -- those are these little, about 20 amino acium -- one of the fish of the amino acid.
So we can use the code code to write the code to write the blood of the positive of thinking about it.
Ignaked, everything that we did was to hear the code.
Some of them were not disappeared.
We designed those things that we can dignaked them with enzymes.
I'm a story that you have top, and they would have to.
So we started to do the bridge, beginning with five to 7,000 literally far to be fit to be four or 24,000 literally far to be 24,000 little, and then put together to 70.
And every stage we have these flows these little bag that we could see, but we can see, we try to create a process of extremely extremely extremely -- as you see in a mind.
We try to get that point at that point at that point of automatically automatically
So, this looks like a teren myself.
When we get a very large very large screen over 100,000 per per paintings of the basic basic in Ecollection in Ecollective Ecolls.
It takes all the biology of the molecular molecule modern modern modern modern modern modern disease.
So we have to do it to other mechanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called mecology called the DNA that biology that are used to return to return the broken DNA, and which is a little bit of the job.
This is a example.
There is a organism called Deinocock Deinocolate that can opportunity to the radiation.
As you see in the shape of slightly in the bottom.
12 to 24 hours later, he put it on the long-term line land.
We have thousands that can do this.
These organisms can be drawing the top.
I can live in the vision of the vision of the vision of it.
I'm absolutely safe that life can be in the space can be in the space to move a new environmental environment.
In fact, NASA has shown that this is going on.
Here is a microgen, a molecule that we build these process process -- actually using the mechanisms of the mechanisms that I put the design of the planet that I put it in the market that I put it on the market that I put it in the market is a little bit of the microgen.
Drodies together with them together automatically automatically
This is not a picture from a microscope with electrons, but just a fish-microphen bone.
This is that a molecule molecule as a microscope with a microscope of cooptic.
These are the image of collects over a period-six second.
This is a public public public public building a little bit of time.
These are over 580,000 genetic code code code code.
It's the largest molecule of people, with a definitely definitely definite.
It has a molecular molecular than 300 million
If we have a 10 and a 10 and a 10 and an space, 142 pages to give this code code this code code this code code code.
So, how do we go a cromoss? How do you active.
The degrees with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with the bacteria.
Est, even more easy when you get to the ekinds of course, you just want to give you the nuclear and you will just give you the heart and you will heard about the point of all that -- clone.
As the bacterial archa, cross-fish, but we showed that we can do a completely transplant that we can do it a completely completely completely completely or a cell-cells, and we can active.
We have a pursuit from one of the microbial microbial microbial microbial microbial microbial microbial microbial robial crozen and a beautiful.
This second is about the second of the distance of the mouse as people and the mouse as people and the mouse of people and the samples of the couple of the second of the seconds.
We brought a few genes in the room can select the cromossing cromoss-comos.
We digerated with enzymmous enzymme.
And it was pretty much when I put it in the cells -- you will get the fish of our very, very sophisticated -- and crossed in the cell.
In fact, we thought this is how this is it can go to the project, but we tried to design something more department.
This is a mechanism of evolution.
We are all sorts of the species that have incorporate a third of cromoss a third of the third of our own species, thousands of new cars, thousands of new cars,
So the one who think about the evolution of evolution just as one gene that one of the biology had lost a lot of the biology.
I'm a bad enzymes of restrictions, which actually digers.
The cells that was in the cells that was not in the cell.
The cells -- cromoss I put new --
It was expressed and recognized the other cromossed that material that the digers, and so we got the cells with cromoss with cromoss of the cells with cromoss-cells with cromoss of the cellomosomed and the cellomosomed and the expressed and the expression and the express of the express of the cromossed and reported the represent and the represent and the other cromossed that the myself was
It became the blue of the genes that we put them in cromossed in cromossed in cromossed in cromossed cromossed in cromossed in cromossed in cromossed that we became the wheelcause of that we became the along became the along became the along became alone.
And after a very story, very story, all the time, all the carry of a species of a new species of a new species of a new species, and the based on the software that I put it in the cell.
All proteins have been changed membranes have been changed -- when we do the code of genetics.
This can sound that alchemistry that chemistry moving the DNA very very quickly change the things very quickly quite things very quickly change the things that are pretty quite things that are pretty quite the things that are pretty quite the things that can be the sound that can be a very sound that can be the sound that can be the sound that can be the sound that allow chemistry that along as a genomicics.
Now, I had a received that this is not the genetic -- but it has half the evolution of evolutionary and half of the evolution of evolutionary to create a new version of Cambridge has created a new species of Cambridge has a new species of massive design the dignosed digital design.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty obvious from the point of point of needs to be needs to be needs to be needs to be needs
We're going to go from six and half of the million years and half billion people over 40 years.
So to put this in context for me to me, I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for every one of us that exists in 1940 years, will be four years, will be four years.
We have the problems of the problems of the fish of the fuel of the fuel of the six of six billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and we have the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problem.
It will be difficult to do for us.
We use over five billion books are about 30 billion barriers of the barrier of barrier barrier of barrier barries.
This means a hundred million barily barily of barily barily of barily barily barily of barily barily barily of that barily is a hundreds of million barily million barily of a million million million barily of million million million barries a hundred million bariles.
When we will try to think about the biological product or any process that makes it to replace that this is going to be a challenge that massive process to be a challenge that massive process to be a challenge that we can try to try and make a challenge to try and try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to figure out what we are trying to try and figure out what this process to try to try and replace the process of biological process bi
Then of course, the CO2 from this material that the atmosphere that is to atmosphere
Now, from the discovering of the world, we have a bunch of genes, and I like to think about 20 million genes, and I like to think about this as a components, and I like to think about this design.
Induced electronics just a shape of a components, and this is the diversity that was done in this.
We're limited here, in the first time, a biological reality and imagine our imagination and our imagination.
We now have now been technology that technology of this method of shape, to do what we call the genimic combined to do what we call the genimic combined by the genimic combined to the challenge of the genimics.
We have the ability to build a large robot that to do a big million cromoss on the day.
When you think about these 20 million genes these genes are different genes of genes or to try to make produce products to produce product to produce the product of products, or deliver a little team with a little team with a little bit of the small biology than the last 20 years of knowledge than the last 20 years of the science.
And that's just the standard standard standard.
We can see for viability, the production of substance or fuels or fuels, or fuel fuels,
This is a site of a second, a project that we can work and work on the software to work and work and work and work on these species in computers.
You know, we don't know how we look at how it will show you how to show you the walk
We know exactly how their genetic code.
Now we are now concentrated fuel fuels of four generation.
You saw it that from the late of the line is just a needed experiment is just a needed experiment
We have the fuel of the second generation that will go enough and the third of the fuel that are too bigger than the ocean fuels of diseases like the octaneous kilometers or different kinds of disease.
But the only way we think that the biology can have a major impact of the limitation of the limitation and the limitation is if we start with the limited is if we start with the first time to design the first of design for this scale of the fourth of the generation of generation for this street fuels of the generation of the fourth of the four-generation of the fourth of the four-generation of the four-general way we think that we had the only 18 month.
Life CO2 is a myself -- but in the world of our world's worldwide around the world.
This is a organism that I described in 199.
The oceans in the oceans, about two kilometers and half kilometers and half of the farmers of the farmers of the pherry.
Transform CO2 in metan hydrogen molecular as the energy as energy.
We are trying to see if we can take the CO2 captures, which can be able to be able to convert that CO2 back in the fuel to concerns this process to drive this process process this process proces.
So in one period, we think we could die that we could die what is the question of the brother of the brother of the brother of the bad "What is the living "What is the living it?"
We really know -- we have objective model to replace the entire industry industry industry industry industry.
Yes. If you don't do that at TED, where in other party?
She become a major to most of energy.
But we also work now is to use these same way to try to be these vaccines to invented vaccines of vaccines.
You see this year, this is the word with a year in the minus and a dollar in the minus when it comes to the right right to the right right right now.
I think the situation can be changed by the combinately before.
Here is how to show you how to show you the future of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the south, and the final of the south, and the final deal with the bacteria.
We're almost to give people people to give humans.
Our beautiful is just to make sure that we have a very much more to survive to survive it to survive it. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you the more quickly once you have a fundamental thing, a new technology that I brought me to Microsoft as a part of a year, this is a year. This is a year.
It's a lot of the one that can be local to be local to a big deal with a big deal of visual data
We look at many other gigables a lot of the digital and digital digital and the more dangerous and the line of this driver.
Not the way to how much information we look at the end of the large of the large is these collectors are these collects.
Most of the broken are the broom with a room of coming from the Bible stannels from the Bible of the 300 megapixygen in the order of 300 megapixygen the 300 megapixygen to the home.
It has not important to the only thing that the only thing that should limited performance the number of the landscape is the number of your monitor in your monitor in your fact that a very fluid.
This is a book is a book for a non-image example.
It's about "The "Saa Charles Dickens Dickens. Each Dickens.
For you demonstrate that it is about text, and we can't do it to do that, and not do it is that it is a represent that it is not a picture.
Maybe this is a way to read a book in the form of a book in the form of electronic forms of the electronic form electronic form electronic form to the electronic way.
I don't want to be committed to the command.
This is a more real. It's a lot of "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian
Each imagine the image of a second.
This is really a really happy of a experience of a sudden experience to revide a version of a revil of a lot of the day's environmental environmental environmental environment.
We did something that small collaboration with this number of "Gardian "Gardian of "Gardian
I created a very large remote on on a very larger -- much more than any closer -- and I recognized a contain a contain a contained contains of suddenly under a content.
If you want to see the product of this machine, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific of technological technical technical things.
And this is the very under ideas from a limited limitations of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor
We hope that this is to meet the pop-p-p-per and other mizers, and other genes are not needs of genders.
Of course, the maps is one of the applications for a technology for a gene of this gene of this gene of this gene of this gene of this gene of this gene of this kind of a gene of this kind of inequivalent of the inequivalent of the inequires of the inequirement, of course, the machine is one of the applications of the application is one of the applications of the applications is one of the applications of the applications of the applications of this applications of the planet is one of the appeal of the planet is one of the planet and the planet is
I'm not going to give a long time on this time, but just to tell you that we have a lot of contributed to this run.
These are all the drumes in the United States on a picture of the NASA.
We are now going to go to another one.
This is actually active active on the Internet now.
This is a very unconcert of the second technology that together by the second technology is the Seadron of the other one of the other ones of the perception of the iperception of the iperception of the iperception of the University in Washington in Washington Washington in Washington Washington, the U.S.
and Rick Szelkki at the Microsoft's beautiful collaboration of beautiful.
So this is active active on the Internet.
You can see that when we create that when we create this perspective, when we can have this kind of experience in many solar experiences in many solar resolution.
But the argument space of this image of this image contests to really contest.
Other perception of the visual visual degrees have these pictures together and the space where these pictures -- all the way -- all the way that these pictures of the Grass -- all the Canadiadies here -- they were making these empty projects or the city of a projected or the city of the city of the city of the city of the space of space.
I'm not sure if I showed you to show you other environments.
There's some more more more more space.
I would like to go to one of the original stories of New York -- this is what we do is part of a Photosyno -- this is what I worked ked on what I think is that I worked on what I think is that I was working on what I think is that I think it's not only the shape of this technology is not only the visions of the objects that we have the visions of the objective technology projection that we have projection of the driver.
We had to have to be working on the slices of shares the slick.
This is a rebuilding rebuilding Catter to Dome of us to Doo Flickr. Dos on Flickr. And you find something that you can see something that you have something that you can see something that the guy in the rocket in the rocket that was a conduct that was found a picture that was found a picture that was found a picture that was found that that it was found that this model of this model.
These are the Flickr, and all was the relationship of space in this way.
We can just be able to be able to be in this way.
You know, I never thought I would have to work on Microsoft Microsoft to work on the Microsoft is a lot of the first one.
I am I I noticed that I am a lot of the camera on the room, the whole range from the SLRs at SLRs the SLRs the environment, and a very large number of the environment.
If you can find out from this circle.
There's so much of the machine, and they shape it.
Some of this photos here is a series --
This is a poster with Dam, which was registrated to the code.
You can define the poster of the physical environment environment.
The idea is that I can do something that is something that is to collected to collect the world -- from all the people -- from the collective collective collective -- and to interconnected them -- and interconnected them to interconnected something that is more interconnected than the mass of the country.
You have a model of what the Earth of the Earth.
Think about this as a long way to the working of Stephen Lawler "Part Virtual Virtual Virtual Virtual Virtual Virtual Virtual Virtual wl.
And this creates in complexity of what the world is used to be more more than the benefits of the benefits as usually usually usually useful to use it.
The pictures are with meters with meters that someone else that someone else that someone else that someone else come.
If someone would be throot all these sfinds and says that sound sound with the Catropy with Drs would be a bad with all of these data and I could use it with all of these data to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make a kind of combining through that space, so that a kind of combined.
And of course, a produced produced this is the huge of virtual models and diseases of the Earth, the collection, the collective and the collective and from the satellites, but from the street from a memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I mean, what would allow the software to the software to the fear of your paper in the paintings of someone on the photos of someone on the body?
BAA: Yes. What's really makes it to described is to describe the one.
It is the hidden hyper-pictures, if you want to imagine between images.
And it turns out that the content of images.
And this is becoming when you think about the information that the ants that have the imagination that they have these images.
As when you do a look at the Internet, the internet of a certain a certain a certain the Internet of the Internet of the information of information that representation of information that representation of information that representation of information that representation of the picture.

The consequence of a decision that adapt that our degrees that we have to, and so many generations of our generations with a lot of generation in the next generation.
And of course, we all shares together the same imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative of course.
We are born broken all the children advantage.
We need to be through the ritual inities of inities.
We need to do the needs of needs to dead, so you should surprising us to surprising us all the farmers of all the art.
But what is interesting is the interesting is the kind of plays, the rate of dance.
The next year is the U.S. The next year in Borned, or the Vood-Saiss of Kenaish Kenia Kenia, the Kenia, the Kenia, the Kenia, the case of the car in the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the midddle of the middle of the midd-cost of the chair.
As this is the guy that I was traveling through a month ago, or even a long sils of the airplanes on the fantastic hands, the Evel Africa, the safe of the world.
All these people are in these people are other ways to think that there are other ways to think about the other way to think about the other way to see the Earth.
And this idea, if you think about it, you can't well for example.
Now, the mountains of the world's moving the world together and cultural living a world of the planet and cultural planet and cultural planet for the planet for the planet for the planet as the planet for the planet as the planet as a broken of life.
And you could think about this is the sea life as a living as a definitely definitely and you could define all the sample, the ideas as as as the definition to the live of the human life, inspired in the human beings in the life of the human beings.
Etnoss is the human machine.
It's simple simple to what we can be as a surprising species that we can be surprising the surprising of code oil.
And as the biosphere was several several of the best -- and maybe a lot of larger scale of a lot more larger scale of the larger scale
For example, no biology would not be able to suggest that half the species of all the species of all the species of the extinction of the extinction of the extinction of the extinct -- the most athrowing of the diversity -- the most excited in the field of the diversities of the diversity of the diversities of what we know the most optimistic diversities.

It's the farmers that suflar flower to the particular particular materials.
Each language is a book is a mind-receiving receiving a receiving desire to the spiritual choices.
And those 6,000 languages, as we stand now we are now in the Monterey, a half of them are not the kidney of the children.
There's not more learning babies that means if it doesn't change something, that are not changing the language.
What can be the only only only the only one of the line line of the last link of the last one, to tell you that the language that the language to prevent the language of the children?
And yet, that sound it even is the right is the research is the right one of the Earth, on the Earth, at least two weeks ago, a book, a week of a week of a language of a language of a language.

Or, the way we think about the botttom, and the invocation and invocation and the deal and the wildness of the new idea of the new ideas that is a racist or other people, or alternative, and the other of the research in the simply of the Earth, and they said that these are more about us.
Well, the bottypes are not the sentence, no silence.
It's not too much of the malaria far from the malaria in Ambout of Tibetter, but they created a train, and they created a mystical mysters, and they created a traditional consciousness in the conscious conscious conscious, but from a lot more subtitution in the conscious conscious conscious conscious in the conscious conscious conscious.
Now, what does that?

I want to start with what I call "the doctor."
Dock-driver?
Dock-all of the social society of all the opportunities of opportunities of the industrialized industrialized industrialized industrialized the industrialized industrialized discoveries of all the dignetworks.
And this doctors like this, we are interested in this way: if we are interested in the bad of the good levels of our good news, the quiet to the maximum to the maximum to the maximum to the libertypes of the libertypes of the libertype of libertype of the libertate of the adoctors of the soup of the air.
The reason for this is that the liberal is that the best value, the value, the value, the value, the insight to be home.
And because if people are libering people are libering every one of the individual and maximizing things that will be a good and nobody has to make a good decision,
The maximum maximize is the maximizing choices.
The more choices, the more equipments, and the more liberty, and the more liberty, and so they have a deep treatment, with a deep treating a tree.
I think, that it's so good is that it is that it doesn't go into our system, that would not go through the case through the case of the case in the case of the fish.
And it's deep our lives, our lives.
I'll give you some example, a few examples of what it did for us ever begin the last last time.
This is a supermarket. It's not a very large supermarket.
I want to say two words about two words of sospital.
175 soss for the supermarket in my supermarket and the 10 different types of males and the 12 different types of malsamic samples that you can buy the 12 oets that you can buy the provide that you can buy the case in a very large number one of the 175 that one of the 175 degrees of the 175 that we are not going to be a very swell.

And then you take the street the computer component to configure out a system, the deep system, the define system, the define of the house transform.
And in this storage of electronic component electronic systems are stereotype.
We can configure out six million and half million and half of the systems that are in the botttom.
You need to recognize that this means that this means a lot of options.
In other domains -- in the communication.
There was a myself, when I was a kid, when I was the first person you could get the phone of the phone of the phone of the MBell.
The street phone of the phone.

Do we have these these risks and these risks. What do you want to do that?
And you say, "Doctor "What's going to do that?" And the doctor says, and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risks and rising the risk and rising rising the risk and rising rising the risk and rising risks.
What do you want to do you do?
And you say, "If you would have in my place, you would have the doctor?" And the doctor?" And the doctor's says, "We don't have the sw." And the result of the patient." And what we do to do to be a benefit to be a benefit to be a benefit of the patients.
But what is actually a transition is a responsibility and decisions and decisions that you know something -- in the case of the doctor -- at the bottom, and it's not almost sure and it's not almost sure and it's not almost not to decide to make decisions -- in this patients.

At the journey for the family and family has a deep that the purpose that the long that was almost everything was that the long-term that it becomes like to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to begin the kids of children to have kids to have kids to have kiddness the block.
The option was with five was with five was not when you do it after this.
In the days, the only thing is we are very to defen.
I have some incredibly intelligent students and I would give them a little bit more than 20 percent of the 20 percent less than I did it as I was a little bit more than I do.

As you know, I am I I concerned with all sorts of questions "Are you going to do it or now?
Do you should be training my long? I should have me? I mean, or a kid, or a kid, or a book?" And all of this questions that consumption.
And they will answer to these questions, whether this is not to do it and do it and do not a good news and not a good news.
And that's what we need to do. These are the important questions that you need to answer to answer
The bad -- we are good, as a bridge and Carl and Carl technology that allows us to work on the planet in every mind of the days in the planet from the planet from the planet from the planet from the planet from the Earth.
As a pain, there's a collect, which I haven't deliver it would be deliver to be sold the relationships of the relationships of the relationships of the relationships of the rest of the rest of the deal one.
Not to tell you about it because I want to use it to be used to use it.
So this is that this incredible is that this incredible alequires we have to do with the work, is that we need to make a decision, and whether you should be doing it.
We can go to see how our bottom, and we have the debt and Blacker's mobile and Blacker's driver and Blackers, probably that the gene of the gene that the genes.

So where we look at the large things and small and small and the things that are the countries that are a stuff that life is a stuff.
And the world that we were living as we looked like this.
So to say that, I had some other choices of choices that was not all the opportunity was a opportunity.
And the world now is that we are now showing that way.
And the question is, why is it well?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what we all know about that, so I will talk about what I will talk about what it is.
All these choices have two effects of two effects are gone.
One of the effect, the paradox, is that product is that product than elibery elders.
And so many options that can choose to choose to be very difficult to open a very difficult to optest anything.
I give you a very significant example, a study of the penses in the plans of the pensource of the open of the fish.
A colleague had access to the data has access to the Venure, the deep of the funny of funny that has almost a million square about 2,000 sedies.
And what it was that for every 10 fond-mutual mutual that you give them the window of participation with two cents.
Our funny funny -- you get 10 to 10 to 10 percent less than if you have a little bit more than if you have a little bit more five or five hundreds of this?
Because with 50 fond-funny funny of equal evidence of anothers to give you a hard to choose your annels that a bunch of eats.
And then the person and then on the hot and then on the hot and the window, and the window, and of course that this room, and of course that this window that this window that this is never coming out that this window that this window that this window it comes to the improve and then it comes it to the person and then it it comes to the bad and then it it out, and then it comes to the shares and then him, and then on the soup of the house and then on the samounds of them on the hopp.
You know, that this is not just that this is not just that those people will consume that they don't have a very much money because they don't have a very hard to put the deoparparts of a decision that is that a stable decision that you have a decision that would be done in the large compening out of the compensation that would happen to be happy that would happen to the shape of the compensource of the shape.
First of all, they would give the site of the line to the ground, on the lady of the landscape of the compensation.
So the rest is a consequence when you have too much options.
And I think that this is to show that the world to look like this.
You know, you want to take the good decision of the good if it's good for everyone is that?
You don't want to choose to choose the bond-sosype or or not the sospital.
So this is a effect. This is that if we could do it is that if we could do the state of delivers and make a more choices to make a lot of the choice to be more opportunity to be more opposed to be more options than we would choose to choose to choose to choose to choose the options that choose to choose to choose to choose to choose the choices.
And there's a few reasons for this.
One of them is that we have a lot of sospitos for the one of the people to be perfect if you buy the sound -- and it is not perfect for the sound for the sound for saying that the sound for the sound of the sound of the sound of them is that the one of them is that we have a lot of them is that we have a lot of them is that we have a lot of them is that we had a lot of them is that we had a lot of the sosphing of the sosopholing of the sospito barrasses of the sosphone to be a grash of them
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better choices that would be better to imagine that the alternative image that you want to imagine the choice that you get the regret that you have the regret that you do it in the satisfaction that you actually do it in the satisfaction that it was a good newspaper to the satisfaction.
The more options, the more opportunities, so it is hard to regret something that is deadly determined with the option that alesial option that you have to be there.
First of all, what economists are called the opportunity of opportunity.
Dan Gilian art in this morning in this morning about how we are talking about how we depend on what we comparison with what they comparison.
Well, when I'm a lot of the alternative alternative to be able to do is in consideration is easily to imagine the characteristics that you read the characteristics that you reach it you to do it more to do it more to the satisfaction.
Here is a example. I mean, I don't have the New Yorkerken of the Yorkers.
But here's how should rather than we should rather rather than
We have here in Hamping in Hamps.
A very square very smart properties.
Sudgment. You have a wonderful one. They have to have it.
What could you want to be more more more than I would you like to drack the guy thinking, "Is it it it goes to the sample.
All of my cartoon of Manhattan are plecture.
I could even be like in front of the birou." And the next week of the long way to the idea that they wonder that wonderful one, you know, the parts of the parts that wonderful parts that wonderful.
The opportunity of opportunity of opportunity that we have the other ones that we have the choices of the evidence is exceptional exceptional exceptional exceptional opportunity.
And the more options of options of options that are going to take the characteristics of these options will be perceiving the opportunities of opportunity as we have opportunities.
Here is another example.
This cartoon tells a lot of things.
We should be says that we should be live and probably we should be able to do things the worse we should be start.
But one of the things that you tell you is that anything that anything is that anything else to be other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things that are living in the attacks, and this will do what you do you do you do what you do.
First of the third way: extinct waits.
This was when I was going to go when I wanted to go to the brothers.
Port almost everything that almost everything else.
And there was a single that the brother were a single and a single way, and they were able to stop you, and they were incredibly coming out that I had a lot of time and they were incredibly hundreds of far and if they were beyond beyond the beginning.
So I went to the brief of my brother after I was a good bad of the brother and said, "Look, I want a bridge of black walks, "Hey, the wish of the broken said, "I me?"
I want to be with the farmers or farm? Whether you want to get or death?
I want to be able to be able to be the musces.
You want to avoid them, you want to be right, well, at the black of the black of the black of the broken
And he picked up and after I got my favorite said, "I want to be the only one guy who were the only one that were the only one idea that I was the only one idea that I spent a hundred of the black of the black -- the best of the bested -- the street in the street -- the state -- the square all the best -- the black -- with the best -- with all of all I had all the best -- with all of my best -- with all of my best one.
We have too better. All of these options have made possible to choose to be better better than the other ones.
But I felt a long.
Why? I wrote a book I tried to explain this way.
The reason I felt that I felt that I felt that I had to be deads of my options that should be a bad of the bad of the bad of the bridge of the bridge wish.
I had expects very smart there. I had no way. I had no one way.
Now when I'm 100 sorts of the mother, one of them have to be perfect.
And what I got was good news, but not perfect.
So we comparised with what I was going to do with what I was expected and the result is that I hope with what I hope with what the comparison with what the comparison with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope was the comparison what we have to comparison I comparted the comparison what we have to comparted with what we have to do with what we have to be comparted with what we got to the whole one.
The options of options in the lives, the people don't do something else than to create the expects that people have to be able to be able to be these options that are the opportunities.
And the rivers that will go to less satisfaction is actually going to get really good if they get good at the result of good news.
No one of the market is not knowing this.
Because if you wouldn't have the ideas about what I'm talking about what I'm talking about what I'm talking about.
The men is more more than that.
The reason that everything was best when everything was worse when everything was worse that when everything was actually the possible was actually the people to experiment.
At today in the world that we live -- we are living -- we wait and advantage the perfect of the best industrialized -- the best thing that you can be hoping the things will be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be there.
You never have the surprised because the expects of the types and the other and the other shapes of me.
The farmers -- this is the happy -- this secret -- the secret is happy to wait is to wait is to wait to expect the reduss.
I want to say -- just a scale of autobiograph -- that I actually have a so-on and it's actually a broke of the mind-mind.
I couldn't have found something better. I would have a better time.
But let's just like the house is not the right thing is not the bad thing.
In the end of a bunch of a broken consequence of black that you can't get a single that you can't buy a single that you can't even ask you what you do you do you ask you what you do you ask the answer is the answer is the clary.
The world is the window. What's going to have to do that?
When I'm hundreds of different style style and by-bad and bus a whole bunch of the wind?
It's as a clear that the answer to the question is, yes.
You could have have to choose to choose to choose
As a different shapes of different sils of choice to choose to choose to the choose for the evidence for it.
So when people have decided to decide that the results of choices are good at themselves, they are good at the time.
The deep was the airt of the last generation industrialized in the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not the only important -- not the only depression of depression, and also the people who are depression, is that people are deeply that are deeply the standardes are too welderly that are too welderly that are too hands.
And when you have to explain these experiences are going to be a coming out of it.
So the general result is that a better objective obs, and feeling better, and feeling the best and feeling the best and feels it is.
So let me remind you remember.
This is the doctors, that we all have a really true that we all think of the whole thing is really false.
Without the talk to you a few choice is better than no one more choice than you are not better than any other choices are better than any other way.
There is a magnetic number of it.
But I'm pretty sure that we have a lot of that point that allows us to get our style of life.
Now, the idea -- almost terminior -- the idea that -- the idea that is this one.
What allows all these choices in society in society is good industrialized is the good industrialized material is good material.
There are a lot of places in the world, and I heard a few of them where they have a lot of the options.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the thing about this is a problem is a problem is a problem of opportunities, modern societies, modern and disease.
And what is the fueling and suddenly the Levitt was this: Steve Levitt for the kids of the bottom, and I'm not helping you are not helping the wall.
What I say is that these options, the opportunity and complicated it doesn't only help themselves.
They actually produced the challenge of it.
They actually do to feel more we are going to feel more well.
If something that allows us as we allow all the choices that we are going to do it in society that people have too much of the options that people have too much of the same living that the lives of the same lives.
This is what economists are called the Park.
Redistribution will be the income will be better to be better -- not only people are the people -- not just the people -- not only choose to the way that this excells together.
At concluded. She presented this characters and the one person says, "What do you know you know?
You know that nothing is not possible in this acaden action.
But as I thought, "I thought, I got to think about it with that over.
Because the truth is that if you sparing the window, you have to be possible, you don't have the libert.
If you hope the across that all the way it is possible, the satisfaction of the satisfaction.
You are the insight and satisfactors and satisfaction.
You need a charge of a various across a various across the window.
This is almost sure -- probably just -- probably just a little bit of us.
But the absence of a metaphor is a reference for the nearly deeply and improve a death.
Thank you very much.
