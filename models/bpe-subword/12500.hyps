And the one of the second one of these two second-line research for the land of the land of the most of the last three million years ago, three million years ago, the last year, the last three years ago, the past of the couple of the couple of a million years ago.
But this is the results of the problem of this problem is that the problem is that the baby.
The police of the police of the police that is the fashion the planet.
He was exactly the slightly and the same.
The second of the city of the street that I want to show you a faster in the last 10 years ago, the last 10 years.
God is the purpose is the floor.
So as you can see the slightly the balance of the art.
This is the paper in the time in the cell.
And it turns out the street.
The Aslimb is the same, with a few years ago, you can see that the more or more than the one of the streets of a bunch of a national stream.
In 25 years ago, the 10.
This is a problem is that the problem of the sample of the line of the line of the line of the story.
In a fascinates is a barrashed by the botttom, is the shape of a microphone, is a little bit of a microphone.
The line of policy with the police of the world's global labeling of the global paper could be the farmers could be the extremely reaction of this exception.
The one one of the one of the golf in the Kasha is the golfer is the flogical streets is the floor.
The Kaitan Kaiter Kaker in the U.S. A in the goline of a few of another one of the other one of the other one in a few of the past.
He's Gooh! I saying. It's a question of question.
And a little bit of the past is that the story, the Genon is the Genland.
This is a message.
But the best is more than the best way you would never have a little bit of it.
This is Kalah Kenhn in the Genlass.
If you want to be you to get the brain the middle of the botttoms of the street.
These are faster faster is very fast.
And the other other of the other of the planet, the Earth, the most of the future.
one of the people people have been representing the street as the palgorithm of the future, the story, the story, the storytells the street of the street of the future.
This is the galaxy with a national photographics.
In Haya myth, the couple of the line of the land of the future, which is the future, that was going to be the labeled with the bar.
40 percent of the world's population of the world's light of these in the history of these bar.
In the Earth, this is a funding to this is the same.
Dewaling the creation.
But when it comes up with the slipping and such a story.
In the middle of a 40-hundred of the Ston Stark.
This is the hundred of the slightly himself
And the reasons, as you can read the challenge.
The world's global limb of a nice of the slightly religious of the research of the religion.
And the fingers of the world's global light and the global world and the extremely and the research and the concept and the research and the research and the research and the research and the research.
First of all, more than the last 10 years ago, the last 10 years ago.
This is a system is a computer.
If you look at the conversation of conversation of the streets can see what you can see is the street.
In the last 10 years ago, I was a million dollars a military 100 million of the 10,000 miles of 100 million of the 100 million of the week.
The second is going to be the story of the Pixide the Wikipedia, and every day in the world, and the story, and the one of the U.S.
The most most of the largest ones of the global purban history of the future, is the story, the street from the slightly religious of the samples of the farmers.
The city is a problem is a good problem and the most beautiful is the most beautiful is the blood.
The United States is one of the cells of the Chinese governments
And the process of building the more computers like the baby.
But we actually want to see a change.
Here's the people who have been in the last year, the last year.
And the next thing that was a political political politicians in our political lab.
And the industry of the bull, and the bola million dollars a million dollars a military of the last military of the last year.
The baby is the barrashing is a future.
This image of the image of the street.
In Camming Capper in Tennely, a million dollars a million of the balance of the barrase.
You have a little bit of the story.
This is the slightly the slightly one of the Ston Stanford in Comormous Cominics.
One of the labs of the label, and I was in the Capapped Calalley, was this message.
You're the Franks, the France, is a beautiful.
He is the babies in the world, and helping the economy.
The ballo, the bars, the best way from the past, the limb of the limb of the future.
He is a beautiful and religions and religions and farmers and farmers.
Asian Go: This is the most important of the North of the North of the North of the North of the North of the North of the North of the North of the God.
The Mindle is the most beautiful of Mashing's Mash.
Do: Dahhhhhhhhhh. He's not the North God, but the Gohi Rush.
Audi: So God, so Australian of Cambon Cambon the Michael Audience of the year.
This is one of the story, one of the one of the one of the horms.
You're the GDP of the ALE: we see our own own own projects as a very faster to our own own own our own own own own our own own own own our own own own own own own our own own own own our own own own own own our own own own own own own own our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own our idea.
This is the way our homework is to be the best of the future, and we want to be able to be able to be the research of the best and and we really really really really really required and the blood of the blood.
The art is the barrange is not the bar.
We think that is how we think is the floor and the floor.
So I don't like the streets of the process of change.
Latask this in our home.
You're the Great the Gard, you know, you know, it's a little bit about the message.
So you can do do a ideal ideas of this characters of the future.
He! My is the art is a barrase.
But this is the technology of technology of the bar.
And as the bars of the bars is one of the global of the world's biggest technology that is a good newspaper that you see here that you can see here that you see here that the change.
The second is going to be the technology is a technology of the babies.
Audi: The Gogero is the slightly the situation of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem.
You're the Great the hort: the economy is the economy of the over, the secret of the fashion the fashion the fashion the fashion the fashion the farms.
The reason that the street that the street of all of the slightly coming out of the bond: but it's a good newspapers.
But now we have a new new new new of the research of the future.
The energy economy with the economy of the six of the size of the 100 percent of the him.
A couple of the 19th century, and then the religion, and then the farmers and the overwhels of the world.
In the army, a solution, a big solution that is a big problem to use the problem of the problems.
Right? Audience. Australia.
Audien: This is the last year.
Do: I am North Americ: it's about the energy of the world.
One of the way of the most faster and I was a beautiful farmers of the farmers of our planets that is the Barbon is the Barbitan: Is here, is a nice of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy.
Barbith Ste: Look at the street to create the farmers to create the floor.
Narr: Right? It's a time for the American for the time.
Audi: It's a message, is a characters of the street you want to get to get the only one one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the second."
If you want to be able to be able to be the streets of the bar.
We have to get to get the farmers,
Thank you very much.
The next year, the TED I wanted to get a LIDS L.
And I was a myself to get a little bit about how to get the way to do this.
So the second airplane. And for the people who were here was here for the most important experiment that was the most experiment that was the research of the Australian -- the Combon is the sample of the situation of the U.S.
It's the extremely unexpects of the same.
This is the art of Gendark Gen.
We have a little bit of these myself in the conversation of the content of the content.
I was working at this point. It's called the TV is called EDDAs -- Lawful Agama 2-home, a second of the Addamn Addle Eastern AIV with the LAIV in the LAAs the LAASAs the LA.
One of the future, the paper in the first time I was a story.
And this image was the ALLLLET.
He was the one one of the cloth.
It's a image of the first of the first of the world that the way of the slightly of the slightly in LI, the Lab Lab Lab Lab Lab Laws, the Lab Laws, the Combon the Harvard in the case of Laws.
All of the other thing I wanted to get the image of the next 10 times of the streets of the street that is a complete of the character.
I don't like that, I don't know that the first of the most of the most of the most of you have a bage, or not, and the first step and the first once of Google and the first one.
The reason I was a message that I had a little bit of the slightly research.
After the future, I had a problem of this problem, which was a problem of these problems -- these are the sample.
These are the story, the bridge of 100 meters of the samples of the future.
Now, the light of the story of these stories and the message, "I can't read the research.
But I can do this for that when I'm going to be the slightly in the slightly comfortable to the conference.
So as a 25-2-year 25 percent of the streets of the streets can be the story, and the slightly and the research can be the research.
In one of the couple of the 1,000 of the 1,000 of Lain Lain Lain Lake.
So the way the city of the street and the 15 hours of the brain research of the electricity.
This was the message.
This is more involvey as a perfectly such as a situation of the future, and they were 30 percent of the faster than 30 times a 30-the-hourselves.
So I was a research of the future.
I had to do the street the street, and what I do.
I have content in the story, I remember the home.
And now we have a research of the sample.
Lan's go to the cloths of LHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHer HHHHer Hanananananita Lanananitary of the anananananitary of the ananthana diagnanced of the analyancle of the anananananthana Cana Lananancesting of the paint of the ancient of the pappeal of the ancestory.
We will go back to the new new of the new way to do it in the past, and we will get to the street and to get the universe to recognize the universe that are the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the new way.
Now, the idea of course, as a way of researchers of the opportunity to talk about the important thing to talk about the research and the express of the extremely research.
I think that the way of the street is the sample, the way we have the way that we have a very important of the project of LHH.
I will be a laser of the arms of the British Right? Harvary, David David Diff, I think of the experiment of the Michattan of the Michattan of the Micham, the one is not the way of the him, the way we don't have the streaming of the humanity of our homeers, I don't have the street in our homeers, the world's street the world."
Thank you.
I wanted to get the way with the land to get the baby of the kids will be a bunch of himself with the baby.
And the next thing you can get to the floor and then you want to get the street and you get the farmers of how to read the problem and you can get the problem and the problem and the problem of the problems.
The perception of the street is the process of how we can do a big world.
So I think about the process of the IV research of our innovation of our innovation with our connectionary -- one of the Paul Paul Paul Paul K: Madean -- and the Kiter K: Japanese -- and the Kalalley, and we could be a read of the way to be a research of the homework of the way to do that we could be be a researchernetwork, and we could be a research of the stagain to be a bridge in the purban -- and the pose to be a paint of the pose the patively and the Koreendriddddddone one one one one one one one one with the pativant, and re-up with the patively ret of the patients of the bars of the bright?
The art I want to do that?
The question was the question, this was fascinated by the samed to reduce the Sife of the Sify building.
OK, a Sif, a Sife of the computer.
I can be the babies of the research, you can read the situation of one of the galax, and they have a choice and a character.
The most important thing that I'm a very important bulls, like the farmers, like you can just be the floor of the floor.
And Sife the farmers of a new example, we have the research of the brain is the brain is the brain creativity of the brain is the reaction of the brain.
The climate of these include in the faster in the faster of the farmers of the street, and the other stories of the street, and the content of our history, and we can explore the research of our innovation.
I will remember the street will be a simple example.
This is Sife Sife is the future, and if you remember the research of the farmers of the floor of the land in the future, the farmers of the farmers of the galaxies.
These are the insects are constantly constants.
So if you were asked a little bit of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of it.
If I'm connected to the content, and I can become a conclusion.
I can feel the research and the including and the inclue.
We went to the way from one of the interesting of the interesting of the content is that we can use the streaming is a characters to be a standard-up such a little bit of a bunch of a message.
In the way, we have three days of the Sife of the farmers and use the streets and the state of the street the middle of the street.
If I was a lot of him, we can get a lot of the same.
There's the way to understand the interesting of the interesting of the stuff of the farmers and recognize and we want to do people to do people to see the things that we can see the things like the things that are the things that we see the things that we see the things that are the things that are the result of things like the same.
So here I -- this is a faster Fibully.
Here's a game of a story of the shape of the Suddenly Stepher's British and Broad.
Again, in every single of the first time a couple of Sixts, and the flog, and the research of the research of the street to a bad of a bunch of a bad of the street.
And then then I was 30 percent of the second second secret of the future, and you have a new way of research and we have a concept and connecting the research and research.
Thank you.
These are the kids who were the consumed of Lab Lab Ladia Madia, and I remember and I remember, and I wanted to get a little bit of the planet.
Let's go back to the good news.
And one of the interesting of this interesting is that the interesting is that you have to do with the brain is not the brain with many of people are intentions.
I know what the one is to do is "Francissip."
Here's a lot of people are going to be the people with the research.
This is the most beautiful is our farmers in the gard.
It has been working on the time, I was going to do a Sife Stargets a story.
So for me just were just a little bit of the home.
This is a new new animal with animal animals.
We wanted to build a computer-term of the people who are research.
And this is Fix.
It can get the choices of the choice of the Sif, just the Sife of the Stargets the characters that you can read the characters.
Here's the slips of the fashion the same.
You're the Great the home.
David Muslan: I was a message of the galax.
You're talking about the slightly the slightly
Good h! Da!
Manderson, Sife and the samples and the slightly can do with a simple of the conditions.
DM: So I create the process of the process of the characters.
Do: But:
DM: It's a story with the story of how to read the stream.
Yeah, Google hero: God.
DM: The U.S. The last time I was going to be a research of the research and the conference of the Sikipedia and the Sikindness that they would be built and the Shattland and and the balancy and the ballog.
The one of the last four our four or four different types, you want to use a different way.
And you can remember the characters of a complete of the slightly stream.
You can get the streets of Sife Sife Sify Sife Starget.
There's the common who can be the street the research, and as a long story.
The one is the one of a couple of a couple of the farmers for the lab.
The second is the generation of the general of the generation of the future, the second of Harvillage of Harvillage House Heals.
You're Dorde: I want to get the Sify Sherror of Sherville, a complete of a choices of a chemicals, a more research, a lot of the farmer.
Now one of the past.
Yea: Da: I love the sample.
Yea: And I will be a golf, I will be a balance, to be the shape of the same.
You're DDarwin: You can be the future, the future, or a little bit of the slightly or in any other or or in any other or or in any other or or or in any other or or in the way or or in a or or in a whole thing.
Yea: DDD: I'm going to be a little bit more extremely faster for more extremely revolution.
Yea: DDon't do that. I want to do the second time to do the future.
So I don't have to do the planet, I can remember the research, and the farmers of the streets of the streets of the street.
Now, in the army, I can do you get the second faster to the Sify Shervard Sify the future.
Thank you.
And as a whole thing that is the story is the international of the connection that are the way to the way that the brain that the brain and the brain and the brain and our brain and our brain the brain in our brain our brain our brain our brain our brain in our brain in our brains and our brains.
And then I had a time to show you a little bit of this process of this design, and you can get the process of the process of the research of the labor in the lab.
The one that the way that we are the shape is that we are the new digital of this research of this research of the content of the world, the world that you will be the world's new new new of our world's light in our world's light in our lives.
Thank you very much.
As the shape with you to go back with you to.
I'm a hundred of the him.
She wrote is the Twitter, but it's a lot of the research.
It's my house and my house and fascinating.
And I don't know that this is that this is what this is the me.
But this is the best story, as a research of the street and the land and the land and the land of my home, and I was a little bit of the research of the research of the research of the research with the research with the way with the research.
And the thing I was so described that this is the best of the best one, the Mandel, Right?
The art is that the story, and people are connected to the content of the content.
Serbarry -- connecting the content.
As you have the example, you know, you know, you don't know you saw it is not a little bit of the street is going to be a story, you can be be the story.
You don't have a story, you know, you can go back to the land of the land of the floor of the world that you will have a story, the world that the world will be able to be the world?"
It's very fast, in the palgorith.
But it was more and and if they were not going to be a few years ago, I was a few years ago, I was going to be a little bit of the samples -- I was going to be a research, I was going to be a street -- I want to be a little bit of the same way of the same way that I was a little bit of the same way of the same way of the same way that the sample.
And people said, "I didn't have a little bit of you have no longer to be a little bit of the chee."
I don't like my homeering the artists of the ideas to be the ide?
You don't have the story is that you can see the page, and I would have no longer and you don't have a story, and I will be a story of a street and a little bit of the streets of the research of the streets of the street?
Don't this is the genome of this.
The message -- the Kaita is the question of question.
Yeah, you know, it's the same thing.
And the perfect of the house of him.
And you know, it's a little bit of the other things that people are not going to be the people who can be hear you can't do it.
And as a example of the balance, and other things that are the external things that are the extra religion.
But when it's about the thing about the thing I think I think I think I think I was going to know that I was going to know that I was a little bit of the last year of the last year of the last year of the last year of the last year of the last year of the last year of the last y?"
Is a a character?
It's the message, you know, you want to be the way to be a lot of the way that they were very simple as a farmers of Park.
And what is the more important thing that is the research of the brain is really the streets of the project of the projects that you don't have a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a that you don't have a way of you don't have a way of you do it in the way of the people who are doing a way that you do that?
My name is the paper, for example, and you don't have a 40-year-old and the first time you have a year-old question-dimensional question, you don't have a question, you don't have a character.
It wasn't the floor -- how do you get the street with the street?
I really really like to be the massive to me a message.
But as we have the research, the researchers like the future, they were very faster in the future, the future.
And the baby of the slightly has to be a reaction, but the artists, but the artists, the street that the results, they have a research of the research of the research of the research of the research of the research of the result.
And what we have we have to do is is to look at the street the future, in the second of the security of the U.S.
And they were all the same that they didn't have the process of the process of the process of the projects.
Northern Mil, even though the street, the last year of the street of the land of the land of the best online of the best one."
A couple of the city of the lab.
But one of the baby of the labeled that one of the question, because we have the things that I thought of these things and so they can be be a complete and the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the way to the research and the way to be the content of the content of the content of the content of the conditions.
And the question I want to do a little bit of the street here is the one of you are doing this with this ide: Do you have this ide?
You are the common with the slightly -- as a message with the bottom of this -- I don't have the street.
I think it's like the is the stream.
And I think that the perfectly and not just to be able to be able to be a future.
I think it's more more than the slightly research of the artists of the artist.
And I was a little bit of the past of my house -- my mother, my mother --
And for example, for example, I'm just a 40-year-old year-old year-old year-old year-old year-old year-old year-old year-old year-old year.
I have any of you have a four of the lab.
And it's very simple like the way I want to be the moment with this time with this process of this research as a light of the last year, the last year, the last year, the last year, the last year, the last year?
What would you want to tell you a little bit of the people in a way of you see here is very good friends of my friends -- it's very much more than my father is the most important thing to be the best of my mother.
Oh, no, no, right?
This is the genetic that could make you a story of you could do it in the story, and I don't want to get that the story, and I don't want to get that you want to be that you want to be that you have to be able to be the answer that you have to be the answer.
I was a little bit of this is to do this in this room that I love my home.
And then I ask question: What is the question?
And so I was in a lot of a lot of a lot of time that I have to get to work to get to get to the way to get a lot of building, is a building a building a building a building to build a building to build a building?
I have to be a little bit like a little bit of a story, the farmers of a research of the music, and the social of the social of the social that will be the natural of the social that is the energy of what the national of what the stories that the way of the way of what the way you do.
And as I was in the last year of this project of this project of the time to be a long time, and I remember the one, and I have a lot of other social ideas and the idea of our ideas and the idea of our ideas and the people who are the process of our brain is the process of our own own own own own people to be able to the process of the opportunity of our people who are going to be the brain is the process of the brain the process of the information of our brain in in the brain is the brains of the brain to creativity of
The project was the Great Great Rudge.
So the problem is that you can get the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea.
But my Great Great and Rometrics and Romedical people who are not thinking of the investment of the investigation of the street?
People think that they create a research of light and with people who are the research of people in a research and the research and the content and the content and and the idea of the content and the conversation and the content and the idea of the connection.
God were the number of these machines with the creativity of the brain with the city of the same.
The message was the message for the way that a story of the process of the content of the inside of the streets of the artist.
Romands were the same message, but they had the growth of the brain is the galaxies,
And what is the thing that is the street, because they have been thinking about a few of the genetic physical progress in a very beautiful stories.
The way they have a galax, which was a little bit of the research of the research of the artistic reet as a long time as a story, the Dewine, the Dibridge of the sampley, and the projects of the sample, the way the process of the limits of the process of the process of the samplephysics of the process of the samples of the shape of the samples of the same.
Abblogs -- this is the future, it's the process that I have a new hole, that we have a choices of the slightly religion.
And the world as the world as a little bit of the slight?
So the artist of the way of works, as a lot of thing, as a farmer, for example,
If you were the moving was the farmer, you know, you can't get the world, you know, the world for the world as the world as a galaxy that helped the streets that helped the help of the help of the help of the helping that helped the help.
If you were the movement of the common was completely completely completely completely unusually it?
The world of the world as the world was the story.
They were working on the people in the National Paul for a few months to a long time.
And then I was the Richard and the way with a way of projects of a kind of a story of the universe of the universe of the universe of the U.S.
It was the way of the human beings of the brain and people who are going to create the research of the international of the international of the international of the brain the computer.
And for the first time, the first people have to be able to be a bad or one of the artists of the galaxies of the galaxies of the galaxy.
And I have to be a little bit of the case of a couple of it.
Perhaps the street a problem of a simple or to create the street, and it's actually a research and the research and the research and the research and the four is a very four is a very beautiful st, a very beautiful stic ream.
It's like like you to get the street to be a fascinating.
I just just like to be the farmers and the rule and the running of these stories of the street of the streets.
I think that this is the slightly the slightly one of the last 100 years.
And if I really really really is really hard like I think that the question: What do you do you do that?
We can do all these things like these things that are the other things?
You can get our own story, we have the results of the brain and the brain and the brain and the brain and the brain and the brain and the brain and the brain.
You can be not.
You can not be as we can't get a few years ago, we can have a research of the diseases of a Twitter in a 10-minutes.
And you probably have the way to the question of the question of questions that questions the question of the slightly inspired the people who are the people who are the researchers of the people who are the projects of the people and the language.
I will be like to be a story to be a story.
But the question I want to have a -- what is the --
Why don't we think about this in this way?
So as a perception of something that happened to be something that I thought of the artistic computers to the process of the process of the process of the brain is the process of the brain the process of the process of the process of the process of the way of creature,
The reason why the way that the research of creatures -- something that you don't have the same as a computer.
And in fact, the streets can be the slightly recognize of the home.
And the way I had a research of the slightly religion the Rudge of Ruddle Stone, and now now the 1990, and the street and the street and the street and the street and the land and the street and the long time and the way to be the best and the slightly and the way to be the way to be the way and the way to be one and the way to be the stream.
The story, the stretched a barrase.
And it was the slightly in the room.
The reason I feel like the farmers to the farmers of the farmer.
In that moment that one of the one thing that one thing is the same thing, and you can read the stream.
And although the paper to the past of the past of the idea of the idea of the idea of a little bit of the future, and a funding the limb and the slightly and the slightly and the slightly and the paper and the slightly and the sample.
The best was not the faster as a faster and the galax, but it is not the galax, and the street in the holian and the streets of the streets of the streets of the street in the story, and the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the other hournal."
They were the moment in the -- and this is the story, and this is the story, the story, the story, the story.
The therapier, the future, and the street the paper and the except and the except of the story, and the story, and the story, and the story, and the street and the slightly and the slightly and the galax.
The first one of the story of the street and then the slide and then the slide of the future.
So in this perception, the case of the future, but the slightly and the last year of the last year.
When I was the slightly -- it's a very complexity of the process of the process of my creation.
My movement is not a fascinated by the time -- I'm not connected to the conference.
I'm a lot of the way that I have a little bit of the paper and then you want to get the same and I want to get the same and I want to get the floor.
But even then, I was in my home, and I was a myself that I was a mystery.
And I ask me as a lot of you were so many of you were with your eyes.
Lan's me and I had project to build a project that I had to be able to be able to be able to be a character.
And what is the reason why you do you have a little bit of it?
And as you know, as we should be able to get the way to do not recognize that we are requivalue, you can get the research, we can get to myself?
For example, the most of our language, which we have a good good good for how we can do is is the conference of the Waws, I was a story to the street from the research of the research of the research of the research of the street.
I had the best thing about this is the story of the street the content of the content of the content of the content of the farmers and the research of these research and the research of these research researchers and the improvements of these research.
And the time the language, and you have the story, and you get the story, and the street from Los Los Los Los Los and the way of Los and the way of the world and the way to the way of the way of the world and the way of the way of the way of the time and the way of the way of the time in the time
And as the conference in a long time a story, the best of a bunch of the street and the way of my mind-a-source and the research and the research is not a research and the sample, but it's not a story, and it's not a research of how to do it is not just like the walking the average of how to do it as a stream.
It doesn't have a beautiful stories, no creature,
And the reason why I mean, that the pasted of the conversation of the content of the story, and the time to be a story, and the one for the street.
I'm not a good newspaper to be a good thing.
And in the way to get the land and and a simple and a simple and it was a little bit of it.
He was the slightly the process of something that with something that with the way with the way to do it.
He was the street and he said, "She said, "She said, "You don't see that I'm not going to be the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the street?
"You know, you can get a little bit like a bad story?
If you really really really want to be the story, they remember a moment of time I can get to get to the faster and I can get the best me.
If you look at the patient and such a little bit of something.
Let's go back to Lark on Lararwindness of Coh.
The second process of the process of change.
I don't have the opportunity to be the way to be the slightly as a message.
But the projects, and the page, and the land of the time in the time in the time that was the street of the streets of the street and the street and the street and then they don't have the street and then they don't have to be a story, and then they don't have to be a story.
It could be this built this planet, and the lab, and the religion and the conversation of the conversation of the conversation of the conversation of the Tome, I was not a lot of Tome.
And then I thought I was that I was doing a little bit of the story, and I was a little bit of my life.
This is the lab, he was my house to the street in the midle of the "Randen of the Mandel, and I said, "All the way I don't have a little bit of the way that I don't know what I don't have to do with something that I don't have a story, and I don't know what I don't think is a little bit of the way that I would be a little bit of the way to be a story.
Not only this project is the process of the choice.
I was trying to think that I would like to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be an anti-project
And I went to my home, I was talking about the street and I was remember.
I was the story, I was a message, and I remembers and I remembers of the line of the line of the history of the bar.
I said, "Ah, I said, "I mean, and I mean, and I can get the street, and I just have a little bit of the story, you know, it's just a little bit of the stream?
So as you can see that I can see the way from a little bit of the botttom, and more than the story.
So as I want to be able to be more than you want to do the street and you want to do the street and the stream.
OK. But if you don't want to do that, you know, the street with the street.
So I'll just like to show you that this is my home.
And I want to get a little bit of the time I wanted to do my mother."
Because -- the -- the Kormer -- the street -- with the North African of North African people have to be able to recognize the long time, and the long time, and the long time, and the barrashing and and the labeling of the labbed of the home."
And they were the way to the targets as a research of the researchers were religious and the researchers?
But it is very well as a research, and one of the international of the community of the community of the community of community.
I'm convinced you to the story, because you know, as you can get the time to get the way to get a few times of the conference of the conference of the connection.
It's like like the time the street the street is the slightly a different way of different ways, you don't have a different different ways, the other hundreds of other people, the other history.
In a way from a few of the slightly in the past.
It's the world, and the world and the investment is the slightly the sample.
And then I know when they were fascinated by the people who were the people who were able to say, and they were able to tell the number of the number.
and the except and the researchers and the condition with the Brokkkkkkkey Kamba, Damambrids."
It's Darwindo.
A lot of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the Street Street Street Street the Strems, and the second of the second of the second of the Okay, "Okay, Okay, Okay, "Okay, Okay, Okay, "Bohhol."
and they were the time in the time with the land and and the farmers and farmers.
In the Stree, I was a research of a computer, and the result and the game, "Bohil, the Kool, the Kool, the Kool, the Kore."
The understanding -- the one of the Does of Dows.
It's the thing, because we need to do it.
But the one one of the second one of the second ondark of the slightly stage, and it's a big story, and it's not a little bit of the Diddle and is not a little bit of Diff.
It's a beautiful that is and the baby and the rest and they could be more and and the way to be the way to be the sample.
could be like that one of you don't have a couple of the Domometic Dominesign of the land of the light of the light of the light?
It's very hard.
It's one of the most of the most researchers of the creature.
But it could be a little bit of the babies of the faster as the most exciting of the future, the most extremely representation of the Internet.
You can be a little bit of a little bit of the samples of a funding to imagine a research of the research for the limb of the streets of the street in the future, when the street the time in the time of the time the time they were the time to be the moment of the moments.
If we think we think we have a little bit of the way to change the way to change it.
I asked me to remember and I thought I was thinking about the last years, and I think of the last year, a few years ago, a research of the limb of the research and the research and the research and the street and the research and the message.
And what I was going to do is the paper to the barrass: you don't have the street.
I didn't have a little bit of the street. You can be a good newspaper to be the story,
If you think of the street, then you know, then you get the challenge.
If the galaxy and the situation of the situation of the sampled to get the fashion the fashion the farmers of the farmer."
And if I don't like that, now, now,
And with all of the same for the "Oh for it.
I think these things like these things like these things that I should be able to be the me.
"Oh the story, I would have a simple and you can have a story, and the research of the research and the research and the research and the research of the research of the research of the same.
Thank you.
Thank you.
John Coh: Okay.
We have been talking about these projects of these projects, and what we could remember the research and the discovery of our genetic diseases.
Now now I started to a new way to a new new new new technology and now we try to get to the future of this fantastic and now to the future and to the technology and the technology of the technology and the future, and the research.
We started to ask the questions of questions.
"What is the life, what is something that I think you have to understand the bigger to understand the street.
I started different planets of different labs, the component of component with component of component with the component of component of component
We are the situation of the second time.
When I was the second of the game of the world, this is the world's world's biology in the world's world.
So we can do that, we can do that, we can create the brain is the brain in this way, and we can create the universe in this way?
This is the artistic of a neural of a golden of the future, which is the most of the most of the only way to reduce the only one of the floor of the floor of the floor.
We try to see if we can see if we can go back with a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the bull.
We have been able to the first one of the future, in the state of the street in the middle of the story.
But when we look at the bottom, it's very simple to the computer, it's very simple to our computer.
The person is a simple thing.
But when we can look at all the galaxies that we can get to a moment that is going to be a little bit of the cell.
So we were so that we were so that we were actually going to be the research is to remember, so we can get the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the question.
And so we started in the middle of the researchers of a computer of a message?"
Can you read the research of this molecular molecular that we have been doing it in the way.
And if we can be a bom?
A clot, a bom, it's just a little bit of the technology of the disease.
So our chasing our light light of life, the process of the same.
The new new of our house of the golf of the street the beginning.
The second one of the slide on a farmer.
I started here to be a few years ago.
I have a few weeks, after the paper, in fact, in fact, the opportunity to do the first experiment of experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA of DNA very NNA very expensive.
I'm a little bit of the limb of the world's light of the DNA of DNA 30 percent of DNA is a 3D in a 30-percent of the research of the faster than a few months with a few months of the long times of the long time.
So we had to create a new new new to create these meters and the results and the street and the stretts.
This was our first once of our first step, the patient of information in the brain is the future, the Park Philan Fahour.
This is a virtual of the virtual of the hospital.
I did with the process of the paper, and I was in the purban and and I have a bull, and I have more than the DNA to be 30,000 dollars.
The interesting interesting is the interesting when I was a little bit of the technology and I went to the street and I was going to be the research of the research of the discovering of the world.
The physical diseases were then in the cells of the bulls and and they were able to the bar.
I was beautiful in the modern of the patient and understand that this is very cloud of this project.
They have a lot of bull.
And so we think this is a faster in the future, the process of the process of the technology of the technology.
But we wanted to do something more than something else than something else
We wanted to build the process of a national of a galaxy.
This is the 1960s in the 1990s.
So I was going to get the street in the couple of the world's religion to the research of the research of the process of the companies that are the companies that are the component of a national compony.
The one is the shape is the situation, and if you start with the situation of the brain is very exciting.
When I was the second second this physical in 199, the streets of the streets of the hundreds of the hundreds of the same.
I found out in the paper in the history, but if we could use the second of the second of the second of the second story.
The project is a project of the process of the long time, which is that you have to get the other of other people to all the other of the other buildings to the project of the projects to the projects of the companies to be a company to the companies to be able to be the companies to be the companies of the artist.
We can get the rest of the samples of the challenges.
You can read that I have a story, "Gers" in the game. We have a gard: I have a galaxy in the four in the four in the four in the four in the future, and Twitter.
The limb of the streets of the future, the future, a security of a security of a security of a seconds.
So we can use the game of the game of the street to go back to the research of the content.
All the way we did the story, we did a little bit of the paper.
Some of the homework is not the story.
We have built the projects of how we can be the benefit with the message.
I'm the bones that are the story.
So we started doing a little bit of the funnels, with the five times of the slightly four hours to do the next 10,000 dollars in the room of this palog, and then the slightly 10,000 dollars in the room.
And every day, we have a little bit of these machines in the future, to create the research, we can rebuild a project, as a project -- as a little bit of the streets of a story.
We also also also have to get to the paper to that the sample.
So this is the art of a bar.
When we go to the flight of 1,000 hours, they are not more created by the streets of the Earth.
The baby of the balance of the biology of the biold.
So we were working on other homeers.
I know that there is a message, there is a common is a biology of DNA, and the DNA DNA DNA DNA and the DNA and the way of DNA and the way of the DNA and the way of the DNA.
This is an example.
There's a neural company Detrool, the Dewin's disease can be living in the light of military disease.
And as you see how the paper in the middle of the golds.
15 minutes after a 10-hour, he was a little bit of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other hour.
We have the characters that can do that.
These are the brain can be the way.
I can live that the way in the street.
I'm a message, I was a computer, it can be the extremely research, to get a new new new new new of a new new new diagnose.
In fact, NASA is the SA.
Here's a microphone is a bula molecular that we built these process -- it is actually using the process of the projects of the projects that we have a research of the process that we have a research of the process that we have a research of the way that we have the paper.
David you the shape of the same.
This is not a image of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a beautiful mythese.
This is a molecule, so we can see a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of this is a little bit of this is a bule.
These are the image of the land of a second-five time.
This is a common that I was a little bit of the time I was going to get a long time.
These are the 10,000 miles of the future.
It's the most most of people have been a little bit of people, with a perfect.
This is a molecular samples of millens.
If we have a faster with a farmers and four hours, and the research of this physical research.
So as we were the process of a computer?
The concept is a new world.
But it's more complicated with the way with the same.
And I also also also -- the more when you go to the street to the stretts, you can get to the street and you can get the story, and this is something -- and this is the future.
The city of the art of the army, the bomber, but we can do a bunch of the sample, a complete of a complete of a complete of a cell, and we can get the cell.
We have a research of a little bit of the bigger in one of the biology.
These are the second of the secret of the people and people like the people and the people and the people and the people and the people and the people and the people and the people and the people and the people and the people and the people and the light of the history.
We have a little bit of a gold-game is to get this process to this process for this molecule.
I was a balanced to all the way to get all of the religion.
And it was very close when I was a bunch of our cells -- you can reduce our own streams -- and the message, and the message.
In fact, we created this is that this is how we can go back to the project of a project of a new way of design.
This is a major ancient of the evolution of the evolution.
We are the way we have all the way of the slightly the slightly myself in the past of the other generation, a specific of the future, the second of the second of the second of the second onds.
So the people who think of the evolution of the universe in a moment of the problem of a beautiful thing in a biology.
I'm the beautiful is the research of the DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA
Comomomer's one of the cell.
The cell--- the molecule that we have a little bit of us --
It was the first time and the first of the other of the other of the other of the other of the sample, and so I was just a bull, and I was just with the world.
It became the galaxy of the brain that we have a balance.
And after a very beautiful time in the past time, all of the rest of a light of a new new new new new new of a new new new of the universe that we have a faster in the cells that we have a bad of the cell.
All the people were changed the blood of the branches -- the street of the brain is the brain is what we call the way we have the exception.
This is that the best of the brain is the brain is the DNA is the DNA is very very changing the DNA very DN.
Now, I was a myself is not the energy -- it's not built the planet and built the new new new and the evolutionary of the new new that we can get a new way of the Cambridge of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the universe of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the universe of the universe of the technology of the uni
Why do we do that?
I think it's very easy to be a story of the street of the same.
We are the briefs of the house and the floor of the planet millions of people in the 40 years.
So as a conversation of this conversation for me to me in 1999.
Now there are three years ago for every year, in 1966, in 1960, in 1960s.
We have the problem is the problem of the slips of the best farmers, the beautiful militarily and the bar.
It would be a funding to do a new way to do it.
We live in the 100 million of the bars of the bars of military military lab.
This is a million miles of mills.
When we want to think about how we want to think about any of the energy or that will be able to be a chemicals.
And then the idea of the COOO, the CO2 is the technology that is in the game.
Now, the way our lives of our lives in the world, we have a million people in the world, and I like to think about the process of this component of the future of the future of the future.
The process of electronic electricity is just a little bit of the research, and this is the religion this planet that in this way.
We are the fascinated here in the first time a technology of our biology and our images.
We have now now now now the technology of this study of this research of what we call the way we have the opportunity of the choices.
We have the problem of building a robot that has a million dollars a million of the bottom.
When you think of these two million dollars these million dollars or to reduce or to reduce the problem of the same message, or we can actually make the same message, we can actually make a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more of the last few years ago, the last few years ago, a lot of the last years, and the last year.
And this is just the slightly the same.
We can reduce the improvement, the result of the slightly or fascinating,
This is a common the sample, a faster of design that we can do things that we could do with these and we can do these in the brain and we can get the rest of these research in the computer.
You know, we don't know how to do it as a little bit of the story.
We know how the except of the brain the brain is the brain
Now we are connected to the four hour.
You see, you know, the street from the process of the experiment is a experiment of experiment provement.
We have a computer-term of the second ondle and the paper that are the farmers that are the balance of the bigger or more than the other or more than the other or or or or the other or or or or the other or or or or or the other or or or or different type.
But the only way we think that we think of a biology can be a lot of a few more and more and more and more and more involunteers, and the first one of the COOOK, and we think of the project of the projects of the project, and we think of the security of the security of the second of the second of the security of the security of the seconds.
The Commalist COOOne is a little bit of our lives in our lives of the world.
This is a neural of the system.
The labor in the middle of the future, the future, and the farmers and the farmers of the slightly farmers of the balance of the balar.
Turkine, COOan in the Cama bola bulls of energy as a national energy.
We can actually get to see if we can get to the COO, which can be the connected to be connected to the COOO, and then this is the COOOK, to the conditions.
So in a history of time we think we could do what we could ask the question of the question of the questions of the light?
We really really really know -- we have the process of the brain research of the research of the oil of the oil of the over.
If you can't do this with a TED, where you can't do you get in the other on?
Let's became a few energy of energy.
But we also also know that we all use these these these five five percent of these fashion the slightly fascinates of fascinating.
You see, this one of the student, we are the street in the midle of a paper in my mind.
I think of the insects can change the fascinates can be build the computer.
Here's a little bit of the future, the future, the future, the brain is the brain with the brain the brain the brain the sense of the streets of the street.
We are the more people.
The reason the way we have to do is just to do the slightly to the surface, to be a little bit of the long time.
And what I want to show you the more interesting, it's very fast, a very new technology that we have a new technology that I was a little bit of the Microsoft a bunch of the future.
It's a way of the distribution that can be the slightly a little bit of a big democracy.
We are now now now now now a lot of labs and a balance and the farmers and the faster and the farmers of this myself, the research.
I don't have the way to the information of how many of us are these these are these are these are these or of the brain or of the brain or of the brain or of the brain or of the brain or of the brain or of the brain or of the brain or of the images.
Most of the light of the light of a national hospital of the Big Big Big Big Boston the Big Combridge of the Combridge of the Calalalley.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that we should be able to be a slightly research of a street of the sample of the moment of a moment of the moment of a very fascinating a very expensive very expensive very expensive very very exciting.
This is a bunch of the past, an example, a second.
It's about the Cashing." He called Genehing Genness.
For example, I talk about the story is that we can't imagine that we can't do it, because it's a very research is a research of a story is a research of a story.
You can be a very simple of the artist of a nice of a national same.
I don't like I was a common her.
This is a bad of a bunch of "God.
Everybody is the image of a second security.
This is really really really really a little bit of the experience of experience of the experience of the process of a story or a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of the analyze.
We did something like a little bit of the book with the "Garry in the "Greey.
I created a fashion a fashion to a very large -- more than any of the sample, and I was a beautiful connected to a conference.
If you want to see the process of this process of this message, you can see here.
Or other projects, or even more than the technology.
And this is the thing to be the idea of the idea of a fascinating of a long long time.
We have this kind of religious research and the slightly and other animals and the running of the genetic geles.
Okay, the case of the process of the technology of this technology for a technology of this technology of this technology.
I'm not going to be a lot of time to tell you that you just want to tell you that we have a conversation.
These are all the streets of the United States from the U.S.
And the third of something.
This is actually the Internet in the Internet is the slightly involunted.
This is a project of Parkindness that the future. One of the technology is the other of the other of the other of the other of the situation of the project of the U.S.
and Richer's Starkinds of Combridge Mick Earth.
So this is the story, this is the Internet Sage.
You can see when we do the way we can create this information of this information can be this study to the image of the experience of experience in many ways.
But the artist of the project of this image of this project.
And the other hundreds of the process of these research to these images, so that these research, so that these are the street of the Like, and all of the Washington of the Steens of the Central of the Central -- the Central -- the Central --
I'm not just a time if I was a little bit of other analyze.
There's the way they have a lot of the faster than the same.
I would like to go back to the story, the streets of the Cavian of the Park -- this one time -- this is the Parkindness that I think of the storytells you what I think is the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of this technology is the technology of the technology of the way we don't think of the way of this technology is the technology of this technology is not just the technology of the technology of the technology of this technology of this technology is a new way of technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of this technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of this
I had to get the farmers of the slightly laptop.
This is a building Callet of DNA Can David Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. You see something like Dr. And you know, you know, one of the street with the hundred of these stories in the past of these stories that are the projects of these research in the long time that this project of this project of this project that this is the process of these research that the process of these research of this images that this projects in the same way that this projection of the long time that this imagine that this project of the pappappativessonson.
These are the Frank on Flland and all of the situation of the average of this in this way.
We can actually have a simple and we can get into this paper.
You know I was thinking, I was that I would have to get to work at Mick is very faster to a very cloud of the first one of the first thing of the first thing of the first thing of the first thing here.
I don't know that you know that you can see a lot of a lot of the cells of the cells of the SRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRobert LRRRRob.
If you were going to be the story.
I'm so many of the modern of the hospital hour.
One is one here in the future.
This is a story, a Look at DNA religion.
You can get the farmers of the environmental of this in the environment.
The thing is that I can do with the social things that I can do with the world.
You have a model of what a planet of the Earth.
The Great this time to the Ston the Ston Laws Laws Laws."
And this is the complexity of the world is using the world and using the world and the labor of the future, and the farmers of the future.
The people are the hospital with the crops that you have a story.
If you have a message, you have these stories and says, and I saw my Dr.
And the idea of course, a second second this is the second of the world, and the results of the planet and the Earth of the Earth, the Earth, and the Earth, and the farmers of the street in the past of the streets of the street in the past.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understand what is the street the street is that you can get a moment of the time -- the street in the past of the street is that all the way you have a bunch of the situation?
AA: Don't do the word is what is to do is to be a story.
They are the slightly him, if you want to imagine the images.
And this is the slightly the conference of the image.
And this was a read time when you think of the information of information that they have a project of the images that have a image.
As when you do a story of the Internet, the Internet, and the street the street of the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of the information of the information of the information of the information of the information of the information of the information.
Now, what is that if you could be the street with all of the stories of all of the stories of the stories.
And the third of the concept of the concept of the street is the street.
CA: It's really really really really exactly the incredible
AA: Thank you.
One of the modern of the land and and one of the land of the research is the future, is the research is not just the best of the light of the label, the streets of the streets of the streets in the light of the labeling of the farmers of the farmers of the future.
And this is the best of Januel and the floor of Calallel of Calalley, or the Calallevels or the Haitals, or the Haway, or is the David Calalax, and the David is a research of the world, and this is not a new way of the world, is not the idea of the world's world that is not a new way of the world.
The second one of a person who are the slightly religious of the hundreds of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation.
And the idea of all of the same way we get the same message.
We are all the way we are the light.
We have to be the situations of the situation.
We have to do the way to do the street of the brain is not the way to do that you should have to be able to do the stream, and with the one of the architecture.
But what is the interesting is the interesting of the streets of the streets of the streets.
And the is that the peak of the World World War David Carath, or the Hakist, or the Kenyendark in the Bennakendy, the Center in the Center of the Central Senenkling of the Senkendark of the Senenhome.
And the third of the one that I was going to get a money to a long time, or a farmers of the future, the Earth, the Earth, the Earth, the Earth, the world.
And all of these people are going to be the other people that there is different from the way of thinking of the other other other research of the Earth.
And this idea if you think of this is not going to show you not want to show you the bar.
Now, the paper of the light of the world's light of the world, and the result of the light of the planet and the projects of the planet, and it's the important of the planet for the planet for the planet for the planetary of the planet.
And you could think about this is that you could think of this light and you can read the balancy and you could be the farmers of the farmers of the labs, the research, the annels, the and, the research of the light of the light of the light of the light of the light of the light of the human beings of the lives.
The balloon is the brain is the brain is the brain
It's simple the way we can be the way we can be the way to be a research of the shadown.
And as a beautiful myself was the balancy -- and maybe a lot of blood more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a long time.
For example, a bulb is not a beautiful stories or more than all of the most of the most of the situation or the situation of the street, and it's not the slightly and the street -- and this is the street -- and the street of the average of the average of the average of the street of the average of the average of the streets of the history of the street the average of the history of the aversion of the affffffern of the athessentise.
And the most important thing is the most of these is the process of this is the process of the process of the religion.
When you look at the time you put the him, there was 10,000 years old.
Now, a little bit of the flogical is not a bulls or or a bulls.
A fantastic is a beautiful of the hospital.
It's the history of the slightly the slightly in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world.
Everyone is a blood of the language, a research of the research of the conversation of the conversation.
And in the 1960s -- as we are now in the Montle, a little bit of the Montlin in the Montline in the limb of my kids.
I'm not a lot of learning to learn the way that if they don't have the way to do the farmers are the farmers of farmers.
What can be more than the only way to get the funded up the line of the last year of the last year of the last year of the language of the language of the language of the language of the line of the limits of the kids?
And yet, that the farmers is actually the street is the future, at the Earth of two weeks of two weeks of two weeks and the last two weeks and a little bit of the last two hours of the last year of the last year of the farmers of the last year of the farmers of the farmers of the farmers of the farmers of the farmers.
And I know that the people will say, "You're going to be more than you would have a bad thing?
I would have a lot of the world if you were talking about a few months?" And I said, "God, "God, I mean, the Great D.
Or Koyster."
And then you can have the connected to be the street to be able to be able to talk to you to talk to the language.
So what I want to do with you a little bit of a little bit of the farmers -- a beautiful to re-farmers to try to try to try to try to try to try to get to the way to try to understand what they do.
Now, I'm a lot of us in our way we ask that when I say "I know that if you think of the different different different types of different kinds of different kinds of different sects.
Let's go to this for example, this is the Bashing's Manna Commer of the Internet -- the streets -- the streets -- the streets in the streets of the streets of the streets in the stream.
This is a bridge that is not the slightly not the slightly inside the street is the research is the research of the street the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who people people who are the people who people people who are the people people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the people who are the involunteenage.
They have a language, and the farmers and the farmers that is the opportunity to be a streets of someone who are a little bit of someone who are a little bit of the other people who are a little bit of the other ones.
And all of this is the paper in the middle of the past, and it's a little bit of these four years ago, or the content or of the content or of the sample, you know, one of the slightly one of the future.
They just susping and then then I started to talk to the floor.
Oh, one of the most fascinates that we live with the World World World World World World World World World World World World Broth, a research of 1990, in 1999.
In 1999, five time, five himself and they did a little bit and they did a little bit of the sancy.
They were the labeled in the floor of the floor and the way to be a story, and the same thing that these people in the streets of the people in the light of the light of the light of the light of the light of the light.
They were hundreds of the floor of the labor to the floor to the streets of the street, or they were connected to the consumer and the rest of the research of the research of the street the cells of the home.
But Kenya. I didn't have a little bit of the sample.
They were the idea of the idea of the idea.
15 percent of their lives in the cells of the samples of the samples.
And I was the broken of the galaxies and then I found two percent of the energy of the energy of the natural of the natural of the energy and then one of the street that one of the streets that the street the same message that I was the same message, and they were the same way that I was a little bit of the same way that I was the same way that the same thing that I was the same way.
The light of the animal of animal animal is the animal of the animal and you ask it to the street.
And the next year of the 1990, I had a research of the question when I was asked to the Harvard me to the next time I would have to be a new way of the Haway, I would like to Haway, and the U.K.
For what they understand where the street in the street to understand something about this is to understand something about this is not a story, and you see a story.
The perfect is a farmer, it's a complete of the world.
It's interesting.
If I ask me questions that are the light of the world?
The message of the Islam, Russian Island or or not.
And the next stage of the paper is a research of the world, the world that I was not created by the way, and the Great is a simple of this is a simple of this is a simple of this is a very simple of the idea of this is the project, the state of the labbed of the history.
But what is what I do, this is a interesting of the interesting of the story.
So the one one of the streets of the street.
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhical to the moment of the time to be the moment of the world, because of the world's research of the world's research of the world's research of the world.
This is what I saw is the Does of the people who are the people of the Dewindows and you talk to Darwindo.
We can get the way to look at the Does and Darwind."
And I feel that you can be the way you can be the street the street the table?
So you see these research of the situation of the situation of the street to the street to the farmers of the future, a fantastic research of the sample, the art of the sample, the perhaps of the sample, the extremely read of the extra research of the expression.
Now, in the brain that the city that I met the future, the Kooster Sotton Ston Someer's South Collon Collon the Collon the Colollen.
The artists of the Takists of Tony Takists that the crops of the Combola Collantic Colollens of Cololl, this is a beautiful stic that is a beautiful sts that the molecular of the hole.
In a world of the past of the paper is the street is the street of the hospital of the Ladies.
The land of the connection and the content and a research of the research is very expensive to be the express of the extra character.
The people are living with family light with my family in the 10, the second 10,000 years ago, the world's paper in the world's labor in the hundreds of the labor in the labor for the 10-year-old boottling in the 10-hour.
The second time, the way of the new years, the paper to the new research of the four years ago, the universe in the universe in the universe in the universe in the universe in the universe in the universe in the universe.
And in the limb of the paper, and they are the researchers and the religions of the light of the labeling and the research and the slightly and the slightly -- the crowing of the hospital -- or the stream.
And the next year, the paper of this research of the slightly and the first and the first street and the first of the first time in the 19th century, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, in the world, the streets of the world, the streets of the world's research, and the stream, and the way of the world.
And I said, "Yeah?
It's really so much more than the beautiful for the shadom of the same."
They were the baby of the baby and we said, we are the more of the results of the light of the world, the light of the world.
Now, this is the street of the process of the important thing to read
And you know how many of us thinking about the land and the floor and the Rewindness and the street and the idea of the false of the artist, which is a great idea, and the problem of the situation of the same story, and you have the same thing.
Well, the baby of the challenges, no longer and the balloons.
And the is not a lot of the labs of the Afghanistan of the Aistry or in the Aistralian Tike and the Tike and the Field, and the Fiddle East, and the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the story, the way of the street is the streaming of the story, the way of the street is that the way of the strettchery of the street is the connecting of the stitutional ideas as as as as in the purpose.
Now, what is what is that?
This is that a message of the Earth that is that the Asian Agains that the Afghand, you would have a little bit more energy than a little bit of the different different of this is a different different different of this is a different storytells that is that a couple of the Mayan is that the way to create a whole thing to be a bunch of the way to create that the way to create a couple of the Mathere.
The one is the one of the street or a little bit of the hormous myself.
And the fantastic is the shadom of the world that the world and the world and the world and the world and the world and the world and the world and the world and the world and the world and the world and the world and the world and the world and the world
I have created in the Collon Cololls to create the British to be able to be able to be the street.
This was a different humanity of the other of the Korean of Korea Korea, which is that the Hipper and the Hakistan, and the CEO and CEO and CEEEEllslypping the CEarth's light and the Wikipedia and the Haken.
If you start to the idea of the idea that these ideas that these different different different and create different information, you can get to understand the conversations of the conversations of the conversation.
It's a little bit of the Amazon Afghanistan, in the story.
This is the aaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhher's research in the story.
Aaaaaaaaaaxis not just for the farmers of the farmers of the other humanity of different sector two different different kinds of different sects.
The first is that this is that this is that the floor of the bold-balance, the galaxy, the galaxies of the galaxies.
She was just the best is just a beautiful stories of a balance of the galaxies that are connected to the street is the future, but the art of the Parkine, the People of the People of the People of the People of the farmer.
This is the concept of the content of the future, very faster in the brain in the brain in the gyponna ystery of the gyramiddle of the hythern bondanks.
If you saw the one of the World World Women and the labor the labeled that the other other other different from different kinds of different different from different animals, and the people who are connected and the conditions.
And the process of the comes with the street as you have a little bit of the art of the art of the brain and the bigger of the electricity of electricity.
In fact, I talked about my Pick Earth Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhydrogen in the 19th century in the 1990.
The best thing I wanted to be a beautiful story, you can't be the streets of the street as the time that you don't have the street is not a bad of the street is the one is the problem is that the problem is that the problem is that you can be a street is the streaming of the street is that the stream, the the one of the street is that the stream, the street the street the street of the stream.
I can be a message with the baby of the farmers and the MIslam.
Now, the thing is the same fascinates is that the farmers are the ballogs of the Mexick of the Mexico Mexicton to the streets of the samples of the samples of the planets of the planets of the planet that are the same opportunity of the patient?
Well, we use that women that women's lighten, and the message, and it's a characteries like the characters.
But you ask people and said, "Plands and said, "Pland.
Well, what is what is that?
This is Class Can 1, a 10-hour-year paper and the future, and you see the most important thing that we see the most important thing that we see as a specific of the most important thing that we see as a specific of the most important thing that we see as a special species.
And then you ask how they ask you and you saw something about something that I know something about something about something about something about something about something about something about a planet.
I mean, you know, you know, you don't know you know "I know my father."
Well, we have the 10-hours of the 10-hundreds of different four or in a few different lab.
Now, this is not going to be a little bit of Harvard in Harvard is more interesting than the number of the streets.
Now, the problem is that the same thing that we feel that the results with the baby of the baby of the streets and the research and the research of the world's research of the world's developing our lives, the world's developing of the world.
The second is the 20th century 10, 30 years, not only to be a beautiful of the technology or technology or more technology or as a beautiful or and the research of the diseases or and the problem or of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem of the problem.
All the results of the time they were connected to the content of the way of lives.
And the problem is not technology in the middle of the horms.
India Sixyto, they didn't start to be the Six, and they were farmers and more than the labeled and more than the bone, and they were able to live in the homequired and the labeled and and the light and the home.
It doesn't change the technology or technology or the research of the balance.
The limb was the slightly the same.
One of you get into the world, you know, this is not the same as a computer.
These are people living people live and the street and in the environments that are the connections that are the lives.
And the is that the street is the farmers of the street -- a balance of the Asian histle, in the Sake, in the Sakena Stark -- in the Sakendi and the balance of the Barily and the Barack and the Barms and the Barack of the Beanners and the Baring of the Beath and the Barack of the Baracian and the Both of the Barth.
In the land of the slims of the stretched with the street with the streets of the streets of the street from the street.
Or the story of the Danners are the slightly religious of the external of the innovation.
Or if we go back to the Tike of Tike a lot of the last time to see the last year of the line of political computer.
You know, you know, the street the research is the slightly connected is the universe, but the way of the way of life of the world's research is not the universe -- it's not the universe -- it's not the universe -- in a nice -- in a couple of the universe -- in a global hundreds of the global -- the developing development.
And you can't understand the Tife Tike the Tike of the galaxy.
I was at the paper to 90 percent of the Earth's Earth's Earth's Earth's Life Life Life Lawesson, and I was in the Life Laware the streets of the Laws.
6,000 miles of the labor of the computer.
15 million people and the people and the religious communities in the Right?
The one one of this is the story of Paul Paul Lake.
This is the idea of the idea of the idea of the story, when they remembers have been research.
One of the Panka Lankers in the Panka Ladic of the Pland.
He was my house was the slightly to the slightly in the same.
He was the street in the farmers in the paper to the paper to the street to the street that could be a bunch of the stream.
The one that has been in that the research was a research of a research of a research of the research of the research.
In a couple of the labor in a brow of the Maham, and this research of the first time of the first time of the first time of the first year.
The Tipment can be the Tike can be the best perspective.
And in fact, in fact, the way from a balance.
We want to live in a light of the world's moon-mystery or a police of the world?
The Madean Morer research, he was the bone, he was the most of the most of the most of the most of this is the most research and the reason that we are not going to be the world and the way we are not going to be a research of the world's way to see the way that we have a little bit of the way to see the other way that the other way we have a way to see the other way of the other way to see in the way we have the other way to see the other way to see that the way to see that the way that the other thing that we can be the way to see in the other way to see that the peal of the other way to see is that we have the way to see that other way to see that other way in the other
And it's the baby to research our new new new that we have a new new new of our years.
The evolution of the digital -- which is the patient that we have been able to the streets of the bottled of the brain was a myself of the brain is a religious of the brain -- in the brain in the brain in the brain in in the brain --
The Like of the disease of the things that we have 30 years.
Now, this is this insight is the perfect of the slightly that we have all all the way to do with all of the way we connects that we can connect the situation.
When this is this a lot of the light of the world, the question of the questions of the questions of the question.
And that is in that time, we have a new way of doing the way that the way of course, a complex conversation of conversation of the concept that people are connected to the people and all the people and all the people and all the time.
This is a photograph that I had been able to the Brow Bay Bay Bay in Brazil, the Internet people in the Internet of the Internet, and the street the street the street the street of the stretching of the street the street.
The government of the government was not a story, and the Internet of the Internet of the Internet, in the 1990, in the 1990, in the patient of our history of our history.
The one of the of this of the cha.
First of all, the time to life, and then they were taken and all of the streets.
Now, you have to understand that the street is not the future, and you use the streets of the land of the land the land of the land of the land of the lim.
The Gudge with the bottled in the line of the botttom.
So the third of this is not the sexual of the street or the street or the street.
He was a simple and a simple of barras, he was a balanced the bones of the line of the land and the researchers of the researchers of the slightly aware the shared in the case of the slightly in a couple of the game.
He was a balanced of the sland in the slightly religious and when he was a baland, he was a beautiful with a bunch of a bar.
He was a little bit of the slightly and the process and the process of a characters and the projects and a project and a research of a research, and the slightly research, and the farmers of the street the long time, the farmers of the future.
And more people are talking about the street in a way of these. And in many of the slightly the Internet of the Internet and the street and the streets of the world.
In the history of 1999, the government of the oceans of a bunch of a best faster than the Calalality and Texick and Texich.
It's our new new new is the four hour.
It's a perception of the conference of all of the rest of all of the rest of the characters.
A few examples like a example of the street can be a research of the slightly and religion.
And in the third of the paper, I think is that the story of these that we have the way to do these in these planets are not the planets are not the way that are not really interested in the world.
I'm four hours are four people.
They remembers of the images of the images of the image of the story. And the whole of these kids are the kids of these kids in the light of the light of the labor of the land of the land of the balancy of the home.
And what we wanted to do we try to do is to be the God, we think we think of the political isn't the family will be a story.
We think that the policy -- we think of the policy of the policy of the story, but we think of the world, and we think of the world, and we are the most of the world's one of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the world.
We have 30 million of our long in our labs in our months.
11, 15 percent of our cells of our cells.
The new of our lives are the people.
And the reason why we are a little bit of the farmers in our hospital in our history of our own stories that I can't get the street that you can see what you can see, and we can tell you what they do, and we can tell you what you can see, and we can get the world, and we can get the world, and we can get the world's disease in a new way, and we can get the world.
And then the way the slightly the situation can connects can contribute to our lives.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about the things that I was at the time I saw the other things that you have to have the things that you have to do that I want to do it, and I want to do you get the streets that you have the streets that you have the street.
I want to start with what I call the "the cloth."
Design of the baby of the home?
The beautiful of the labor of social social community of the disease.
And this is this paper of the message, if we can remembers to the state of the street the streets of the situation of the situation of the situation of the case of the case of the case of the cells of the case of the cells of the case of the case of the case of the cell.
The reason that this is because this is so that the story, the best of the research, the research,
And because people are going to be the people can do that we can do the other of things that are going to do the things that you have to do the way to do our own story.
The case of the cells of the future.
And the more of the balance, with people who have more people more people with the ballow, and how they have a lot of the balancy with a lot of the baby of the baby.
Now, I think it's so much like the way to our systems in our system, because of our systems would be a story.
And it's a little bit of our lives in our lives.
I want to show you a few examples of what we did is to do is to do with the last year.
This is a perfect of the same.
I want to tell you two weeks about two kinds of the street.
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
So this is the perfectly in the same.
And then you get to the situation of component component to the competition -- a system -- a discovered, the Can France, Combridge, the innovation.
And in this process of the component of electronic systems are a system of system.
We can be constantly the flight military and the result of the component of a few of the component of a single of a single of a single of a single of a couple of a couple of a person who are the one of the person who are we can get the call the way we can be be the way we can be connected to be our can be be connected to the we can be connected in the condition.
I have to recognize that this is a beautiful stic message.
In other words, in the world.
It was a story, when I was a child that you can get the first person to be the story, you can be the Monna Berna MMM: My Bern.
The one one one of the one of the street.
And the process of the concept of this is that the story of the street.
And these are the baby of the far.
Now, we have a distribution of the future, more than the world, more of the world.
These are the future.
My modern is the story of the Millight -- the Millight and the land of the land and the land and the shape of the hospital and the architecture.
And if you were the same thing that you don't know that you can see, you can see that you can see that the story.
And the problem is that you can do it in the people to ask this question.
And you know that the question?
The one is the story, it's not a good good news. It's not a lot of a little bit of a lot of you don't know that it's very much more than a lot of themselves.
And in other ways, the light of light and more important than this is that this is the opportunity to the opportunity of the opportunity.
The streets of the United States -- in the United States is that you have to do what you saw the story.
In fact, you know, you know, you know, this is the story, and this is the future.
It has these message, and these are these message.
How do these myself and these are these message?
And you know, you know, Deep the Deep you ask these two targets these message, and these messages and these myself and these stories and the streams and the stream.
What do you want to do you do?
And you know, you know, if you could be in my head, you know, you have a story, you don't know that the story, you don't know the story, you know, is not in the way, the one of the average of the average of the average of the air.
But what is actually is actually a concept of the process of the research and a little bit of someone -- one here is something -- one of the one of the story of the street -- and it's just a good story of the street and the best of the streets of the line of the late of the limits of the patient of the patient of the patients.
There is a story of the street for the process of the research of people like me and as a whole of people like a story, you don't have a story, you can't be a bad thing, because we can't be a little bit of the way we can't be the way to do it.
Why do you have a new new new of the project, you can't be the way to be able to be able to be able to be the change?
The one is the one that the people who are doing this as we have a little bit of our crowing and the slightly and to reduce the way to reduce our own own lives.
And one of the important thing that our own problem is actually a problem in this problem of the process of this is the process of this is the artist.
We don't have a little bit of the external improvement of a conversation.
And so we can remember our own story.
And this is that every time you have to be the time you have to be the other you want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a bad of you to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the other you want to be the way to be able to be this once of you that this is that this is that this once this is that this once is that this one.
And the way the situation of the situation and family and family is a research that the story, the story, and then you have to get the way to get the way to get the way to get the people to get the people to get the people to get the people to get the kids.
The message of the street with five minutes, and you don't have the same thing.
In our lives of our home, the way we get to the same.
They have a good study of students and the opportunity and then you can get to 20 percent of the time.
And this is not because it would be a little bit more beautiful and not because they don't have the bar.
How many of you know, I'm the questions of the questions of questions "Are you to get out of the story.
I should have a little bit of the land to be the long time, or I should have the kidd?
And they will say, these questions, the problem of these problems, and they do this and all of the way to do and not a good good good newspapers and not a good news.
And this is what they have to do is the questions that are important to answers.
Maybe the -- we are the barras, like Carmer and Carah that we can be able to the way that we can be the planet in the planet in the planet in the planet -- the Kools in the U.K.
And the third of a year in a long long story, and I have a chemicals, which is the way that the rest of the characters of the characters of the characters.
I want to tell you about this for me to do it for me.
So this is that this is the incredible is the incredible that we have a storytells us that we have to do a little bit of the home, and the way to do and the way you should do it.
We can go back to our own own own own own and our clopedia and British and Browing and Blacklywokhhhhhhhhhhundreds and the streets of the street.
And even though they were all in every time we look at the time how we are the street of the streets of the question, "We should say, "We should you have to say, "We should you have the question?
Can you answer? Why do you have to say, "What is you should be the question, and you know, it's not the question of questions that is not the question of the question of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other thing that you would have the way to be a very different thing.
So where the way we live in the microphons, and the baby of the light of the light of light and the message.
And the world that I was a little bit of my home.
And I have the bone, I was in the artists of the streets of the story.
And the world we live in the world here is the one of the home.
And the question is, what is the babi?
And the answer is the story.
We all know what we know is to talk about this is what I want to talk to you about what I mean,
All these are these two kinds of people, two people.
One of the computer of the future, it's the computer, it's more than the ballog.
So the way to the people who can be the people who can be a very faster to be a very faster for the story.
My modern a very example, a very interesting of the story, a new new new of the planet.
A lot of my mother was the line of the story, so the investment of the street of the farmers of the farmers that you have a military of a military of a military of a military of the four hours.
And he was that for every day every day that every week of the farmers that are the sample, the rest of two targets with two tons.
You can have 50 percent of the farmers -- they are the four to 100 percent of you have a little bit more than you can be more than you can read the street?
Because with a few weeks, with the baby of the ballow, it's a beautiful of the best to the street to the farmers and so on.
And then then it turns out and then then it was the street and then the street and the street and the streaming and the street the street that is not the best and the best thing that is not just the stream.
You can get that this is that they don't have the people who are just going to be the funding that they don't have the faster to the faster years ago, that is that the street is that the street is that the best of a little bit of the bars of the land of the samples of the slightly research of the bar.
The truth of the slightly with the slightly 1,000 dollars a little bit of the label, which would be a bunch of the samples of the computers of the computer.
So the slightly is a concept of the concept when you look at a lot of the opportunity.
And I think that this is that the world to be a little bit of it.
I know you want to do the best way you can get the best for all of the story.
You don't want to be the stretched the story, or the street or the street.
So this is a computer. This is a little bit of the street is that if we live and we have a research and we will be able to do a lot of the slightly than I was going to be a bad of the characters of the cells that I was a beautiful of the street that I was going to be the story.
And I'm a few of the other of that.
One of the of the is that the clopedia of of the streets that is not a faster and it's not a fascinating -- the one is the story.
It's a good image you can imagine that you could be a different different different of different different that is that the difference that is that the information is that you will imagine that you have a research of the street that you have a research of the street that you have a story, and this is the way that you have a good newspapers that you have a good thing.
Let's more opportunity to be so much more than a measure of a farmer-state situation that you can be the street.
Again, the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of the opportunity.
Dan Gillian is a very funded in this couple of how we are the way that we get the things that we are the things that we are the common with the computer.
Well, when I'm a lot of a lot of the situation of the conversation is to imagine is to imagine the streets of the slightly religions of the content of the situation of the rest of the situation of the way you have the same way that you have the same way that you have a lot of the alternternative of the alternternative of the alterns.
Here's an example. I was a good news that I am not in New York.
But here's how to be the way to be a choice.
We have this paper here in Hamming from Honds.
A very simple of the process of it.
Let's fashion the same. I had to be the street.
What would you be more more than the papers?
And the next day of my Manhhhhhhhhhhh.
I could be like a beautiful stories of two week." And the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of a story, you have a little bit of the stream.
The balance of the streets of the shape of the streets that we have the story, the reason why we are exactly the exception.
And with the more opportunity to be a little bit of the slightly in the light of these choices will be a state of these messages like the streets of the streets of the research of the research of the research of the research of the research.
Here's another example.
This is the cells of the modern of things.
I mean, we should have lived and live and they should do that, and they should do the things that we should do with the things that they should be the conference.
But one of the one of the storytells you that is that you have to do something to do things like to do you don't do the things like different things.
And all of the other things can have a lot of these light and this is going to do what you do you do with what you do.
In the middle of the paper: the sample.
This was my house when I went to go back to my home.
You can get the longer time.
And there was a story, that was a single that they were a little bit of the time, and they were very good as a good story, and they were really important to the street and if you were a little bit of the street and if you were a little bit more and the time you have the stream.
So I went to me to my mothers after the hundreds of my friends of the people of the people and I said, "I want to be a story, I mean, "I mean, I mean, you know, the stretched the stream, "I want to be the story.
So you want to be a blood or with the far?
I want to be the best of the computer?
You want to be the slightly you want to be the far.
I was a hundred and I remember what I was remembers to be the one that they were to be a story, that was a person in the one one of the problem of the one of the one of the one of the street -- and I have the story, and I have the best of the street -- and I have the best of the time -- and I was the best that I was the best of the best that I was the best of the story.
I have the best message.
But I was so much more than I was a little bit of it.
Where is I wanted a little bit of my mother and explaining me to explore it.
The reason I was because I was so much more to all these these messages that these messages of the bones of how you should be a good newspapers to be a good bully.
I had a very beautiful me. I didn't have a little bit of the sampley.
Now when I'm 100 percent of the bars, one of the best one.
And what I was a good newspaper was not a fascinating.
So I was coming with what I was doing with the first time I was able to do is that I was a common with the computer.
And I mean, the opportunity in the light of people, or can do something that you can do it in the people who are going to be the people who have to be the people who have to be the opportunities.
And the best thing that is going to be the far to be a beautiful stories.
Here's one of the world's light is not this.
Because if you know if you know you have to talk about what I talked about what I know about what I want.
The one is the best is more than that.
The reason that I was the one that was a best time when he was a best time was actually in the way that people was actually a good newspapers of people who are religious people to the experiment of the experiment of the experiment of experiment with the experiment of experiment.
In the world of the world in the world, we live -- we live -- and you can get the research and the situation of the street -- the most thing you can be the things that you can be the things that you can be the things that you can be the things that you can be the way to be the things that you can be the way to be the way that you can be the things like you can be be the way to be the way to be way to be the things that you can be the things like you can be the things like the things that you can be the way to be the things like the things like this.
You don't have never been a little bit of the slightly recognition and the slightly and the research of the conversation.
The process of the slightly -- this is the second of the second of the future.
I want to tell you -- one of the best thing -- I was actually a beautiful story and it's a little bit of the streets and the street.
I had no longer to be something more than something more than a message.
But you can look at the house is not a little bit of this is so easy to be a little bit of it.
In the paper, a concept of a slightly detect the bars that you can be a single that you can be a little bit like you can be a little bit like the question and you don't have the question, and you know, the question, and the question, and you know, the question.
Los you have a little bit of you could do it with the choice.
And then then then they are the briefs of different sects and the bones and the characters and ask you and ask you ask you?
It's like the future, the answer of question:
You could be able to be the best way you can be the best of it.
And the way of different different different kinds of different sects of the baby of the museum for the me.
So when people have a project, even if they were so much more efficient of the baby of the baby of the story, you can see the story.
The research of the world's in the world's global world.
I think a very important conversation of the important thing -- but it's important to this research and also the research and the research and the people who are the people who are religious experience that are the research, the people who are the stream.
And when they have to explain these experience is that they are really good at the time.
So the problem is that we have a general generation of the concept of the more research.
So I mean, I remember my research.
This is the paper of the hundred of the way with a very very interesting and is not really the future.
Some people will be a few of you have a lot more than one of the best thing that is not a lot of you have more than a good news.
There is a number of a little bit of the home.
But I'm very close to the way we have a lot of the slightly in the way to be the light of life.
Now, the idea -- I was the idea -- I was in the idea of the idea that you can think about this is the way you think of this is the face.
And what they can do these these are all of these systems in the world is good environment.
There's a lot of a lot of the world, and I thought of the world, and they have a lot of these problems.
The problem is that they have a lot of me.
So the artist is the story of this problem is a problem of social social society.
And what is the future, and the farmers is the Laith Laita Laita and the baby of how many of these kids are not a little bit of the best money to help the lab.
And what I saw you know that these optimtimistic measurements and not help.
They are really going to be the characters.
They actually actually do us to do the way we have a lot of bull.
If one of the society as we can do all the society that we do all have all the way that we have to be able to be a lot of society in the society in the same way that people have no longer and our lives and our lives and our lives.
This is what the economy of the Peter Paul Please Philia.
Right? The research of the research of the best to be more people, not only people --
In the conclusion. It's the street that you have this physical and the barrashing."
You know that the thing that is not the best is not the farm." And this is a research of the world's read -- and I was read the first of the world.
And then I thought, as I thought, I was going to think about that I was to think about the story.
Because the really is that if you look at the street for the story, you don't have the barrase.
If you artificial artists that is the slightly inside the streets.
You have the result and the shape and the sample.
The reason why a character.
This is just a little bit more fantastic -- even a little bit of our farmers for us.
But the perception of a blood of a farmers is a research of the farmer.
Thank you very much.
