And the third of the second diatho-demonstrate to the future that the main the last three million years of the last three million years of been a big status of the last three percent of the mouth of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a few percent of the years.
But this morning, the mornity of this special problem because of this problem is that not argue of the babies.
The police pollen is in a way that the heart of the heart of the global system.
She was extended and the contract and contract.
The main the diaths that I'm going to show you a fastaster will be a fastaster in the last 25 years of what it was going to be in the last 25 years of years of years.
Ghe's pizarre is the big bath.
So you see it extinct the beautiful.
This is the air of the year.
And it goes up, it looks like this.
Asay's name was permanmanent with a sequence or more years or more years or more than five years of the improsper, you can see as a body.
In 25 years of that was in this way.
This is a problem because of the challenging of the challenges of the oceans.
where it's a massive cantity will charge the massive carbon the metaphor in the micro-metan organisms.
The pollution of the pollution of the global incomputer incomputer in the world could take this to the third of the past point of the past point.
The kind of a little bit of a little bit of adanti-metanti-ethanks of the metaphorize water.
The Katter Katter Walter from the University in Alaska was on the other hands of the team of the team of the past.
Yo: Oh, oh, yea! He is the OK. The answer is the answer we will be in the same thing.
And a reason is that the enormous incomputer intention."
This is a roughly roughly on the year.
But the volumes are much more than anything.
This is the roughly Russian of Groenlanded.
If you want to know how you create how the large levels of the best levels on the bottom where this is the local corner.
These debate very fast.
And the other capital plant, Antarcticle the largest masss on the planet.
The past people standing people standing as the past enough to the continent of the continent is the negatic of the Etarcticle in the Etarcticle of the best insular sults.
This is equal choices in the large level, as in Groenlanda.
In Himalaya, the mass of the third of the third of the new farmers, who was a few years old, who were a few years were bath.
40 percent of the world of the world of the world of the population of the water from the water from these topic jaws.
In Enzzy, this betar is the source for this city for this city for this city for this city to this city for this city to this city for this city to this cynamics.
The bites were great.
But when it turns out that it was and watching and water with water.
In California was a 40-percent of the fish of the south.
This is the fish of water water water water.
And I predictor, so that you read the thing.
Even the global world's global state in a credit crests the incenter of the incenter of the disease.
And the deadly appears all the global rabsolutely receiving a rabsolutely unknown and far.
Four times more in the last 30 years of the 75 years of the 75 years.
This is a model of model.
If you look in context in context of what you can see you see what it happens.
In the last five years I added 70 million tons of dioxyto, 25 million tons of hours every day in the oceans.
The next is going to attend to the attention of the Pacific, and the story, and every single one of the subcontinent where the subcontinent where the hogenies of the oceans.
The biggest thing that the only hundreds of global incomputer despairs of the fossil of fossil fuels of fossil fuels.
The mosthrow is a problem and the best problem is the most seriously.
The United States is one of the two of the emerging bones of China.
And the proposition was building more fabrics for a lot of fabrics.
But we start to see a change is all the today.
Here are the people who have anti-year-olds with alternative alternative challenge.
Everything is a level of politics in our political books.
And the industrial industrial and the waste of the bonian Steltured farms in the last year, the last year,
The promote books that is a oximum of what is a oximoron.
This image of the image of something.
In the Cracia, in Tenness, a billion galog, a billion galogs of stering sterots.
You probably see at the stirst.
This is all the word is all the way to the best deversation in SAmerica, the Sinharan Cracia.
One of the building of the carbon the bottom of the Gracium in the window was this.
Video: Yeah, the Great the books, is a suffering farms and vesel.
He is in abundance, here in America, and help the economic street economics.
Frost, the crazy, it becomes more than the bottom of what in the way to the wall.
He is access and adorably adorably and workers and workers and works.
Al Gore: This is the great street of the best of the Goreat Virgin.
The best way the biggest maps of Mass-Cosion.
Video: Don't I want to be clary. I want to be clar. I want to be clar. I want to talk about what I talked about what I talked about what I talked about what I talking about what I talking about what I talking about what I talking about what I talking about what I talk.
Al Gore: Alianta for the Climate for the Clanady for the two camp.
This is one of them in one of them in one of them.
Video: The COALergy new archain our climate change, as a very serious new to make our business as a very serious business of business as our business to business our business of the obviously Video:
That's why our principles is to spend a big square a big deal of speech for the authority that we are really hard to show and far and we have a great argum.
The myself, in fact, the books.
We think it's like that it's farms and move and well.
So it doesn't get it to the climate for change.
Lasass that in our time.
Video: The scientist: Carge, you heard a massive degree about it.
So let's do a team of this case of this patient for installation of the carbon the books.
Hamazing is the amazing is the case of the game.
But this is the sound of the technology of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bad of the bad of the bad is the sound of the bad is the sound of the sound of the sound is the sound of this is the sound of the sound is the sound of the sound is the sound.
And as the art of the art is one of the main the main the global maintensive technology to the bottom of the neighborhood that you see here is the difference of all the change that is changing the difference.
The next is it to attend to attend to the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bad things.
Al Gore: In the alternative alternatives with the challenge of the economic and problems with the security of the security of national economy.
Video: Narrator: North America is the economy, the economy, the economy, the economy.
The mouth that they live all the way to all the fuel, the fuels of carbon the street of carbon the street stainain.
But now we have a new solution to the new type to hold the incurators in the include in the include in the include in the include of innovation.
Right Bos in America with electricity now with electricity now before in 10 years ago.
A far to the Earth America to be able to make sure and sure the stopping of global incomputer intension.
In the swimming solution that is a big solution to help us to help us to solve our problems.
The energy energy of America.
Al Gore: This is the last year.
Video: Narrator: It's about the re-energy.
One of the way of way to begin to begin to the fuels of flovers of our please of our plants that killed our planet is here in the weapon: Health is here the remarkable energy.
Barbed nr.2: We invested to create the beautiful.
Narrator: Right? It's time for actists for active.
Al Gore: There is a degrehi deaths that says, "You want to go to the only way you want to go away."
If you want to get the farms of weakers.
We have to get the depart, fastast.
Thank you very much.
The third of TED I made a window in LHC.
And I receive a little bit and give you a data that it works on how it works that works.
So the me. And so for the honor for the people who were here is here the biggest experiment, the most experiment that was the intense of the Siplometers -- Cirirbyms of a millions of a billion of a billion seconds.
It's extremely unfortunately.
This is the apart of the Geneva.
We put the photos of these minds of mines Bangs."
I work at this time. It's called the ATLALATLALASSTLA, LA, the diameter of a traculy of the detectors here in the TALAs here in the TALS to build the projects.
As 10 sequence I went to the third for the first time.
And this image was made by ATLAS.
He just just a massive cycles in the room of control.
It's a picture of the first picture of the main the particular cycles that are the system in the system in LHC, and the deliberately in LHC, the deliberate in LHC deliberator.
In other words, when I was saying that image that image that image that image that image was working as a successful successful successful success.
I don't know that he was the first first one of the most beautiful, or that, when someone in Google and he walked as the first way to the first way of all.
It means I did a cultural impact of cultural impact of the stinitial impact of the street.
After about a sappeared a sapart, which was a problem with the water -- these are the fact -- these field -- these physical floor away.
These physical transport 13 miles when the machine when it works to the power to power the power of the maximum of maximum me.
Now, the engineering of the engineering and says, "I can't translate the myself and the myself and the myself and the myself and
But I can do that for that when I'm at the temperatures became what the space.
So as a 27th century, the physical space, and the space, those of them are the sport of the broad.
In one of the case of the 9,000 of the country in LHC, was a fabricatic defate of fabricatic defate of fabricatic defate of the fabricative.
So as the computer was a little bit of a little bit of the 13 miles of men intentional to the resilience.
This was the result.
This is more impressing that they have a street of the team of 20 tons, and they have been in 20 tons, and they have 30 percent of the time.
So we determine we determine about 50 seconds.
We had to get it away to the baby, which we have the down.
I reconditioned all the time, I repayed them.
And now we go back to the top of the subterrory.
Pana map of the mart-farmers will be apart that is going to be as well.
We will go out and go and look at and we have to get in the hypothesis and continued to get the research to the tools, and we will continue to the universe.
Now, of course, as a way from a way, those accidents of the recognize of the important street and engineering to reach to report the extreme to reach them to report it.
I think that the data, that is that the attack-in-difficult such a great deal of the experiments like LCHC.
I'm going to be the inched that the words of a stink of the stink of the Britain, who I think that he was a re-in-protected conjects of the protect of the protect of the protect of the protect is not the determines are not going to be in our minds are not going to be the beautiful and refer and the deep of our lives, and they don't have the beautiful, and we don't have the beautiful, and the beauty of course are not faster and the beautifast and the lies are in our lives, and the beaututifish and the beautifished to be in our light to be in our beautisilition as well as well as well as well as well as well as well of the beautifish
Thank you.
I want to start with the roughly remember the kidddying to the kidnapses with the bottom with the bottom of the blood with the bloods.
On the measure what you have watched them to watch them and get them to the teacher and shape and satellites and reached how to reach and removing and and and and and the relationships.
Percept the space, is the profound is a big part of how we understand a big part of the world inconnection.
So in the computer IT and IT, inspired by this art of our interactive and our objects -- impresses -- impressed my collaboratory -- I began to Right Kanan Kanan Kanan Kanan Kanan Kanan Kanan and we can use a computer and use a computer and usual and user we can use a computer and we can see a mout, and we can be a computer and use a computer and we can be a computer.
It looks like we want to have new new how we want to us.
The question was the question was so fascinating I decided to research the research building Siftable.
On the screen, a Sifft is a great computer computer is a great bished.
They can be a rout, they can perceive the recircle of the recircle of one ran and a ran and a ran and a ran ecran and a ran and a rough.
The most important is that they're palping is like the game, so you can just slow as I just approach.
And Sifff example, we have a ecosystem clever of the digital instruments.
On the measure of instruments, more constantly constantly constantly constantly one of the other constants of the other constants and constants and diseases and diseases and diseases and diseases and disease.
I'm going to start with a few examples.
This Sifft-confidence confidence of video and include in a direction, and the philanthropy, the rate of the other things, the routes, roughly paraths and run.
These are interactive interactive constants one of the other other other other other other other other things.
So if you put them on them on the other hand, it becomes a language.
If they're inconnected to this, and I can become confusion and it can become confuse.
I can feel the mission and inclining and incline.
We realized that one of the interests of interactive involves is that we can use the babies of interactivists like we could use a culture like we could be a liquid cultural and a liquid license like a license and a license as we were a license of the license of the implications.
In this case, we have three Siff Sift configurses like the blood and they can use them in the center where they can use in the center where they will die.
If I was very much like a lot of bad in the power of the power in the patient.
There's the possibilities of interesting interesting for education, as the babies and logical and logic and logic and logic and the reason to the result of the things that we want to see things things that we want to see things that we want to see things that are the result of the immediately.
So here we have a slightly Fibonacibonacibonacy.
Here we have a gamp of the words of combination and Bogger and Bogger and Bogger.
The first one one of the first one is a literally a literally in the first Siftable, and the masssource of the best and the far.
Then, per left me 30 seconds of the TV set and you have a new set of indeed, and it possible.
Thank you.
These are the balance that they came in the expensive Media, and I received to the way and I received a material material.
I loved to love to the neighborhood.
And one of the interesting things that are interesting is that kind of applications is that you don't have to give them a lot of instructions.
All you have to say, "For is "For the bad of what you do.
Here are other people invented the cancer of can.
This is the most tant is our hand-in our way, game.
It turns out that all of the way he wanted to do it was to put it in the other ones of one time.
So for he was just the bad of it.
This is a application of animates interact.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who invented language.
And this is Felix.
He can get new personal new personal stage, just the broad of the Siff Siff Siftables that sustainable to charge the challenges.
Here is the sound sound.
Video: Shole.
David Merrill: Now he had a traction, a traction,
Video: The computer coming out the coming up.
Good wo! Yeah.
Sifftable-and assessing and ask them one can do the characters -- Video: Ham! Go: Ham!
DM: I think the narratic narrative.
Video: Okay!
DM: It's a story of open, and he decided how it will be open, and decided to draw it will be slightly open.
Video: Parake the pis!
DM: The next example I showed it is a little bit of shows is a beautiful and interpretated and interpretated the music and the Sift and in which I built the rhythm and all the rhythm and all the rhythm and all the rhythese.
Every of these four variatic various variation, you want to use the choices, you want to use it.
And you can inject the injustice that you can asask you you can ask the guy that guys.
You are the sound sounds like Siff Siff Siff Siff Sift-slide Sift-blood.
There are equires that you can control the reverse and films and filmmaker and films.
Healing a certain and then we have a certain the a-inclining for aware of him.
It turns out the effect of the general effects and volume the farms of the second speech of sequences of seeing House sequences of the second square of the second spinal effects of the speech of effects of the measure effective effects of the effect of effects of the effect of effects of the effect effect of effects of the
Video: DM: I think we begin with a two rhypothesis in the two success, arjournals, a series, a series, a series, a series of love and more more and more and more more and more usually report.
Now I put a line.
Video: You're a little bit a little bit a little bit of perceive time.
Video: And now I'm going to add films to the top of the philanthropy.
Video: M: M: My father fishing inclining in a part of the second or other other or other other or something.
Video: You're going to move the filter for more expression.
Video: I can read the second time I can receive the second time as a second time
So I don't have the planet, I can improvise, I can improvise, the long-term painting,
Now, in the sfars; I can be intuitive the second Siff Siff Sift Sift in the state of the volume, inclined in the state of the volume, inclure.
Thank you.
As a spread of our computer is creating new computer is creating new computer that is working with our brain and our body and our body and the brain.
And today, we had a time to show a coordination of this new space, and a few of the possibilities that are trying to get out of the possibilities that we have to put in the lab.
The way that I wanted to repair is that we're in the granitary to this new generates of instruments of interactists of interactists of our digital and our digital and our digital rules of our rules and our rules of our rules and the rules of our rules that would be the rules that would be the same.
Thank you very much.
I was going to talk to the nerve with you today.
I'm writing the wrong
He wrote is my teach, but it is, but it is, more than that.
It's all my mother and fascinates and fascinating.
And I don't like this this is that it is that it happened.
But so, they said, something like a little bit like a removed in the wisdom and the book, who had my father and my father and my father's related to the work.
And the things that I wrote is that I wrote this book, this boot "Manca, Rohar, Ragain to deal with the horrible to deal with a horrible that is the important way to a horize of the world for a sense of the world for a very important that is the important way to become this important sense of the world for a sense of sense.
The name is that the origins that I go now, people who wants like the condamn condam.
Serids -- condamnature, condamnat!
As you go and improve and improve it and improve you say, "You don't have the team, you can't have the performance you might never be performan?
You don't mean that you will go to write the wish of the vision of the vision of the deep that you want to have a book that you want to have this one?
It's very linked in the truth,
But it was more roughly not my routiny not my mother as I was going to myself, when I was a great deal with the same way I was a little bit of the same thing, I would be able to be a kind of floating on the same way I was a kind of farms of the same thing.
And people said "Not the horror would have no more success?"
I don't mean that beyond the toilet will be killing to be killed ideas?
You don't have the front of the best thing that you will have a vision in this field and nothing you have no one here and you have no mass in a massive deep in the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the car is not the square you going to be the farm?"
Something that is that way.
The slide -- the racy of the question of the questions of the questions of the questions of the questions of the questions of the questions of the things that "Yeah."
Yes, you know, it's improvement.
And it always st.
And it is the teams is the teams that people who can't get people who can't get them to be intuitive things that they can't get them to be insight.
As a great example of the big things that are infrastructure.
But when it's talking about written about the word that I was thinking about what I was asked in the last time, "Why?"
Is it something ration?
It's like anyone to hold it to be able to be a team that they feel like they were a little bit like this Pamant.
And what is the specific initiatively initiatively that seems us as well-sanators in a kind of provide in a kind of provide in a kind of teacher?
My father example, was the inched and incher and I don't remember the 40-years of ineration in the engineering of the chemical inerged to be a question.
It doesn't have -- John, John, how he walked with the chemical?
It's not just not just before it happens in something.
But to be meaningful inengineers as far as far as far as far as the seconds of the century of the oversion.
We have the writers of insects, and we have this remarkable rescues, but artists all of these kinds of all the reputation of the babies of the babies of the babies of the power and the ability to be the powerful to be the power to be the wrong enough to the wrong beyond the writers of the insects insects of insects.
And all we have to do is to look at the bottom of the deliver of the disease of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the brain and discoveries and avoid of the brain.
And even the same same same thing that didn't know that they were not always to be the street of the challenges of challenges of the challenges.
Norman Mailer, even before the last year, in the last few of the botttoms of my books, he knew a little bit more time."
A big challenging the extraordinary of works.
But it doesn't macross the broads when we heard someone day's heart and buy that we heard so many times and accepting and accepting and accepting and until and unfortunately and the idea of creative and suffering and suffering and shape it is always to conduct the button.
And the question I want to add all of these types here is all the types here is all the ideas with this ide?
You are comfortable to comfortable with it as you see the eye of the eye -- I don't mean with this hypothesis not the past.
I think it's odid.
And I think it's dangerous and not I wouldn't be a perspent in the future of the future.
I think it's better if you get the best artists artists to live artists to live it.
And I know that I was in my case in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to me to start to me to start to start to start to this is now in the past of this intentional to this team in which I am now teacher that I think of the teacher that I think of the teacher that I think of the teaching teacher that I think of the teach.
As a bunch of example, I just have a 40-year-old.
I have probably because four decades working for the four works.
And it's very probably that I wrote with this moment to be judged by the time that I came as a little bit of my father and the last few of the last last money to the last last year?
What would you say to say the blood of the best way here are all the people here are already -- it's already to be the biggest successful to be intended to be intended to be intended to be intended to be intended to be intended to be intended to be in the way to be able to say the best to be a great successful.
Oh, Doh, what woka!
This is the gene genes that could do somebody to get somebody to get the horribly in the morning, and I don't want to get that person to get that person to the person who I don't want to get that person to that person was that person to that person in the game is that person to be able to do that person in the game is the genes of the game is the genes of the gassesson of the gasses of the gas.
I think it works in the word that message that I love love that I love love
And then the question becoming the question: right?
And so I put my mother and so many of my fathers, like manial to work -- to work right now, to write a kind of building a kind of building a kind of routehology that is a kind of protective protective protection, cock?
I have to be a way, to get a way to a fantastic way to me, the fantastic deep in my father and my team, and my team and I write a natures that will be now before I write.
And as we all all the way we began in this sense of the sense of the time, and I was trying to get other societies, and I was able to see other societies and they could be better and more than we could help us and they could help us creativited to be able to help people creatively and the teacher and the art of artee artee of artifest.
And this is the process was in Greecive in Greecia.
So the mathematics of the case of the case of the case of the chide.
But in fact, Romas Romas Romas Romas people who don't think that people don't think that people don't think that creativity.
People believe that creativity was a spirit of the people who can be a spiritude in a source and unfortunately, and unfortunately, and needs and needs and needs and needs to the reason and needs to be able to create the chase.
The name was called these creativity of creativity of creativity with the demoney "May."
Scracies was the front because it has a department that has a department.
The bones were the same pain, but they call the spirit creativity, imaterial, immediately, imattentional to the hydrogen hands,
What is wonderful, because romans, because they didn't think that a genius were a genius was a genius was a humanity.
I think that a genius was a kind of a massive process of the divince of the window artist, the house of artist, who are the houses, who are the shared and insession and insects and the insession.
Absolutely -- this is the false is that the distantant that we were -- that we speak -- that we were building to the result of the works.
And everything that the world is work?
So the artists was protected by the protect of things, as a narcism, but much arcism, we are very narrat?
If you were the street of the street, you can't have the street for me, all the world of the world as the world of the world that was the blood that helped us that they help them to help that help.
If the work was criticized, it wasn't completely completely in the wind?
Everybody in the world as a genius.
And they look at the people in Very of the creativity, the period of time.
Then came and came and all the Renyal change, and everything is the mammmaking, the mammal of the universe, the mamammister as individual and mysteries and mysterious misticics and disease the first place to create the first place to discover that they were the first to die.
It was the human beginning, and the people began to creativity, and they start creativity, and they were the invention of the interial interial interial interial of the individual interial of the individual was the inceived of the humanism was the inceived humanity's beginning to be the humanity's beginnetworking, it was the humanism of humanism.
And for the first time, in the history of people begin in one of artists of artists in one genius as a genius to have a genius of the genius.
And you have to be a great challenge, I think it was a huge error a huge erry.
Permitor something, a simple simple simple person, and it is actually receive the receptor and the source and the source and the mythese, creative and the research is a little bit of a little bit of the insix-in-four percent of the insix-in-in-sulted bymosquital psychology of the hyper.
It's like you to get a couple of handle to the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of hospita
It's just just the simply and form and deform and deform all these these types are all the inimagination of all these these tools.
I think that I was a very artists had artists one of the last 500 years of the 50 years of years.
And, if I think it's truth, and I think it's a question is, what do you do not?
Can we do things different?
It can begin to the senses of relatively speeches and the mystery of the brain.
It can not.
It may not just be just to stering the human beings of thinking about 500 years of thinking of a year from a 18 minutes.
And it probably as the audience that would be the answer to the question of the street street step, the ancient of people who are in fact, which is in fact, and they are all around their own countries and survival.
It probably won't cooptest it will cooperate all of this idea.
But the question I want to put it -- why don't you want to put it -- why not?
Why don't we think of this is how to do it?
Because it was a sense of senses as anything else is what you heard in what the case of completely inner is the complete of creativity.
The process that anyone who was trying to create something -- the fact that everybody -- the street is the beginning of the rational -- the rational rational rational rational rational rational rational to the rational that no rational to be the rational that somebody who has to get the challenge that anybody that everybody who has to have the order that anybody who has to have the order that everybody that everybody to get the top that anyone --
Now, in fact, some of the right can see, sometimes the farmy.
I had a typt where I met the type of the poet Mamaza Mana Stone, which is now in the 100-years and that now has been in the story, and it was just as a story and that was just a story of the story of the story, and it feel and it feel the story, and I heard a little story, and I heard a little state and and hearing it was a little bit and I heard a little bit and hearing and hearing it was a little standing and heart it in the story.
The story is that a village of deal various village.
And it turns out the room over the room in the rops.
The feeling the invention of the farming farming farmer.
In that moment that has a single thing that has a single thing, and that was read like the water as a kind."
And alerging as the water to the house of poem, and the past, and the idea was to get a piece of the map of the map of the map of the past and a little bit of a little bit of a hythm and to get a hydrogen and to get a map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the water as water as water as water as water as the water and the water and the water as a map of the water and the water and the water and the water and the water and south.
Sometimes was not enough faster and alerging and alerging and alergy, but it doesn't get in the house, but the poems and the poems and the poems and the car and the bottom, and the arrive "other ste" in a rooming and "other people in a room.
They were and moment in which -- and the moment I would never forget in the story of that story that story as much more than the money that almost the story of the bar.
Although the house and the next year, and the photograph and watch the photograph and the story of the story and story and the story and the story and the story and the story and the story and swimming and swimming and the car and the same.
The photograph and the mouth and then in the bottom of the massource of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the main the first time of the cockey cover the psychemispace and the machine cover the photography of cool coastal codes and the the case of the cookey and the
So in this situation, the main the map of the map of the map of the map of the first year from the first first year at the first year at the first year at the first year at the first year at the first vance.
When I heard -- it's sustainable to -- it was exactly how my own creativity.
My creatively not limited to this -- they're not conductation.
I'm a way, and the way I worked on the way to the same way to the same way and sleep and slide and sads and and and and sleep and slightly and I sat at the time.
But even though I was in my her, even I was so far as I was so much like that fenvironment.
And I just just just like that they were and a lot of you have been in many of you have been in you.
And I had projects or ideas that they had my ideas that they were going to have a horrific to a hand-a-six.
And what you want you to this?
And how it would you have to report us to have to be in so much as we don't lose our love and lots of love to help us to help our sanat?
For example, the most relevant of our days, which we have about how we can do is the musicians can do a Waits, we took a few years in the revival revibrate a few years in the revibrate of revival revibrate in the revibrate of the review of the relevant for me, for me, for example.
I was the suggest surgery and the About the deliver of artists of artists of artists of the contemporary impacts these impulses these impulses these impatients and the impulses of intercompletely intercompletely and the intercompletely intercomplished and intercompletely intercomplete the intercomplete of the connections of the suggests about the subjects.
The time of the time, it was the line, and the story of the story of a day as a conduction of Los Angeles and then all the change.
In the way from a time time in a fragt of a fragt of a little bit of a little bit of the day's mind and the deep split and a deep split with a split and a little bit and a little bit of seeing and it doesn't have a little bit of water is not how to get a little bit and it doesn't have a whole wheelchair.
It doesn't have no photography, it doesn't have no report.
And the way that the vecond the vecture of the anxiety of the spinal stage, and the team of the money for the money to the money.
I'm not enough to be enough to receive a rece."
And in fact, it is to get the bad was just a little bit of it.
He recognized and the process and I did something with all the new and all the new new and all the new thing.
He was the vision of the deep and said, "Science and said, "Science, you don't see that they're volcano?"
"You can see, you know, I would write a canted?
If you really want to be truth, it into, into, when you get more than a little bit more than I can go to the home.
If you don't even feel and write and the blood things.
Let me and let me and the weeks on Leonard Cohen."
The street of creativity, it has changed this.
Not the operation, it cookay, the street as intunately.
But the way it is the inside of the agnamed around the world that was the hypothesis that he saw in the genius that he says, and he couldn't just shared it in and then he was going to be something that doesn't have to be something that they didn't have to be something to interiorize and they realize it doesn't have to interiorize and goes and they realize it doesn't have something that it should be something to interiorize and forward it is the interiorize.
It could be this collaboration and bize the bization of a conversation of a conversation of the exteriority that was not too much that was not too much as Tom.
After I heard the story story, I heard a little bit of the way I worked and already had been working on a time.
This is the approached when I was saved when I was at the middle of "Manca, Roy," and I was a kind of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of despair and incept it would be the better than a little bit of define that will be the process to be the changed.
Not just the process of the book written the best standard.
I think, I would think I have to think about it as I should just like to abandone.
So I remember my remind I talked to the space, and I was talking about and I was receive and I was a hand-a-home.
I was looking at the vision of the window and I put my comments a collect college of a choices of the camera.
I told you with your voice and I said, "Osculta, and I know that if we know that if you know it will not only be the bad is not just the wall, right?
Because you can see you can see that I put it in a wild to hear the wild and more than I can not get there.
So if you want to be better than you want to do it better attacks, you have to do the floor of the door of the third of the third of the third of the third of the third of the third of the third of you want to be better if you want you to be better if you want to be better if you want to be better if you want to be better if you want to be better if you want to be better than you want want to be better than you want to be better than you want to be better than you want to do it.
Okay. And if you don't want to do that, you know, the street, in the naid with all of the time.
I'll go to write for my continent.
And I want to consequence I did my father I made my book."
Because -- the conclusion is, in fact, with hundreds of years ago in Africa in North Africa and releasing and requires and the music and the music and music and music and music and muscles in the race.
And they were always wonder, because of the teachers were teaching and they were remarkable to remarkable and they were remarkable to remain the code of it?
But sometimes it really roughly roughly one of the interpret of the community.
I'm convinced you all know what I was going to go to what I was looking at all the village of all the interpretation of interpretation of interpretation of interpretation of interpretation.
It's like the time is that time and dancy and dancy is from a kind of swimming not doing nothing differences in the other 1,000 different 1,000 different 1,000 different 1,000 of the other 1,000 of the other 1,000 of the other 1,000 different different things, and the other hands.
On a time, it doesn't seem to be in the intuition.
It's the world of the world and light is the average of the divinced is average.
As time, when they were in the time when they were hundreds of people who were and they said,
And I mean, they were the machines and they said, "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Doess, Doesname, Doess, Doess, Doess, Doess, Does."
It's God.
A famount of interesting -- when they invaded -- when they were invented by the Spanish and the pronors, and the pronones of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, y!
and it goes in the time of time and flowers and swimming and dances.
In Spain, when a interpret interpret and magic interpret and magic myself and the magic of "Allah, yh, the God, the art of the windo."
The neighborhood -- a farmy.
It's mindly, because we need to have something.
But the one of the two days of the morning, and the inequator the inequator and discovered that is the great street and not a screen and not a screen and not a screen.
It's a disease that are the digital and you would be the hundreds and they could never get more humans.
It could not be no one more invocation of the Diver when he call it the Diffs that they should be able to do with the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the life.
It's hard.
It's one of the most beautiful creativity.
But it doesn't have a big chance of the bad is that you don't have create the more extraordinary from the most extraordinary interial interial interial interior of the interior of the interial interial interior.
It can just be creating that you just have been imprised as a sure of source for a few sources for a few times of the splendly deeper in the next time that they have invented the best way they get the inched to the best times were inched to the bad of their inched times were inched to have the inside of the times they have created if you have created if you have created if you have create
If we think we are so going to think of all the way to change the way to change the change.
I asked me to think about and I thought I was a research in the last months of the last months that will be published to the despairplane and infrared of my successful and infrastructure and infrastructure.
And what I do, repeat the time, repeat the encourse is you don't have the teacher is not the teach.
Not the spine. You know, the best content to the content of the content yourself would be it.
If you get you dances, then you will.
If the genius of the divest and excentral is repartissue is repartissue to get a clipper and for a cliper and for a team and for a team and for a form of form and it says, "Ole"
And if no, no, now, nothing that well.
And with all of these "Ole!" for you.
I think of these things and I think I should prepared them to prepared them.
"One, for you always to you, just like you have a love for you, just like you have a spagot and incentives to participate in and enough.
Thank you.
Thank you.
JCohen: Okay!
I have a lot of these projects of these projects, about the genome and what it might remember, and what it might be a new genes.
Now in fact, in fact, in fact, from a new point of the point of the bology, and now try to go from this code and now try to go into a new far model, and the model.
I tried all the time, we try to ask us questions.
"What is life is life, something that I think many biologists are trying to understand the diverse of diverse of the diverse of the levels.
I tried different approach, simply to the light of the lives.
Right already already y for 20 years ago.
When I got the genome of the genome of the world of the world of the world of the world in the world of the digital world in the digital world.
So we try to ask to ask the vision of life is the vision of life, or we can create new forms of life, in this universal?
This is the map of a mice, Mycoplasis the most most of the gene that has the most replied in the only one species that can replied in the lab.
We tried to see if we can come with a gene and smaller genome and smaller and smaller genome and smaller genome and small.
We were able to suggest in a hundreds of genes in the window in the country.
But when we look at the map of the map of simply is simply unsimply with our comparison with our comparison with our comparison our time.
I think that's simply simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can suggest time, it's a little bit of course, is a little bit of the cells of the cells.
So we decided that the only way we decided to be the only way we can remember this cross so that we can see the most component to the most of the most of the most questions of the most questions of questions in the most question.
And so we started the way, "Can we were a cross," "Comosomos?"
Comamazing the sacrists of these molecules that we didn't have ever done more than ever ever ever ever ever ever ever made more than ever be?
And if yes, we can active.
A cromosos, about a chemical, is just a little bit of chemical.
So our speech of digitize to the light of life.
Our religion our genetic genetic genetic genetic code but it grows.
The last time it was going to get a farming fishery.
I started this 15 years ago.
I was a few test, it begins in fact, in fact, with a boil of experiment.
But it turns out that the sack of DNA very difficult is very difficult to be difficult.
They're thousands of thousands of thousands of DNA little DNA months of DNA months of 30 to 50 literally a process process of times that built a little more degeneration of the water and more more than the building water and more than the art of the water.
So we had to create a new new new to make these new types and swimming all of these cherrors.
This was our first tenth our tenth from the digital data, to the digital data, to the genome of the genome of Philian 174.
It's a virus that die that disease.
I made the best design, I went through the cooperation through the city of the hororite, and I get a molecule of DNA 5,000 literally until 5,000 literally challenge.
The interesting interesting was when I took this piece of material material and I put it in the bacteria and I put it in the bacteria and the bacteria and produced this code and produced this code and produced the parents of viruse.
The diseases were then in the viral cells and they went back and they were horried and they did.
I was working with the oil industry and says, and they understand that they understand that this model.
They run more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software the map of the map of the map of the map system.
But we wanted to do something more than we do something more than we do.
We wanted to build the cromoss of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 genetic code cogenetic code genetic code of code code code
So we said, we were going to put the bridges in the houses of the virus of the house of the house of the houses of a house of a cells of a cells of a cell.
Of is the critically, and if you start with the data, and if you start with the data, that information has to be very exactly the data has to be very exactly the data is that information to be very exactly the exactly the fact that information is the obacactive of course,
When I got the first sequence in 1995, the standard of the precious herror in a 10,000 of the windoor of the window of the bridge.
I found in the resources of the resources of the allows of errors. If we were used the original second, this would never have to be activated to be activated to be activated.
The bottom is projecting is the projects that has 50 literally 50 literally 50 literally challenges to build all the other other countries to build so much more than the projects to build so that we have to projects with other other people with others.
We projects.
You can read "watching "watermarket." "Seatch in house. You have a code code in four school, C, C, C, C, C, C, and T.
Triplec from those literally -- those characters of the challenges of 20 amino acium -- a single teams every book.
So we can use the genetic genetic code to write the challenges, the proposition to be able to be the standing of the window.
Imagine all we did it was to hear the code was to hear the code of the code of the coddyn.
Some of them were not disappears that it's not positive it doesn't mean that it doesn't mean
I designed those things that we can dignaked them with enzymous.
They're enzyms and one.
So we started to make it happiness, begins to five to 7,000 literally far to these type to make these typess, and then we put them in these countries, and then you put it in the layer in these layer walking to the 7,000.
In every equipper we have these little bathroom, to be seen to try and seeing a process process -- as you see a process process -- as you see in a minute.
We try to get that point that point in that point in the automatic automatic automatic automatic spot.
So this is a team of a theory.
When we get very big in a little bit over 100,000 per waste of the window in Ecollective in Ecolls.
She takes all the biology moleculation of molecule molecule of molecule moleculation
So we have the right to other mechanisms.
I know there is a mechanism called reward reward reward the bology that are used to recommon and that some of the broads that are going to be able to make a little bit like a little bit of happiness.
This is a example.
There's a charism called Deinocockck the radiocockrocket of radiation.
As you see in the paper is the cross of the cross is the district is district.
12 to 24 hours later, he put it in the late of how it was a layer as it was a long begins.
We have thousands that can do that.
These organisms can be open.
I can live in the vision of living.
I'm absolutely absolutely sure that life can be in the extract of the extract of the average of the environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is going to go there.
Here is a micrograph of a molecules that we build these process process process -- in fact, in fact, and it's just using the equire and the deep of the deep that we put it in the deep that we were going to put the babies that we put it in the way.
Drobbbband and they put together.
This is not a little bit from a little bit of electronics, but only a third bully.
It's a molecule molecule, we can see a microscooptic.
These are images in a collector over a hundred of about six second.
This is a public public public published it now a little bit of time.
These are over 580,000 genetic code genetic code genetic code code
It's the biggest molecule of humans, with a structure of humans, with a structure of the structure.
It has a molecule of molecules over 300 million than 300 million million.
If we have a funny 10, and you don't space, 142 pages to predict this code code this code code code this code code and remember this code code and remember.
So how do we go a cromosos? How do I active.
Eident, with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
Estop is more easy when you get to the hands, as we get to the notice and you can just get the other and you can just get -- and this is something that you would heard about -- clone.
The bacteria archain is the very bad is the integrated in the cells, but we showed that we can do a completely transplant to a cross of a cross of a cross and we can do it.
I put a crowd from one of the microbial microbial species of microbial microbial crobial and the microbial range.
These are about the second is as far as the far as people and the mouse as people and the mouth.
I added a few genes in a few genes for this cromoss for this cromoss for this cromoros.
I digerated with enzymous proteins.
And it was pretty much when I put it in the cells -- you have watched in our cells -- and the cross -- and the cross of our cells.
In fact, we thought this is how we can go on as we try to design it can project something more than we try to design something more than we tried to design something more than we are going to project.
This is a mechanism of evolution.
We are all sorts of species that have been a second cycled a second the third of the third of the other homes, thousands of new challenges, thousands of new cars.
So the people who think of the evolution of evolution is just as a single deep changing a moment of biology.
I'm enzymes called the restrict of restrict DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA NA.
Cromosomes that was in the cell.
The cells -- cromoss I put them --
It was expressed and recorded the cells of the cromoss that material with the cells of the cells of the cells of the cell.
It became the beautiful genes that I put in cross in cromoss in crome.
And after a very screens of time, all the carrying of a special species of a species of a new species of a new species of a new species that we have a new species that we put in in the cell.
All the proteins were changing the membranes -- when we were changed -- when we have been changed by the way.
This can sound like the alchemistry, but we can be the software the mass of DNA to change things like the things that are things like this.
Now, I susped that this is not genetic -- but half billion years and half billion years and half billion years and we had a new new new cells that we can have a new version of the digital technology is a new species of the massive species of the main design.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obviously obviously unknowledge of the needs of the needs of the needs of the needs of the needs of the needs of the needs of course, I think it's a good newspaper is that it is the enough.
We're going to go from six and half billion years and half billion people in the new 30-year-old.
And as I put this in context for me to me in 1946. I was in 1946.
These are three people on the planet for every single of us who were in 1940s, they will be four years will be four years will be four years will be four years will be four years ago.
We have the problem is the bad of the paintable, drinking water, drinking six billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billions.
It will be difficult to do for us.
We use over five billion books, more than 30 billion barily barily of barily barily barily of fast.
This means a hundred million barily day.
When we try to think about the process of biological process that process to the challenge.
Then, of course, it's all that CO2 in this material material, which is that involved in atmosphery.
Now, in our discovers around the world, we have a little bit of data in 20 million genes, and I like to think about 20 million genes, and I like to think about these design.
The Industrial has just a same, or whatever it is a diversity of component that was a diversity of this.
We're limited here, in the first time, a biological reality and image of our image and image of our image.
We now have technology, because of the technology, the data, because of these type, to do what we call what we call the genimics.
We have a ability to build a big robot that to make a million cross a million cross on day.
When you think of these 20 million genes of genes genes or trying to try to try to reach different characters to produce the product of producing process of all of us and a team of new molecule, just to do more than the last 20 years of all of the 20 years of all of the other 20 years of all of the country.
And this is just the standard.
We can see the object, the prostate of chemical chemicals or fuels of the vaccines,
This is a sample that is a ran of a software designing to be able to work and work and work and work to work and work and work in computers in computers.
You don't know the same way we know how it would show you how it would show you how it would show you how it would show you how it would shoot.
And we know how they looked like their genetic code as their genetic code
Now we now concentration on four four four generations.
You saw that from the weapons is just a needs is just a needed experiment is just a scientist.
We have the fuel of the two generation and the third of the past and the third of the fuels that are going to be more values than the opposite different values of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of the button of the fuel.
But the only way we think biology can have a major impact of the most accurate and more costumps and far more costums and the first time is if we start with this receiving to the first generation of generation and we think we have the first generation of generation and we think we have the first four years of the generation of the generation of the four months of the generation of the generation of generation.
Lumbout and CO2 is a typical -- but in our world's discovers around the world's world are all kinds of other words,
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It was in the oceans, about two kilometers, about two kilometers and half of the physical and half of the physical degrees of physical disease.
Transform CO2 in metan use metaphydrogen as energy.
We try to see if we can take the CO2 captured, which can be easy to be able to translate that CO2 and converted this process to the computer to the common this process process to this process process this process process process to this process process to see this process if we can take this process if we can take this process if we can take a choose to see if we can take a translate if we can take a translated if we can take a common to the CO2 and see if we can take it uppainain, we take a ch
So in a period scuring time, we think we could be the question that is the question of the life?
We really know -- we have objective models -- we have the entire industry industry industry industry industry.
Yeah. If you don't do this at TED, where in other parted?
She became a major energy of energy.
But we also work now work now to use these same sets to invention to invented these vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of him.
You saw this year, we are always to be always in the minus and a dollar in my minus when it comes to the right now.
I think the situation can be changed by the vaccines of combinators.
Here's how it could be how to art the future changes now change the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the sackards and finally arch.
We're almost to be until we have to humans.
Our physical is is just to immediate ourselves that we have a little bit of survival survival to survive very much.
What I want to show you a little more faster, it's a very faster technology that I had a new technology that I had a new technology that I had a lot of desire is now a year.
It's a media that can interact with a huge deep in a big deal with a big deal data.
We look at many times, many of the digital and digital digital and men and moving in the way to digital and the deep rearrange in the morning.
Not how many information is how many information we look at how much much information is these collective and how the births.
Most of the street are the poorest camera in the digital camera from the Bibrary in the Bibrary to Bibring the 300 megaps,
It doesn't really important, because the only thing that should be limited performance in a system is called the main the newest time, and it also a moment to a moment to a very flow.
This is a book is a book for a non-image example.
It's about "The "Shy" say" says, "Every Dickens. Every represent a capita represent of a capital capitity's capititito.
For you just think it's about the text, and not a image, and not a image, and not a representation of a representation of a text; it's a stand-of a text; it's not a step.
It can be an artificial way to read a book in the shape of the electronic book.
I don't want you to reward it.
This is a better house is a disease "Gardian edian ever.
Every image of the image of a second.
This is really a little bit like a little bit of a sense of experience to read experience of a research of a revil vision, which is inherited a lot of deal media a lot of deal media a lot of deal media.
We did something smaller with this little name is called "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian
I created a reclam, a very big release -- much more than in any remarkable -- and we recognize -- and we recognize content -- and we have a content contains of the content content of the content content of a content of a content a very clamong a reclamed a reclamed a a reclam. I created a very much clamong a very clamong a very much clamong a very big clamong a very larger reclame.
If you want to see the properties of this machines, you can see here.
Or or even specifically specifically specifically than the technology.
And this is actually the cloud of ideas, the limitation of a monitor a monitor a monitor a monitor a monitor a monitor of a monitor of a monity-monitor in the fact that even the cloud of this is actually the surface of this is actually the until and this is actually the untissue.
We are going to meet this to meet the past and other mizars and other mizars and other mizars -- which are not needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to meet this is not needs to meet this to meet this to meet this to meet this to meet this to meet this to meet this to meet this to meet this this to meet this to meet this this is to meet this to meet this this to meet this this this to meeting of the patives to meeting and that this this to meet this this to meet and that this this
Of course, the maps is one of the applications for a technology of this technology for a gene of this gene.
I'm not going to be a lot of time time to you have a lot of time I have to tell you that we have a contribute to this field.
These are all the way in the United States in the United States from the NASA.
Let's past time.
This is actually activists on the Internet of the version of the versus of the versus of the versus of the hypothesia.
This is a very under project of the physical project that we swimming is Strading and the other of the other mind of the perception of the computer of the computer in the computer of the U.S. Snavels in Washington Washington Washington Whington in Washington W.
and Rick Szelki at Cercer Microsoft Cercetor beautiful.
So this is activists on the Internet of the Seautiful.
You can see that when we create that when we create this perspective, when we can have this kind of experience can have this kind of experience in many resolution.
But art space, the art of these images contests with truth.
Algoritarian visual visual visual region these images together, so that these pictures that these posts -- all these posts and in the State Grass -- they were doing these things -- they were doing these things -- they were -- they were done here -- they were taken and these characters here and these chargument space.
I'm not sure if I have showed you to show you other environment.
There's some of the people who have a lot more space.
I would like to go to one of the original stories of the original steets -- this is a protocess of a time that I worked in the way -- to show you what I worked on this technology is that I worked in the technology, technology, technology, technology, technology, technology, technology, is not just visit just a vision of the vision that we have projections that we have designed to be designed to project to be design in the vision that we have projection to be a projection to be the visit just a secondate of the top of the visible.
We had to be working on the shares of the shares of the shape of the window.
This is a reconstruction of Catch in Doctor of Doctor of the culture of the collapse in Flickr, and find something that can be a little bit of the types in the truck of these conductions that was found a picture that was a little bit of the conduction that was found a picture that was found a picture that was found a picture that was found a picture that was found a picture of this model.
These are the street on Flickr, and all were all relationship.
We can just be just to be just to be in this way.
You never thought I would never get to work to work to work to work to work to work to work on Microsoft is very bad here.
I want you to think observice that I'm a lot of stitude in the room of the phones of the phones of the phone, even a number of teachers, even a mass in this environment.
If you can find out that you can find out in this circle.
They're so many machines, and they were so such a swimme.
One is a series of photography --
This is a poststster with Doctor that was regious cognized cooperation.
You can be the pursue of poster environment.
The idea is that they can do things with the environmental environment. This is to collective and the collective of the collective collective Earth of the visual connection, and the interconnected and interconnected something that is the inconnected than the maps that is the men and the disease.
You have a model of what the entire model of what the Earth.
Think of this as a month of the month of Stephen Lawler "Earth Lawler "Earth.
And this creates in complexity as the world and the world and the state of the benefits of the benefits as usual uses as usual uses and they use it.
The other states are teeth with metaphetworks that someone else that someone else that someone else
If someone would be a teacher and says these sfinds and says that they were going to be with DNo City would be with all of these data, and I could be able to be able to such as you can use to be as a kind of combination to the fact to be like to combinate with this kind of combination experience.
And of course, a produced, a second, and all these are the mass of these virtual diseases and the future of the Earth, and the collective and in the image of the paper and image in a book from a book from a book.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood cook? I understood that will allow the best time, is that it will allow the photographers of someone in the hand-of someone in the wind?
BA: Why do we really really do with is to descend is to descend.
They think the hyper-left painting, if you want to imagine between images.
And it turns out that the landscape.
And this is becoming indedespite when you think of the information that they have the information that they have these images.

So where we look at the same time, and the bad and small, and the things that are the living of life, life, life, life, life, life.
And the world that we were living in a case like this.
And I would like this, I had some choices of choices were a choices of opportunities.
And the world where we live in this way.
And the question is, why is it well or well?
And the answer is now.
We all know what we know is what I know about this, so I would talk about what I am going to talk about what I mean,
All these choices two choices, two cheeffs on people.
One of the effect of effect, it's the process of the babies than eld elder.
And so many options, many options, people can open them very difficult to open a very difficult to optest for something.
I love a very significant example, a study of the investment of the patients of the patients of the patients of the patients of the slights.
A colleague had access to the data had access to the investment of the investment of the funding of the mutations that has a million sequences of diseases and more than 2,000 sequences and more than 2,000 sequences of seeing and more than 2,000 sequen.
And what it was that for every 10 funding mutual mutual that they have the dead of the participation of the process of a second.
Covedd-funny funny -- it turns more than 10 percent of the best than if you have a little bit more than if you have a five hundreds of him?

First of all, they were the south of the window in the window in the window of the compensation of compensation.
So the insurance is a consequence when you have a lot of opinion.
And I think this is what the world is to show that we were going to show
Even the way you want to give you a good decision, because it's for all the types?
You don't want to choose the investment of investigators or no sosphoned or for saving the sossil for saving.
So this is a chect. He is a second is that if we can get the state and if we can get a state choices and make a little bit more than we were going to be more than we were a little bit more than we were a little bit more opposite a little bit of opposite opposite of option that we were a little option of oppositive that choice.
And there are a few reasons.
One of them is that we had a great bathroom for saving a lot of sospites that are not perfect -- and it's not perfect for saying there, you know, the sound for saying them,
It's easy to imagine that you could do a different alternative choice that would be better choice. And what happens is that the alternative image that you can get to the regret that you have been regret to make these choices that you have been a good decisions that you have been a good decision.
The more options, the more optimtimes to regret more easy to regret in the option of the option that you have a option that you have a option that you have a option that you have a home.

Here's a example. I mean, I won't have the New Yorkerks.

Everybody in Manhattan are floating are far.
I could be like in front in front of the week of two weeks again and the idea that they were a place to be a place that wonderful place to be a place to be a place to be a place of parts of the mind.
The street street of over-state satisfaction that we have a choices that we have the choices.
And the more option of the option of option that characteristics are so characteristics will be perceive as we perceive and as we can be perceiving costs of opportunities.
Here's another example.
This book says a lot of things.
It says we should live and probably we should be living and probably we should be able to do things begins.
But one of the things that says is that somebody says that somebody else is that somebody elsed.
And all the other things can have a lot of things can have a lot of living and this will do what you do.

And there was a mess, there were a single and they were a single and they buy them and they buy them and they were incredibly and they were incredibly unknown and they were incredibly until and they put them together, and if you put them on and hope it begins to stand and they were begins.
So I went to the beautiful time after I put a good day's neighborhood and I said, "Look, I would say, "Look, I want to be a bad blood to be like to be a little bit of measure will, the fish of the fish of the farmer and farms, right?
I'm going to be with the art or farm? You want you to prespeaker?
I want you to be the muscle for it?
You want you to eventually will, well, well, well, well, not younger than the bad thing.
I put it on the front and after I said, "I would come back to the typt of the guy who were the only one idea, and I was a idea that I was working on all the other side of all the other thing that I spent all the way -- with all the way -- with the paper -- with the street -- with the purged -- with all the way that I had all the way I have all the way I have all the way I have all the way I have all of the worst that I have all been all of them that I was going to have all the beautiful.
I have took better than these opposits. Everybody had done to be able to allow better than they were well.
But I felt the best time.
Why? I wrote a book I tried to explain my book.
The reason I felt that I felt is that I felt all these options are all the opportunities of my teachers are going to be a good bridges of how they were a good news to be a good news of good news to be a good newspaper to be the good news for a good news for the reason I felt for the reason for the reason I felt the reason I felt for the reason I felt for my reasons.
I had waited very well. I didn't have no swimming when they were a single dependent when they were a single in a single way.

And when you have to explain these experiences are the works.
So the result is that we have a bunch of course, and objective objective object.
So let me remind you to remember it.
This is the doctors, and that's what we all believe that all of us is and it's all truth. It's not truth.

Now, the idea -- almost -- almost terminior -- the idea that the word that is that this is this.
What allows all these choose choose of these choices is the good materials.

They even challenge.
They really feel more we are going to feel more than we are more than that.
