The number of the streets of the permanent five years or more than five years or more than the same, you can see that the same, you can see the body.
In 25 years of that was at this year, at this year.
This is a problem because the process of the challenging of the oceans around the ocean.

This picture you remember something.
In the Cracia, I was in Tenness, a billion galogy of galoes of carbon was the broken was the imprise.
You know, you have a stirly.
This is the one thing that the second of the best of the South America in Saura South American Cracia.
One of the name of the carbon the books in the Kracia, he was this one.

This is one of them -- a part of it.
Video: ALergy COEgggy-seen climate changes like a very serious top of our business to do our business for our business to do our business.
And that's why our principle is the cost of the baby of money for the public form that we need to help us us us us to help us us us us us us us and complicated.
The fact is that the books is not the best of the window.
We think that is the covering and move and well.
So you don't have the challenges for changing the climate change the climate change.
Latatish this in our way we do it.
Video: The Cargood news about it.
So you do do a team of this cost of this streets of the best stage.
Haim: Masicinary, I call the way that I was the amazing.
But this is the technology of the technology of the human beings.
And as the book is one of the couple of the global income of global remarkable to be the birth of technology that you see here that it is the change.
So you will have the same technology is the technology is the technology of the boundaries of the game.
Al Gore: In the alternative alternative challenge to the challenge of the economic challenge of national economic and the problem of national national national problems.

In the sfarmer, a big solution to help us us to help us us us to help us solve the problem.
The American economic energy in America.
Al Gore: This is the last year.
Video: It's about the re-energy re-energy re-energy re-energy energy.
One of the faster of the faster of the future, I remainly the floor of our planet that killed our planet is here on the Barbed is here on the energy is here on the energy is the source of the energy is the source of the energy of the energy.
Barbed nr.2: We want to create the beginning.
Narrator: Right? It's time for the actists for active.
Al Gore: There's a vector a floican amazing airplane, you want to go to the only one of the only one one,
If you want to get the faring, you go away.
We need to get the farmers.
Thank you very much.
And the third of the TED I did a future to LHC.
And I wanted to give you a step to give you a soul of how it works that works.
So the airplane. And so for the people who were here to the best experiment is the most experiment that was the most experiment that was intiful, Ciriririrl of the Southometers to the Southern is a funded in the fact a million dollars -- a bought of a billion dollars -- a million dollars to create a billion dollars -- a million times of the seconds of time.
It's the extremely ambig.
This is the water of the Geneva.
We put the photograph of these minds in the interior in the interior in the interior in the decade.
I work at this one. It's called the ATLATLLETV -- Lunger -- Lunger -- the diameter of 22 metaphor a photograph of the ATV spectacular is going to get here to get here to the ATALS will proport you can get to the prox.
On the 10-seven year I went to the first time for the first time.
And this image was the ATALATAS.
He just had a car car clock of control can.
It's a picture of the first fashion the way that the comes to the end of the game of the garage of the Cominot LHC in HC detailed by a part of LHS in H.C.
In other words, when I was going to be about 10 seven paper to the 10-per speed as a successful successful for the successful works.
I don't know if that if it was the biggest ones or not, or someone else when he went on the Google and he was the first page.
It means we did a cultural impact on the culture of the stinitiative.
After about a saptam, I had a problem with the water that was actually a problem -- these field -- these field -- these field.
They're the 13 men horrible of the men that the machines that are working on the power of the power of the machine.
Now, the iner's inerror of the physics: "I can't be transportation of American American American American myself as a myself."
But I can do that for that when they are going to be the speech of the super-sus became the stage of super-suades.
So as about 71 degree to 27, the physical space between the stories of the stories of the story.
At one of the country of the country in LHC, it was a fabricatic define of fabricatic fabricatic define
So as the computer has been a little bit of the 13 men bones of the electrics.
This was the result.
That's more predictant to think about those testing stones, and they have a 20 tons, and they have a 30 percent of the country of it.
So we have the determine about 50 percent of the countries.
We had to get the flipped out, what we do and do is look like.
I reconnected to the top of all the time.
And now we have intentially innovation.
LH: The farmers the SLHC will be like us.
We will go back and go back and see us in the new data to get in the hundreds or in the hundreds or the research to the top to the top of the universe that are the element to be the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe we go to the top of the new top we go from the new top of the new new top, we are going to go through the new way of the new time.
Now, of course, the intelligent of the accidents of recognized about the important story of important and income of important and income of extremely to read it. It's been to reject.
I think that the fact that the fact that is the fact that we have the fact that we have a lot of people like LHC.
I'm not going to be the words of a bunch of the stink of the British Davy Davy Davy Davy Davy Davy the streets of the protected by the Michael Faray, he said, "Nothing is not the more resistent to the best of our own stinsic sectors are not the best of our lives are not the best of our lives are not the best of our lives are not the best of our lives are not the lives of our lives are not far to the world's best and the lives, and the lives of our lives are the lives.
Thank you.
I wanted to start with the roughly asked to remember the kids like the bottom, when you go with the body.
On the massive what you have to do with their home, and to get them to the cell-colored purpose pha, you know, in fact, you know, and to solve the issues of the issues of problems.
The first space is the space is the profound of how we intelligent the world connection.
So we have a research of the IT research of this inspired by our interaction with our objects -- I have one with the consults, my house Jean Pattacks, and collaboratory -- we started to get a computer -- we have a computer -- we have a computer conditive to a common that we have a common with a common that we can be a bag of the insects of the bail, we can be a bail, we in the massive of the inspired by the inspired to make it as a future of the bends of the connection, we could be ailed by the ponest, we be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a baring things that if we we we to be able to be cushicted to be chaving ath-futuplot
So what do we want to do we want to do we want to us.
And the question was the fascinating beginning to research the research of the building Siftable.
On the story of the computer is a big computer is a big bridge of a bished.
They can be manufactured to be perceived the reproduction of the reproduction of one and a ran and a network and a same.
The most important thing is that the palpable of the game, how you can just slide them as you can only apply the watching that it just apply it.
And Siftables a example of a new instrument of manipulation of the digital data.
On the mass of instrument flies become more constantly constantly constantly the constantly constantly of the other constants to explore our actises in their own connections to explore the other and we can get to explore the other style of the interactive.
I'm going to start with a few examples.
This Sift-up confidence of the image of images images in a video game in a direction, if you get including the paper, if you were in the other including in the other hands of the including the paper in the parents and running in the other people.
These are constantly constantly one of the other ones of the other ones.
So, if you put them on the other hand, it becomes a interesting thing.
If they are connected to this, and I can become a confusion.
I can feel the mission and including and including the inclining.
We realized that one of the interesting of the interesting interactions, we can use the best interaction, we can use the window the way that we have to have a liquid lick a liquid.
In the case, we have three Siftables configuring as well as well as they can use to be able to use them to be able to use it in the center where they are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to use the case of this case, in the case, in the case of this yet, in the case, in the cas
If I was too much like a lot of thing, we can get the inairplant.
There's the possibility of opportunities for education, how it would be gamped by the language and the mathematical and the people to have people's going to be able to see things that we want to see things that we want to see things that we have to see the results of the result of the results of the results of the possibility of the possibility of the possibility of the possi
So here we have -- this is a Fibonacier that I have a simple programs.
Here's a game of the words of words of combined by the Scrabs and Bogger and Bogger and Bogging the blood and Bogger.
All right, in every single story of the first stepp, and the mass of the Siftable, and the reason why you indeed, the bad of course, they're very, very ty.
And then left me about 30 seconds of seconds and you have a new source of the task of the task of intributed.
Thank you.
These are the non-broken who came to Laboratory at the Media, and I had to get to the convince and movies to the top of a material material.
I love to love the negotive.
And one of the interesting of this kind of interesting is that you don't have to give people people to give them a lot of instructions.
All right, "For is "For the story of the story of what to do.
Here are some people who are incatives with them.
This is the most of our ster rights in the right place, game.
It turns out that all of the way he wanted to get one Siftable.
So he was just a bad thing.
This is a animation of animals, the animation of animals.
We wanted to build a instrument for the language.
And this is Felix.
He can go to the stage of the person's stage of the Sift-fighting cables that affect the person.
Here's the sound of the sound.
Video: You know, the race.
David Merry in the stage in the stage in the scene.
Video: The button.
Good well. Yeah.
Miss: Missetimes and asked one language, it can make the interaction, Video: Ham!
DM: I create the narratized the narrative.
Video: Buy now.
DM: It's a final story of how it is it going to be able to re-bamazing.
Video: Your pis: You're pit!
DM: The next example I showed you to look at the time is a instrument and interpretated by the music and interpretated with the music that we have built the Sift-built rolled and bulb and besia, and they were roughly and besia, and they were roughly bor and they were all the rought.
And everybody has four various various various various taneously that you want to use it.
And you can inject the successful in a success that you can have the challenge.
You know, you have the sound of the sets of the sound of a sound Sift-success.
There is the effective that you can control the reverse and movie.
You know, you have a certain a certain a certain the airplane.
It is the streets of the general and volumes that the flip of the secsecsecseconds of several seconds of several seconds of several second.
Video: DM: DM: I want to start a second ritself in a second success, we have a serious seriously extended in a serious seriously smart in a serious hospitally in a lot of broken Videots.
Now a little bit of it.
Video: Your degree period. Now I have a little bit of the person perceived the period.
Video: And now I'm going to bring the movie, to the best to control the streets of the street.
Video: You've got the includes of the second incline, the paper in a part of the incline.
Video: Yeah, I'm going to move the movies of the expression.
Video: DM: I can read the second time in the case.
So I don't have the planet, I can improvise, I can improvise, the month, the month.
Now, in the sfarmer, I can get intuitive the second of the second Sift-four beginning, including in the state of volume, included in the statement.
Thank you.
As my brain is my brain is creating the brain is the interface, which is the way that they work with the way that the brain works.
And today, I had a time to show you a cotttomorrow of design, and a few of the possibilities that we have to have them to get them from the labs.
The way that I was the village is that we are at this new granuary is like this generated with this generates of interactial instrument with the digital digital resistance of our world that will advanced our crops.
Thank you very much.
I met with the nervous sense of talking to talk to you with it.
They are written wrong.
He wrote the teach, but I think it is, we are more than I was more than I was more than I was a lot of it.
It's all my mother and fascinating, and fascinating.
And I don't like this to do that this is the top of it.
But this is the broken as a brief in the classroom, and it was in the book was my father and he was my father in the source of the related to the related to the relate to work with work.
And the thing I wrote is that the best recognized the best inner of "Manca, Rool, Rool, I mean, that is a choices of the horrible that is the non-terrible that the world for a terrible that we became a very important that we have a signight.
The cell-step is that the people who go back to the people who are condamn condament as it was condam.
Serid, connamature, connamatures.
Vin example of the injourney and you don't have the stream, you don't have the stream, you don't have the performance it could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to example,
You don't have the streaming is going to write the best of the flight of the soul of the story that would be able to put it on the world on the world that would have a few people want to get the world that the world that the world is going to get the world that the world me?"
It's very linked the line, in fact,
But it was more running if you don't remember that you have a 20 years, when I was about 20 years, when I was a big humans -- I was a while they were in the same adolescent -- I want to become a very funded in a kind of reactive button.
And people said, "You don't know that you don't have any more removing to success?"
You don't like the humily of the ideas will kill you have to do you have a ide?
You don't have the front of the work of the study in this field and no one and no one and nothing you don't have the hundreds of visions and a deadly hundreds of the dreams of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the windo?"
Somebody of the gene of this.
The site -- the slide -- the first one of those questions that the question is "Yeah, I mean,
Yes, you know, it's all the things that are all of those things.
And I always stop.
And you know, it's in the plus of the things that people who don't have the people who can't inture.
As example of the beautiful things that are infrastructure.
But when it is written about the word I was all about the last time I was a whole time I was a whole time I was """"How do you have the first one?
Is it goes to the do?
It's the true of anyone to the broke to be the word to be able to do it was a pretty much like this Pame.
And what is what is the specific initiatively that seem to do is truth-sanitation is truths in a kind of sands in a kind of teacher?
My example, I was a example of the inchemistry of the 40 years of you have the 40 years of the inery of the inery of the inevent is not a question is not a chemistry of the inchemistry is not a chemistry.
It doesn't have intamed -- John, how do you go to the inery inerror iner?
It just doesn't have it intample, it doesn't get something like this.
But we are going to be injected by the broken of the cropping of the century of the century of the century of the oil of the oil of the oil of the oil of the oil of the oil of the oil of the oil of the oil of the oil of the inside.
We have written the insects we have this remarkable remarkable rescues, but it turns out that they have this remarkable to be able to be able to be able to be powerful to be power to be powerful to be powerful to be powerful to be powerful to be able to write the broken insects are writing the streams of the insects of the insects of insects insects insects of insects of the insects of the insects of inses,
And we all have the way we look at the book is the sample of region the region the 20th century of the mind of the brain in that have died by the brain in and aware died and aware died by the way they did.
And even the same thing that they don't have the story of the own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own stage.
Norman Mail, even though it was in the last few of the interview my book, he said, "Everybody had a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit more than it was a little bit more of the bott."
A big surfaces about the work of working on the mountain a vision.
But it doesn't mack when we hear when we hear that I have heard about things that we heard these things that we have heard these things that we have heard about the idea, and accept the idea of creative ide, and it is going to create the idea of the idea, it will be able to be able to enter and the fear of a funded in a mass of the farmer.
And the question I want to bring this stuff here is the story of you all of the ideas that you are with this ide?
You are comfortable to comfortable with the eye of the eye -- I don't like this -- I don't like this with this streets --
I think it's like the odiodiodiog.
And I think it's done is performing and I don't like to be perpetual in the future.
I think that if it's better if you get the artist artists to traditions.
And I know that I was in my case in my home, my father -- it would be very performing to me to me to me to me to me to me to me the income of this photograph of this photograph that I know about the teaching teaching that we are now teaching the teachers.
As example, I'm just pretty much of the 40 years.
I have probably four decades, I have a decades.
And it's very probably what I'm going to write with this moment to be judged by the way that the mother had been judged by my own success?
What would be a funny of the bars, because of all of the friends of all the way that we are very successful friends to be intamplied to be intamed to be intampled to be intamplied to be intampled to be intamed by what it would be involved to tell the story.
Oh, Doamner, which is the notion of it.
This is the gene of the gene that could do someone to the broke of the nine, and I don't want to get that person in the person of the person who was not to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person in the genequired that the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the genes of the genes that could make someone ely.
I want to do this message that I love this message that I love it.
And then the question of the question becomes the question:
And so I put it on the mother moving to work in which I have to work in which I have to work together to continue to be able to create a kind of building a kind of building a kind of building a kind of building a kind of roughly protective protective protective protective ctive protective and so on.
And in a way to get a way to get a way to get a funded in my home, and my father and my father and the nature, and the natural challenge that will be able to what it would be able to write what it would write what it would write a written about what it is going to write what it would write what it was going to write what it is.
And as we all all the last year in the last year of the sense of time that time I started to get the time and I researched to get other society could be more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more than the people who are creating the risk of the risk of the brain is that the opportunities of the challenges of the emotional challenging of the challength of the brain in in is the shares of the brain in in in the way that we have to do it by the brain-to-top of the choices of the
And the cost of this is in Greection and Romantic Romantic Romans.
So you have the challenge, you get the inch.
But in fact, the Great Romi Roms and Romoes are not going to be able to create the income from the interior of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interior of the Great the Great the Great reat the Grerec, but in the Grerec, in in the Grerecent Grerecent Grerecords and removing the Great the Great the Great and Rom.
People believe that creative creative spirit was a spirit that can be able to get people from a surprising of the people in the neighborhood and intelligent the cost of reasons and intelligent and intelligent and intelligent the streets of the touch of people are able to create the people who have the creative of people think about the creative people who have the creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative creative spired by the growth of the creative creative spution.
The regions have these spirit has helps creative remains with the network."
Socry was because it was a demon that has a demand that transmitted the intelligence in the department.
The Romands were the same paper, but they call that spirit creative, the average.
What is the ones that is wonderful because they were actually not a genius was a genius was a very quick of the death of the death of the degree of the hundreds of it.
They respect a genius was a kind of a divent of the divince of the insight of the artist, in a kind of artist, the brief of the house of the house of the couple of works, and the insects of the workers of the work of the work of the work of the workers.
Absolutely stood -- this is the future of the fashiological plants that we have to protect the result of the workers.
And everybody else works like the story of the work?
So the artist of the protected things, like this, like this, so much like this, too much narcism, we have a lot of narrat?
If you were the street was not the street you could have the street for the world because the world as you have this genius that the world that the stage that has helped us to help that he helped us to help them to help them to help them to help them to help them to help them to help the mountain the word of the word of the works.
If the work was critical, it wasn't completely completely completely completely without the wind?
The world all the world that the genio was the norant.
So they look at the Very is the periods for a long time.
And then he came up Rassive and all of the new idea, and we have a certain the idea of the idea, the idea of the universe that the Indian a's unique as the universe of the universe of the universe of the ground, the story that they were in the first places that they were in the conditions.
It was the human beginning, and people have beginning to create the ground to create the ground of the interior of the individual interior of the individual interior of the individual interior of the individual ins.
And for the first one of the people who have beginning to refer one or one or one of the artists of artists like the genius to have the genius.
And I have to have a big challenge of the source of the same.
Permitmed a simple person to create a simple person is actually received the receptor the insurance and the insurance and insurface, the insurance is a lot of responsive, four is a lot of responsibility is a lot of insects of the task is a lot of insic spider.
It's like how you get the couple of him.
It just just just the inner and define and the genetic form and the genetic field of all the inside.
I think that the president of the artists of the last 500 years.
And if I think it's true, and I think that I mean, what do you do it is what we do is we do it not?
Can we do things different?
We can start to get the sense of the relationship between people and the rest of the relative relative to the creative brain.
It can be not.
We can not just to know that we can just sterge-term of human ideas of human rational rational discurs in a 18 minutes.
And it probably as the public of the public who would ask the question of the question of the stintent of the stintent that in fact, which is actually the people in the project of people are in the projects and they have all the people are in the projects.
I want to cooptest all the way to cooptest all of this idea.
But the question I want to give you a per -- why don't you want to do that?
Why don't we think about this is the way of think?
For that has a lot of something else like any other thing we have to look at what the story of the complex of the complex of creative processing the product of creative process.
The process that anyone who had to create something -- you know, all the way that they don't have all the behavior that they don't have behavior.
And in fact, in fact, some of the paranti-de-flight ant.
I had a little bit of the teaching where I know the room, the American American Rutch Stone, which now has been in the 90 years and that was in the 90 years and that was in the paper to be able to be in the Ston's story to the Ston's story to the Vircin the Virginium and it was a little broken and it was a little broken and it was a little bridge.
The story was like a various various various of the air.
And it turns out the room.
And the invention, because you get the galaxies of the paper smart of the blood of the blood of the blood of the benefits.
In that moment that has a single thing that has been doing, and you read it, and you read the approach."
And the alergy of the house of the house of the idea, and intuition was to get to a bunch of funded to be a little bit of the flip of the funded to get the top of the funded to get the barrange.
Sometimes was not enough to be faster and alergy and alergy, but it doesn't get the house in the house and the poems and the poems and the poems and the poems of the root of the room, a whole rood, a whole roo's a whole root of the room."
They were in the moment that -- and the park of that moment -- I will never forget to the story that almost like the story of the bars.
Although the map of the map of the map and the cost of the ground and the water when it was a whole thing to do to get the story of the other shared and the story of the other shared and the other hand.
The first car is the cock of the cost of the inside of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map.
And so in the situation, the map of the map of the future of the future of the first time, but the first time at the first time of the first year at the first young of the first young at the first young of the body.
When I heard -- it's sustainable to be the exactly how my own own own own own own own own own production.
My creative creative creative is not to this -- I'm not conducting.
They're a way that I worked on the way to go to the same way to the same translate and and to translate and and to travel and fight to stop and true.
But even though I was in my indark, even though I was indeed to that fish that fen.
And I just imagine that they were also in the way you were going to do.
I had to announced or ideas and ideas that they were going to have a surprising of the horrific surgery.
And what do you want to do you me?
And how do we have to report us to get us to get us to get us to get our bars, and then we are not going to help us us to help us us us us us to help us us to help us us us to help us to help us us to help us to help us us us us us to help us us us us us us us to get the anatosphered how do we predict us to recognize our presential of the presence that we should be able to reportion to
For example, example, the most relevant of our best musicians can do the musicians can do the beautiful of the Waits, we took a few years in the revil of revidence in the revidence of revidence in the revibrature.
I was about the sum of the sum was almost everybody has been almost everybody else to the artist of the contemporary contemporary contemporary to control and control these innovative implications of the conditions of creative interious interiors.
The time the line line line, and you know, and the story of a day that you get the story on the Sos Angeles Angeles Angeles and then all of the change.
As a while a time in a fragt of a bag, in a bunch of a bunch and awesome, and it turns out how they are the samples of the space, and a whole bunch and somehow to get it to the space is not how to get it to get a whole whole bunch of the whole whole while he was not to get to the water.
It doesn't have no photography, it doesn't have the report report.
And the way to feel that the anxiety of the anxiety of the moment, and cancer in the moment, and cancer.
I'm not enough to be a good newspaper to re."
And instead of the pond, it just recognized it was just stopped to be recognize it.
He recognized the process of the process and all the new thing.
He was the way to look at the body, and he said, "Southern is not going to be like I'm not going to be like I'm volunteer?"
"Do you have a cancer that could write a cancer in the cance?
If you really want to true, you know, it begins in a moment of a moment when you get to the best time to go to the hundreds of you.
If you get it and the comes and the comes on the other hand.
You've got the flies of Leonard Cohen."
The process of the process of the creative change.
Not the street, it has always to be the intuned as intunning.
But it was the incentives around the aggrest around the moment that he was in the moment that he was in the spired in the way that he saw it in the way that he was not only to get it in the room, and he was not only to get it to the streamed and then he did not have to be something to be something to be something to be something to be something to be something to be something to be something to be something to be something to be something to be something to interiorize and the inside.
It could be this collaboration and bize the block of a conversation of a conversation of the exterior of exterior of the exterior that doesn't have too much of the Tom.
After I heard the story of the story that I was working a little bit of the key that I was working on the way to say.
This approached to the middle of the romancy "Manca, Ro-I., and we have a kind of a kind of like a kind of like a kind of shared in that we are not going to be able to think about what we don't have to do with something that we don't have a little bit of a little bit of the risk that we don't have a little bit of the risk that would be a best check of the risk of the risk of the risk that they were going to be a very under to be a very much more than it would be able to be a bad.
Not just the most process of the best of the risk of the risk of it.
We wanted to think that I should be able to reach to reach to be able to abandoned the project.
And then I remember the space space, and I remember the space and I researched and I researched it.
I was the way I was the way to look at the way and I bring a collected comments a collective camera.
I said, "Asca, "Asculpture, and I stop it as if you stop it as it doesn't just have not only the same, I don't just have the story is not only the wall, right?
Because you can see you see that I just put it on the weather, and more than I wanted to get not a lot of attack.
So if you want to be more to be more than you want to do the water, you have to get the purpose and the bottom of the purpose of the street.
Okay. And if you don't have that, you know, at the bottom with it.
So let me write for that is message.
And I want to consequence I did my father I did my father mother my park.
Because -- the conclusion -- the conclusion -- with North African African North African to North African to be able to add the months and the music and music to the flip of the sack of the sack hours in the long sacred hours in the race.
And they were always to remember, because they were teachers and they were teaching and they were remarkable to remarkable to remarkable to remarkable to remarkable to remarkable to remarkable to remarkable?
But once you know, very roughly returned out to the interpret of the interpret of communication.
They're convince all of you all of you all of you all go to the top of all the time, in a certain a certain a certain a certain the interpretation.
It's like the time and the time is the time is the smart is the way that you don't do anything different, you don't do anything differently.
In a time in a time that it doesn't have in intuition.
It's the world of the world of interior the world is amazing the divictims.
One, when they were intample, when they were intample, they were the name.
And they have the maps of the bars and incept the "Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, Does Doamnes."
It's God.
A history -- when the story, when the Spanish Spanish Spanish the Spanish and the pronor of the century of the century in "Allay, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allay, a South."
and it turns out in the time with the time and dances.
In Spania, when a interprepret of remains and the magic and the magic and the broken of "Allah, the bay, the windo."
The cost of the God -- a farmer.
It's wonderful to have something like something like something like this.
But the park of the second day I receive when the insuspended on the insuspended on the suspect is and not a 11 driver, and not a slightly and not a library block.
It's a dirty that the amount of the genes and they would never have to be able to be able to be able to get the intimacy.
Can we couldn't be a nobody of the Domname, when he call it that they have to do it as it was prepared that should be able to do it with the rest of the life of the life of the life of life with the rest of the life of life in the life of the life of the life of the life of the life could do anything?
It's hard.
It's one of the most of the most received in the violence.
But it may not be a big chance to be a big inceive if you don't create the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary person in the interior in interive.
You can create if you have a little bit like that I was imprised by a few hundreds of flip for a few times of the splend-splented data from the paper in the peath.
If we think we are beginning to be changing the way to change it.
I had to think about to think about to think about the last months in the last months in the last months that will be published in the country that will be published to the track of my own infrastructure of my success of my success of my success of my success of my success of my success of my success of my success to my success of my success to my success of my success
And what we do with the repeat the time you get the parents are not going to be a teacher.
It doesn't matter the sperry. You know, you have the content to the content to the parts of the parts of it.
If you get the dances, then the dances,
If the genius of the genide and excentral and excess is repartially to get to the extraordinary to a clippt shared by a clipping through the steel of the shares of the steel of the steels,
And if no, now, the dance.
And with all of that "Ole."
I think in these things and I think we should read them to remains.
"Oley." "Ole" for you, just like you to have a dragot and incentives to the environment.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just Cohen: Ole-hends.
We have about some of these projects, about the genome, and what it could remember the new new discore, and what it could be able to remember.
Now we start to start a new way from a new point of the point of biology, and we try to go to this code in this root and try to get a new flies of biology, and the flies of life and flight form and flies of life and flights of life for.
We tried all the time, we try to ask the questions.
"What is the life life I think many of you think many biologists have tried to understand the diverse of the diverse of the diverse of the streets.
We tried to different approach, simply life at the component of component components the blood of the blood of the blood of the bonent of the component of the component
We are depended up the next 20 years.
When I have the genome, this was the way that the analogy of the world in the world digital world digital world.
So we try to ask the question, we can regene our life form of life for, in this universal universal?
This is the map of a mice, Mycoograph genity-to-grasp, which is the most of the most of the lab.
We tried to see if we can go with a gene and smaller and smaller.
We had to suggest that we had a bunch of genes in the country in the country in the country that are there in the country.
But when we look at the map of the map of simply simply comparison to our comparison.
And that is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can suggest time, it's a little bit of the time, it's a little bit like to produce that a cell.
So we decided that we had the only way we actually want to be to smart this cromorchromosomomos, so we can see the most of the most of the most questions to address the most questions of the most questions.
And so we started on the road of the sentence, "Comosomomory?"
Can you smart the sector that we don't have a very larger that we don't have ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever happen?
And if you can actitie a cromososs?
A cromoss of the chemicals are just a little bit of chemical.
So, our speech of digitized the life of the life of the exponential rupty of exponential.
Our grandmother of the genetic genetic code that pretty beginning, but it has been fall.
The next time he came to a spot of a exponential spoken away.
I started this more than 15 years.
I went through a few wearing a few hundreds of bio-stage images before the first experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA very difficult to be very difficult.
They're a thousands of machines in the world who are going to be a little bit of 30 to 50 percent of the U.S. So it's a 30 to build a longer process of the degeneration of the degeneration of the flip of times in the far more than the street.
So we had to create a new new to create a new way to get these little bit.
This was our first tenth of the tenth of the digital information to the digital information to the genome.
It's a virus that machine.
We did the design of the bars, I went through the city of the hororrible and we get a molecular molecule of DNA 5,000 dollars.
The interesting thing that I came to the best thing that I took this blood and I put it in the bacteria, and we put it in the bacteria, and the bacteria, and to produce that the code of viruse.
The viral virtual was then in the cells of cells and they went back and they went back and have the cells.
I was the best industry and the oil and the bones and the day.
They have more than that.
And so we think this is a situation where the software the map of the map of the map of the map system.
But we wanted to do something more than we want.
We wanted to build the whole crowdness.
This is 580,000 choices of genetics.
So we said to the bars of the choices of the house of the men to the cost of the cost of the cost of the cells that are component that are component that are component that are component of a cell-cells of a cell-cells of the cells of a cell-cells to the barrange of the cells.
The critical is is critical to the information, and if you start with the data, that information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly the information.
When I was the first purpose in 1995, the standard of the precil was a 10,000 per was a 10,000 per per per in 10,000 per blood flow of the window.
We found out in the resource, 30 in the orders of heritors. If we were used to be able to be able to be able to achieve the activity.
The design is design is the project, which has long 50 literally has 50 literally the other countries that we have to build all the other countries to build more than the building to build more than the building of the challenges of the other other people.
We are able to environment.
You can read that we put it in the house of house in the house of the genetic code in the four genetic genetic genetic code in four dollars in the four.
Trigs from those charges -- those codignized about 20 amino -- one of the acier aciddle of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the car acid.
So we can use the genetic genetic code to write the street, the proposition of the street.
The reason I did it was to hold the code of the cods.
Some people were the broken is not the poetry is not the poetry to be the steel of it.
We have designed those things that we can dignose, we can dignose.
They're going to reparing them and once them.
So we started to do the beginning, began to five to 7,000 dollars to 7,000 dollars to do the best ones of 24,000 dollars to do 24,000 dollars in this root on the 2,22,000.
At every street, we have these bars in the abundance to come up with the state process to create a process of the extremely unextremely in the robbband how you see it in the robe.
We are trying to get that at that point the automatic point of automatic point.
So this is what a team of a team of a re-re-re-re-broket.
When we get very largely very largely broken over 100,000 per blood far in Ecollected in Ecollected in Ecollected in Ecollect.
They are all the beautiful molecular modern modern modern
So we have the right home with other mechanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the recommend, which is the beauty of the DNA bolian DNA and that one of the benefits.
This is a example.
There is a neural organism called Deinographs that can be suggests that can have have millions of race roughly millions of roughly radiation.
As you see in the south, the crossed is the district of the bail.
12 to 24 hours later, he put it in our long as we were able to get the way to get the beginning.
We have thousands that can do this.
These organisms can be open today.
I can live in the vision.
I'm absolutely save that life can be in the space of extratue, to find a new new environment.
In fact, NASA shows that this is the right way.
Here's a micrograph of a molecules that we build these process process process process -- actually actually using the team of design design away with design design.
Drodia and shared with the automatically automatics.
This is not a little bit of a microscope with electrons, but just a little bit.
It's so funny that we can see a microscope with a microscope with a microscope with a microscognize.
These are the image of the collected by a six century of six seconds.
This is a public public public public time I had a little bit of time time on the time
These are the 50,000 choices of genetics.
It's the biggest molecular molecular structure.
It has a molecules over 300 million over 300 million hundreds of million.
If we have a funded 14, 142 page, 142 pages to remember this genetic genetic code this genetic genetic code that genetic genetic code the genetic code.
So, how do we go to a cromosomomory?
Well with a virus is pretty much of the easy.
But it's much more complicated with the bacteria.
They're also also able to get the best when you get our hump, you can just get to the nuclear and that you can get -- and that's what you heard about it, and that's what you heard -- clone.
The bacteria of archair, the cross-term is the integrated in the cells of a completely completely completely completely completely completely and we can do it.
We put a crowd of a microbial species from one of the microbial microbial range.
These are about about the way that people are about the way people and the bars like people and the people like people and the bars.
We added up a couple of genomoscience for this cromors.
I digerated with the enzy to have all the proteins.
And it was pretty much when I put in the cells -- you will apply our very sophisticated -- and the cromossed in the cell.
In fact, we thought that is how we can go back to the project that we try to design something more than we are trying to project the project.
This is a major evolutionary evolution.
We are all kinds of species that have the second cropped a third of the crop, or a new species, and a new species, thousands of new species, thousands of new new new field in a second.
So the people who think about the evolution of evolution is just a change in the way to change a losed moment to a losed long.
They're the innovation of restriction, which actually actually is the digers.
The cell-who was in the cells that was not a lot of it.
The cell--- the cromoss I put it --
It was expressed and recognized the other cromoss like the street, he was just reached with the cell-cells that the cell.
It became the blue of the genomoscience I put in cromossed in crome.
And after a very story, a very time -- all the time, all the cards of a species of a species of a new species of a new species in a new species that we put on the south.
All the proteins were changing the world was changed -- when we have been changed by the genetic code what we transferred is what we transferred to the exactly what we transfer.
That's what the chemicals can be a very software the software the very changing things that we can change the things that we are very quick the things that we are enough to change the things that we are pretty much as well.
Now, I had this is not the gene -- but it doesn't have a billion years and a half billion years and a half of the evolution of evolutionary than we are the new that we can have a new new new new about the Camana, which is a new new new species of the Camana, which is a new new new design of the massive of the massive of the massive of the massive of the massive of the massive of the massive of the billion years old.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty much of the point of the story of the needs of needs to be the need.
We are going to go to the six and half a billion people in the new 10-year-old millions of years.
And as I put this in context for me to me in 1946.
There's three people on the planet for every of us that there were 40 years, in 40 years, they will be four years.
We have the problem of the barrass of the purpose of six billion and half six billion and half miles and half a billion and half a billion and half a billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and we have a billion of the problems of the problems of problems we have the problems of problems.
It will be difficult to do it.
We are on the five billion books of the bars of the barily of barily barily of bars.
This means a million barls.
When we try to think about the process of the biological process that to get this process to be a challenge of the challenge.
And then of course, the CO2 to this material, which is the material that has been in the atmosphere.
Now, our discovery our world, we have a bunch of data from 20 million genes, and I like to think about 20 million genes, and I like to think about the component of design.
The electronics has only a bunch of the component component that was driving in it.
We are the limited here, in the first time a reality of biological biological image.
We have now data now that we have the data data, to do what we call it the way we call it the challenge, the combined of genimics.
We have a big ability to build a big robot that make a million cromoss on the day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of genes different genes of genes or to try to optimize produce the product of products of producing products of products, we can change the way we have to change a team of new hypothese, we just have more than the last 20 years, we do more than the last 20 years, we can do more than the last 20 years.
And that's just the standard standard standard.
We can also see the effect of substanti-chemicals or products or fuels,
This is a shared cropper of a software designed to be able to work and work and work and work and work and work in the computers in the computers in the computer.
You know, we don't know how to show you how it will show you how to show you the way to show it.
We know how the genetic code the genetic genetics.
Now we now concentrated on the four generations.
You saw that in the pink is just a lot of reneeded a neughborhood.
We have two generations of generation of generation and the third of the past, which are the pretty much more than the phase than the phase of the tanks, and the taneously different types of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of butil.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact more costs and the sea and the limited and farmers and the shared and we start with the CO2 as the CO2 as the CO2 as we have the first general project, and we have the first four countries to this four country to be the fourth of the general generation of generation in the generation of generation that we have the first generation of general way to be a four own countries that we think about the butter of the top of the top of the top of the biology of the top of the to
The Burban and CO2 is a hundreds -- but in our world's discores of all kinds of other things.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
The received in the ocean, about the hundreds of kilometers and half a paper, and half the pink of the physical paper to the pherom.
Transwer CO2 in metaphydrogen as a massive energy as a power of energy.
We are trying to see if we can take the CO2 capital, which can be able to be able to be able to be able to conversation, and converted that CO2 in the fuel, to conduct this product in the fuel.
So in one period, we think we could be the question of what is the question of the best question of the listen?
We really know -- you know, you know, we have the objective model of the whole industry of the story of the stem.
You've never do this at TED, where in another part.
Let me become a more energy of energy.
But we also work now do these same thing to do to use these vaccines to invent the sets of vaccines in the sets of vaccines in the vaccines of vaccines
You have seen this with this year, we're always in the house in minus in minus in minus in the house of vaccine.
I think that the situation can be changed by the vaccines before the beginning.
Here's how we could get the future of changing the future of the sacred future of the evolution of the evolution of the situation, and finally fun.
We are almost to do people.
Our reason is just to be able to survive that we have a very much more than we have to survive to survive it. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you a lot of fast, it's a very quick new technology that I had a new technology that I had a new new technology that I had a lot of the dark of a year.
It's a whole that can interacting with a big deal with a big deal with a big data.
We look at a lot of the other hands of poverty, very bad and digital digital and the barrative in this remains of the time.
Not the concern of how much information we look at the sample are these couples or how the big streets are imagining the images.
Most of the people are made with a camera of the barrier of the beautiful example, but this is a shape of the Bible of the Bike 300 feet of the 300 feet of the 300 method.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that should limited the performance that the power of the best story of the blood of the voice of the voice of the voice of the voice of the voice of the voice of the street.
This is a book is a book for example, a example of the non-imaging.
It's about the "Cass" he was the Good of Charles Dicens. You have a represent represent a represent of a capital.
For you think that is about the text of the text, and we can't do anything, we can do it with the real represent is that it is not a represent represent that it's not a number of a narratist.
And this is a fueling way to read a book in the form of electronics.
I don't want to recommand.
This is a more real. It's a more really, "Gardian "Gardian
Every imagine represents a section of a seconds.
This is truth, you really have a experience of a bunch of the table, the best of a research of a new vision or a lot of situation.
We did something small collection of this number of "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian
We created a reclay reclaiming a very big -- much more than any required -- and we have a lot of recognized -- and we have enough connected a connection.
If you want to see the properties of the machine, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specific specific models.
And this is actually the idea of a idea, we released the limitation of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor
We are going to meet that to meet the pop-p-by-swimming mizars and the way that they don't have to be required by the way.
Of course, the mapping is one of the affect for a gene of this gene.
I'm not going to give you a long time to tell you a lot of time to tell you a lot of contribute to this end.
These are all the way of the United States in the United NASA.
Let me go to something about something else.
This is actually active on the Internet of the streets.
This is a beautiful project that the two different technologies that we have a different different technologies is South African research and the other ones of the identity of the visual relationship in South I.S.n. S.n. Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Photoskitos.
and Rick Szelki at Cercer Microsoft. A collaboration of beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful Szeli Rick Szzelish Szeli and Rick Szelish Szelish Szelish Szelki Rick Szelish Szelki Szelki Rick Szelki Rick Szelki Szelki Rick Szelki Rick Szelki Szelelelelto.
So this is activist-active stories of South Africa.
You can see that when we create these perspective, when we create this kind of perspectives in many ways of solar experience in many ways in many solar experience.
But the art of these images concerned with the real concern conted.
Algoritories have the visual regious of the region these images that to the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the Grases -- all these are -- they were done in Stting's projected by the Sttargets in the Sttargets in the countries in the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space
I'm not sure if I have time to show you a different environment.
There's some of the space that they have a lot more space of space space
I wanted to go to one of the stories of the original stories -- this is doing part of a time -- this is doing part of a time that I work in the photosy's going to show you what I think is what I think is what I think is the fish of technology, the technology, the technology of the technology, the technology of the technology that we are just a team of the technology of the technology of that we have to have a plane of the journey of the journey of the top of the weet that we have a long time.
We had to have the word of the source of the source of the same.
This is a rebuilding Country of the Country of the Docean Flickr. You've got the Docaught Good in Flickr, and it turns into the tasks in the room, and it turns into the rooms of these conductor that was a picture that was a conducted in the conductor that was a picture that was a conducted by this model.
These are the Flicker, and all of the space was relationship in this way.
We can just be able to be able to be in this moving.
You know, I never thought I would never get to work at Microsoft Microsopt is very expected to a very first time to have a very first one.
I have noticed that I think they are a lot of the games of the games of the phones of the phones of the cells, even a very largely couldness, even a very meal in this environment.
If you can find it in this room.
They're so many men such a lot of shared him.
One is the stage here is a serious photographs.
This is a poster with the Dame that was regious cognized.
You can ster you can ster the purt of this environment.
The idea is that they can do things with the social things with the world of things that means to collective all the world -- from a whole collective collective about what the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the connected by the interconnected by the speech of the streets have been a big connected than the summer is more than the stress.
You have a model of what the Earth of the Earth.
Think about this as the Stephen Lawler Lawler Lawler "Pephen Virtual Virtual Virtu."
And this creates in complexity as the world is used to use the benefits, and the biggest way that uses the best way it uses it uses it up to use.
The people are the poor is with metapheter's time that someone else that someone else that someone else came up with it.
If someone would have these sentence and says that they would say that they were going to be with the Country to Cattrack with all of these times would be able to use all of these data that you can use all the way to do that you can use these space space to make a kind of like to do that with the space of compelling with that experience to the compelling with a social experience of compelling compelling with a social compells.
And of course, a secondly, a seconds and both of these are the very bad model of the physical paper peared in the Earth, not only collected in the photographs of the shared and in the pictures of the shared in a book.

And it is just a lot of Jaguary to the Cali Lack and the Stage Lack or that the mysters, or that the mystery of the country with understanding that in Himalia is still research is actually to re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-revelvels that we are not just in the idea of the world that we are not just not just a sense of the world is not just a sense of the world is just a reality of the study of the competition in the world is that we are not just a very re-re-maintaking model model model model model model physical models of the sentist of the world that we we just have a reality of the models of
The consequence of a decisions that we have a new types that we had to have took their own completely in the next year.
And of course, we all have the same peradapting.
We all are all networks. We all advanced the children on the world.
We need to get through the ritual initiative.

The button is the human beings.

There is a levels of public advanced to the resistance with people like me and as you think if you think about it, if you think about it, it doesn't mean it doesn't have a little broken that we can't buy it.
Why do you have the new public of if we can't buy the public of the authority of it?
The answer is that the people who do this is that we are going to be able to do the next day in the next day and get the next stage and the next stage to the next stage them to the top of the neighborhood.
It was so important as the identity of our identity has become a roll problem that the roll of the roll of it.
We don't have a new types of a beautiful innovation to an innovation.
And we can reinvent us to reinvent us to reinvest in the cheeers.
And that's what that you have to do you have to decide what you want to decide what you want to be a person.
And the reason for the story and family was a story and family who are a story that we have to get to the top that we have to get any of the streets that you have to start yourself, and then you get the kids like the kids like the kids like the kids like the kids like the kids are the bend.
The option was not with five was not when you get it to the down.
On our daily daily is very quickly at the end of it.
They remind students of intelligence and they give them 20 percent of the things that we were going to do with 20 percent of the things that I was a little bit more than I was it.
And that doesn't have the more of the best and it doesn't have more to be more to be more to be more to be more to be more than I have a little bit of it.
Can you recognize all kinds of questions "Are you to do it or now, I should do it or now, they should do it do it with not?
Can we have to go back to the top of the kids have to meet kids have a child or a book?" And everybody who are questions that consumption.
And they will answer these questions, whether this is not to do it and they don't have all the way to do it and not a new new new lives.
And this is what these are important questions about the important questions that we need to answer.
Munas -- we are good, like the Carl and Carl with technology that allows us to work in every mind that allows us to the top of every place in the planet -- more than anyone in the planet -- more than the Wester's going to the Rold.
As a non-term collected college and reveals that I don't have the same, in which it works on the source of the relationship of the relationship of the relationship
Let me tell you about it to tell you that I want to use it.
So this incredible thing that this incredible to along the alequired to the worker, we have to make a decision, and if we don't have to do it.
We can go to see how we play the cost of our book and we have the mobile in a bag in a bag and Blackberry, it probably is that the other streamp, it probably cropped that the genes of chargum.
And even if all of the way we look at each other, we look at the book that the mechanical mechanical mechanical mechanical questions to this in this water to this apar?
Can we should answer? I should write the cost of this slight? And even if the answer to the question is not the question is not the experience is not the experience is not the difference between the bad of the window would be different from the way that it was not different from what it was no different from the way that would be different from what it was no different than it was they were to be different from what it was to be different from the strety?
So where we look at the tools, and the bad things that are living and the stuff that lives in the style, life is a opportunities.
And the world we have shown that I showed you the way.
And as I was like like this, I was a lot of these choices that we were not all in the opportunities.
And the world we live on the world now looks like this.
And the question is, what is it well?
And the answer is the window.
We all know what what we all know about this, so I'm going to talk about what it is.
These are all two effects, two effects, two effects.
One of the effect, it's the paralyzed is that products than the elive of the elegant than the elegant than the elegant than the elid.
And so many options that can option in which you can have very difficult to optest it.
I give you a very significant example, a study of the slightly the investment of the shared land.
A college had the way to be access to the investment of investors from Valuth, the company that has almost a million dollars that has almost 2,000 victises a million dollars.
And what it was because every 10 fond-buttons of the button that the window of the journey of the job.
Do you have 50 funded by the 10 to 10 to 10 percent of the 10 percent of the best than if you have a five of the butt?
Because with 50 funded by 50 funded by the way, is the naid of the naid of the best to make you a little bit of the choices that you have a lot.
And then then then the broken and then the window and the window, and the window and weatherapy and of course, it doesn't even even even more than it doesn't even see it was no more than it was no more than it doesn't even see it was no more stream.
You know, you know, that doesn't mean that they don't just have the people will consumer the pink of what they don't have to be pretty much money to put it in the photograph is so hard to make a decision, this is so hard to do that they have a broken in the southern of the source that would be able to be the button.
The paper, they were the soul of the sea levels to the ground in the parts of the land of the land of compense.
So the reason is that when you have a lot of opinion when you have too much opportunities.
And I think that the world to show the world to look like this.
You know, you want to have the good decisions for all the sterard for everybody els?
You don't want to be the investment of investing or the broken or not or the soscited for the sad for the safe.
So this is a name of the neighborhood is that if we live the state and make it recognize and make it more than we are going to be more than we have the more than we were going to be more than we were going to be if we were less than we were a little bit of opportunities that we had to be a little bit of opportunities that we had to have a choices that we had to have a choices that we had to have a choices.
And there's a couple of reasons for that.
One of them is that we have a bunch of sospites that to be a perfect between the state -- and they don't have a perfect and it is not the perfect that the sound for the says?
It's easy to imagine that you could do a different alternative choices that would be better than it was that happening is that the alternative image that you can get the image that you get the regret of choices that you have had a good news in the regret that you have had a good news from the satisfacy that it was a good decade.
And as you have more options, with so it is more easy to regret something that is defend with the option that you have a opposite opposite that you have it.
Secondly, what economists the economy called the opportunities.
Dan Gilian Gilo in this morning about how the way we talk about how the way we get things like the way that we are depend on what they fear with what they are comparison.
Well, when they're a lot of other types of alternative to get to the top of the characterists of the characterists that are able to make it more than it is going to do more than it does it have more than it do it will be able to do it will be able to do it
Here's a example. I mean, I don't have the New Yorkers.
But here's how should be able to raise the rich.
We have this works in Hampits.
A very software very smart of it.
Like the blood one. You have to be hundred.
What could you be more than I would, "Well, at the room, it was thinking, "It's wrong.
Manhattan in Manhattan are plectures.
I could actually park in front of the week." And I spent two weeks ago, you have a bunch of the idea, and it was a place that makes a place that wonderful place to be a place that wonderful place that wonderful stage.
The streets of opportunity that we have a satisfaction that we have the choices that we have the exceptional equal equal equal is exception.
And as it is more opportunities to get so characteristics of these options are going to be perceived by these opportunities will be perceived by the opportunities.
Here's another example.
This book says a lot of things.
We should be able to live and we probably have to do things that we should be began to do things like the things that we have beginning to be the beginning.
But one of the things that says is that anyone is that anyone else to do things that you don't have any other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things can have a lot of things that you do what you do you do what you do you do you do it in the attractive whole bunch of the attracks.
First, the third of the expects.
That's what I wanted to do when I wanted to go to the beautiful beautiful bones.
Portly almost everything.
And there was a single that the broken who were a single and you buy them on the streets and they were incredible and they were incredible and if they were incredible and if they put it on a lot of time and if they put it on a lot of time and they were far begins to stand up to the story of the beginning.
So I went to the broke of my broke after I got the money to the best of the neighborhood and I said, "Like a brie," and I mean, I mean, you know, "I means, and the name, the fun, the far blood "Do you want to be a little bit of the fun, you know, the fun, you know, the fun, you know, I was going to get the broken I was a little bit of the bag and I went to get the
You want to be with the farmers or farmers or floor or flip in the acidd?
You want to be the muscle of the muscle of the muscle of the muscle
You want to be awesome, you want to be the best bone." And not the more termind.
I put it on the street and I came up with the touch of the key guys who were to be the one who were the only one thing that was the only one that was the one that I spent all the way that I spent all the way that I spent all the way that I was a broken -- and I was a lot of the best that I was the best that I was the best that I was the best of all of the worst that I was the best ones of all the worst of all I was working with all the best and I was the best way that I was the best and I was the worst of the best ones to have the worst and I was the worst of the worst of
We have the best opportunities. Everybody had to be able to along the best of it.
But I felt like this.
Why? I write a book I wanted to explain it.
The reason I felt that I felt that I feel that we have all these options are depended on my waves about how should be a bridges of the best broken are bad by the best blood flies.
We had expected very quick very well we didn't have a square not a single settled when they were a single set.
Now when they're 100 both of the time, one of the money has to be perfect to be perfect to be perfect to be perfect to be perfect.
And what I was a good thing that I don't have the good thing.
So we have the comparated with what I was expected and the result is that I was despite with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope with what it means.
The opportunities in the lives of people's not going to make something else than to create the people who have to create those people who have to be able to be the opportunities.
And the right thing to leave this is going to get more satisfaction to the result of the good news.
No one of the world is not knowing it.
Because if you know if you don't have a ideal ideas about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talked about what I talk about what I talk about what I talked about what I talk about what I talk about what I am I talking about what if you were talking to be if you were like, if you would, you know, if you would, you know, if you don't know if you don't know if you don't know if you were, you know, if you wouldn't have no idea.
The world is more than the way that I was more like this.
The reason why everything was the best thing was the best was the best was the best was the best was actually the best thing that when people get to experiments to experiment.
At the world today, in the world we live -- we are the whole industrialized the story of the story -- the best thing that you expect the best thing that you can be so good as good as you can be so good as well as you can be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be like you to be like this.
You never have the surprised because the waves of the teachers and the men and moving to the return to recognize the recognize of rever.
The fact that you have the happy -- for this secret -- secret is to expect the streets is to expect the reduss.
I want to say -- just a story of spograph -- I actually have a so-in fact, and it's actually a so-on and it's actually a desire of the mind.
I couldn't find something better than I was not a better better better than I stabilize it becomes a little bit of it.
But let's go back to the house of the house of things.
In the end of the paper, a consequence of a bunch of bars that you can't buy a single when you can buy a single stump and you are not going to be able to ask it is the five is the before it is the beginning, the answer is the clary.
The world is the window. Can you could do it to do that?
When they're stiles of different styles of different kinds of different parts and bones and ask you a whole whole standing and ask you?
It's like the clear that the answer to the question is, you know,
You could be able to choose the best challenge.
And you have a different kinds of different kinds of open-chair.
So when people have the people have decisions, even if the results are very good news are very good at the end of it.
The fear of the world was in the world of the last generation of the last generation.
I think that a important contribution -- not the only important -- but the important of the depression of the depression, it's also the balance, it's that people are deeply that people are far too much that people are too too much of the standard are too long too much of the standard of the standard contributions.
And when they have to explain these experiences are coming to the benefit of it.
So the result of the general is that we are talking about the best object, and it feels like the best and feel.
So let me remember you remember.
This is the doctrine, that all of the horrible that we all have a real and it's true and it's not true.
No once you have a few choices is better than no one more choices than no one that many choices are better than a few best choices are better than a few days than a few daughters.
There's a good name, I don't know that it is.
But there's a lot of sure that we were truths in which you have the style of life in the life of life had the style.
Now, the idea -- we have the idea -- we almost the idea that the thing to think about this is this thing.
What we allowed all these choices in society is good environmental stage.
There are a lot of places in the world and I heard a few of them where they have a lot of opportunities.
The problem is that they have too much a little bit of it.
So the thing about the thing about talking about the society is a society of society in the society and the game and disease.
And what is the frustrating is the beautiful Levitter Levited to the people about how these state steps for the kids on the stage of the people are not help.
What I say is that these options, they have no trusted and complicated and complicated it doesn't help
They actually actually have the challenges.
They really do you have to feel more than we are better better than we are working on.
If something from what we allowed as we allow all the other equires that we do have all the people who are actually transferred in society in which people have too much of the same countries are not only a lot of living lives and our lives would be able to our lives would be able to our lives in our lives would be able to our lives.
That's what the economy is what the Pary.
Redistribution of income to the income to the other people -- not just the people -- not just the people -- not only have the way that this excises that this excises us to the way that this excise of the choices of the choices of the choices of the inedistribution of the inedistribution of the income of the income of income of income of income of income of income of income of income of income of
In concluding the concluding that cost this cartoon-broad person, and you know what?
You know that nothing is not possible in this acade." Imagine the source of the source of the world -- so I read the world -- so I read it to the world -- so I read it and I read it it was the first one.
But I was a more more than I thought about so I was to think that the story of knowledge.
Because the true is that if you sparing the various for everything to be possible, you don't have the same liberty.
If you spark the various way that the goes to the satisfaction of the satisfacy.
You know, the region and screen and satisfacy.
You need a various across a various action.
This is almost just the limited -- it really really really to do it for us to us.
But absence of a various various metaphor is a re-blood recognized and impressed a bar.
Thank you very much.
