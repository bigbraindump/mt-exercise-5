Thank you very much.
The last year I did a walk at LHC.
And I got to get to come up and go a data and give you a data that works.
So the home, for the size of the world was here, LHC is the largest experiment is the most experiment that was intisent -- Cirumbling -- Cirumbling the 27 kilometers of 27 kilometers of a sea of a second fear to a second to a second to a second to 600 billion times on the several of 600 billion times on the seeds of 10-billion times -- a billion times of a billion times of a billion times of billion times --
It's extremely ambitious.
This is the apart of the Geney.
We do photographs of these mines "Big Bangs" in the decade of the decade of the top of the top.
I work on this one. It's the detector ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATAT's diameter here of the detector's building the ATATATATATATATATALS proportiate work that you can get to proportive.
On the year of the ptempt for the first time for the first time.
And this image was made by ATLASSSSSSS.
It became a huge of a huge camera in the room.
It's a first picture of the first fashion the particular particular that the WHC, the WHC, the LHC, the car LHC, the car in LHC, the deliberath of LHCCAAC, the key in the particular particularly detector.
In other words, when I was seven, when I was 10 seper 10-seper seper as a huge that is a huge successful for a huge success.
I don't know that the larger has the larger ovative, or that, when somebody else went on the Google and he walked that first walked that first page.
It means that we did a cultural impact on the language of standing of stepp.
After the climate of a paper I had a problem with the issue that actually had a problem -- these physics -- these physics -- these physics -- these physics -- these physics of the hands.
These are the 13 thousands of both myself when it works on the power to power in power to power power in power of power power to the power power of power in the power of power to be the maximizing the physical translation of the physical translate the per translate the translation of the 13 thousands of me.
Now, the engineers in the weapons of these physics and says, "I can't translate it.
But I can do that for that when they're going to be in the temperature's temperature's superconductation.
So as a 271 degree, as a team of the stories of stories can translate the way that they can translate that they can translate that they can translate the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the hundred of a four-271 per den at the 271 degree to 271 graduate of a deep paper to 271 degrees of the food.
At one of the 9,000 of the 9,000 stories in LHC, it was a farms.
So that the common was income, and the 13 thousands of both myself to electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressing that those magnetworks on the stone, and they fly over 20 tones, and they funny them to 30, and they funny.
So we determine the building of 50 stories of 50 stories.
We had to get it to the farmy, what we did and do and do was doing.
I reconfident on the top of all of the top.
And now we go back to the subteran.
The painting the big weast of the LHC will be as a new kind of like new one of the top of the top of the top of it.
We will go back to the new way, and we get to get us to get into the if, and we will continue to keep the research to the research to the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the unique of notes in the enage, and we go back to the way to go from now, and we go back to the top of the new data.
Now, good, of course, those accident, those accidents recognize about the important engineering and engineering to extremely rejured at extremely rejuven.
I think that the fact that is that it's so hard to be so difficult that we have to be inalone, that's important, that's important, that's important, that's important.
I'm not going to be the enemies of a word of a Brita's words of Britay, I think that I think that I was when I was a characters that the protect of protect that Michael Farcus: "Nothing that he said, "Nothing more dangerous for our mind, he was not farmyth, that we don't have the sample of minds."
Thank you.
I would come up with the range to the route to the kidney of kidney with bottom.
On the massive to invented them to get them to the environment, and you really get them to the teacher and you actually get invented how to rely and religion and religious and manipulate problems of space, and the relatives.
The deliver, the teacher is the providing of how we understand a big part of the world inconjournals.
So that we can realize the IT inspiring of this stuff that we can interact with our philanthropy of physics -- impress with my physical consults, and my collaborator -- I get a Kanthanks -- I get a computer -- I began to use a computer, when we can use a couple of mouth with a computer, and we can be able to be a dead, and we can be able to be a fishing dates of the mouse of the mouth,
So what do we want to do we want to do we want to do we want to do that?
And the question was so fascinating that I decided to ask the research of the building Siftable.
On the wind, a Sift-in-interactive computers in a bisco bisco.
They can be manufacture, they can perceive the recireceive the rest of one other, and a ran and a ran and a ran and a ran and a relationship and a relationships.
The biggest is that they're palpable, so you can missing them as you can fly approaching it just approaching it.
And Siftables of an evidence of a new equires of manify information in the digital information.
On the massive that these instruments becomes the past, more constantly constantly one of the other, and constantly constantly of our challenges of our incidents in their own stiles and distractive and distractive and distractive and diseases.
I'm going to start with a few examples.
This Sift-Sift is configuring video of video of video, and if you include in a direction, if you get the philosophy in the asp, if the rich.
These are interactive interactive are constantly constantly one of the other.
So if you put them on one language, it becomes interested in interest.
If they're inconnected to that, and they can become involved in confusion.
And I can also feel the mission and incline.
We realized that one of the interesting of interesting involved in the interactive involved that we can use the gestures, how we could use a running that would be a llicense like a lyme.
In case, we have three Siftables configuring that galets you can use them to be able to use them to be able to play in the center in the center in the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of that will be amesteck to the do.
If I was too much like a lot of time, we can turn it into the inside of the inside of it.
There's also the interesting of interesting for education, like education, like the mathematical language and logical ligent and logical peoples that we want to have the result of things that we want to see things that we want to see the results of the results of the result of the results of the immediately immediately to see the results of the interesting of interesting thing
So here is a bonacibonacibonacial program with a simple program with a program of econes.
Here we have a game of words of combination combination of combination and Bogging and Boggle.
After every one of the first one of the first one of the first one Siftable, and on the measure of what they try to do with a bunch of form that are verif, they are verif, they are verif.
Then I was 30 seconds of seconds of reset up a new type, and you have a new type of types and we can do it.
Thank you.
These are the kids who came up in expensive in the Media Lab and I was to start to take them to the movie, and I was trying to move to film and filmmaker material.
He loved it to love it.
And one of the interesting of this kind of applications is that we don't have to give them a lot of instructive.
All right, "For is "For word," and they know what to do.
Here are some people are inchatic in order to them.
This is the most tanishing our best ridge.
It seems like he wanted to make it was to put it was to put it on one of the other one one one of the other one on one of the other one on one of the other ones of one of the other one else of each other.
So for it was just for it was just the botom.
This is a peak applicator.
We wanted to build a language for the people who invented language.
And that's Fellow is Fellow it.
He can go to the charges of the bridge of the Siftables that affects the Siftables that affects the personal characters.
Here is the sound sound.
Video: Sometimes
David Merr: now he now got a traction,
Video: Tract's commitment.
Good well! Yeah.
Siftable, and Siftask them one language is the language -- the GDo can make personal person,
DM: I think it was a narrative.
Video: Okay!
DM: It's a fish story with final story, and he decided to deliver what it will be drawing it.
Video: Yeah.
DM: The next example I showed you today is a little bit today is a run and interpretated music and interpretated music and interpretation that we built the role of sound that Sift and all the roll and all the base that they were rhythms of the base and wood and all the base of the brother.
Each of these four four-various various various choices that you want to use it to use it.
And you can inject the sound of the sound that you can asasambs you can asasasamba guy what would you want to do.
You get the sound sounds the sound of sound like Sift--so-like success.
There's the effect that you can control the live in the living and filter.
He's atassy and then you get the sound for a certain it for him to avoid it it it it it it to him it.
It was the state effects like the field of the future that the floor the second Hetve Hetve Hetve Hetve Hetve Hetve Hey to see it.
Video: DM: Well we're going to start with a Siftables success, they argues it in a series, and it looks at a series, extensive to a series of a lot of time.
Now I put a line.
Video: DM: I add the bad of period.
Video: DM: And now I'm going to add the filter of the living in the lives.
Video: M: M: M: Maybe the second inclining inclining in a part of a part or in a part of a part of a part of a part.
Video: DM: I now will attack for a lot of base for a lot of farms.
Video: Tw: I can do the second time in the case in a couple of while the cost of the cost of while the city of it.
So I don't have to do the planet, I can improvise, I can improvise or melodia in the work.
Now, in the sentence, I can go to the second second to the second second Siftable's common in the volume, including in the state of volume, including in the wincle.
Thank you.
As my favorite passion is creating new interface, the internal and the way that it works that it works with the way that it works with our brain and our body and our body and our body is working on our brains and our body body wants to our brain and our body wants to see our brain.
And today, I had had time to show a new coordination of this new space, and a couple of design, and a few of the way that we had to go out of the lab.
The one that I was that I was that we are in the new granitation with this new generates of instrumentation with the instruments of instruments of instruments of our digital religion our world of relives.
Thank you very much.
Astep, with you to talk to you with you today.
I'm written about it.
He wrote the teacher is my teach, of course, more than that.
It's all my mom and fascinated and fascinating.
And I didn't go to this is that it was to change it.
But these physics that he was intampled in the vision and in the vil and in my own book, who had to really, he delivered me to my relate to work with worker works.
And the thing that I wrote this is that I wrote this car, this guy "Mancy CManco Royan "Manco Iubest, Roya-Iubest, which was the way to deal with the world for a sense of myself in the world is that the world is that the way that the world is important to be an esture's worked on the world for a sensational thing.
The region is that everywhere in the way that they go now, people are going to be condamnature.
Seriods -- condamnature!
As of example, and you say, "You don't have it is that you don't have -- you don't have -- you don't have that no matter that no longer can be more to depass that you could not be performan?
You don't have the team is going to go to write the vil of the vil of the vil of a book that you would have some of the world that you want to put the world on the world that you ever get this time,
It's very long line, in fact,
But it was more running if you were not moving to not myself as 20 years ago, when I was 20 years ago, when I was a big standing -- when I was a written when I was a written -- as I was going to become a kind of brother-based on a kind of bad of a kind of bad bone.
And people said, "You don't know that you have no longer that you have never had any more success?"
I don't have mean that humility will kill you going to kill you?
You don't have the bad is that you will be the best of life in this field and nothing that you don't have any open there, and I'm going to deads here and I'm going to death the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the machine is the sentence of the maps is the great thing to do you get a great thing to be the bad of the bad of the masentence of the top of the bridge.
Something that is that the gene.
The sea -- the rack on the wish of all these things is "Yeah, I said, "Yeah, I said, "Yeah, yeah,
Yeah, it's all of these things.
And always he was always standing of it.
And that's what it is the meal is like many other things that people can intuition.
As the big example, and other things that are infrastructure.
But when it's about written about the word that I was thinking about the last time I was in the last time, which I was "Why do you get it in the last time?
Is something rational ration?
It's a log that everybody to go to the work, and they were to be very much like that they feel that they feel that they feel that they were able to do it on this Part.
And what is so specifically specifically creative initiatively that seems us as we really seem to be in the way of maintenance of mental health?
Tato example, was inchemist and not engineer and not improved in 40 years of you have the 40-year-old inery inercent of chemicals that would be inchemisphere.
It was not intampled -- John, how do it go to the chemistry of chemice?
I just don't get it to the samples of something.
But to be synthetic engineering that we don't have too much like group of centurged by the centuries of centuries of centuries to be alcoolic to be alcooling the mani-depression.
We wrote the wish of insects, and not only the remarkable of all sorts of all sorts of all kinds of all kinds of all of the labeling that they have this reputation of power to be power to be able to be able to be able to be able to wrong.
And everything we have to do is look at the name of the basis of morning only in the century of the 20th century, in the mind of the mind of the brain of the brain and died by the young woman and open.
And even though they didn't have itted to be a provided to be really strange the products of your own own products of your own own own way.
Norman Mail, even though the last year, in the last last year, he said that "Each books, she knew me a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more more than a little bit more of the Norman Mail,
A big sample of extraordinary works.
But it doesn't mack when we hear somebody says that we heard about that I heard about that I was so many times that we have heard about a completely c., and they have been able to collective and suffering the window and suffering as well-conducted enough to be inside of the limb at the end, it will conduce the inside of a far.
And the question I want to add all of all of all of all of the type here is: Do you all with this ide?
You are comfortable to comfortable with it as it turns out of the light -- I don't mean with this ipoty.
I think it's odiodiodiodiac odias.
And I also think it's dangerous and not that I wish it to see it in the future in the future.
I think it's better if you get the big artist, we are artists to live it.
And I know that my sure that my case in my case, in my case -- it would be very dangerous for me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me the mouth of this special hypothern that I was now teaching the teacher that I was now teaching the teaching of teaching in the teacher.
As for example, I'm just pretty much in 40 years.
I have been likely to be four decades.
And it's very probably that I'm going to write that I wrote with this moment to be judgment as a process of the last couple of my favorite success?
What would be to say the window, because everybody else in a kind of like all of the best friends -- is very simple that the largest successful that the largest success.
Oh, Doh, what gand!
This is the gene of gold somebody could do somebody to get the brown to the name in the hormous morning, and I don't want to get that person who was that person who was person to get that person who was person to get that person to get that person to get that person could do it.
I think that I would do this works on this message that I love it.
And then the question becomes indeed, right?
And so I can see, my fish move to work that manian that manian age, to go to the right now, is through the way to keep my way to write a kind of like a kind of like a kind of like a kind of like a kind of protective protective protective protective protective protective --
As a way, to get a way, to get a way to the pastraway to be a distance, and my favorite absolutely absolutely now, and my team of absolutely now, and my favorite that will be now before what it would be now written to what it was written about what I was written to what it was written to what it is.
And as we were all looking at the last year, I went to this sense, I started to get the time to get the time and I tried to get other society to see other society that would have to be better ideas that would be better and more than the idea that would be better and more slightly more and more and more than they help us to get people creative.
And the process of this was in Greece and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma
So the big big master cost of the mouth is the inchance of the couple of weap.
But, in the Grecantly and Romantic Romantic and Romantic creativity of the comes from the beginning, right?
People thought that creativity was a spirit of people who can be delivered by a source of people in a sure and needed to the reason and needed to the reason and needs and needed to the reason and needs to be able to enjoy and needs to be able to be that we had been thinking.
The record called these spirit of creativity to creativity with the fact with the fact of the term of the term of the term of the term of the Count of me.
Socrats was the fact that it has been a demon that has a demon that transmitted in the department of department.
The handling of the same parents, but they call it the creatively aware of the genius of genius of genius of the game,
And what is wonderful, because the romans didn't think that a genius was a genius was a genius was a cheath of a cheath of death
They deliver that was a kind of a kind of environment, which is a kind of enough of the window of artist, in a kind of like Dobby, he speaks like Dobband insession of the work, who had the worker and the shape of works, the shape of works.
Absolutely the street -- that's the distance, which I was -- that we were building -- that we were building the result of the works.
And everybody else that was the way that it was the right thing?
So the year was protected by some things, like this, like this, like a lot of thing, like a lot of narcism, right?
If you were the stralky, you couldn't have been so that you could go to themselves for them, everybody knows that he helped this genius that he helped it to help.
If you were criticized, it was not completely the window it?
Everybody knows that the genius was pretty much of the game.
So they looked at the West creativity for a long long time.
Then came out of Renast, and everything has changed with a certain a certain the idea of ideas that the maintain the universe that individual in the universe of all the day's disease of all the mysters, the bridge of the mystic that they get to the dives.
It was the human beginning of the rational humanism to create that creativity that creativity of the individual inside the Indian interior of the individual interior of the individual inceive the individual was the beginning of the broken begins to the bridge of the human beginning.
And for the first time in the history of people have began to get to one or others as a genius as a genius of the genius of the genius of a genius of the genius of a genius of the genius of the genius of the genius of the first story of the first state of the first story.
And I must be a great massive was a huge error of a huge error.
Permite, a simple person to create that it is actually create that it is actually receptable and the surgery, and the surgery, and the source of mythernal mysternal and the mythernal home, the sacrequire slightly the slightly the branch.
It's like you a few of you a few hypothese.
It's just incovered and deform and deforming and genes all these astonishing inimages all of these tools in the psycheeseats.
I think that the presence of artists us one of the 500 years.
And if I think is really what I think is, and I think that is what we do now?
Can we do things like that?
It can go to the sense of senses of the sense of the relatively and the mystery of the creativity.
It can not.
It can not just to stering that we can sterm 500 years of thinking of human rational thousands of time.
And probably that it would be in public public public public seems to ask the street stines on the teacher state of the teacher that people are presented the people who are presented to their own days.
It would be not going to coopt all the way to coop.
But the question I want to put it is -- why don't you get it?
Why don't we think about how do we think about that?
Because it has a lot of way we heard anything else that we heard in what we heard about completely inner of the creative process of creatively provided the process of creatives.
It process that everybody has ever been doing something -- that everybody -- that everybody -- all the people here -- you know, everybody -- you know, it always didn't always begin to always the rational behavioral to be rational.
And in fact, sometimes you can put the right anormal.
I had a lot of intense where I known to know. I known extraordinary to Ruth Stone, which has been in Ruth Stone, which has been now to be in the 10-year-old story, and when he was a story of the story of the West story, and he was just a roppped the story, and it feel the bridge of the roppper and it was just at it on the ropps on the rocke.
The story was that a village of the tunny of the window.
And it turns out the rops.
And it was invention, because you get the paste of the past.
In that moment that has a single thing that is that I read it, and that he read the apater as it apata."
And the alerging that the urposes of the large of poem, and the page, and the psychology was to get a piece of enough to a piece of enough to get the way to get to the bridge and drift to get the hand to get a hundred and put it on the map.
Sometimes was not enough faster as the alerga and alerga and alerga and the key and the house in the house and the brog and the brother, and the brother, and the brother, and the brother, "All rist, a "As a "other poet."
They were and moment's moments in that -- and the one one -- and I will never forget to the best story that the story that the story of the los.
Alerga house the map of the map and the past, and the water and the exactly when they get the exactly when it was indeed to the story of the brother and the story of the otherwise and the story of the degree.
The first of the coast coast and sleep in the masslamor in the masslamp.
As the situation, the poems of the map of the map of the map of the first time at the last year at the first of the first couple of the first young at the first year at the first year at the first of all.
When I heard -- it's supractically was exactly how it works works.
My creatic creatively not limited to this -- I'm not drift.
I'm a way, and the way I worked on the way I get to the same way to go to the same way to get the same way to sleep and to sleep and to sleep and to slightly bully.
But even though I was independent in my favorite was so indeed, I was so far.
And I was like to have been as a lot of you,
I had the pain, or ideas that they came from a sure that they didn't know that they didn't know that what it was going to be a lot of insight.
And what do you have to do that?
And how do we have to report us to report us to be so much of that we don't lose our mind, you know, improve our mind, immediately, to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to reach us that repress us to report us all have to report us to report us report us report us report us repor
For me, the most relevant days, we have been about how we can do is that we have been doing is the musicians that we took a Waitt, cartoon a couple of years ago in the revil of reviviviviolate in the revil of revibrature.
I was talking about this super-sum was almost everything that was almost everybody else artist, what they include, what they include, what they can we run to control and running and to figure out how to figure out how to be able to be able to read these slightly interiorized.
The time the long time, and it was the line story, and improve that it was a day in a day in Los Angeles Angeles and then everything that everything has changed it.
While it comes from a fragment of a fragment in a piece of a piece of a piece of the event and the average of how it happens to the sea and a desire and somebody else.
It doesn't have the floor not have the map, it doesn't have the reportop.
It turns out that the veck that the veck of the debate in the interior "To lost that I would leave the monky moment, and can.
I'm not enough to religion, I would remember it.
And in order to get into the painting, it was just over.
He was the process of mental process and did something we all do something we all do it.
He was a little bit of the wish and said, "Scock," I don't see that they're not going to be like volunted?"
"Do you seem like a canoy a canoy for a canoy canoy now.
If you really want to be really into, into, intoo moment in one moment in a moment, when I can go to your eyes.
If you don't know, and you release it today.
You can go to the Leonard Leonard Cohen."
The first process of creatively changed this.
It didn't operate that it was the way to be deseeds like intunnely.
But the end, and the engineering and agnamed in the moment in the moment in the moment in the moment that he took the genius that he was just to get it in his room and he had to go back to the room and he realized it that he was going to be something that they didn't have to be so interior of Chinese and Chinese and Chinese and Chinese inession.
It could be this collaboration and the bizarre and bizarre conversation of a conversation of the exterious enough.
And after I heard the story of the story of the way I was working and already that I was working on a little bit of a little bit of data.
This approaches that I was at the middle of the middle of "Manca, Rool, Roy-School and I have a kind of kind of a kind of kind of a kind of kind of a kind of like that I was going to think about something that I was going to think about something that I was going to be the best deliving to be the best death that would be the best den of a best debt.
It's not just the provide that the best written up.
I was going to think that I should have just like to abandoned it.
And then I remember the Earth, I was talking to the space, and I was released and I was indeed.
I was a home on the manuscripped and I adress a collected collected collective cameras.
I said to the wind: "Asculpture, and you know that if we know that if we know that if we don't just get this book is not just the extraordinary, right?
Because you can see you like to see that I have a house to hold it to hold it to him.
So if you want to be better than you would have to do it to do it to make it the paradigm and you get your down.
OK. And if you don't have that, you know, you know, at the top of all of it.
You will write for that is my message.
And I want to consequence today I did my favorite part of my head of the tree.
Because -- the conclusion, the weapons of years ago in the European African hundred years to be able to sarple with the long way to suspect that they had long as long as long as the long sack to the rack hours in the room.
And they were always to deal with the dancy and they were remarkable to danced and they were remarkable to remarkable it.
But sometimes, something that is something that they really intam, and one of the interpret of community of community.
I'm convinced you all know what I was refer to all of you all see, because all of you are going to be a certain a certain a certain the moment, like this, like a certain the interpretation.
It's like the time is the time and dancy and dancy is in a kind of opportunity to do nothing differently, in the other 1,000 series in the other 1,000 series in the other 1,000 series the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of time,
Once a time that it was intremendous in the mouth.
It's the light and light in the games is the games of the divarious photography.
On the time, when they were intamples what was the people who was and they were saying the name.
And I get the machines and inceptions and they were "Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, Doamn, Doamn, Doamn, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doamn.
It's Good goes to it.
A lot of interesting historic -- when the history, they invented the Spanish Spanish this object has been running out of the century has been the century of "Allah, Allah, Allah," "Allah, Allah," in "Oly" in "Olyeah," in the "Oly" -- the lamb alone.
and they hear the time with the flower and dancy and dances.
In Spain, when a interpret and a myself and the magic and magic myself the "Allah, Allah, Allah, the Gree."
It is a bad -- a farming of God --
It's wonderful, because we need to have to ask something.
But the one of the second day that the morning when the dancer of insusping is and discovered that is the large, the hundred of Divan morning, and not a lipiece of Diva's heart.
It's a disease that the late that the gallons and they could never get to be able to be more inalways that would never be inalways to also also inalways that never beyond to be inalways to be intimate.
It could not be no one that would not be the call the Domna while he was when he was going to make it that he had to do with the rest of his life with the rest of his life with the rest of his life with the rest of his life with the rest of the life of his lifesty?
It's hard.
It's one of the most flight of the broken creative.
But it may not be a big chance of the big challenge, if you don't think about the most extraordinary that the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary parts of the inside.
It can have been creating that you just have been imprised by the way, it for a sure of source for a few source moments for a few splening to be more delivered to be more department of the moments of the moments, when the moments were inspired to the moments have been prised to the moments have inspired if you had inside the times of you've been invented to get the bridge.
If we think about how we begin to change the way to change it.
I was so often began to think of the months of the months of the months of the long thing that will be published to the top of the course of the audience and infrared of my successful and infrastructure.
And what we do, I repeat when you improve the course is not going to be there.
You don't have the spiring. You can go to the content to the Content to be your partea, anyway.
If you are dancy, then dances, then driver.
If the genius of the divent and excess is repair to get the decade to get the extraordinary, even for a clipper as you extraordinary, even for a clipping through your equipped through your equipping the shadow."
And if no, no, nothing to everything.
And with all of these "Ole!
I think that we should have have to predict them to prepare to prepare
"Ole! I just had to you, just for you, just as you have a current for the course and incent to the participation of participation to participate in the environment.
Thank you.
Thank you.
JCohen: Ole!
We have been talking about some of these projects, and what could could he repress, and what could I represent us to represent new genes.
Now I start from a new point of thinking, we digitize biology, and now we're now trying to start to start this code from this code and go to this cost in a new flies of biology, modeling and feeling the shapes of life and feeling the form of life --
We tried all the time, we tried to ask us to ask our questions.
"What's the life of living something that many biologists have tried to understand the diverse to understand the diverse levels.
We tried different approach, simple approaching life in the component components.
We already have been already for 20 years.
When I got the genome, this was the humans the world of the world of biology in the world of the digital world in the digital world of computer.
So now we try to ask question: Can we recognize our life form of life in this universe of this universe of this universe of this universe of this universe of it?
This is the map of a mice, Mycoplasma genitalist, which has the most most of us that can reply a species that can reply the lab.
We tried to see if we can come up with a genome.
We had been able to get the rest of a hundred of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of metabolic metabolic is pretty simple in our comparison.
You read it, that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can suggest at a moment to a moment that is a little bit of a cell.
So we decided that the only way before we actually had this cromoss that we actually can actually be able to see this cromosis so that we can see the most fundamental component to the most most of the most most most of the most most fundamental questions.
And so we started on the road, "Can we began a cromoss?"
Maybe the chemistry of these molecules that we didn't have ever done it a lot of that we did ever ever ever ever ever we did ever ever ever be?
And if you look at a cromoss?
A cromosis, it's just a piece of chemical.
So our speed to our life, the living life has grown to a rhythm at a rhythm of a rhythms of the exponential.
Our wish genetic code that is moving enough to begin the beginning, but it growth it growth up.
The last time he got a current ended up at a cloud of it.
I started this better than 15 years.
I went through a few tappeared, in fact, with a bio-examination funny experiment.
But it turns out that the South is very difficult.
They're thousands of thousands of machines that make small machines of DN, months of DN, but it's a process of providing a process of degeneration, so that's a longer piece of longer degree to more than a longer longer long, with a lot of thousands of machines of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands
So we had to create a new metho-new myself to put these little bit.
This was our first tenth of tentation, beginning from the information of the digital information of Phi Phi Phi 174.
It's a little virus that killed the bacteria.
We did the bridge of the bone, I went through the city of the herorors, and we get a molecule of DNA 5,000 literally guns of DNA 5,000 literally literally far.
The interesting thing that I did was I took this piece of chemical material and I put it in the bacteria and I put it in the bacteria that code the genetic bacteria has been able to produce this chair, and to produce the viruses of the viruses of the viruse.
The viral diseases were then eliberator cellular cells and they went back and they were going to Ecol.
I was talking with the fish industry and zymous and zympics that they were really clear this model.
They run more than you do.
And so we think that's a situation where the software that software in which maybe building biological system.
But we wanted to do something more than we did something more than we want.
We wanted to build the entire crows.
This is 580,000 literally code code code code code
So we said, we would get the window the window in the house of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the cells of a cell.
Of is the critically, if you start with the information of the digital information that information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly the fact that information has to be very exactly the fact that information is very exactly the enough,
When I set up this genome, this genome in 1995, standard was a hero-precise was a 10,000 per in 10,000 per window of window the basis of basic weapons of window cars.
I found the rest result, 30 heroes, 30 herorors. If we have used the original sequences, this would never have to be activated.
The design is design is design is projected by 50 literally 50 literally 50 literally choice that you have to build all the other 50 literally 50 literally challenges to build the challenges that are so much more of the best challenges that are compatives.
We projects of tool.
You can read that we put it in the house in the house in the house of this: we have a code of this: We have a gone from four literally cheath and T.
Tripper are the literally codiffee code about 20 amino acive 20 amino acive acive.
So we can use the code of genetic code to write the word of words, thinking about.
So the idea of thing I did was to hear the code of the code of it.
Some people were deadly disappeared.
We designed those things that we designed that we can digit with enzymes.
I'm enzymes that we repair and play it.
So we started doing it the bridge, began to 7,000 literally funny to 7,000 literally letting them do with 24,000 literally charge to make it bridge the sets of these layer role, and then he asked to 72,22,22,000.
As every time, we have these little bit.
We try to get that point that point that point.
So that's what a teren is that a ren in the name.
When we get a big market at 100,000 per window of window in East.
It takes all the broads of molecular molecular modern.
So we go to other mechanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the biology that biological biology that biology that biological DN, and that took the charges of DNA and that too.
This is a example.
There is a organism called Deincock Deinoth radidiation.
As you see in the past, cross-wick is delight.
Only the four, he put it in the long time, he put it in a new law in the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be drawing total.
I can live in the vision.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the extraction of extraction, to find it moved, to find a new environment.
In fact, NASA shot that this is come back there.
Here's a micrograph molecule that we built these products that we build these process process process -- actually using the mechanisms that we had the average of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the bone.
Drodies they put them together.
This is not a picture of a microscope, but only one of the microscope, but one photograph.
It's so big molecule, we can see with a microscope with a microscope with a microscope of microscope of microscope of microscope of molecule.
These are the collects of a hundred of six seconds.
This is a public public public published a little bit of time.
These are 580,000 literally code code code code code
It's the biggest molecule with a sample of people, with a definitely define structure.
It has a molecular molecular less.
If we have a funny 14, 142 parents, 142 pages to practices this code code this code code code this code code this code code code that code the code of genetic code with a genetic funny of a funny funny funny with a funny funny funny funny and you have a funneling fish with a funny funny funny.
So how do we go back to a cromoss? How do we active.
Well with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated with bacteria.
They also also also easy, it gets to get it to the bad and you just get to get the nuclear and you to get somebody else and that everybody else and that's something that everybody who everybody else -- clarea.
The bacteria archain, the cromosis is the integrated in the cell, but we showed that we can do a completely transplant that we can make a completely cell.
We put a crozen from one of the microbial microbial crobial microbial crobial crobial crobial crobis.
These are the second is about as far as far as the mouth of people and the mouse and the mouse and the couple of me.
We added a few genes in a few genes that we can sell this cromoss for this cromosse.
We digerated with enzymous proteins.
And it was pretty much when we put it in the cells -- you will appreciate our birds -- and our cromoss -- and our cromoss -- and cromoss of cell.
In fact, we thought that this is how it can go back to the project, but we tried to design something more far.
This is a mechanism of evolution.
We are such a species that have been incorporate a second crome, or a third of the third of the third species of the field of new cars, thousands of new cars in a second.
So the people who think about the evolution of evolution is just like one time to a moment to a moment that they lost lost a long moment in biology.
I'm enzymes called the restrictions that actually digers, which actually digering DN.
The cello that was in the cells that was not a lot of it.
The cells -- cromoss that we put it --
It was express and recognized the other cromosis that material that material was just so much the chromososome, and so we just got to have only cromososome.
It became the blue of the genes that we put them in cromoss in crome.
And after a very expensive time, all the characteristics have loss have lost a new species have lost all of a new species that we had a new species that we put it on the software that I put it in the cell.
All proteins were changing the membranes were changed -- when we call the genetic code that we transfer transferation.
This can sound like the chemical chemical, but we can make, we can change the DNA to change things that we change the game.
Now, I had been susped that this is not genetic that we built three billion years and half billion evolution, and half years and we have a new version of evolution to exploit that we can be a new version of Cambridge a new specifically specifically a new specifically a new specifically specifically seeing a new special digital --
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obviously of obviously of now.
We are the way we go to six and half billion people and half billion people over 40 years.
To be in this context for me to me the sample in 1946.
There's three people on the planet for every one of the new that there were 40 years old, they will be four years old.
We have problems of hundred measuring the floor fuel, medicine, drugs, fuel, half billion and half billion and half billions and half billions.
It will be difficult to do for new it.
We use over five billion of the bad books of three billion billion barrier of barrass of oil bars.
This is a hundred million bars.
When we try to think about the process of biological process that makes that, to replacing that this huge will be a challenge that makes it a challenge challenge to be a challenge challenge challenge to be a challenge to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to think about how we try to try to think about how we are trying to try to figure out how to get to the process of the process of process of the biological process of
And then of course, it's all that CO2 from this material, which is that the atmosphere.
Now, from our discovering discovering around the world around the world with 20 million genes, and I love to think, and I love to think about this as a component of component design.
The electronics has just a painting, or so that something, and that's what he was the diversity that he went out of this.
We are limited here, in the first time, a real real real biological reality and imagine our images.
We have now data now that data is the data-drift smart smart of smart combinath of genomics.
We have the ability to build a big robot that to make a million cromoss on day.
When you think about 20 million genes these 20 million genes of genes or trying to optimize the product of products to produce the product of products of producing the farmaceutics of new molecule molecular biology to make more biology than the last 20 years of science than the last 20 years of all of the way of science than the last 20 years of knowledge.
And that's just the standard.
We can sell viability for the substance of substances or fuels of fuel, production of vaccines,
This is a head of a software of a software design to be able to work and work that we can be able to work and work on these species in computers.
You know, we don't know how to show how it will show how it will show how it will show how it will show you how it will show how it will show you how to show you the point.
We know how they looked like their genetic code and their genetic code.
We now concentrate the four four per generation.
You see, you know, that from the eton is just a cloud of inner experiment in the inside.
We have the fuel, the second generation and the third of the course that are going to get the current of fuel, which are amazing fuels like the oil of butters of butants of different kinds of butanol.
But the only way we think that the biology can have a lot more of people without more costs and the limits of the limits of the limitation is if we start with CO2 as we start with CO2 as we start with the first of design to the project, and we think that we have the receive four house four generations.
Like the solar and CO2 is -- but in our discovering new discovering all the way we have all kinds of other kinds of other ways of ways.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It was the ocean, by the ocean, by the home of two kilometers and half kilometers and half of the physical temperatures, to the temperature.
Transform CO2 in metan use hydrogen molecular energy.
We try to see if we can take a CO2 capture, which can be able to be able to be able to convergering that CO2 back in the puple, and then to conduct this process of the product of the product of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process we were trying to see if we we can take a CO2 and see if we can take a CO2 ctop, we can be able to take a translated if we can be able to take it to be able to take it to take a CO2 and see if we can take a
So in a time that we think we can mean that we think we could mean the question of what is the question of the broad?
We really know -- we have objective model of the entire industry to the entire industry industry.
Yeah. If you don't do that at another part. Where is in other parted?
To be a sure of energy for most energy.
But we also work now is to use these same source to invent these vaccines to invented vaccines immediately to inspired by immediately.
You see, this is the year, we're always with a year in the hundred dollars in my minus when it comes to the right now.
I think the situation can be changed vaccines of combining to the combinators.
Here's how it could get the future to arming the future changes the evolution of evolution with bacteria with bacteria with bacteria and finally indeed, and finally, the end, and finally, the end, and finally, the ending.
We are almost to improve people.
Our cost is just to make sure that we have a chance that we have a pretty much enough to survive that we could do that. Thank you very much.
So what I want to show you very quickly, it's a very quickly, is a new thing, a new thing, a new technology that I had a new technology that I had a lot of that I had a year. This is a year. This is a year. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragg.
It's a big environment that can be local in the distancing of a big amount of data.
We look at a lot at many girls of gabout, and thousands and men and men and men and moving through this one, the rearrass of it, rearras.
It doesn't matter, how much information we are these big information of large information are these large images are these large images.
Most of the picture are done with a camera of the window, but this is a scanneline is a scannation from Bible from Bible South Congress, the result of 300 megapixel.
It doesn't have important because the only thing that should be limited to the performance a system that the baby of the monitor of your monitor of your monitor of your monitor that was like a very long time.
This is a book is a book for example, a per example.
It's about "Casa is that Charles Dickens. Each Dickens. Each one colored in a representation of a head of a head.
To show you that it's about the text, and we can't imagine it, we can do it so that we can do it with this representation is a representation of a text; it's a bad picture.
It can be an artificial way.
I didn't have the command.
This is a better house is a lot of "Gardian edian edian evidence of "You're going to you.
Each imagine the beginning of a section,
This is really what you really have a piece of a experience of the version of the version of a review of a review of a review of a lot of a lot of a lot of inherently completely done a lot of the environmental environment.
We did something small color of this number of this number of "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian
We created a reclaim to a very larger resolution -- much bigger -- and I was used to be -- and I was used a content content of supercharged a content content.
If you want to see this properties this machine, you can see here.
Or or even the specifically technology.
And this is really the idea of a sense of a limited limitations of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor
We perhaps that to meet the pop-sea and others, and others, and others are not necessarily -- which are not needed to be required.
Of course, the mapping is one of the applications for a technology for a technology for a technology of this gene.
I'm not going to fit a long time to tell you that we have a lot of time that we have a contributed in this physics.
These are all the way of the United States in the United States from NASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASA.
Let's go to something else.
This is actually active active on the Internet now.
This is a bad project of the Wornth, which is the second technology is Seadows, and the other is Seadron and the other mind of the research of the perception of Irruhyh Snavelabsolutely ah Steve Seitz Steve Seitor Washington at Seitor Steve Seiti Wash.
and Rick Szelki at Cercer Cercer Cercer built beautiful collaboration of beauty.
So that's what this is active on the Internet because Seadowing Seadragon.
You can see that when we create that when we create these kind of perspective, when we can have this guy in many of the resolution of experience in many solar solar solar experience in many soludgments.
But the argument of these images of these images conted.
Other religion have been region have been registracted these images together, so that you can corely where these pictures -- all these pictures -- all the Grass -- all the Grass -- all of the Canadience -- they were made these charms of a project, and these emerging stability of a stable stability of relationships of a space.
I'm not sure if I was a while I was going to show you other environment.
There's some more spaces that have a lot more space.
I would like to go to one of the original stories of New York -- this is part of the time -- this is a protop of Photynature's time -- to show you that I was working on the window of this technology that I was going to show you that this is the piece of this technology that I put it at the time that I put it at the moment that we put it at the paper that we have projected to go to the demand
We had to worry to be working on the shadows.
This is a rebuilding of Catch of the New Dock of Dock in Flickr. It was on Flickr. It was in Flickr. And you find something you can find something you poop with the type of trick that was a story of the conductor of this long-term imagine that it was found a picture of this model.
These are the picture of Flickr, and all they were all relationship in this way.
We can just be just to be able to sleep.
You know, I never thought I would have never come to work on Microsoft Microsoft is very measure a lot of measurely of a lot of me.
I don't see that there are a lot of that I'm a lot of cameras, all the games of the games of the phone cells of teachers, even a very large number of teaching in this environment.
If you can find out of this chair.
There's so many machine, and it's so much machine.
Once here is a series -- here's a photography.
This is a poster with Namong with North was registration that was registract.
You can get your bridge your physical environment in a physical environment.
The idea is that they can do things with the social environmental environment. This is to collective data from all the way that the collective collective Earth, what the Earth's visual connecteds. They were going to be more connected to interconnected something that is bigger than the gergent of the country.
You have a model of what the Earth.
Think about that the long coading the months of Stephen Lawler "Park Virtual Stephen Lawler "Park."
And this is that it creates as the world is used to use the benefit that the benefits larger weapons as usually useful as we use it.
The picture of the picture of meters are with meters that somebody else that somebody else has a charge it.
If somebody would have all these sfinds and she would say that they are willing with Catch with Catch with Dock with Dock with Doccom with all of the data with all of these data, and I could use it as a kind of space, to make it as a kind of like a kind of like a kind of like that kind of a kind of like that kind of a kind of like this, to make this kind of a kind of like like this, and you would have this kind of shadows.
And of course, a second, of course, and all of these are the mass of models and disease the ecture of the purposes of the Earth, collective and images not only of the sea leeper and imagine of the window and images from a memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: What I understood that it will allow your software that will allow your moment, is that one moment, in the moment, in the moment of years, is like all the picture of somebody els?
BA: Yeah. What does is really do is to descen.
It creates the hyper-left images.
And it turns out that the image of images.
And that becomes independent when you think about the village that have seen these images.

And they will answer to these questions, if this is not to do all of them and do it all the way they wouldn't have a good news.
And that's what they have to do is important questions that are important to answer.
Munlike -- we're good, as we are good, as the South Carl and Carl that allows us to work every single of days, every single of the planet -- a little bit of the planet -- more than the Randold-slightly from the KTandol.
There's a non-the-hundred collect, which I was born to deliver the relationships that works on the relationship.
I don't tell you about it because I want to use it to use it.
So that's so incredible that this incredible libertate to aleating with the mouth that we have to make a decision, is that we have to make a decision, and if we should not be able to work and if we should be working on.
We can go to see how our cost our photbal and we have the mobile and Blackberry in a poster and Blackberry in the other cy-laptop, probably the gene of the game of the genes of the game of genes that we can go to the gene of the game.
And even though they're close every mind where we look at the time we look at a mutility of the mechanics of photbal mechan?
Would it answer to this email? I should have written this writ?" And even if you answer the question is "No, it's not safe that experience is not a little bit.
So everywhere else we look at the bad and small objects and things that are the stuff that lives is a stuff, life is a stuff is a stuff.
And the world that we lived in a way.
So I had to say that we had some choices of doing it was a stuff was a stuff was a stuff of options.
And the world we live now showing you this way.
And the question is, is it well or well?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what we all know about this, so I'm going to talk about what it is.
All these choices two effects have two unger unger unger unger people.
One of the effect, it's that produce is that produce is that produce paralyzing than eliberation.
And so many options that can choose to choose people are very difficult to open it to open something.
I give you a very significant example, a study of the pensils of pensilence in the planes of the pensilence.
A collection had been collective databases from the data-investing dates from Vanguage that has been so company that has almost a million sample of square and almost 2,000 sequences.
And what it was that for every 10 funny mutual mutual platforce that they help with two percent of the participation of participation with two percent of the product.
You get 50 funny mutual -- I think about 10 percent more more and more and more and more and more and more you can only get five to you?
Because with 50 funny funny mutual with the blood of hard to make you a hard to choose you to choose that you have to choose that a choice and a hands.
And then on the post-home, and then on the wish and then the window, and the window and goes and of course, and of course, and that's what it was the spot that this spot is never coming to never commit to never commit to be no longer to be no longer and then on the weapp.
You know, you don't mean that they will not only consumer people will consume that for the parents that they didn't really get to put it in the pensive money to put a decade that stability to make a decision that means that the stable to make a bunch of compenses that would be so hard to be funny the shape of window the wish of the bad of the window.
Neparticipation, they walked with 5,000 dollars a year in the hundred dollars a year in the window of commitments of compensation.
So the measure is a consequence when you have too many options.
And I think that this is that it makes it like this.
You really want to take your decision if it's for everybody is for all the eternity, right?
You don't want to choose the floor of investing or not the soscar to save the soscar to save it.
So that's a second effect. This is that if we could do it is that if we could get to deliver the state of intense and make a lot of choice to make a little bit more choice to be more than we would have been if I was a little bit more opposite than we had a little bit of choice that choice to be more to choose to choose to choose to choose to be more of the choice.
And they're a few reasons for that.
One of them is that we had a lot of sospitals for save to the window if it was a perfect -- and it's not perfect for the window for say?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different alege, which would have been a better alternative that would be better to imagine is that choice you get your image that you get your regret to imagine that you would have been regret of choices that you get out of a satisfaction that you really did really make it even if this was a decision.
The more oppositive and so it's so easy to regret something that is deadly hard to remember of the option that you have to be with option that you have it.
The second one, what economists are called the opportunity.
Dan Gilient was very clear in this morning in this morning about how we speak about how we depend on what we comparish with what they comparise.
Well, when they're a lot of other people, it's a lot of alternative to imagine is easy to imagine is to imagine your characteristics that are doing it a little bit of characteristics that you rejuvenies that you have a little bit of choice that you have a little bit that you have a little bit of the choice that you have a lot of choices that have been a lot of other people who have a lot of otherwish is going to be a lot of choice to be
Here's a example of the strength of the people who are not New Yorkers that are not New Yorkers
But here's how should we rather than we should be rational.
We have here is this case in Hamptons.
A very expensive very expensive.
She was a bunch of the mind.
What could you want to be more more than I was thinking about the dracu" thinking, "It's august.
Everybody in Manhattan are pless.
I could actually come back to the front of the week." And the day that two weeks ago, you know, the idea that he was that running the rate of days, you know, to have a place that mind.
The opportunity of opportunity that we have a satisfaction that we have the aleggs that we have the choices.
And the more options of options of options that are so characteristics so characteristics will be perceived by these opportunity as we have perceive the opportunity as we have been perceive the opportunity.
Here's another example.
This book is a lot of things that are bad for things.
We should be says we have to live and probably we should be able to do things begin to do things begin to do things begin to do things begin to do things begin to do things begin to do things begin to live things that we should be living in the slightly lippped that we should live in the slamely, we should live in the slipps we should live in the slightly light to light things start.
But one of the stuff that says is that anything that anything else to do to do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things can have a lot of living and that will make it a little bit more and so many more attractive attacks.
Third of the third extinction.
And that was when I was going to go back to my handle my brothers.
Porse the blings of the time.
And there was a measured that the black were kind of a kind of like it and they buy them out of yourself as you can get out of the common and if they were incredibly long time and if they were very long time and hopes it was a long time and they were starting to stand up to stand up to the best bridge.
So I went to replaced my brothers after I was a good purt-purch, and I said, "Look and I said, "Look at the bees of my bridge wish weapons? And so, the bridge of my favorite fish wish?
Do you want to be with the arms of the prison? You want to prespending in the acid?
Do you want to be the mush?
You want to avoid you to the best bunch -- and not finish." And I don't really terrible -- and not termine.
He picked me the fact and after I was revened, I said, "I want to be the guy who were the one who were the only guy who were the only one that was the only idea that I was spent all the mouth of the balance of the bests of the bridge -- the bests that I was going to be right -- the best -- the best -- the best -- the best that I had the best way I had had been worse of all of the best and I was the best way I had been worked on and I was going to have to be right now.
We have been swimming these options have made it better.
But I felt more than I was feeling.
Why? I wrote a book I was trying to explain this way.
The reason I felt that I felt that I felt that we had all these options are expecutives my way, how to be a bridges of what should be a good news.
We had expected very well. I didn't have a very expected way, I had a way.
Now when they're 100 sorts of hundred times, one of them have to be perfect.
And what I got was good for it was good -- but not perfect.
So I comparated what I got I was expected and the result is that I was despite with what I was despering with what I hoped with what I hoped with what I hoped with what I hope.
The opposite opportunity of people, people don't do something else than to think about how people have to think about how people have to be able to be these options that people have to be those options.
And that's the right thing that will go to a little bit more satisfaction to the result of good well.
No one of the market don't know that.
Because if you were going to be thinking about what I was talking about.
The same was more like this.
The reason that everything was better when everything was the best was that when everything was the best was actually the best was actually the people to experiment.
As we live in the world that we live -- we live -- and we live and we add it that we expected, and we wait -- the best thing that you can be so good at that you can be so good at that you can be so good to be so good as you can be so good as well.
You never have been paying ensure that way, because of my favorite and my favorite and my release.
The really, for that you -- for this is -- for this secret -- the secret is happiness to have waiting to have waits.
I want to say -- just one scuring moment -- that I actually have a very so-right.
I could not have a better better than I was I stabilize it.
But you can do not sat at your house is so bad.
Then inside a consequence of a bouthern consequence you can not get good when you can buy a single that you can buy it as you can not thank you as you can't thank yourself and you ask the question of what it is the close and five is the clar.
The world is well. What do you could have been doing it?
When they're hundred different style of different kinds of balloons and bubble and I buy that you can deal with why, why do you ask yourself to the window it?
It's like the clear that the answer question: You're asking question.
You could have been able to choose to choose to choose it.
With a hundred different kinds of blings at the choice for the same.
So when people have been deciding people have decided to be good at the bedded is very undered to be a disappeared by themselves.
The persure was the world in the world industrialized in the last generational world in the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not the only -- but it important to this was the depression, and also the depression, is that people have been disappears that people have been releasing that people have been releasing the standards are too right.
And when they have to explain these experiences that they are coming out of it.
So the result of general is that a better at better, and we feel better, and we feel better.
So let me remind.
This is the doctors, that we all have a true that we all think we all think it's true and it's in the whole false.
No discussion that you have a few choice is better than no one one than no one more choice than there are no better than you somebody else than somebody else.
There's a big number of magniture.
But I'm pretty sure that we went to that point that we had improve that choices us improvement had the style of life.
Now, the idea of -- almost the idea of remember -- the idea that is that you think that's this thing.
What allows all these choices in society is good in society is good for the material is good material.
There's a lot of places in the world and I heard a few of them and they have too many of them is that they have too many options.
The problem is that they have too much like this.
So the thing about is a problem is a problem is a problem of the World Western society and diseases.
And what is the fuel, and the suffering is this: Steve Levitt talking about how these chair, and they are not helps and not helps us not help. I'm broking.
What I say is that these options, and they don't have it and complicated and complicated not only help.
They actually actually produce it.
They really do it really feels better.
If something that allows us as we allow all our society that we do all choices that we do have too transfer in society that people have too much options that people have too not only that people have to be improvement that would be improvement that the lives.
This is what economists are called the Part's call the mouse of Party.
Redistribution is going to be better, it will be better -- not only people -- not just the people -- not only -- that this excess of the way that this excess of the way that this excess of choices that this excess of choices.
As conclude that the cities that the cities and the phphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphysics you know?
You know nothing that is not possible in this action is not possible." Imagn." Imagine debate of the world -- so I read the first time -- I read it and I read it and I read it and I read it to the first weap.
But the way I thought I was a more at it so I got to think that the fish of science is something.
Because the real is that if you spend the window it all the way you don't have the liberty to be possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to home.
If you sparing the various various that everything is possible to the satisfaction.
You remainly the prisoners, and the satisfaction.
You know, notices has to be a various various across the various various across.
This is almost released -- probably for a fish to a fish for us.
But absence a metaphor is a remarkable various for inference and improve a bunch of intain a bunch of intains and improved.
Thank you very much.
