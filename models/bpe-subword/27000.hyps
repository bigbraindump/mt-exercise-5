But this morning, this is special species because of this problem because it doesn't look at the gross of the black of the black of the baby.
The polline is in a way, the heart of a world that the heart of the climate system.
She was expanding and contraction and contract.
The next diaposition that is a faster that I look at what it was a faster than what it was the last 25 years.

This is a slide model of it.
If you look at the context of the history of what you can see is what it is.
In the last five years we add 70 million tones of carbon every 24 hours of 24 hours of the oceans.

And the proposition was building a lot of fabrics for carribs.
But we start to see a total.
Here's the one who have anulated in the last year, with alternative ecological propaper.
Everything else is a fighting of our politics in our country.
And the industry and the food of the oil and the one of the farmed of dollars in the last year in the last year in the last year in the last year.

This image of the image of something.
In the Cracian Cracia, a billion galogenes of stery-stery-stery-stery-stery-stery-stery-male carbon was impractice.
You probably see the window of stird
This is, in your arm is the mass of the mass of the Stampled in the previous Cracia.
One of the industry is the carbon the days, and it was the samples of the day.

Al Gore: So the Aliana for Climb for the Climate of Climinal campaign.
This is one of them, one of them one of it.
Video: ALergy us see the climate changes as a very serious change as a very serious way to do our very serious for us to do our face.
That's why our principal is to spend a big shape is a large of published to be a lot of public public to argue that we have been complicity about the cargood.
The thing is that the carbon is not dirty of the carbs.
We think it's closed -- and the broke.
So it doesn't really fall to change the climate change.
And that's what we do in our hands.
Video: The Cargovernment, you heard a girl of it.
So you can do a hundred of this chair, the current of the carbon the carbs.
Hud! Masinart is like this.
But this is the sound of the technology is the current of the carbon the course of it.
And as the arms argue is one of the income, the principal of the global human technology is the provide of the technology that you see here you see here you see here that you see here is the change.
Some of you with the attention of today, this is the technology of carbon top of the carbon the board.

The same mention that we have lived all the way of fuel fuels of the carbon: the carbon: the carbon the street of the street stainable.
But now we have a new solution to figure out to iestimate from the incurcy.
The energy of the electricity of the electricity of 100 percent of the curately now before I began to 10 years ago.
A plan of the American America to get to the tree, and then it is the samples of the global stopping the stopping of global incomes to the global stop.

If you want to get to get to well.
We need to get faster fast.
Thank you very much.
And the last time I did a TED I did a inherite.
And I promised to give you a data about how it works on how it works on this way of works.
So the hypothese. And for the people who were not here, LHC is the most experiment that was the most experiment that was certainly 27 kilometers -- Cirumps is about 27 kilometers of a second-up to a billion of a billion of a billion times of a billion times of the universe -- a billion times of the universe -- a billion times on the sides of the universe -- a billion times of the universe --
It's extremely ambitious.
This is the apart of the Geneva.
We do photographs of these minds Big Bangs" in the decades.
I work on this one. It's called the ATLAS -- Lungy-ATLAS -- Lung, the diameter of 22 meters of ATALS photography here of ALS pt here to get the proportionary built the proportionation.
On the third of the third of the time for the first time.
And this image was the ATLAS.
She was a massive cell.
It's a very first picture of the first cycling that the third of the ink of the inner of the system, the cycling of LHC, the deliberately in the LHCCAs in the LHCC deliberly in the detector.
In other words, when I was looking at that picture on 10 several of 10 several I stand that is a huge that is a huge successful for the very successful to the very very successful for a huge successful to the down.
I don't know that if that was the largest oventures, or that, when someone else went on the board and seeing that the first page of the bottom of these page, and he wants the first page of the shape of these shape didn't know that the first page of the largest way to the highest of that if you don't know that the largest hole.
It means that I did a cultural impact on the impact of the street impact of the street.
After about a paper I had a paper I had a problem with these field -- these fire-aura.
These are the 13 men when you get the mouth of the power when the power of power power to power power in power power of power.
Now, the engineers in the room and said, "I can't translate and said, "I can't transport myself."
But I can do that when I'm at the temperatures become what they speak of the super-south.
So as a 271 degrees of the street of the street of the street can transport the couple of the couple of the couple of the couple of the couple of the couple of the couple of the couple of the couple of 271 desporation of 27 hours,
At one of the laws of the 9,000 meters in LHC, it was a fabricative.
So as the common the 13 men and the 13 thousands of both of the electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressing as those magnets of the magnets of the tone, and they have been deploted 30 to 30 to 30 to 30 to 30 to 30 to 30 to 30 to 30 to 30 to 30 to be a 30 times of the impression of the impression of the impression of the impress of the impression of those impresent to those of the magnets of the magnetwork of the stone.
So we determine the deteriority of 50 magnetwork.
I had to get affair, which I was doing.
And I reconditioned it took it.
And now we go back to the subterror in the subteran.
The past of the marties of the LHC will be like us.
We will go to the track and figure out what we have to do in hydrogen or hydrogen to the research to find out the universe that are elements that are elements of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe is that the engineer we go to the universe is we go from the engineer and we go to go back to the way from the drive data from the dge.
Now, of course, in a way, those are those reddoped by the important sense of the important engineering and engineering to the extremely rejected to reject to reject to reject to reject the deep of the inside.
I think that the fact that is so farming is so difficult to be young, is the important that we have younger experiments like HCCH.
I'm going to sleep as a word of the words of a stid-stian stide of the Britan Davy, when I think about the process of the protect of the protect of the protect of the protect of the protect of the progression of our minds are not the enough to make our own stinitially until we have the southern of our stinside, as well-sourselves are not the engineering of our lives,
Thank you.
I want to start with the assumption to remember to the kiddney of kidds.
And then you invite what you invite them to the water and they get them to the character and they are actually invented to the way to figure out how to figure out how to figure out how to solve the relatively intelligence and relatively intelligence and relatives.
The space is the profound is the profound a big part of how we understand a large part of the inconject.
So if we can get the IT inspired by this user of the interactive inspired with our objects -- impress with my objects -- I was presentious and collaboratory -- I started with my collaboratory -- I started a computer, and I started a computer, in a computer, in a computer, in a computer, in a computer, in a computer, and we are maybe a mouse of cannot be a maslide of the mouse of the cancer of the mouse of the mouthern of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse of the moutherapp, and we can be able to be able to be a maybe whether we fied to be the mon the mouse to be the mouse to be the mouse to be the mouse of the mouse of them of the caught.
So what we want to do we want to do we want to do we want to do?
And the question was so fascinating as I decided I decided to ask the research of the building Siftable.
As a Sift-hand is a computer, a bish of a bish of a bish.
They can be manufacturing the perceive perceived perceived one alted, and a ran one evidence of a relationship and a radio relationship.
The most important is that they're palpable, so that you can miss like just games, you can only bring them as just as I can only get it.
And Sift examples of an evidence of a new manipulation of the digital information of digital information.
And in the mass of these paintings because, more constantly constantly constantly one of the hand constantly one of our cells on the other side of our active and determines of us in their own stiles and determines of interactions.
I'm going to start with a few examples.
This Sift-hand is configure out the video to predict video in a direction, if you have the philanth, the rule of the aspect of parts of the park of the park of the park of the park inclay.
These are interactive constantly one of the other.
So, if you put them on the other way to otherwise, it becomes interested in the interest.
If they're conjected to confuses and that, and I can be be able to confuse.
And I can also feel the missing and incline.
We realized that one of the interesting implications is that we can use gestablish is that we can use to manipulate the manipulate of how we could be able to a license a license license.
In this case, we have three Siftables like the galets of painting and can use to type and can use to retach in the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of this case in the center of this case.
If I was too much as a very lot of the inaths of the ath.
There's also interesting the possibility for education, as the games, like the games, and logical lives, and we want to have the possibility to see the result of the results of the result of the results of the result of the results of the result of the results of the results of the immediately interested in the dark of interesting interesting of
So here -- this is a slide of Fibonacier program with a simple program with a program of equative.
Here's a game of combination of combination combination of Scrabbed and Bogger and Bogger.
The according to every other day a literally literally on every Siftable, and on the mother, and they try to form the mother, are verified with a dictionary to a dictionary.
And then I went to 30 seconds of seconds to the literally smart square a new set of silk and possibility.
Thank you.
These are the nistakes in the expression in the Media, and I was able to take the Media, and I was trying to get a video a material material.
He lived it on the neighborhood.
And one of the interesting of this kind of apples is that kind of apply is that it doesn't have to give people a lot of instructions.
All right, "Make you know what to do to do to do it.
Here are some other people are incatives in it.
This is the most tester tester in our right.
It's like everything that was to do was to take a Siftable, and the Siftable.
So for him to him.
This is a apply apply involved.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who invented to the language.
And this is Felix.
He can get new person, we can get in the scene, just the Sift of the Sift of the Siftables that affect the personal of personal characters.
Here is the sound sound.
Video: The broken is
David Merrill: Now it turns in the scene.
Video: The brother's common the bear.
Good well.
MisWhen Siftable, and the slices and the language can personally personally person, the person can make personal person.
DM: I think about the narrative.
Video: Buny awesome.
DM: It's a story with the final story, and decide how it will draw the same.
Video: The car sand.
DM: The Uline I showed you today is a time to look at today and interpretated the music and interpretated music that I built and in which Sift in which Sift and in which Sift and all of the sound and the rhouse.
Every one of these four various various various clothings, you want to use it.
And you can inject the sound of a successful that you can asassembling you can do it.
You get the sound sattack of a sound Siftable Siftable Sift-south.
There's the effective that you can control the reverberal and philosphere and filter.
And you know, you have a certain sound and then inclinical inclinical to hit for him.
It is the power of the general effects like the future that apply and volume the patients of the sequences.
Video: DM: DM: DM: The baby's two successful Siftables in a series, we arrive a series, a serious series, a serious rhitmen in a serious journal Video:
Now a base.
Video: DM: Now I add a percupy of percuting.
Video: And now I'm going to bring the filter to control the movie to control the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of Video:
Video: You can make, you can get include inclining in a part of a part or in a part or in a part or in a part or in a part of a part of a part of a part of a job.
Video: Now I'm going to attack for a lot of bas a long time.
Video: DM: Maybe I can do the second time as a cancing.
So I don't have to do the plan, I can improvise, maybe the melodian or melodian or melodies from the window.
Now, in the sfars; I can find the purpose of the secventure of the Sift of volume, inclined in the status in the stange.
Thank you.
As you see my passion is my interface, the passion of us interface, which is actually the way that it works better with the way that it works in our brains and our body is working with our brain.
And today, I had time to show you a coordination of this new space, and a couple of designs that we have to put them out of the labor in the labor in the labor in the labor in the lab.
The one that I would be able to retiny is that we are in the new generator is that we are in the new generates of interactive instrument with the middle of the middle of our rules in our world.
Thank you very much.
Astep, with you to talk to you to talk to you to go to you to.
They are writing.
He wrote is my teach, but it's more than that.
It's all my mother dragoes and fascinating.
And I didn't want to change the way to change it.
But these field said, something like a little bit of a little bit of a life, and in the book, and in my book, which was my own inside my relatively in the work.
And the music is that I wrote this car, this car, this car, I wrote "Manca, Rosian Iubest, Rool, Rools to depend on the depends on the depending on my books for a small meaning in the world for a certain the world for a sense of the world for a sense of balance.
The recircle is that the original people go now, people go to the condamnature.
Seriops -- condamnature!
As you know, for example, and you say, "You don't have a him, you don't have the mouth -- you can't be the performance you can be performance th?
Do you don't go to the track of the ink of your own life, the bar to be the soup of the world to put a book on the world to put the world on the world that would ever be able to put the world on the world that was going to be able to get the world is not going to be able to do you wouldn't get the way to go to the world is not going to go to the track is not the way to wrong.
It's very linked the lines, indeed of it.
But it was more running if I wouldn't remember that I was not like 20 years ago, when I was a big time -- when I was a great time -- as I was adolding people -- I was a written -- I want to become a kind of rule in a kind of frick on a kind of frick on a kind of frick far.
And people said, "Not you don't have any more than you never have any more than the success?"
Do you don't like humility will kill you will?
You don't have the front of the ink of your life, and nothing that is not going to be not in this field and nothing to deads here and I'm going to be deadly in a deaths of the center of the middle of the midle of the midle of the midddle of the middle of the midle of the middle is the front of the midddle of the insight of the inside of the include of the inner is that you will will be the inside.
Something like this.
The slide -- the rack on all those questions is "Yeah, yeah, I said, "Yeah."
Yes, you know, it's all of these things.
And always he stands up with it.
And you know, it's in the floor as many things that people can never intuitive.
As a big example of the big things that are infrastructure of things that are infrastructure.
But when it's about written about written about the word I think, about the last time I was asked in the last time, "Why is I said, "Why is "Why is "Why is "Why are you to hear the last time I talk to you to the last time I talk about what I was talking about what I was talking about the word about written about the word about written about the worker about the word of written about the word of written on the last time I was talking about the working about the work.
Is it something rational here?
It's logic as anyone to the top of the mountain their worker that they were pretty much as the Pamant.
And what is so specific initiatively that seems like a non-hand is really the way to the provide in a way that other teens in a kind of way that other teachers don't do that?
My father example, it was the invention of the inery and not remember of the 40 years of you have the inery of the inery of the inery of the incher incher-inched engineering engineer engineer engineer engineer engineer engineer engineer engineer invented to my invention,
It wasn't intamed -- John, how do we go to the chemistry of the chemistry of the chemical?
It's not just not the way to do something.
But to be synthetic engineering as group of the century of the century of the century of the century of the century of the oaco-depressive machines of the holds of the holds of the holds of the holds of holds of the engineering of the engineers,
We write a writers have this remarkable remarkable and not only writors, but artists like this reputation as they have this reputation as they have the labor to be powerful to be power to be able to be powerful to be power to be able to be able to wrong.
And all of us are looking at the bottom, the number of morning of the morning of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of young creative, who died by young woman who died by young people died by young young people died by the prisoned by the young people who have been doing is to look at the board of the samples of the samples of moral deaths of the morning.
And even the same same thing that they didn't have a chance to be the distracted to be the destruction of the own states.
Norman Mail, even before I did, in the last year of interview, he said, "Fither my book."
A big main a great deal about a viattack of the movie of the movie of the movie of the movie
But we don't mack when we hear someone saying someone day's heard about because I heard these things like this, and I heard these things and a lot of time, and I have absorsorry and suffering the idea of creativity and suffering as well as a massive and the art of the suffering of the suffering in a suffering in a suffering of the suffering of the suffering of the suffering of the sufficient of the suffering thing in the top of the top of the sufficipation of the top of the top of the top of the to
And the question I want to bring it all of the types here: Are you with all of you with all of this ideas with this ide?
You are comfortable to comfortable with hand as you see the light -- I don't myself, I don't mean with this paint per painting.
I think it's over.
And also I think it's dangerous and I wouldn't be able to see the future.
I think it's better if we include us to get the artists of artists to live it.
And I know that I was in my hand -- in my situation -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to me to me to me to me begin to me to start to me to this card of this purpose, in particular perform, in the presence of the circumstantes that I was now professional to teach the teacher.
As for example, I'm pretty much in the young woman in a 40 years.
And I have been in the money as four mountains.
And it's very probably that everything I wrote with this moment to be judged by the way from the mountain the last successful for my own story of my own career coreach, cognize of my book, corectly both of my book, right?
What would be to say to the mention of the mention of the people here are very much as a friends -- is very much as the most successful -- it's very successful to be intamed to be intampled to be intampled to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to say the best way to say the barridge.
Oh, God, God, Gand!
This is the gene of the gold someone to get to the hand to the hand to the hand to not want to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person could do that person could do with the gene of garden, this is the kind of garden,
I think about this message that I keep it that I love it.
And then the question becomes the question, right?
And so it turns out that the way to work that manian that manian to work now, to work now, is in the way to go to the baby of building a kind of building a kind of building a kind of a psychological degrees that are the psychological degrees that are the psychological to be able to be able to be a lot of meditative meditative to me to be a lot of the meditative.
It was a way to find a way, to find a way way to be a distance, and my favorite physics of myself, and the them, the ones that will be able to reactive reactive that will be able to reactive what it was written by what it was writing about what it is.
And as I was looking at the last year of this year, I started to home in the time, and I tried to see the time, and I tried to see other society would be able to see if you could have ideas as that would be able to find better ideas about how to be able to do people to be able to do people to do with the emotional emotional emotional emotional emotional emotional emotional to be able to do with the emotional model.
The process has been able to Greek and Roma and Roma Romantic Roma and Roma
So the mass of the mass of the Christ.
But in Great Great and Roman ancient and Romano that people don't think that people don't think that people are not that the inside of the homok?
People thought that creativity was a spirit was a spirit of people in a horse of people in a source of people, and needed to be able to understand the needs and needed to be able to understand the needs of reasons.
The Great these spirs are creativity to make the front of the term of the terms "demonstrate "demonstrate in "demoni."
Socrack was the fact that it has a demon that is transmitted the intelligence of the department.
The same parents were the same parents, but they call that spirit of the genius of the genius of the genius of the genius of the genius.
What is wonderful is wonderful because the romans, they didn't think that a genius was a individual person.
I think that a kind of a genius was a kind of a dives, which is a message of the artist of the artist of artist, in a kind of like Dobby, who had the house, which is the insession of the mountain the worker work, which is the worker in the word of the worker work, the worker work, the model of the worker work,
Absolutely strallowed -- this is the distance, which I was -- that built -- that build psychological result of your work.
And everything that was working on the way to work?
So the artist was the protected by things, like a lot of things, like a lot of narcism, right?
If you were the stralking, you could not stallowed the street for her, everything that you were, everything you have to help that the track that the genius that the terms that they helped us helped us to help them to help that they helped us to help us to help the labor was the stralways of the mountain the strallow.
If you were criticized to you, it wasn't completely completely right?
Everybody knows that the genius was like ignorant.
So they looked at the people in Very for a long time.
And then came up with the Renast, and everything has changed with a certain the idea of ideas that the mass of the universe as individual in the universe of all the universe and mysterious mystical and mystical to creature's dience that they get from the window to the horrible to the window of the window of the window and the Renast,
It was the human beings beginning to create the humans began to creativity as the creative of the individual bear.
And for the first history in history, the history of artists of artists as a genius as a genius as a genius of a genius to have a genius to have a genius to have a genius of the artist of artists in the history of the overwhelming in the history of the overwhelming horrible in the history of the artist people have the history of the artist.
And it is going to make a huge error of a huge error of it.
The paper parently a person to create that it is actually receive that it is actually receive the speech and the source and the source of mystern, creatively a lot of innovation is a lot of the inner responsibility is a lot of the psychological acoral psychologist is a lot of performance of the psychologist person is a lot of person is a lot of person and the myth,
It's like you to get a couple of somebody to get the sound of soil.
It's just just the incool and shares of equires all these expectations of all these types of the inimaginable inside.
I think that the president of this artists of the last 500 years.
And if it's true, and I think is, and I think is, what is we do is that we do now?
Can we do the things else do that?
Maybe we go to the sense of relationship of relatively and mystery of the brain.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't stand simply stergem to stering 500 years of thinking about a homework from a 18 minutes.
And perhaps that would be in the public public meaning the question of the question, the question, the gift of the mass of the mass of the people are prepared people are prepared of their own people and survive.
It probably doesn't have it to cooptest all of this idea.
But the question I want to put it is -- why don't I mean?
Why don't we think in this way?
Because it has a lot of sense of something that I heard about what we heard about the crazy of the creative process of creatively inner of creatively inner process of creative process.
The process that anyone who was trying to create something -- that is all the way -- you know, all of the -- you know, always that they didn't always have always been coming up to the bear.
And in fact, sometimes can put the analymouth.
And I had a typical to the extraordinary of the American poet American hand the American Ruth Stone, which now has been in the 90-year-old me that it was the story of the past and the story, and when he was working on the Virginia, and I heard a story of the Virginidle and I heard a story of story, and I heard a step in the rop.
The story was like a wall of the tunny of the air.
And they get the catching of the camps.
And the comes up because it is the shape of the paper under the painting.
In that moment is a single thing that is doing, and that is the down, and that appear."
And the alerged as to the houses of poem, and the past ideas was to get to a piece of the map of the map of the map of faster to a faster to get a faster to get a fast, to get a map of the mapper one of the map of the map.
Sometimes was not faster faster as the alerg, but not the alerg, but not the role in the house and the poems of the rostogol, and the poems of the root and the poem, I read the training of the camps, a poet of the camps, a poet."
They were also now in which -- and the part of this -- and the part of that story -- when the story that almost like almost lost as almost lost as a lost of lose as well.
The other home, the map, and the poems and the poems of the exact of the exact of the exact of the exact of the silk and story to the other.
The parent of the coads and the source and the source of the massh of the massive to the map of the map.
And so in the mapping of the map of the map of the map of the first door of the first body, from the first to the first of the first word in the first body.
When I heard -- it's the surprising of the process of my own own creative.
My creatively not limited to this -- I'm not running to do it.
I'm a way that I work together, and the way I worked on the same way to get the same way to sleep and to sleep and to sleep and slide me with a hard and I can find out to stand to sit with the hard and I am a hard way.
But even though I was in my indark and I was so touched that phenomenon.
And I mean, I was and so many of you were and many of you were and many of you will.
And I had the projects that have been projects that they came from a source that they didn't know to a hythme.
And what is the way to do this?
And how does it mean that I should be reported to us to wouldn't lose our minists, and we weren't going to help us to ram?
For me, the most relevant of our days, which I have about how we can do is the musician can do is the musician in the town of the revival revivil in the brain in the brain in the brain.
I was talking about the suffering was almost everything about the artist of artist, which is the artist of the contemporary contemporary to control these involved, and to control these impulse impulse impulse these impulse impulse of the incontrol in-in-controlled involved inside.
The time of the line of the line story, and improve the story of a day on the autop of Los Angeles Angeles and then everything has been changed in Los Angeles has been able to take the top.
At the way to leave a fragment of a piece of a piece of a piece of the evazy and amazing aths and amazing and a floor and a handful and a whole and a splensia, but it doesn't get the water than to him.
It's not not the mapping of making now, it doesn't have the report of the report.
And the way to feel that the village of the anxiety of "I will lose the moment of the monkey, and the cancer, and the canopy for the monkey.
I'm not enough to receive the best to re."
And instead of the painting, it was just a stop.
He recognized the process and made something with all of us and all of the new new new thing.
And he was the way to do it and said, "Scocover I said, "Scocovered that I'm not going to be volunted?"
"You know, I can do it as I would?
If you really want to be true, you start in a moment of a moment of a moment moment when I can get my her.
If you don't think about and forward somebody else today.
You know, you walk up to Leonard Cohen."
The paper proaches has changed that.
Not the surgery, the surgery as intuned as intuned as intunately.
But the way it was the pagnose, and the page, he was the moment that he took the moment that he took the spired in him, and the cause of the drid of the tools, and then he had to go back and then he realized it was not just to be invented by the Chinese and then came up with the Chinese and the Chinese and then they don't have to get to the income.
It could be this collaboration and bize bizard and bizard under the exterior of the exterior of the exterior of the exterior of Tom.
After I heard the story of the way I heard a little bit of how I worked and already saved me a data.
This is what he saved me when I was was in the middle of the "Manca, Roagain the middle of the Aloan inside of a kind of person in a kind of disappeal in a kind of disaster in a kind of disaster than a very short of a very short of a best written to be the most product of the process of a written that the best product of a book
Not just the process of the book written to be the written
I was to think about how I think I should be able to abandoned the project.
And then I remember the hand I talk to me and I was asking to the him.
I went to my view the way from the manuschain and I addressed me a collect of the camera.
I said, "Oh the voice of the window, and I know that if we know that if I know that if I know that if I know that if I don't just weren't just the sample will not only be the sample, right?
Because you can see that I put a myth on the wild to him, and more than I could not her.
So if you want to be better than that, you need to do it to do it and you have to do the south.
Okay. And if you don't do that, you know, you know about it.
It's going to write because this is my message.
And I want to consume for today, I did my hand my hand."
Because -- the -- the conclusion -- with hundreds of years ago in African hundreds of North African to sard people get to shape the month of the long-term and music in the dance.
And they were always wonder, because of the dances, because they were teaching and they were remarkable to be remarkable to code them?
But sometimes very rules, and one of the interpret of the common the common the common the common the common the common the common the common the common the common the common the common and horrible ons, but sometimes, very richers, but some of the rules, very rules, very range of intanks, and very rare very rarely rough, and
I'm convinced you all of you all of you as I was to see all of you see today, so you can see the moment of interpretation -- like a certain a certain a certain a certain a certain the interpretation.
It's like the time is the sample and the dancing is from a kind of dance, and you don't do anything different, in the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of alinias.
In a time it doesn't even even even in the intuition.
It's the light and light and light by the game is the paper is the diving.
As you want to get people when they were humans and they were holding people who were and they said to him.
And they have the maintains and incept to scanne, the Alllah, Alllah, Does Does Does Does Does Does Does Does Does --
It's God.
A history -- a history -- when they invented the Spanish of Spanish herited with this obvious and pronuntil the century has been able to "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, alone.
and they hear the fights of flows and dances.
In Spain, when a interpret of remagic and magic myself and the magic of "Allah, Allah, the arm of the arm of the arm of the arm of the arm of the arm of the arm of the arm."
And the needs -- a farming of God of God of God
It's wonderful for that we need to need to be like this.
But the way that he was the second of the morning of the insusion of the insusion of the insusion of the morning and not a 11 demand, and not a soup of Divings of Diff.
It's a disorder, and the murity's dresses and they could never get to be the intimate and so intimate it as intimate in the same way of intime.
Could you be no one to the Great the Domn, so that the Great the room that they should be able to do with the rest of his life.
It's difficult.
It's one of the most painting in the business.
But it may not be a big key to not do with the shape of insuch as the most extraordinary as the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary interior of the inside.
Maybe if you have been able to simply as well as a measure of a few sure of a few times of a few times of the vision of the vision of the next time that you get more often than the next time they were inched to be including their home.
If we think about these kind of thinking about how to change it.
And so I started thinking about and thinking about and so I think of the last months of the last months of the last months that will be published by the way, a continuation of fashion and infrastructure of my successful and infrastructure of my successful music for my successful and the successful of my successful and I was a successful and I started to think of my success.
And what I do is look like when you get the parents of is: You don't have lost the ama.
It doesn't be the spert. You just go to Can Can Can Can you do, anything you would be doing.
If you are dance, then dances, then dance.
If the genius of the divine and exhibition is repair, to get the extraordinary decision, even for a clipping through your eform and for a way to you, "Ole" by the eform of your eform in your eform in your eform in your eforces in your samples of the genius of the genius of the genius of the gen
And if no, no, it gives anything.
And with all of this "Ole" for you.
I think in these things and I think should be prepared to prepare
"Ole! Well, for you, for you, for you, because you have a dragot for humans and incapatancing in the end, and incapatancing in the continuation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We talked about some of these projects, about the genome and what could I represent us to represent us to represent new genes.
Now in fact, from a new point from a new point of making biology, and now we're trying to start to start to go from this code and go to a new by-flies and to get biology, modeling and feel like shape and shapes of life.
We tried to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us all the time.
"What is the life life is something that I think many biologists have tried to understand the diverse levels.
I tried to different approach to component the component of the basis of the basis of the base.
We already have already about 20 years.
When I was the site genome, this was the year of the world, this is the digital world.
Now we try to ask question: Can we can create new form, or we can create new form, from this universe of this universe of the digital life.
This is the map of a mice, Mycoplash gender that has the most of genome, which is the most of the labor in the labor in the labor in the labor in the labor in the labor in the labor in the labor of a specific organism in a mice.
We tried to see if we can come with a genome.
We were able to suggest in a hundred hundred of the five that are there.
But when we look at the map of the mathematics, it's pretty simply to our comparison with us to our comparison.
And that's the simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can suggest moment that we can get to a moment that to produce a cell.
So we decided that the only way before we were to smart this cromos, so we can see this cromossed to address to bring some of the most of the most of the most assummer questions.
And so I started on the board, "Can we can feel a cromosom?"
Maybe allows the shares of these molecules that I didn't ever do it.
And if yes, we can active.
A cromosis, by a chemosomosomosome, it's just a chemical.
So, our speech speech of life, the exponentially.
Our grandfather genetic code is the mountain the beginning of the beginning, but it growth.
The last time he got to a close exponential claim to a closer.
And I started this 15 years.
I went through a few eth, it starts to a bio-example, before the first before the first experiment.
But it is the DNA is very difficult DNA very difficult is very difficult.
They're thousands of cars in the world, in the world, the long DNA month of DNA 30 to 50 literally degenerative process to 50 literally degenerative process to build a longer more more than we built a longer long.
So we had to create a new way to put a new way to put these little bits of the herorors.
This was our first tenth of tenty-up from the information of the digital information of Phi 174.
It's a little virus that killed bacteria.
We did design design, I went through the code of the herororitors, and I got a molecule of DNA molecule of DNA 5,000 literally literally fun.
The interesting came up with this piece of chemistry was the chemical, and I put it in bacteria and I put it in bacteria to read this code of genetic background and produce the viruse.
The articulate viral cells were then elidents and they were going back and killed their cells.
I was talking to the oil industry and saying that I understand and that I understand that that this model.
They have a longer than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software in which the maybe maybe the maybe maybe the maybe biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the cromoss of a bacteria.
This is about 580,000 literally code code code of genetic code
So I said, "So we would allow the next types in the houses of the houses to the home, in fact, the size of the homework that are component that are component to understand that are component to understand the component of a cell.
The critical is critically, and if you start with the computer, and if you start with the computer, that information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly exactly the exactly the exactly of course,
When I was the first sequence of 1995, the standard of precision was a 10,000 per was a 10,000 per per per per well.
I found in the next rest resources, 30 herors. If we were used second, this is the original sequence would never have been activated to be activated to be activated activated.
The design is the project, which has months of 50 literally literally laughter, which has to be slightly 50 literally literally to build to build a sub-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-driven companies with alone.
We design tool.
You can read the "watermarket." The push. The finger in the hometic code of thesitic code from four genetic code from four literally God.
Triplef the literally literally codify about 20 amino acified -- one literally a single acid.
So we can use the genetic code to write code to write the balance.
The uniquely thing I did was to hear the code of her.
Some of them were disappears.
We designed those benefit that we can dignaked them with enzyme.
I'm enzymes that are to.
So we started doing the piece of five to 7,000 dollars to 7,000 literally literally floor 24,000 literally floating them to do a 24,000 literally fun, and then ask to 70.
And every equip, we ended these pieces of abundant, but we can see, we try to create a process process of robbblown in a mind.
We tried to get to that point of automatic point.
So, this looks like a teren teren type.
When we get a big piece of the market in 100,000 per per per per in Eastern Ecolls.
They are all the tools of biology molecular molecular moleculation of molecular molecular moleculation of the molecular tools of the by-molecular issues all the tools of the biology of all the tools of the bymolic tools all the tools of the biology of the biologist molecular to
So we got to other mechanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the biology that biology that biology that is DNA to read DNA to reach the babies of DNA checking.
This is a example.
There's a case of Deinocock role of radiocock role of radiation.
As you see in the paper to the chromosomosomosomosomosome.
12 to 24 hours, he put it on the line labor in the labor of how it was in the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be drawle.
I can live in the viold.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the extra extracted to move a new environment, to find a new environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is where it was darking.
Here's a micrograph molecules that we build these process process process -- in fact, by using the mechanisms of the adecade with design process that we put them on the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of a molecule.
Drodie with them together.
This is not a picture from a microscope with electronics, but only a photograph.
It's so big molecule molecules we can see a microscooptic.
These are the image of a collector over a hand by a six second.
This is a public public published that I had a little bit of time.
These are over 580,000 literally code code code of genetic code
It's the biggest molecule of people, with a structure of the definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely the far.
It's a molecular molecular to 300 million home.
If we have a funny about 10 and no space, 142 pages to practices this genetic code this genetic code this genetic code this genetic code of genetic code with a genetic cycle.
So, how do we go to a cromosome? How do we active.
Widentically, with a virus is quite easy.
But it's much more complicated with bacteria.
You know, also also easy to ekill you get to ekill you just will, you can only get to get the nuclear and this is something that you would have heard something that you would heard -- clone.
The bacterial archair, the cromoss-cell, but I showed that we can do a cromoss-cromos, from a cromosome, from a cromos, and we can figure out to a cell.
We pushed a crozen from one of the microbial microbial microbial rth of microbial microbial rthble.
These are about as farming as people and the mouse as people and the mouth.
We added a couple genes to this cromossed for this cromos.
I digested with enzymous enzymous.
And it was pretty amazing when I put it in our cells -- you will be our very sophisticated -- and the cromosis -- and cromosomed in cell.
In fact, we thought that this is how it can they go to design something that we tried to design something more than we tried to design something more like a more department.
This is a mechanism of evolution.
We are all kinds of species that have the cromossed a third of the third of the third of the third of our new cars of new cars in a second.
So those who are thinking about the evolution of evolution changes as a single moment they lost lost a lot of biology.
I'm enzymes called the DNA restriction, which is digering DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA
The Cromosomosomosomosomosomosome.
The cells -- the cromosis that we put it --
It was expressed and recognized the other cromossed material that material was just with cells with cells with cell.
It became the blue of the genes that we put them in cromossed in cromossed in the cromossed of the comosome.
And after a very excited periods of time, all the time, all the cars of a species of a species of a new species in a new species that we put on a new species in a specific species that I put it in the software in cell.
All the proteins were changed by the genetic research -- when we cities, it's exactly what we transfer transfer.
This can sound like alchemistry, but we can make, the DNA future, to change the game of the player.
Now, I had been susped that this is not the genetic -- and half the years, and half a year, and we had a half of the evolution of the evolution of the Cambridge of the Cambridge of Cambridge of the massive species of the massive design is a new specific species of the massive species of a massive species of the massive of the design of the massive of the U.S.
Why do we do this?
I think it's pretty obvious from the point of unknowledge.
We are on the way to go from six and half billions of people over the new billion people over 40 years.
And as a context for me to me to me in 194, I was born, I was born.
They're three people on the planet for every one of us who were in 1940 years, they will be four years.
We have the issues of window, the drugs, the drugs, drugs, the drugs, and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billions and half billion and half billions of billion and a half billion and we have a problem of the problems of the problems of the problems of the issues of the issues of the issues of the samples of the fudgment,
It will be difficult to do it.
We use over five billion of the book, more than 30 billion barily of barily barily of oil oil oil of oil oil oil
This is a hundred millions of barily on day.
When we try to think about the process of biological process that to replace that to replace that this is going to be a challenge.
And then, of course, it's all the CO2 from this atmosphere.
Now, from our discoveries around the world, we have a data in the world, and I like to think about 20 million genes, and I like to think about these design.
Industrial electronics is just a paper, or so that something, and this is diversity of that diversity that came from that.
We are limited here, in the first time, a real reality and imagine of our biological image.
We have now been technology-be-driven technology, to do what we call the way of name, combinatorical combinatorical combinatorical combinatorical combinatory of genimics.
We have the ability to build a big robot that to make a million cromoss on day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of genes are different genes of genes or to optimize the optimize of products in the product of products farmaceutical team of our biology in our own hythmolecule molecule molecule molecule than the last 20 years of all of the science.
And this is just the standard.
We can see the substance for the substance of the chemical chemicals or fuels, something, and production anything.
This is a screen capture of a software designing to be able to work and work to work and work to work and work in computers in these species in computers.
You know, we don't know how to show you how it will show it.
We know how their genetic code as the genetic code
Now we concentrate fuel four four generations.
You see that from the line that from the etanoous standard experiment is just a newspaper experiment.
We have the fuel fuel of the second generation that will apply and the third of the fuel, which are the fuels of the police as a black of butility or kill.
But the only way we think biology can have a biology without a lot more costs and the south of the limitations and the far is if we start with CO2 as we start with the CO2 as we start with this scope, and we think we will have the first generation of the fuel of four generation to the fuel of four generation of four months of the future of four month.
The Brink and CO2 is -- but in our discoveries around the world's discoveries of other works.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It gets in the oceans, by the home of the oceans and half kilometers and half the deep of the labor of fierror of fiers.
Transform CO2 in the metan hydrogen molecular energy.
We try to see if we can take the CO2 captures, which can be able to get the control that CO2 back in the country, to convert that CO2 back in the fuel, to drive this process proces.
So in a period, we think about what we think we could mean that we could be the question of the question of the question, "What is the life?"
We really know -- you know, you know -- we have been able to replaced the entire industry industry.
Yeah. If you don't do that in the bottom?
She become a big energy to power energy.
But we also work now to use these same way to invented these vaccines to inventing vaccines to invent vaccines
You see this year, we are always with a year in the hand a year in the minus when it comes to a vaccine.
I think that the situation can be changed by combinately changed the beginning.
Here's how it could it look at the future changes now the ardisorders again with bacteria, and finally argue the evolution of bacteria, and finally finally indeed by the bacteria.
We almost to improve people.
Our remove is just to make survival that we have a chance to survive enough to survive enough to survive it. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you the more quickly meaning, it's a very quickly new technology that I added a new technology I added in a way from a year of a year, this is Sdragon. This is Seadragon.
It's a place that can interact with a local amount of data with a big amount of visual data from visual data.
We look at a lot at many of the giant pictures and men and swimming and swimming in the lab, the drive in the dormous drive.
It's not conteaching how much information we look at how big we look at these large are these large are these images or how big images.
Most of the wall of the window, but this is a digital digital scanning from the Bible of the Bible of 300 machine, the order of 300 machines of 300 machines of 300 machines of 300 machines are making a machine.

This is a book is a non-example of dyn-imaging.
It's about "The Cass" to Charles Dickens. Each Dickens.
And to show you that it's about text, and not a image of text, and we can't imagine that it is a representation of a representation of a text; it's not a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of the picture of you are talking about it.
Maybe this is a ficial way to read a book in the shape of electronicity.
I wouldn't recommend.
This is a better case of "Gardian edian edian edian.

I'm not going to sleep a long time to tell you about this is contributed to you in this field of this field of this field.
These are all the way of the United States in the United States to NASASA.
Let's go to something else about something like that.
This is actually active active on the Internet of the verific very.
This is a given project Photosynth, which is the second technology. Seadow is Seadragon and the other way of the perception of the perception of the perception of the Iah Snavel, the University of the University of Washington, the University of Washington, the University of Washington, and the U.W. Washington, and the U.W.
and Rick Szeliski in Cerced Cercer Cancer Cancer is a collaboration of beautiful beautiful thing.
And so this is active active in the Internet of Seadow Seadow Seadow Seadow.
You can see that when we create these perspective, when we can do this by imagery in a lot of information in many solar sense of solar experience.
But the aranjy of these images of these images conted.
The other perception of perception of the visual regions, so that they can corenel the space of the real space where these pictures -- all these these pictures -- all these Grass in the Stypes -- they were done in the Stypes of a project, and these elements here of a project, and these relationship of a project, and these physical relationship of space.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There's some of the space that have a lot more space.
I want to go to one of the story, the original stories of the New York -- this is a protown of Photosynth that I worked in the various way that I think that's the piece of the technology that I think that's the piece of the technology is not only vision, the technology is not only visive the vision of this technology, is not just the vision of the vision that we have a vision of the vision of the technology that we have a journal projection of the Earth of the sets of the settospitopension.
We had to work on the shares of the shares of the shape of the same.
This is a reconstruction of Cattack of the Great Does in Flickr. The Great Do Come on Flickr. And you find something you can find something you can find something you can see in the trick of the trick of this conditions of these conversations that was found a picture that was found a picture that was found a picture that was found that proper of this model.
These are the Flickr, and all of the relationship in this way.
We can just get to a way to be able to be in this way.
You know, I didn't think I was going to work to work to work to work to work to work on Microsoft is very first to a part of a part of a part of a lot of the first here.
I don't see that there are a lot of training cameras in the room of the phones of the phones of the cell phones in the SLRs a very large number of teaching environmental media.
If you can find out of this amazing in this way.
There's so many machine, and it was swimming herite.
Only one series of photographs --
This is a poster poster with the Dame that was regions.
You can get the environmental environmental environment.
The idea is that they can do with social media for social media to collective data from all the world -- from all the world, from a collective memory, and to interconnection -- and to interconnection -- and to interconnected to interconnected, they become a lot of connection that is a large amount of common that is bigger than the rest of the surgery of the country.
You have a model of what the Earth of the Earth.
Think about the long way to the worker of Stephen Lawler Lawler "Earth Lawler "Earth."
And this creates in complexity as the world is using it and the book, and the books becoming bigger as well.
The prophotos are with meters that somebody else that somebody else that somebody else to it.
If someone would be the expecting and says that they are going to be who I am with Catch with Catch with Catch with the Dame would be able to use with all these data with all these data with all these data as a person to be able to make a kind of person to make a kind of experience as a way way of experience as a kind of experience of experience of the experience of experience with the experience of experience and a kind of experience of experience and a kind of experience of a very much experience of like experience of like the audience of like the Copen
And of course, a produced second, and all of these are the universe and disease physics of the Earth, not only the Earth, not only collective in the window of the satellites, but from a collective memory, but from a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understand what we understand what it will allow your brother, is that in your hand in the next few years, it's like all the photos of a few days of a couple of someone in the wind person to be interrelationship?
BA: Yeah. What does it really do is to descend.
It makes the hyper-level images of images.
And it's basically based on the image of images.
And this becomes indeed when you think about the disease that they have significant these images.

Something that our identity became a choice problem is now a role of role in this transition to show that the role to show that the role in this shot.
We don't have no shape a identity of an invention of a invention of a invention of a invention of a invention of a invention of a handle.
And that we can reinvent us anything that we have check the cheese.
And this means that you have to go to the purpose you want to decide what you want to be able to be to be the person to be doing.
And the reason for the traveling and family was a poor of the hand that was a hand that was almost everybody was that the closer to the traveling how fast you become more than anybody else as faster kids like faster.
The option was the option was not when you don't know what you will do after that you will do after that.
In our days, everything is very quite a very well.
I give you the incredible students of intelligence and I give them 20 percent of them and I give them 20 percent of the worker than I was doing it.
And this doesn't be less than it would be less than it would not be less than it would be less than it would be less than the mapp.
How many of you are prepared with all kinds of questions "I should be willing me or now? I should do it now?
Can I should be travel? I would have to me? I should mean, or a kid, or a car? All of these are the questions that are questions that are questions that are questions that are the questions that are the questions that are the questions that are consummer should be the question.
And they will answer these questions, whether this is to not all of my brothers that I want to do a good noise of my current and not a good notes.
And this is what we need to do. These are important questions that we need to answer.
The way -- we're good, as well-source and Carl and Carl technology that allows to move the mountain every mind of the planet in the planet -- less than the planet in the planet of Randold.
There's a per non-the-drive collect, which I didn't get to devide the reless-hand that works on the relationship of the reless-to-hand
I don't tell you about it because I want to use it.
So this incredible is that this incredible alequired by the worker that we have to do with the worker to make a decision, and if we should not do a decision, and if we should not be working to.
We can go to see how our photos and we can see our mobile and we have the mobile and Blackberry in the other, and perhaps the other laptop, and probably the samples of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of genes and the gamper crazy to see the genes of the game of the gamp.
And even though they're all the way we look at every minute that we look at the mechands of floor of the floor of the floor we should answer the water in this water water in this water water in this water water in this water of water in the water is the water every apply of the water are all the way of funny is the engineering every mind of the mutility of the mutility of
Can I should answer this email? I should write of this written to write the question, is not that if the answer to the question of the floor of the floor of the floor of the floor will be very different from your hand is a very different from your hand without a different samples of the hand without the hand without the hands.
So where we look at the bones and small objects and the mouth of life, life is a stuff, the life is a stuff.
And the world I showed you as I was living this.
And as I was able to say that I had some choice that was not all of the opposite opposite opposed to the option.
And the world we live now look like this.
And the question is, is it well?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what we know about this, so I think I'm going to talk about what I think about what I was the broke.
All these choices have two effects, two effects of people.
One of the effect, it's paradox, it's paralyze, more amazing than eliberately ely.
And so many of the option of the option of people can choose to be very difficult to optetest something.
I give you a very significant example, a study of the penses of the pensource of the penses of the penses.
A colleague had access to the data from the dating of the investment of the investment of the funny of funny that has almost a million of the employees of common the bear.
And what he found is that for every 10 funds mutual that they give the window, run with two percent of the participation of the participation.
You know, 50-funny mutual -- they are getting 10,000 home. Why are you only five percent of the being?
Because with 50 fondline mutual mutual of the choice that is a hard to give you to choose that a chance to choose that a landscape so that a landscape and swimming and hands.
And then then the home, and then on the hand and and and the window, and the window, and of course, and of course, that this spot home, and of course never comes to never be coming to be never coming the holding window that this floor comes to be able to get the same way from the window and then on the window and then the impimines and then on the windows and then on the homework and then on the home.
You know, that is not just that those people will not only consumer people will consume because they don't have enough to get to the pensive because they don't have enough to put a decision of a decision, that is so difficult to do that the funny of a bunch of a bunch of barrier to be able to do the barrier of the broken that would be able to do with the shape of the babies that would be the samples that would be the home.
The one, they give them the shape of the shares of the land to 5,000 dollars a year of the bears of the commercial compensation.
So the insurance is a consequence when you have too much option.
And I think that this is how to show you that this is like this.
You really want to take the good decision of the newspaper for all the eternity.
You don't want to choose the investment of investment to the soscity for the sad for saving the wrong wrong.
So this is a second. This is that if we can do it is that if we can do the state state state of the opening state to make a choice to make a little bit more than we were able to eat the result of equal choice than we were able to eat the along choice of equired.
And there's a couple of reasons for that.
One is that we have a sosholes for saving a sospital to the choice if it bus -- and it's not perfect -- and it's not perfectly -- and it's not perfectly -- and it's not perfect?
It's easy to imagine that you would have a different choice that would be better choice. And what was the better image that the alternative image that the alternative image that you would induce your choice that you have done in the satisfaction that you get a good short of the satisfaction that was a good decision.
The more options, the more options, the more option to regret something that is disappearing with the option that you have to choice.
Second the second ond, what economies called the opportunity.
Dan Gilmonstrated in this morning in this morning about how we speak about how we evaluate the things that we depend on what we comparison with what we comparison.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative alternative to take a lot of the characteristic to imagine the attacks of the attacks that they required the characteristic that you can receive you a little bit of the satisfy will be able to do less satisfy that you have been able to do it
Here's an example. I mean, I mean, I am New Yorkerke.
But here's how we should rather than we should run
We have here in Hamp.
A very expensive very expensive it.
Shim, a hundred day. They have to be her.
What could you want to do you want to do? "Well, I will, they weren't honest.
Everybody in Manhattan are plecture.
I could be parties in front of the week." And the day day of the week of the idea that that they ran hand to have a place of parking a place of parking a place place of parking a park of the park of parking a park place of parking of the park of the park of the park of the park of the park in the front of the front of it.
The opportunity of opportunity of the satisfaction that we have equal choice of evidence is exceptional exceptional is exceptional exceptional exceptional choice.
And the more option of options of options of the option of these characteristics are perceived the option of these options will be perceived by us as we are perceived costs.
Here's another example.
This cartoon-hand is a lot of things.
It is says that we should live and probably we should do things begin to do to do the things begins.
But one of the things that says is that anyone else is that anyone else equired to not do with other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of living lives, and this is going to do what you do you do you do to do you do what you do you do you have less attractive attractive attractive to the attractive thing.
And the third of the third expectations.
This was my love me when I wanted to replace.
Port almost everything else is almost everywhere.
And there was a single eths were a single and they buy them and buy them as well as they were incredibly common you, and if they were incredibly common and if they were incredibly common and himself to stand they were very time and they were able to stand to stand and they were slowly enoughly enough.
So I went to replace my brothers after I was a good hi of the neighborhood and I said, "U., I want to be a pushing paper to be the samples to be the bad of my brothers, right?
Do you want to do with the pharms or with the farms of the hand or shares or home?
Do you want to be able to be able to find us?
You want to be awess, you want to bavoid them --
And he painted me and after I said, "I came up with my guys who was the guy who were the only guess who were the only kind of the guy who was the only way I spent a horse of the silk of the sentence of the blue -- and I plan -- and I was the best -- and I was the best ones of the best -- and I was the best one.
We have better choice. All these options have made possible to choose better than the choice.
But I felt work.
Why? I wrote a book I tried to explain my explicitly explain my explain.
The reason for the best I felt that I felt all these options are deeply of my expectations about how to be a good pushes of how to be a good push.
We had expect very expect today. I didn't have a expected by a single way.
Now when they're 100 men is 100 machines, one of them have to be perfect.
And what I got was good at was good perfect.
So I got the comparised with what I got to expect and the result is that I was disappearing with what I hope was dealing with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope was the comparison with what I was comparison with what I comparison what we comparison what we comparison I comparison what we got comparison what we have to be comparted with what we got to be able to what we got to the funded with what we got was the unexpected with with with with with what we have been able to have been able to have the samong termer I was expecting with with what I was the result
The option of option in the lives, it can't do something else than to create something about how people have to create those are about how people have to be able to be able to be able to be those options.
And the rights of that will leave the satisfaction to the result of the well-results of the well.
Nobody in the markets don't know that.
Because if you wouldn't have to be ideas about what I talked about what I talk.
The same is more like this.
The reason why everything was better when everything was the better when everything was the better was the better was that when the people to experiments was the more surprising surprising surprising surprising surprising surprising surprising surprising surprising surprising surprising surprising for which that everything was the most of the way to be the best for that was better when it was the better for that people who was the better for that was the better for that people were worst.
At today, in the world in which we live -- we live -- and we add the perfection of the perfection -- the best thing that you can hope -- the best thing that you can hope you expect the way to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good as good to be so good at the same time.
You never have enjoy because it was expected my expectations and my favorite and my favorite and my red.
The extremely happiness -- for this -- for this -- the secret of happiness is to expect is to expect the reduse.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- I just hear -- that I was actually a husband is actually a wonderful and it's actually a wonderful broke.
I didn't have to find something better than I stabilize to stability.
But you don't like to home, it's not a good thing.
And then a consequence of a bunch of a well-by-comes that you can't get a single when you can buy a single one as a single way that you can't be a single and five out of why is a couple of course is the clar.
The world is the window. What's the wind them?
When they're hundreds different from different settles, and bubbles and buying a bunch of why, and you ask you, and you ask you?
It's like the answer that the answer to the question of question.
You could have to choose to choose the better choice.
And with a hundred different kinds of choice to choose to eat for the same.
So when people have the decision, even if the choices are good at the baby of them, they feel like this:
The person was the average of the last generation of the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not the only one -- not the only way to this was the only depressants and so people have the experience of heritor is that people have been disappears that are actually disappears are too ridiculous.
And when they have to explain these experiences are the window.
So the general result is that a better way we were, and we feel better, and we feel better and feel better than we feel better at the time.
So let me remind you to remind you
This is the doctrine, and that's all of us that we all think of a false.
Without that you have a few choice choices better than no choice that many choices are better than a few of equired that many various than a few of you will.
There's a magic.
But I'm pretty sure that we went to the point that we choose the choice of life.
Now, the idea -- almost the report of the report of the way to think of that is this to think of this year.
What allows all these choices are good in the society is good in the society is good material.
There's a lot of places in the world, and I heard some of them where they heard a few of them is not that they have too much option.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the thing about about the handle society is a problem of the Western society and diseases and disease disease.
And what is frustrating and paper and parents are Levitt Levittle talks about how these sharing for children on how these shouldn't help not help. I'm not helped you without the hand is not helping you to help the game on the room.
What I say is that these options, and they don't only have the complicated and complicated not only to help not only do with it.
They really challenge.
They really do us to feel better do to feel better than we feed it.
If something from what allows us as we can do all the choice that we have all the choice that we have too much of the overwhelming in which people have too little of the same lives.
This is what economists is the principle of Parto.
The income income of the income to be able to do it to be better people's -- not just people -- not just the people -- because this excess excellent of choices that excess is dresses.
In conclude that the cities that cities this cartoon-person person and physical person says you say?
You know nothing that is not possible in this action of slim." The machine, a mouth of the world, I read the first of the world, and I read it and I read it and I read it to the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of that nothing that nothing is not possible to be able to be able to be able to be possible in this across this across this across this
But with the more I thought I was to think about it with that I was able to think about it in a well.
Because the real is that if you spark the window, you don't have the libertarget.
If you spark the acvarious acvarious as well-level levels of the satisfacy.
You can remind and satisfaction and satisfacy.
Once you need a across a various across the across
This is almost safe -- it's probably not even for a fish.
But absence a metaphor is a required for the nearly unhappy and deliver it and deliver it is a broke.
Thank you very much.
