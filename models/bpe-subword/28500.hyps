I showed these two dia-slide to demonstrate these two and the inside of the polar that the most of the polar that the most three million years of the last three million years of the last three million years old, it was a little bit of the great state of 48 percent of the great state with 48 percent of the hands.
But this morning, the morning of this special problems because the problem is that not showed the grosse.
The polar polar is in a way, the heart of a climate system, the climate system.
She was extended and contraction and contract.
The Urupper that I will look at that I will show you that I will be a quick on what was intuned in the last 25 years.

You! Shhhh! She is OK, is the question is the question is if we are going to be fall.
And a reason is that the enormous enormous heroes of the incomes from the northern of the north.
This is a role that all of the anual.
But the volumes are much bigger as that never smoke.

But we start to see a changing to see a change.
Here's the one who have anulated in the last year-old ecological alternative.
Everything that there was a political politics in our own hands.
And the industry the carbonial and the oil was a spot of the dollars in the last year of dollars in the last year of dollars in the last year of dollars in the last year of the last year industry.
The promote case what is a cool oximately oximoron.
This image of memories to anything.
In the Cracium Cracia, at me in Tennessed, a billion stery-stery-stery-brothers.
You probably see at the stird of the stirds.
This is the case of the art of the art of the art of the deversary of the European Stampled in the proper Cracia.
One of the industry recludes of the names of the days, he was this.
Video: She was a blet of the carbon the bottom of the baby of the happy of the flight.
He is from the abundance, here in America, and helped economic economic economic economics.
Frost, the cose, the chab, that is getting more than we go to the course that we go to the track of the day.
He is access and adorable and the workers and the workers of the shadows.
Al Gore: This is the most prisoned in Virginia.
The most of the most degree of carbon the Masssy Coos.
Video: Don Blankens: I want to be clary. I want to be claring. I want Pelose, Harry Reid Reid Reid Reid Reid Reid Rihabar as I talk about what I'm talking about what I'm talking about what I'm talking about the Blankens: Don Blankens: Don Blankens:
Al Gore: So the Alian for the Climate for the Climate of the Climate of the campaign.
This is one of them is one of them in one of them.
Video: The COALergy new climate changes as a very serious characters for our business to do for our business for our business to our business for our business to the business of Video:
That's why our principle, our principles is to spend a great sure of money for the audience that we have to help us to show us and complicated.
The myself, in fact, the books, it's not dirts.
We think it's currently -- and mother's right.
So it's not going to be the climate of climate change.
Latass this in our hands.
Video: The Carb: Carbon the him, you heard about it.
So let's do a team to do a team of this couple of course, the curately currently curately to the curately crazy.
Here's the amazing is a little bit of the names is a crazy.
But this is the sound technology is the sound of the cost of the course of the course of the course of the course of the non-by-broad.
And as the books is one of the principles of the principles of global inwards global trackle of the cost of the cost of the cost of the course of the nice that you see here that you see here that you see here is the change.
So this is the attention, this is this technology is the narratic technology is the currently of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the attention of the attentionative to the attention of attentionatiative.

A plan to put the America, to put the hands, and then make sure sure to help the stopping of global inwards global insecurity.
In the sentence, a very large solution to help us to help us solve our problems.
The American energy energy in the America.
Al Gore: This is the last year.
Video: Narator: It's about re-energy re-energy re-energy re-energy re-energy re-energy.
One of the faster way to include the faster dependent fuel dependent fuel fuel of the planet is here in our planet is here is the sounds of the energy is here in the energy requirement of the energy required in the energy region.
Barbed nr.2: We are investing to create the job.
Narator: The America. It's time for active. It's time for active.
Al Gore: There is a verb a verb verb that says, "If you want to go to walk up, "If you want to go fast, wallows the only one of the only one of the single --
If you want to get to the farmer, walk!
We have to get faster faster fast.
Thank you very much.
The last last year, I did a TED I made a LHC.
And I promised to come and go to a little bit about how it works on how this works.
So the hand-a-a-mother. And the LHC is not the most experiment is the most experiment that was the most experiment -- the Cirumps -- Cirumming -- Cirumms or is to be a fraction of a second to the condition to the ground of the second of the universe -- the millions of times on the ground of the universe -- the million times on the side.
It's extremely ambitious.
This is the apart of the Geneva.
We make photos the photos "Big Bangs" in the inside of the decades.
I work on this one. It's the ATLASS is the ATLAS -- Lung, the Brunning of 22 metry, the diameter of the ATALS photos here the ATALS photos of the ATALS in building to the proportive.
And after 10 seper year, I started the apart for the first time.
And this image was made by ATLAS.
He heard a huge of control in the room in control camera in the room
It's a picture of the first picture of the first particular that the comatory of the inside of the system of the system of the LHC, the couple of LHC, the couple of deliberately deliberately deliberately in the HC desir.
In other words, when I was saying that I wanted to see that image that I was a 10 several of work, which is a huge successful for the success of the challenge.
I don't know that if that first first of the ovative ovative, or that, when somebody went on on the Google and seeing that the first page, and he seemed that the first touch.
It means that I did a culture of cultural impact on the language.
After about a seapart a seapart, I had a problem with the apart, which actually had a problem -- these field -- these field -- these field.
These field was a 13 thousands of both when the machine that the power of power to power to power to power the power of power to power the power of power to power the maximum of the field of the field of the field of the field of the field of the field of the 13 thousands of both horrible transportation of horrible transportation.
Now, the engineering begins in the networks, "I can't transport the attack."
But I can do that when I'm at the temperatures are spoken that is spoken the super-conductor.
So as a 271 degrees of the deliver, the despite of the street of the street of the horrible and those are the couple of the couple of the couple of the crop.
At one of the laws of the people in LHC, was a fabricatic defabricative.
So the comes that the comes to the 13 thousands of both hundreds of both electrics.
This was the result of the result.
This is the more impressing is that the magnetwork, and they have been able to be over 20 tons, and they have been fun.
So we determine the deteriors of the magnetic field of magnetic magnetic field.
We had to get to the hole, which we have to do it and do it.
We recontained it all the time, I repaid.
And now we go back to the streets back in subteran.
The fartif-sea at the end of the LHC will be as new as a new thing.
We will start to go back and waiting us to get to the data or hythm or hythm or hythm to the research to be able to keep the research to be able to keep the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe is the universe is going to go from the tools of the new beyond the wall, we'll go beyond the beginnetworks.
Now, of course, as a way of a sample, those recognize recognize about the important engineering and engineering to the extremely reject.
I think the fact that the fact that is so difficult to be so difficult to be the fact that we have the important experiments like HCHC.
I'll be the inched as a words of the words of a stretched British Davy, I think that I think that I think that I think that the involved in the experiments of the protect of the protect of the progress for the progress of our minds are not the way we have the paper of our minds are not the nature of our minds are not the way we discovery, very nature, as well.
Thank you.
I would like to start with the roughly remember to remember the kidney of kids.
And then you see what you are invented to the ridicates to the ridicates and get them and teacher and teacher and you actually get to the issue and reduce how to figure out how to figure out how to do is and manipulate the spatial relatives.
The space is the profound is the profound is the profound on how we understand a lot of the inconject.
So that we have a research, the IT inspired by this usually inspired by our inspiring objects -- impressultaneously with my collaboratory -- my collaborator -- I started to get a little bit of a -- I started using a computer in this case, in the front of this unless than a mouse that would be able to be able to be able to deal with a couple of a couple of a couple of holds that we can be a maker and something like a massive and information to be a maybe if we can be a maybe to be a maybe to be a maybe rememory.
Daanoman aranjuan?
The question was so fascinating the fascinating that I decided to ascinate the research to build the Siftable.
And then a Sift-figure is a computer is a very large computer.
They can be manufacturing their recivil can perceive the recircle of one altest one of the evidence of a non-radio rits.
The most important is that there are palpable to be the game, so you can just missing them as just as well.
And Siftables a new equires a new equires of a manipulate of digital manipulation of digital information.
And then in the mass that are becoming more palpable to be more constants to be a missing of the other constian of the non-by-by-by-stillions of the instratory of the interactions.
I'll start with a few examples of simplics.
This Sift-figure is configuring video game to predict the video to include in a holding in a hole, the rule of the parts of the part, if the includes.
These common are constatistics are constants one of the alt.
So, if you put them on the other side of the other things, it becomes a little bit of interested in the interest.
If they're conjected to, and they can be able to do that, and they can be confusion.
And I can also feel the miscing and inclining.
We realized that one of the interesting of interacties are involving is that we can use the gestablished to manipulate the gest, like we could be able to culture how we could be able to culture a license a license of a license of a license as a license as one of the interesting of one of the interesting of one of the interesting of the
In the case, we have three Siftables that we have configuring as well-per chasing and the culture of the center in the center in the center in the center in the center of the center of the center of the center of this is going to be both in the case,
If I was too much a lot of the power in the air.
There are also also an interesting interesting interesting education, as a game for education, as well as the mythm of the challenges of the possibility of possibility to see the result of the possibility of the possibility of the result of the results.
So here -- this is a Fibonacibonacial of ectures.
Here we have a game of the words of combining combination of combining up and Boggly.
In the first time, every year a typical tabove a literally every Siftable, and the masss of the mother, they are verify to a dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds of seconds of seconds of the literally square and we able to do a new shape and new possibilities of recognized.
Thank you.
These are the kids who came to the expressive in the Media, and I received to the Media, and we received to move material.
And he loved to the neighborhood.
And one of the interesting interesting of this apply apply apply is that we don't need to give many instructies.
All I have to say, "For a whole thing," and they know what to do.
Here are some of the other people incative people inching it.
This is the most tanar tester in our rights, the game in the right right in the right right now.
It seems like everything that was to do was to take a Siftable.
So for him were just to him.
This is a involved apply apply apply apply apping.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who are learned to the language.
And this is Felix.
He can get new characters in the scene, just on the master of the Siftables that affect the characters.
Here is the so-bon-broads.
Video: You're race.
David Merrill: now he now a traction, he was a traction,
Video: The Tracker common the beginning.
Good goo! Yeah.
And the sable-sable-slide and assessing one can do the characters to interact -- Video: Ham!
DM: I think the narrative.
Video: Okay?
DM: It's a story to the open story of open open, and he decided to opurpose.
Video: Zara, pis!
DM: The last example that I showed you to look at the today is a very instrument and the music and interpreted music and the music and in which Sify is a role and in which Sify sounds like the rules and tobas well.
Every one of these four variative variation is a different choices, you want to use it to use it to use it to use it to use it.
And you can inject the sound of sound in a successful that you can ask that you can do it.
The sounds the sound of sounds the Sift--Siftable Siftable Sift-figuring to successful Sift-figure out the share.
There is the effective that you can control the live in the live and filter.
Here's a certain a certain sounds to inclinical a-inclining it to the a-home.
The process of the general effects like the tempt that the comes that the comes of the square of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of sequences.
Video: Ma: Ma: May names in the second Siftables of successful job, we arrhythm, a series, a lot of brothers, we have a lot of brother.
Now a basic line.
Video: My paintings a little bit of the period.
Video: Mon: Ma: And now I'm going to add the movie, to control the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of Video: Video: Video: MVideo: MVideo: M: MVideo: M: M: MG: M: M: M: M: MG: M: M: M: Ma: Make the movies
Video: Ma: Maybe the inclining of the secsecond inclining in a nor in a part or in a part or in a part or in a part of a part of a part of a nice or in a whole thing.
Video: My movies I would attempt to move the more.
Video: Ma: I can do the section of what is the second time as a section of while
So I don't have to do the planet, I can improvise, month, long ago, the melodia in the work.
Now, in the sfars; I can get inside the page, the second secsection of the Siftable to use the Siftable-volunteers.
Thank you.
As you see, my passion is my passion is the interfaction of our computers that are actually working with the way that works better with the brain that works and our body works and our body is our brains.
And today, I had time to show a new coordination of design that we have a space, and a couple of designs that we try to get out of the possibilities that we try to get out of the lab.
The cost that I would have the retinent is that we are at this new new generates of instrument in this new generatory of interactive instrument with the middle of the digital requirement in our own gulfire in our own rules in our research in our rules of our rules that would be adults.
Thank you very much.
The step, with you to talk to you to talk to you to all the time.
They are writing the writing of it.
He wrote is my own teach, but it's also the attempt to attacks.
It's all my mother and the mother and fascinating.
And I don't go to this is that this is to change the way to change it.
But, the physical bad was a little bit of the average of the bottom and in the bottom of my book, which was my own inside of the work.
And the thing is that I wrote this book, this book, the autobiography of "Manancy, Rool, Rool, Rool, the dependent on the deoshorrible for my book, and he was the important method of the world for a little bit of the world for a sensitive sensitive of the international sensition.
The research is that the original is that people go now, people are going to be condamn.
Serious -- yeah, congamnature.
At example, and the inside of the told and improve is the teama teama team -- you can't depass that you might not be the performance of performance of th?
Do you don't have the track that you will go to write the mostly worse on the shape of the world that would be a book that would be a book on the world that would be a little book on the world?"
It's very links, inder, indeed,
But it was more running if I didn't move to not move to remember 20 years ago, when I was a great deal of people, when I was a great human-like people -- I would like to be able to become a brown of the same in a front of the brown on a kind of reacted on a kind of basic reacted as a kind of like a kind of like a kind of like a kind of like a kind of like a kind of like a kind of like a kind of like a broke of like a brother.
And the people said, "Do you don't know that you have never had to be able to successful part of success?"
Do you don't think that humility to kill the typical things?
Do you don't have the front of the work of the work of life in this field and not going to be there, and you will not ify not the dream of a dream of the dream of a car to a car to the center of the couple of the couple of the bottom of the couple of the couple of the couple of the tools is the front of the work of the inside of the inside of the intop of the intop of you work to be the intop of the inside of the inside of the top of the intop of you in the intop of the intop of the
Sometimes this gender of genes.
The race, the rack -- the rack on the screen is "Does is "Do."
Yes, it is the teams of all of those things.
And it always photograph.
And it is the teams that are funding a lot of other things that people can never involved in the other things that are not intuition.
And as a great example of the big things that are infrastructure.
But when it's a written about written the work that I thought I was a question that I was a question, "Why?"
Is it something rational?
It's the logic as anyone to be so far to be the mountain their works, that they feel like this was pretty much to do it on this Pamant.
And what is so specific specific initiatives that seeming us as a network is really true in a mental way, the way of anature's provide in a way that other teachers don't do it?
Tatal example, was the inch, it was engineering and not remember of the 40 years of the engineering of the chemical engineering to be the question, if somebody else is not a chemistry of the chemistry of the chemist.
I didn't intamed -- John, how do you go to the chemical engineering chemical engineering chemical engineer?
It really doesn't really go back to the samples of something like that.
But to be honest, the engineering engineering as funny that far to the cost of the centuries of the malcoholic maniaco-depression.
We writers have this reached reputation, and we don't just writors, but the artists of all kinds of all sorts of all kinds of all the way, they have this reputable to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to write and our endors of the insands of the insands of insands of insancy writers of the insands of insances,
And everything we do is look at the bottom of the dead of the dead registration of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of young mythm and open, which have died by the young people died and open.
And even the same thing that didn't kill their own own status to be really really really really to be true to be true to the stretch.
Norman Mail, even before the digits, in the last hands, he said that he said, "The Every books a little bit more than my book."
A great main extraordinary about a mountain a life of the mountain the mountain the mountain the mountain the mountain the mountain a handful of a great handful of a great horrible maker shared a great horrible makerness of a great horrible main a great handful of the great mothers.
But we don't even the while we don't have when we hear it on someone day that I heard of the things that we heard about a lot of times and I heard about a complete and suffering and suffering the idea of creative and suffering the art, the idea of the art of the art, and the art is going to be the insight.
And the question I want to add it today to add all of the today is the impact of all of this is: are you with this ide?
You're comfortable with it -- because it is to be like to be a liberal -- I don't mean the hypothese.
I think it's odiodiodiodiodiodia.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to see it and I don't like to see it in the future.
I think it's better if you include us to the artists of artists to live our artist.
And I know that I was sure in my case, in my case, in my handy -- it would be very dangerous for me to me to me to me to me the book for me to the book of this hypothese, especially in the circumanted.
As a tanard, I'm pretty much in the tanara, I just just in the 40 years.
I probably have the four decades like four decades.
And it's really probably the everything that would write the incept to be judgment to be judgment, the mountain my own stream of my last grandmother of my last couple of the last myself, the best of my book, right?
What would be to say to the men, because of the men, because of the people here are the way here are really probably so that we are really probably successful as my most successful to be intamed to be indeed to be dead.
Oh, the Ganda -- the Gand!
This is the gene of gone, which could make somebody to get the brother, and I don't want to get the nine of the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I think about this message to do this message that I love love that I love love to love it.
And then, the question becomes the question?
And so I think that I was a lot of the meditative meditative that manified now, to work now, it's going to keep my home, it's a kind of a psychological buildings a kind of a psychological protective, right?
I have to be a way, to find a way to get a way to the photography a deeply of myself, and my father, and my father absolutely nature, and my father to be able to be now to what I write the brother.
And as I was looking at the last year of the last year model, I started to get to the time in the time I tried to see the time I was trying to see if you could have a better ideas that if they could have more ideas about how people creative people to be able to be able to do the people creative art of the art of the art of the emotional emotional emotional emotional checkey art.
The recircle in Greece and Roma antic Roma antic Roma antic Roma antic Roma antic Roma antic Roma antic Roma Court to be a recirctor this recitttttor this recitor this recircle of this recittttle-up in Greece me in Greection to this move me in Greece me in Greection myself.
So the urban excess of the cycle cycle is inching the couple of the cycle of the cycle.
But in the Greie Grecantly Roma Romantic Rom, and the creative of the income come from the inside of the home, okay?
People thought that creativity was a spirit was a death that can be the inside of a human-source people in a human-source and needed to the strange and needs and neighborhood and neighborhood and unfortunately.
The city call these spiring spiring the creative of creative spiring with the fact with the fact of the father's "demoni."
Socrats was the fact that it has a demon that has a demon that the shadowing in the departs.
The range of the same paper and the name of the creative spirit of creative spirit of the genius of the genius of the genius of the genius of the genius of the hands.
What is the wonderful is wonderful because a romans, they didn't think a genius was a kind of a kind of a little bit quickly ended.
I think a genius was a kind of a genius as a diving, which trading the inside of the wall, the inside of the artist, the hot of the artist, the Dobby, the artist, which is the artists of the mountain the mountain the work, the model of the works.
Absolutely the streets -- this is the distance that I was a desperate of psychological to protect your work.
And everybody knows that that the world work, the right thing that is work?
So the artist, the artist, for example, like for example, a lot of narcism, right?
If you were the mountain the strallow, you couldn't shape the bridge for her, everything that the genius of the genius that helped his way that the genius of helped his own shared to help that helped his mountain the land if you were helped to be the strallowed to the stretch was the strallows to be the stralone.
If you were criticizing was not completely the criticize was the same thing?
Everyone in the world that the genius was the kind of ignorant.
And they look at the West creativity for a long time.
And then he came to the Renast, and everything has changed with a certain the ideas has the great ideas that the great idea of the bird of the universe in the center of all the days and mystering to create the horrible of creatures that they receive the horrible that I recognize to the discover that I was going to come up with the disease of the Renastery and the reates of the ideas has been reating.
It was the human beings beginning to create the rational creativity of creative creativity of the interior of the individual inside the individual of the individual inside the individual of the individual beginning.
And for the first history in history of people begin to one or the other artists of artists like the genius of the artists of the artists of the artists of artists a genius to have a genius to have a genius to the first story.
And you have to make a great heritoring was a huge error of a huge error of it.
Permitage in the botto, to create that he or is actually create the receptance is actually the receptance and the source and the source and the extent of the myth, creative home, creative the inside of the fragile is a little fragile rerunning of the fragile of the fragile of the psychological home.
It's like you to get some of you to get somebody to inghitting a so-like sounds of the soil.
It just just inheritage and deformed the equires of equires all these expectations on the performance.
I think this practices this artists one of the last 500 years.
And if I think is true, and I think is, and I think is, what do is it the question?
Can we do things els?
Maybe we go to the sense of the relationship of the relationship between the brain and the mystery of the creative brain.
It can not.
Maybe we can't just stering 500 years of human mind-rational thinking about a rational discurines in a hundred of a year of 18 minutes.
And it probably as the people in public public that would be the question of the question of the question, the slide of the mastery of the master square in fact, which is actually the people who are recognizing the crops.
I probably not to go to the cooperate on this idea.
But the question I want to put it on a is -- why no?
Why don't we think about it in way?
Because it has a sense of sense that anything that we heard about the explanation of the prices of the creative processes of creative process.
The process that anyone who was trying to create something -- practical -- all the people here -- all of the common -- the behavior is not always the behavior.
And in fact, sometimes can put the deal with the paranormal.
I had a typing where I knew the extraordinary photo, American poeton of Ruth Stone, which now has been the story, and now has been the story, and that was the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of Virginia in Virginia in Virginia and it feel like it in Virginide in the roppping ropp.
The story was like a vantage of the air.
And it turns out the water over the rops.
The synthese, because you are the saming of the paper under the past.
In that moment that is a single thing that is a single thing that is the water and the apatt."
And the alerging as the water to the house, and the third of the home, and the paste of making a piece of making a little bit of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the maker.
Sometimes was not enough to be faster and the alerga and the alerg, but not the way to the house, and she didn't get the root and the poems and she was the broot and his poem, and the poems in the room, a whole bunch of the "All right.
There were also moments in which -- and the part of this -- and the part of the story -- when the story of the story of the losing that almost losing as a losing of the losing of the losing of the pursuit was also the losing point of where they were and the point of where -- and the point of where -- and the point of where -- and the point of which -- -- and the point of -- and the point of life --
Alerga hacacase, and the past and the water and the water and the water and the water and the story of the exactly when it was a horrible and the story of the other mans and the story of the other and the crop.
The first car the coad, and the slide and then in the body, and then in the massh of the map.
So in the situations, the poems of the map of the map of the map of the first couple of the first year at the first of the first year at the first of the first year at the first of the first year at the first of the first situation.
When I heard -- it's the surprising -- it's exactly how the process of creative process of creative process of creative creative.
My creative process is not limited to this -- I'm not leaving this -- I'm not leaving to the point of it.
I'm a way that I work, and the way I worked on the same way I worked on the same and to sit and to send it and to sit and to sit up and I can stand to sit up with the hard to stand to share.
But even though I was indeed to me, even I was so touch that I was attack-drive that the phenomenon.
And I just imagine that they were also a lot of of you.
And I had the projects or ideas that have designed from a sure that I didn't know that I don't know it to hurt it doesn't know it to hythical identific issue.
And what do you have to do this?
And how does it mean that we should be able to do it at it so that we don't lose our mind, you know, because we are the mind of the mind of the anatosy?
For me, the most relevant days, which I have a days, which is the musician that can do is the musician to the Waits, the cartoon the review of the review of revil in the cereview of revidence in the review of revil review of revil reviewed the most relevant to me, the most relevant for the most relevant daily of the days, the most relevant days, the most rele
I was talking about the subject of this is almost all of the artist, the artist, the artist, what including to the artist, to be able to control and figure out and figure out and figure out and figure out the inably inably inably re-inably retyped about the inables of the insans.
The time the time the line of the line line story, and the story of a day as a conducted to Los Angeles Angeles and then everything has changed the way to be changed to be changed to be changed to be changed to the time
While in a time in a fragmen, from a fragmen, from a piece of a piece of the piece of the event and the air, so that they are inspired and the average and a little bit of inspired and a little bit of the spiracy and it has not to be able to be able to be able to do it as a approach.
It doesn't have the floor of the master is not a report.
The only one of the anxiety of the anxiety growing up in interior "To losing the month, and the cancer of the monkey's money.
They're not enough to reach out to read the bad to report it.
And in the paper in the painting, just recognize enough to be over.
He recognized the process of the mental process and we do something we all the new new thing.
He was the watching quite and he said, "Sorry, you don't see that I'm not going to be volunteer?"
"Do you might be writing a cantest a cante?
If you really want to be true to have a little bit more inside a moment in a moment in a moment when I can get to the over.
If you don't really do it, and it to someone else on somebody else today.
To and leave it to the Leonard Cohen."
The trick process to design this changed by this.
Not opera, the surgery, the surgery as intunately.
But the process, and the agname, and the agnamed around his way that he took the point in the moment that he took the spired and the cause of the genius and the cause of the bad that he was not only to be something that I don't have to be something to be something that I don't have to be inforced and Chinese and Chinosis to be something that inside.
It could be this collaboration and bized the bizarre and bizarre and the exterior the exterior the exterior of the exterior that was not too was that the Tom.
And then I heard the story of the story of the way I was worth a little bit of the way I worked and I already had been worth to a data.
This approached me when I was at the middle of the romancy, the Rool, and I was a game of the "Manca, and we have the case in a way that I was a kind of a little bit of a little bit of the book to something that I don't have the right now, it's going to be the most provided to be the most providing that would be the most provided to be the most process to be the most providing to the best process of the book
Not just the progress that the book the book government.
I would think I have to think that I should be able to abandoned to abandoned the project.
And then I remember the Earth, I was talking to the space, and I tried to him.
I was ridicated the view of the manuscripped and I brought a collect of a goal cameras.
I said to the voice of the voice and you say, "The horrid, and I know if you know that if you know that if I know that the book is not just the extraordinary will be the extraordinary will be the very extraordinary will be the bad is not just the same.
Because you can see a little bit like a battle-up to the battled to him, and more than so that I can't hear it.
So if you want to be better, you have to be doing that, you have to do the water and you have to do the extent and you can do the excitement.
OK. And if you don't do that, at the point of it, the standing of all of the tool.
I'll go to write because this is my message to my message to my hands.
And I want to consume for today I did my father as my father and my father remove my head of the work."
Because -- the -- the conclusion is, on the hundred years ago in the hundreds of Africa's handful of North African to shape the monthotic music in the room, and music in the room.
And they were always the minors, because of the dancable and they were remarkable to add and they were remarkable to do it?
But sometimes very rules, something that is really something that is really one of the interpret of the common in the common in the common in the common of the common in the common bears,
I'm convinced you with all of you to know what I mean, because I refer all of the vassed, in a certain a certain the interpretation of interpretation of interpretation.
It's like the time is the time and the dancy is in a kind of shape is in a kind of shadowed by the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other hundreds of the other hundreds of the other hundreds of series are alinias.
In a time it was not the same in the top of the tool.
It's the light and the light and the light of the divinced is the divinced of diving.
And then when they get the time when they were hundreds people standing people who were saying that was and they said to hold name.
And they have the maintains and they were indeed to scannel, "Alllah, the God, God, God, God, God, God, Good gamne."
It's God.
A historical historical historical -- when the Spanish the Spanish the Spanish and the pronounced it was the prontia and the prontia of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, the Allah, the lah, the lah, the history of the interesting history -- the interesting history --
and it holds like in the fight of the fight and dancy and dancy flows.
In Spain, when a interpret interpret and magic interpreted something that the "Allah, the Goll, the arm of the God, the arvoy."
The neighborhood -- a Good of God.
It's the mind, because we need to have something like that.
But the part of the day's body's dad when the dancy of the insusion is and discovered that it's also a training and it's not a slightly and not it's not a slide of Divin.
It's a dirty that the atrane that the dark and they might not be able to be able to be the intimately untime.
Could it nobody wants not even the Domness when he was a room when he was a little bit of the life that they should do with his rest of his life.
It's hard.
It's one of the most painful paintings of creative creative creative creative creative creative in the creative of creative creative.
But it can't be a big chance in even though you don't think if you don't think about the most exciting of the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary of the inside of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interior of the inside.
If you have created if you have created as a typed as a price of catching a few source of source for a few times of the splening to be done in the way from the point of view of the while they were going to be a little bit of the other square cheen.
If we think about this way, we all start to change the way to change it.
I was so high-thinking to think about and so I thought about the last months of the last months of the last months that will be published by the way, a continuous and infrared of my favorite successful and infrastructure.
And what we do, I repeated when you get the current is the course is not the amazing isn't itself.
It doesn't be spiracy. You just go to the Contin, you can get the content to be the parteam, anyone would be
If you are dancy, then dancy, then dancy.
If the genius divin and expected the extraordinary is repair to the extraordinary decision, even for a great clipping through your efortunately, even for a clipping through your effort."
And if no, no, if anything is that anyway.
And with all of these "Ole" for you.
I think about these things and I think we should prevent them to prevent them to prevent them.
"Ole." "Ole," just because you have a lot, because you have a dragot-by-inct and incision, and the inct of participate in the participation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We have a lot of these projects, about some of these projects, and what could we represent new new genomes.
Now it starts from a new point from a new point of viewer: we now try to start to start to start to start to start to go from this code and go to a new flight and fear and fear and typing and shape in a new form of life.
We tried all the time to ask us to ask the questions.
"What is the life life is something that I think many biologists have tried to understand the diverse at the diverse levels.
I tried different approach, similar approach, similar to the component components at the component component
We are the deal with about 20 years.
When I got the genome of the genome, this was the analogy of the analogy of the digital world.
Now we try to ask to ask to ask for the life of our life form or we can create new forms of life, from this universe of digital?
This is the map of a little organism of a genitalist, who has the most most of the genome for a species that can reply the only one species that can reply the only in lab.
We tried to see if we can see if we can come up with a genome and smaller genome and smaller genome and smaller genome.
We reported to the surface of a hundred of the genes in the hundred of the genes in the hundreds of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of the map, it's pretty simple simple to our comparison with our comparison.
Do I think this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can suggest at a moment at a moment is a little bit of the cells that we have a cell.
So we decided that the only way before we actually have to be able to integrate this cromosome, so we can see this cromoss to address the most of the most questions to address the most most questions.
And so we started on the catch, "Can we can set a cromossed cromosing cromos?"
Maybe the chemical allows of these molecules that we didn't do the big that we didn't do the time?
And if yes, we can active?
A cromosomosomosomosomosomome, it's just a chemical pioneeromosome.
So, our speed to digitize of digitize was grown to a rhytherapist.
Our grandmother to write code code code code is moving enough to be great.
The last time he got to a exponential claim.
I started this 15 years.
I went through a few etaphetaphorts, it actually starts to make bio-tech experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult is very difficult to be difficult.
They're days, thousands of car that are doing little little bit.
So we had to create a new methods to put these little method together and little together and the right and track together and the right and all of the herors.
This was our first tentature, the first tenth of the digital information to the digital of the genome of the genome of Phi 174.
It's a little virus that killed the bacteria.
We made the design of the character, we went through the codes of the herors, and we got a molecule molecule molecule 5,000 literally literally far.
The interesting interesting is when I took this piece of chemical material was a chemical material and I put it in bacteria and the bacteria has began to read this code ckrops of the viruse.
The viral diseases were then elify and the elihood of cells and they have killed and they have killed the cells.
I was talking to the oil industry in the current of the currency and they were really clear this model.
They ran more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software where software the maybe building system in a mapping system.
But we wanted to do something bigger to do something bigger
We wanted to build the cromoss of a chromosome.
This is the more than 580,000 literal choices.
So we said to the walls of the little, in the houses of the houses of the houses of the houses of the houses of the houses of a cells that are the component of a cells of a violence of a violence of a violence of a cells to put the wall.
The critical is critically, if you start with the information of the digital information to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly exactly the information has to be very exactly the information is really exactly the inign, the course is the critically, the ign, the critical is is critically, the critical is critical, and if you start with the information is critical, and if you start with
When I set up the first time that we were in 1995, standard in 1995, the precision was a 10,000 per paper in the window of the window in the window of the window of the window of the purchasing of the first sequenced of the first sequency of the first sequence of the first sequence of the first sequence of precisely shared in 199
I found in the rest resonate resequires, 30 herrors. If we were used to be used to be used to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be activated.
And from design design is designing the project that has long 50 literally lost 50 literally at all the other other other countries to build a little bit of 50 literally to build the sub-unknown as the projects that are the little bit of the other things.
We design the elements of tools.
Maybe I put that we put "fle" in the house. Give the house. We have a genetic code in four code code in four liter: A, C, God.
Triplegic -- those literates are the characters of the amino of the amino -- a single character.
So we can use the code of genetic code to write the words, though, of positive position.
The idea that I did was to hear that we were to hear the code.
Some of the girls were not able to be poetry.
We designed the crowd that we can dignature.
They're enzyming them and play them and they to.
So we started doing the piece of purpose to five to 7,000 literally floating them to do it at this point of 24,000 literally challenges in the layer to 7,24,000 literally funded to 7,2000.
And every equip, we have these little bit. We were able to set them could see, but we try to create a process of robbing process -- as you will see a robbband -- as you see in a mind.
We are trying to get to get to the authoring automatically the authoring of automatically automatically
So, this looks like a teren baskets.
When we get very larger at the piece of the paper rates of the basic weapons of the sask in E. cols.
They are all the tools of biology of biology of modern moleculation of modern moleculation of modern moleculation of the modern broad.
So we have the handful of other mechanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the biology that biology that biology that biology to repair the DNA DNA and the DNA and that took the challenges of checken.
This is a example of that.
There is a organism called Deinocock-radiation of radiation that can open the radiation.
As you see in the paper pear in the paper is the destruction of the bottom is destruction.
12 to 24 hours later, he put it out of the land he put it out of the land to start to start to start to begin the beginning.
We have thousands that can do that.
These organisms can be open to be open.
I can live in living in the life of vid.
I am absolutely safe that life can be in space in space is to find a new media to find a new media movie of environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is going to get there.
Here's a micrograph of a molecules that we build these process process -- actually using these mechanisms of the droughly designed with design design with design cropping the piece of the average that we put them together.
Drodia together together with the automatics.
This is not a picture from a microscopy with electrons, but just a photo-micrography of the microphone.
It's so a great molecule molecules we can see a microscope with a microscope of a microscope of mol.
These are the images of collects on a hundred of about six seconds.
This is a public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public publi
These are over 580,000 literal code code code code of genetic code in the genetic code of genetic code
It's the most molecules made of people, with a definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely the definitely definitely the most of the most.
It has a molecule of the molecules of 300 million.
If we have a 14-hundred and no space, 142 pages to practice this code code of genetic code code this code code code code in the code of genetic code a genetic funny of a genetic funny of a funny fun. If a couple of a funny funny fun. If we have a funny funny funny funny and no space.
So, how do we go a cromosomomosom?
The obviously, a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
And you also also be able to be able to get to the eky that we can just get the nuclear and you can just put the nuclear and it's something that you heard about -- clone.
The bacteria archachachachachachachachain cells, but we showed that we can do a completely transplant to a cromosome, and we can make it up.
I pursued a crowd of microbial species of microbial species of microbial species.
These are the second are about as a distance of the distance of the distance of the people and the mistakes.
I added a few genes in the room, we can sell this cromoss for this cromosomome.
We digerated with the enzymed to kill all the proteins.
And it was pretty exciting when we put it in the cells -- you will appreciate our degrees -- and our cromoss -- and the cromoss of cells -- and the cromoss of cell.
In fact, we thought this is how it can they go to the project, but we tried to design something more than we were trying to design something more more.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are also the all kinds of species that have a second cromoss of cromosome, or a third of the field of the field of new cartoons.
So those who think about evolution as a single gene that is just a single moment to a lost of biology.
They're the enzymous restriction, which actually digits, which actually digitize DNNA DNNA DNNA DNNA DNNA
The romosome, which was in cell.
The cells -- cromosis that we put them together.
It was expressed and recognized the other cromoss that material that the street, and so we just recognized with cells of cells with cell.
It became the blue of the genes that we put in cromoss in cromoss that we put them in cromoss in the cromosomome.
And after a very exciting period of time, all the time, all the time, and all of the time, and it was converted in a new species of a new species that we put on a new species in a new species that we put in a new species.
All proteins were changed to be changed by the genetic code -- when the genetic code -- which we transfertilized the code.
This can sound like the alchemical alchemical muture, but we can change the things that we can change the things that we have the enough things that are quite the things that are pretty much the stuff that is the enough to change the things that can change the things that can be change.
Now, I had the broke that is not the genetic -- it's not the genetic -- and a half of the evolution of evolution, and we can do a new version of creating a new version of creating a new version of the massive of the massive design a new species of massive design in the design of the massive design design.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obvious obviously obviously the needs of the needs of the needs of the needs of the needs.
We're the way to go from the six and a half of the million people over 40 years.
And to put this in context for me to me in 1946. I was born in 1946.
There's three people on the planet for each of us that there were four years, they have four years, they will be four years, they will be four years.
We have the problems of the issues of the potable phasing water, drug per and a half billion of the six billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion of the problem.
It will be difficult to do it for us.
We use over five billion tons of the books, more than 30 billion barily barrasses.
This means a hundred million barily days.
When we will try to think about the process or to do biological process that is going to be a challenging challenge to be a challenge.
And then of course, it's all that CO2 at this material, which is the atmosphere.
Now, from our discovers around the world, we have a little bit of the world of genes, we have a different data on the genes, and I like to think about the component of the design of the future.
Industrial electronics has just a paper or so that anything, component and the diversity that came from this.
We are limited here, in the first time, a biological reality and our image and our images.
We have now now the technological technology, the data of these types of smart smart of these genic things, combinatorical combinatory.
We have the ability to build a big robot that make a big robot that are doing a day.
When you think about the processes of these genes are different genes of genes or to try to produce the products of products of products, or products of products, or products, vaccines, we can only change a little bit of our biology to do more biology than the last 20 years, we can change more biology than the last 20 years,
And this is just the standard standard.
We can selection for the substance of substances or fueling chemical chemical production or fuel,
This is a screen that a non-design a design that we work that we work and work we can work and work and work on the computers in computer.
You know, we don't know how to look at how it will look at how it will look at the time.
We know exactly how their genetic code looks like their genetic code.
Now we are now concentrated on the four per per per generation.
You've seen the recent that from the etanthropy.
We have the fuel of the generation of the second generation that will approach that are going to be the slightly bigger fuel that are butterly bigger than the opposite diseases like the octor or killing different kinds of diseases of diseases or fluen.
But the only way we think that the biology can have a major impact of the machine and the flights and the floor is if we start with the limitation is if we start with the CO2 as the first of design to design the project of the project of the generation of the footage of the fuel of the rules of the role in the fuel of the role 18 months.
Liin the disease and CO2 is a myself -- but in our world's discovering the world of other things.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It requires in the ocean, about two kilometers and a half kilometers and a half of the field and a half of the fiery of the fiers.
Transform CO2 in the metan metan molecular energy as a energy as well.
We start to see if we can take the CO2 captured, which can be easy to be able to convert that CO2 back in the pink, and to convert that CO2 back in the fuel.
So one period, we think that we can die that we think we could mean the question that is the question of the question of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the time?"
We really know -- you know -- we have the objective model of the whole industry to the whole industry industry stry.
You're not doing this at TED, where in the other parted?
To be a major energy to most energy to most energy.
But we also work now we do now do these same thing to be able to invent the settled to invent the vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines
You have seen this year, we are always with a year in the minus and a year in minus when it comes to the right thing about the right of vaccine that comes to the right now.
I think the situation can be changed by combining vaccines before combinating.
Here's what it might be able to arrest the future of the future of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the bacteria and finally arguies of the bacteria and finally finally until and finally the end, and finekario.
We are almost to improve people.
Our bird is just to make survive that we have a survival survival to survive enough to survive very much to survive very much.
What I want to show you the more I want to show you a very quickly a new thing, a new technology that I brought to Microsoft as a part of the type of a year.
It's a media that can interact with a place that is a very large amount of visual data with a great deal of information.
We look at a lot at a lot of the giant photos of the pictures and moving on on the perfect of the perfect and moving through this year by that, rearring through this year in the drive of the dors of the drive of the drive of the dory.
Not content at how much information we look at how big we look at the big data or how large are these large are these large images.
Most of the purchair of a room digital camera digital camera from the Bibrary of the Bibrary of the Bibrary of the Bible of the hands.
It doesn't really important, because the only thing that should remember the performance of a skin is the number of the monitor is the number of monitor at a very flight. It's also a very flexible.
This is a book inside the book for a non-image example.
It's about "Cass a paint of Charles Dickens. Every colored a represents a represents a capital of a capital capital.
To give you that it's about that it's about text, and not a image, we can't imagine it, we can do it with really showing that it's a represent of a text; it's not a picture.
Maybe this is a very artificial way to read electronics.
I didn't recommand.
This is a more real. It's a real. It's a "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian of "Gardian
Every imagine represents the beginning of a section,
This is really a really piece of a little bit of a little experience of a requires of a review of a daughter or a daughter, which is inherity-dimensional media a a lot of dimensional environmental media for a very very too.
We did something small collection with this name of this name in "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian
I created a false reclay to a very larger -- much bigger -- much bigger -- and we recorporate a content content -- and I recognize a content.
If you want to see the properties of this machine properties that you can see there.
Or other models, or even specifically specifically and even specifically specifically
And this really really the point from a certain the limitations of a monitor a monitor a monitor in a monitor in a monitor in a monitor in the monitor in this way.
We hope this to be the eliminate of popp-up-hundreds of the gender of the gender of the gender of the gender of the gender of the gender of the gender of the gender of the gender of this --
Of course, the mapping is one of the affect for a technology for a technology for a gene.
I'm not going to sit a long time on this time to tell you that we have contributed to you in this field of this field.
These are all the roads in the United States to a picture of the United States at NASASASA.
Let's go to something else now at something else.
This is actually active on the Internet of the Internet of the hyth.
This is a kind of a very unlikely Photosynth, which together is the two different technologies. Seal is the Seathern of the computer, and the other visual mind of the computer, the computers in the computer, the University of Washington, the desire Universities in Washinging Steve Steve Seitz to the Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Photosyth, and the Photosytosynthood project the Photosynth, and the Photosynthosynth
and Rick Szeliski at Cerced Microsoft. A collaboration of the beautiful collaboration of beautiful work.
So this is active. The Internet. Seak Internet, the Seadragon.
You can see that when we create these perspective, when we think about this kind of perspectives, we can have this kind of experience in many resolution.
But the arrange of space contest contemplate conted.
Algorithms of the perception of the visual registrated these images together, so that they can coreate the space of the great space -- all of these are doing -- all of these Grass -- all of these elements here -- they were done in the Styped or the paintings here have been done in the paintable or paints.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other media.
There are some more spaces that have a lot more space.
I would like to go to one of the original stories of the original settosype of the time -- this is doing part of a Photosynth that I work in the Photosynth that I think is the piece of the technology -- is not the way I think it's not just the vision of this technology is not only the vision that we have the project that we have a projection of the projection that we have a projeculate projection that we have a projection of the idgment of the purpose.
We had to be able to concerns the law of the lawyers of the laws.
This is a Cattack Catch of the Noon Daming Daming Flickr. We have the Docar Flickr. And you find something you hope in the Dam, and you find something you hope in the rocket in the rocket that was actually a picture that was actually a picture that was actually a chasing that the cores. And this is that was actually a picture of this model.
These are the pictures on Flickr, and they were all about.
We can just be able to navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I would be able to work on Microsoft Microsoft is very measure is very exciting to a lot of the first here.
I think that I noticed that there are a lot of traveling room, all the gama cells at the SLR-R-SLR-R-SLR-R-SLR-tech in this environmental media.
If you can find out from this amazing out of these amazing things.
There's so many machines of the shadows, and they are there.
And one of the photography of photography --
This is a poster with us Daming Daming the codes.
You can get the poster to a physical environment to a physical environment.
The idea is that they can do some things with the social media to collected, the data is to collect the world -- from a collective collective corn, the visual of the visual -- and to interconnect them to interconnecting something that is really bigger than the parts of the country that is the bigger than the amount of line that is the bigger than the parts of the country.

And this is not because it would be less than the death and not because it would be less maker.
Watch because I am the preco-based with all kinds of asking the questions "Are we should do now?
Do we should be moved later? I should have last? I should have the kids?" or a kid, or a kid, or a question,
And they will answer to these questions, whether this is to be doing all of the tempt that is not a good news that I don't have a new new new craft of my currency.
And this is what we need to do. These are important questions that have to answer that we need to answer.
The bad -- we're good, as the Carl and Carl and Carl and Carl to work on the planet every single day that allows the planet -- a little bit of the planet -- a little bit of the planet --
Then there is a collection in a collaboration, which I didn't reveal the non-lethal narrative.
I don't tell you about it because I want to use it to use it to be using it.
So this is that this incredible is that this incredible alequires that we have to do with the work, is that we have to make a decision, and if we should be doing a decision, and if we should be working.
We can go to see how our photos of our photbal and we have the mobile and Blackberry in the other lackberry-in the other hands.
And even though all the way we look at every mind where we look at a mechaniss a mechanical mechanical mechanics to answer to this watch the water of the water to this water apar?
Do should answer this email? I should write the circle of this shape of the writing questions is ""No, it's not the experience is not the experience of the football of the way of the football of the best will be very different things.
So the whole thing we look at the great things, and the little things that are really small, and the things that are a stuff of option, the opportunities.
And the world that I was living like this.
And to say that, I had some choices of choices that we were doing it, but not everything was a thing that was a chestra for option.
And the world we live now shows that we live now.
And the question is, so that's goo?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what we all know is that I'm going to talk about what is the bad about what is the bad about what it is.
All these choices have two choices of humans.
One of the effect, it's that products in paralyzed paralyzed by the elite flight.
And so many options that can choose the choices, people can be very difficult to optest anything.
I give you a very significant example, a study of the square of the square of the shadows.
A colleague my colleague has access to the West the investment of the investment of the company to Vanguage that has almost a million of the employment of plants.
And the whole thing is that for every 10 funny mutual mutual landscape, rators, the rate of participants.
And you 50 funny mutual -- they are worth at 10 percent less than if you were going to be more than if you were only five hundreds of hundreds of this?
Because with 50 funny funny mutual of equal choices to choose to choose to choose to choose the choices of choose.
And then on the poorer and then on the spread and on the spread and on the spread and the goes and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course, it never comes to the brother.
You know, this is not just that that doesn't mean that is not just the food of hands, because they don't have enough to be enough to put money to put money to put a decision, that means that the stable decisions is so hard to do that a great decisions that would have done in the funding of the baby of the compensation that would be helped to be the usual of the uses that would be the usely.
The ones of the past, they would like 5,000 dollars a year to 5,000 dollars a year in the parts of the compensation.
So the represent is a consequence when you have too much opportunity.
And I think that the world to look like this.
You really want to take your good decision, if it's for everybody is this?
You don't want to choose the investment of investing or not satisfy or not the soscited to save the wrong.
So this is a check. And if we reach is that if we reach out to be able to recognize the state of the opening choices to be more than we would be a little bit more than we were going to be less than we were a little bit less choices of choices that we were less choices.
And there are a couple of reasons.
One of them is that we have a soshorrible to save a lot of soses that would be a perfect -- and it's not perfect to save it is not the so-called it for saying to hold the slide of the so-called the "butt?
It's easy to imagine that you would have a different aleges that would be a different alternative. And what is that the alternatives you the alternatives you the choices that have been regret to make your choices that have been a regret of the choices that are getting a good decision.
The more option, the option, the more option, the more and regret to regret something that is deadly to the option that you have a choice.
Secondly, what the economists call the opportunity.
Dan Gilber demonstrated in this morning in this morning about how we speak about how we eat the things that we depend on the things that we comparison.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative to be a lot of alternative to be able to imagine is easy to imagine the characteristic characteristics that are doing less and this is doing less and that makes you less and that makes you a little bit of the alese.
Here's a great example. I mean, I don't have the New Yorkess.
But here's what I should raations.
We have here in Hampons.
A very expensive very expensive.
Shhhhundred. They've got to be honest.
What could you want to be more likely to be able to addressed the dracuate of the pulses of the pull of the pulse.
Everybody in my book, my book, are plected.
I could even be part in front of the birth of the week." And the space of the idea that the rates of the idea that the room today, you know, at the point of parts.
The opportunity of opportunity of opportunity that we have a choices that we have the choices that we have the choices.
And the more options of options of cool options to take the characteristics of these characteristics will be perceived by the opportunities like the opens.
Here's another example.
This book the bottom says a lot of things.
We should be telling that we should live the clipping and probably we should do the things beginning.
But one of the things that tells is that whatever is that anyone to be a choices to be doing other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things can have a lot of living and this will do what you do you do you do what you do you do you do you do what you do you do you have less attractive.
The third of the third expanded,
This was when I wanted to replaced my hands.
Portly all the time.
And there was a poor that the broke were a single and they buy them and buy them out of a single and they were incredibly and if they were incredibly uncomfortable and if they were incredibly time and if they were really beginning to stand to stand to stand to stand to stand to stand to stand the best begin to stand to stand to stand to stand and it was a single best and it was a single slower and if you were incredibly time
So I went to the travel to replaced my grandmothers of the old of the old of the old of the old of the old old and I said, "Look at the bottom of the bridge, "Do you want to be the strangers, right?
Do you want to naste or farmer? You want to prespending or floating or hand?
Do you want to be the gus?
You want to add up the rights, bath, bay?
And he painted my father and I said, "I would come up with the guy who said, "I want to be the only kind of the guy who were the only one idea that I spent a horrible idea that I spent all the way of the square and I left the best -- with the best -- with the best -- the best -- with the best -- the best -- with the black that I had the best that I had the best of all of the best and I would be right right right now.
We have good. All of these opinions have made the possible opportunity.
But I felt work.
Why? I wrote a book that I tried to explain this room.
The reason I felt that I felt the more and more of these options are available to be deeply as my square of my good news about how should be a good news of good news great.
I was expected very expected a way. I didn't have a way.
Now when they're 100 sorts of the sorts of the slips, one of them have to be perfect.
And what I got to was good news, but not the perfect of it, but not the perfect of it.
So I comparated what I got to have the thing that I got to wait is that I was defined to the comparison with what I hope was dead in comparison with what I hope was the honest with what I hoped was the one.
The options of options in the lives of the people can do something else than to create the waves of people who have to be able to do how the good people have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be those options.
And this is going to go to less satisfaction to a little satisfaction even if they get good to the results.
No one of the marketings don't know that.
Because if you knew it, I don't have ideas.
The male is more like this.
The reason that everything was worse when everything was worse when everything was worse when everything was the best was the possible was really possible to experiment.
In the today, in the world where we live -- we live -- we live -- we have the degrees of the industrialize -- the best thing that you can hope the best thing that you can hope be so good things.
You never have the surprised because you expected the way, because of my team and my teacher and my research.
The execution -- for this -- for this is come to -- for this secret -- the secret is to wait is to wait is to wait for the reduss.
I want to say -- just a short sport -- that I actually have a -- that we actually have a great husband is really a great husband is really the wonderful right now.
I couldn't have something better. I didn't know something better. I didn't stable to stop it.
But you don't like the houses of the houses of house.
And then a very consequency of a broadcastes that are not coming to buy the bridges that you can't buy a single as you can not buy the question of what a single is a couple of course is the clar.
The world is the content. What's the bad could do that?
When are hundreds different style stiles of different sils and buying a little bit of a little bit of a whole thing, and ask yourself and ask you?
It's as a clear that the answer to the answer to the question.
You could have the choices better.
And you have a different kinds of different kinds of choices at the alege,
So when people have decidecided to make decisions the choices are very good at the tools are feeling the death of them, they are feel bad in there.
The deeply was in the industrialized in the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not the only -- not the only important depressive to the depressive and also the key and also the people who are desperately unrained to be delivered to their standard because the standard of their standard are too ridiculous.
And when you have to explain these experiences are the content of the experience.
So the result of the general result is that a better objective ob, and we feel better.
So let me remind you to remember it.
This is the doctor that we all have a true that we all believe that we all believe it in the whole false.
Without the talking to have a few choices is better than not that many choices are better than a few choices are better than a few choices than a few of the choose.
There is a magical number of magic.
But I'm pretty sure that we went to the point that we went to the point that we have improve our life.
Now, the idea -- we just finally -- we just finally -- the point that is that the thing that is that this is this thing.
What allows all these choices in society in society is good for the material is good for the material is the material is the material of materials.
There is a lot of locations in the world and I heard about some of them where their problems is not that they have too much options.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the thing I do is talk about the chesteck is a character, the modern society and diseases and disease.
And what is frustrating and the top, and the top is this: Steve Levitt talking about how these scaffolding for kids are not help. I'm not help. I'm not help.
What I say is that these options, the option, and complicated and complicated and complicated not only help.
They really challenges are really challenge.
They really do really feel better.
If something from what allows us as our society to do all the choices that we do all the choices that we have to do not just a little bit of the options that are not only good news that the lives of the lives of our lives would be improving to be improve and our lives would be improving in our lives.
This is what economists are called the Partto.
The revenue revenue will be able to do it be better, that will be better -- not just the people -- not just the people -- not just the way that this excess of choices that excess us together.
In conclusion. She's depending on this characters and physics and physicist and you know the sophisticated person says.
You know nothing is not possible in this room is not possible in this room." The Imagineering of the mountain the world -- so I read the first of the world.
But the way I thought I was a more about it so I thought I was so fish.
Because the truth is that if the sparker because it is to be possible to be possible-sliberating.
If you sparing the various various that is possible, the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the sparkening to the sparker that the sparking, if you sparking. If you sparker the varaccess of the various various various various various vari
You remind and satisfaction and satisfacy.
Anyone needs a various various across a various across the various access of a various across the home.
This is almost safe -- I probably really really -- I probably really certainly to us.
But the absence of a metaphor is a requires for inforce and improve to be a bad and I ask myself.
Thank you very much.
