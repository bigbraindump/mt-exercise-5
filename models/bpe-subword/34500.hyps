Thank you very much of it.
The year at TED I did a little bit at LHC.
And I promised to come and give you a data of how it works about how this works.
So here's the home. And the one that was here, LHC is the most experiment is the most experiment that was the most experiment that was recreated by 27 kilometers of 27 miles of Skie, or is the recreating a billion delivers of a billion second-line months to 600 billion times a second billion seconds.
It's extremely ambitious ambitious.
This is the approach, the Geneva.
We do photographs "Big Big Bangs" in the interior decades.
I work on this one. It's called the ASTLASSTLASSSTLASSA French 22 meters a photography of the ATLASTLATLSSS in building in building the ATLSSS in building to the proportion of this TLASSSA to proportion.
On the year 10 seps of the last year, I went back to the first time.
And this picture was done by ATLAS.
He caused a huge chain of control.
It's a picture of the first fasck that the research that the trading system of the system of the system of LHC, the LHC, the LHC deliberath in LHC deliberath in LHC in deliver.
In other words, when I was seen that picked that picture I was sitting on the september of working, which is a huge successful and a huge successful successful successful for a huge successful thing.
I don't know that if I didn't know that the largest ovacuists, or that someone went on Google and seeing the first page.
It means that I did a cultural impact of the impace impact.
After a climate of a paptama peak with the apart, which has been doing with these physical problems -- these fires.
These field of 13 thousands of miximates that the maximum working on power.
Now, the engineering of the engineering and say, "I can't translation to the amper. I'm a myself, I'm a myself."
But I can do that when they're at the temperatures become temperatures the superconductor.
So 271 degree of 271 degree of the space, those decades can translate these field and transport these crowd and these crowd.
At one of the 1,000-long magnets in LHC, was a fabricative.
So the company was inquired a little bit of the 13 thousands of both electrical resistance.
This was the result.
This is more impressive to those magnets of magnetwork, and they deployed about 30 chases of 30 ces.
So we deteriorists of 50 magnets of magnetic magnetism.
We had to take it affair, which I have to do.
I reconnecting it on the top of the top of it.
And now we take the magnetism back in subterms and subteran.
The next to the sllline of the martpharrow of LHC will be like new stuff.
We will go back and go back and take us and get the data and get to the ibrief or hyold, and we will continue to the research to fix the research of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the new elements, and we are going to go back and go back to the new land and we are going to go back to the new way, and we are going to get the data and continue to get the data of the data and continue the data we are we going to go on in the data to be a data to get the data to take the data to be a data and continue and continue the data and continue dataweaponto be the data to be light to be light to be light in the data to be light datdatdated to the data to the data to be the data datort of us long way to be the data
Now, of course, like a sense of a sense of these recognize recognizes and engineering the extreme of the extreme to the extreme to the extreme to the extreme to the next one.
I think that the fact that this is so difficult to the fact that we have a lot of inal experiments like HC. CH. CH. CH. CH.
I will leave the words of a words of a bunch of the Britanic, Humphrey Davy, who I think that the approaches of the experiments of the experiments of the protect of the protect is not more dangerous for the progress of our minds of our minds of the mind-of-the-the-to-types are finishing workings are finishing of our words are finishing our lives are the living of our words are not more, and the listening of our lightened words are the listening words are the living working, and the living words of the liver, like our lies of our words, like our words of our lies of the words of the words of our words of the words of our words of the words of words of the words of the living words
Thank you.
I was going to start with the range to remember the childhood, when you play with the bottom, when you play with the bottom.
And in the mass of what you get them to the kind, and to bring them and teaching them and refer and remain the training and solved how to find how to resolve and removing and removing and the relative relative relative to the spaces of space,
The space, the space is the profound is how we understand how we understand how we inconject.
So that I was a research of IT, inspired by this inspired by this useful of our physical objects -- impressing my collaboratory -- I was trying to get me to the collaboratory -- I was trying to get me to go back to a computer -- I was going to be a computer in the mouth-funny funny funny of the mouth-inspiration of the research of the mouth-inspired, and we can be a mothern of the reambed with a fashim of the main the mammamer and what we could be a mouse could be a mouse and be a baway to be the research of the research of th, and lick of th, and that we can be the mail as if we be cile for a cile of IT chair, I be chair, I be the main that
So how do we want to do it again?
And this was so fascinating the fascinating that I decided to ascinating the answer building Siftable.
In short, a Siftable of interacting a computer of a bisure.
They can be manufactures, they can perceive the recivil and a ran of the one altee of a wide radio and a reless.
The most important is that I am palpable, so you can miss it as you can miss like just as you can just take it from the water and such as it as a mouth.
And Siftables of a new equipment of a new equipment of the digital information of the digital information of the digital information
And in the mass of what these instruments becomes more palpable to do their miscing constantly constantly one of the action of the action of our actissues and determine our active active and destruction to explore new stiles and determines of us of interact.
I will start with some examples of example.
This Siftable is configuring videos of videos in a video direction, if you take the film in a direction of the philosophy in the other side, if you reach the other side.
These interactive plants are constantly one of the other one of the other other one.
So if I put them together a language, it becomes a whole interested in in interest.
If they're concerned is going to be able to become confusion.
I also can feel the missing and inclining and including and including and incline.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of interactive involves is that we can use the babies of the income of the manipulation like I had a culture of a license of how I have a license a license of a license license of a license of a license of a license of involution as a licen
In this case, we have three Siftables as a gallet-baby gallets and use them to be able to use their bodies, where they will move the center in the center of the center where they will amessentially amess.
If I was a lot of it, we can actually be able to be able to achieve it.
There's also interesting in characters for education, like the mathematical camera and logical lives, and the logical challenges of people to give people the results of the results of the results of the results to see the results of the results of the results of the results of the interesting of the possibility of interesting in the way.
So here's a Fibonacy Fibonacial programming program.
Here's a game of the words of combination of combination and Bogger and Bogging and Boggle.
In the first time in every single paper in every Siftable, and on the masslam, and the masss are the verified with a dictionary.
Then, after the 30 seconds of the training is a new set of the literally shape and a new possibility and possibility of research.
Thank you.
These are the nistake in the excurses of Laborator of the Media, and I reused a video and movies a a material and movie a material.
He loved her to the neighborhood.
And one of the interesting thing of this kind of application is that you don't have to give them a lot of instructies.
All rights is "For a word "Fathlete," and they know what to do.
Here are some other people incertainly recancer
This is the most tanar tester in our right in the right right in the right now.
It seems like it was to take a Siftable, and the Siftable.
So it was just a couple of him.
This is an involvey application of animating.
We wanted to build a tool for the people who invent language.
And this is Fellow,
He can introduce new characters in the scene of the Siftables that affluent the characters.
Here's the soil,
Video: The brief is the race.
David Merrill: Now now he got a traction,
Video: The Trace, the portop of the portop.
Go! Yeah! Yeah!
Siftable, and Siftable, and the assetting the alone can do the characters -- Video: Ham!
DM: I think of the narrative of narrative of narrative of the narrative of the narrative of the narrative of the narrative and DM: DM: DM: DM: DM: DM: I think about the narrative and creating their own narrative and creating their own narrative and narrative and narrative and narrative and narrative and narrative
Video: All right.
DM: It's a final story with the final story of open and decades it will open the decades.
Video: Zarara, the sil!
DM: The last example I have time to look at today is a today a today is a beautiful music and interpretation that I built the music and in which Sifables that I built the role of sounds like the rhythm and bas a bunch of the sounds of the baby.
Each one of these different variation has four different variation that you want to use it to use it.
And you can inject the sounds in a success that you can assembled you can assembled the guy that guys you want to do it.
You take the sounds of the sound of the sound of sound of sound of a success of a success of success of success of success of success of success of the sounds of the sounds of the sounds of the sounds of sounds of sounds the sounds of the sounds of sounds the sounds of the sounds the sounds of sounds the sounds of the so
There's the effects that you can control the live and the filter, and the filter.
You know, you attack-a certain sounds and then including it the hell and the help.
Look at the general effects like the tempt and volume the pursuit of the square sequences of sequences of the Shapet of the Het's sequences of the mouthern of the mouthern of the general effects of the general effects of the general effects of the general effects of the general effects of the general effects of the general effect
Video: DM: M: Ma: My Siftables in a second repliftables and arrhythes, I have the longer of a series, I was rhiting longer and rhits.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: DM: My I bring a little percupy of the percutting.
Video: My now I'm going to bring the filter to control the movie control the effect of the movie of the leadership of the landscape.
Video: Ma: Ma: May square including inclining or in a part or in a part or in a part or another.
Video: My now I'm going to attend to move for more,
Video: Ma: I can do the second time as a quantastic second while the amount of time.
So I don't have to do the plan, I can improvise, I can improvise, the months of the melodia in the walks.
Now, in such a same, I can get the top of the second second user of Siftable-volume, included in the stangle.
Thank you.
As I see my passion is creating new interfact of new interfact that the far that are working with the way that the brain that works and the body works and the body and the body and the body is working.
And today, I had to show a new time to this new space, and some of the design of this design, and some of the possibilities that I was trying to take them from the laboratory.
The one that I would like to retiny the retinety is like we are at this new generation of instruments of interacting with the middle of the middle of our world.
Thank you very much.
Astep with you the spring with you too.
I'm writing the writing.
He wrote the book, but it's also my teach, of course, it is more than that.
It's all my mother love and fascinates and fascinating.
And I don't have the astepy thing to do is it always enjoy it.
But these guys that I said, something very small strange of the bathrowed in my life, who had been determined me of my career that I determined me of the work.
And the strange is that I wrote this book, this is the Atobiography of "Manca, Ragain and Iubes," which, who's going to be in the world for the mouthern of the message, and it became the world for a sensor and became this important metho-byble-beller international metho-ball of the Internet.
The reulfather is that the original remote from the parts of the parts of the conditions.
Serio-hermed -- I condamness,
For example, I mean, "You don't have the long is the teama is teama teama is the team, you might be performance you can be performan?
Do you don't have the team is going to go to the light of your life is the slightly created a little bit of a book that you ever have a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of people who ever want to take the world on the world at all?"
It's very linking, in fact, and it's really excited about it.
But it was also more running if I was not my remember now, I was going to be 20 years, when I was began to be a big stream -- like I was a writing bunch of the same reaction of the same reaction of the same reaction of reactive reactive of the same frick of the same frick of the same frick.
And people said, "Do you don't have any more you have never had any more success of success to success the success of success for successfully?"
I don't mean you humility to kill yourself to kill you?
You don't have the fear is the insurance of your life in this field and nothing to do is not going to get the death of the dreams of the dreams of the spot of the crowd of the center of the chain the center of the crowd of the chair?"
Something like that.
The answer -- the answer on the sample on all those questions is "Day."
Yeah, you know, it's the team of all these things.
And it always stop my hand
And the myself is in a lot of other things that people who are not macades.
As for example, and the other big things that are infruit is infruit of things that are infruit
But when it's about written about written about the work, and what I was all asked in the last time is ""Why?"
Is it something rational rational rational?
It's logic like anybody to have the top of the worker that they felt that they felt like the workshowing a lot of work that was a Pamant.
And what is so specific initiatively that seems like that we really seemative in the providing of the providing of the stuff in a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of do?
My thermother, for example, it was engineer and not remember the 40 years of the engineering of the engineering of the chemistics is not a chemist.
It wasn't intampled -- John, how do it goes in the engineering of chemistry of chemistry of chemistry of chemiesels --
It's just not just is not not the same thing.
But we are to be syndromes like group of chemists like the chemists of the reputation of the reputation of the repression.
We write the inner writers of the reputation, but not only writories, but the artists of all kinds of all kinds of the labs of the lab.
And everything we have to look at the number of morning, the number of deadly regions, in the middle of the mind of the mind of creative mythier of creative myself and the same.
And even the same same thing, who didn't even get to the own street the providing providers of your own own own own own providers.
Norman Mail, even in the last dignose, in the last dignose, she said that "Every books a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more and
A great mart-extraordinary march.
But it doesn't machieve when we hear someone days, because I heard that I heard of things so I heard of things and buying and bout of things like creative and suffering the idea of creative and suffering and suffering and suffering and suffering and a little bit of a slightly driving in a bunch of a whole bunch of a suffering in a funny of a southern in a bath.
And the question I want to bring it today to all of all today is here: you're going to do with this idea: Are you with this ide?
You are comfortable to comfortable with it -- because it is the light of the light of the light of the life-impaited.
I think it's odiog.
And I also think it's dangerous and I don't want to go to the future of the future.
I think it's better if you get us to the artists of artists to live of artists.
And I know that I was safety of my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to go out to me to go back to me to me to go back to the carry of this hypothese, especially special history, special history.
As for example, I'm quite a tanara, I just just just a 40 years.
I probably have been like, like four decades.
And it's very likely to be a lot of what I wrote with this moment to be judge as a mountain the money like the mountain the last last money to my own own stre?
What would say to me to say the shares, because all the way of the one here are the kind of best friends -- is very likely to be the largest successful is to be the largest successful to be intamed already to be indeed to be the high horried to say the sampled to say the sample,
Oh, God, what gand!
This is the gender gender that could do somebody to go to the bridge of the nine morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I mean, I want to do this message that I love it.
And then the question becomes indeed, right?
And so I seem to be a lot of meditative, like manified now, to go now, to the way to go through the psychology is a kind of building a kind of building that built a kind of protective, right?
I had to be a sense of a sense of a way of fluid-left line left and my father, the one who written the natural law of what the natural is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a bunch of what it is writing to what it is.
And as I was always that I was in this sense, I started this sense, I started to get the time and trying to see the time I was trying to see if I could have a better ideas and they could have better ideas and the sanatography of how our emotional risk of art people creative are helping people creative creative to be able to do to be helping people creative to be able to be able to do it to be able to do with the art of artists of artee in the last year.
This is the research in Greece and Roma Greece.
So the marriage, you know, the case is inching the case is inchance.
But in the time Great Rome, and Rome, and Rome, and Rome, the management of the human internal inside of the human internal being?
People believe that creativity was a spirit of helps people in a source of people in a source of a source and neighborhood, and needs and needed and neighborhoods and neighborhoods and neighborhoods and neighbors have thought of the creative creative spirit was a creative spirit of creative spirit was a divity of creative spirit of a divity of the creative spirit of the divity of people who had a divity of the creative spirit of the cre
The Great these spirit of creativity, the term of creative spirit with the father's thermal "I demonstrates of the "demoni."
Socrats was failed to the mon that has transmitted the intelligence of the intelligence in the departs.
The relief had the same samples of the creative spirit of creative spirit of creative spirit of the genius.
What is the wonderful is wonderful, because of the romantics were not a genius was a genius was a genius of a person.
I thought of a genius was a kind of a kind of a kind of a magical divince, the tradition to the artist, and the artist, and the Auby, who had the Aubout the artist, who is the assisted of the mountain the worker of the work, the artists of the workshops of the worker of the works.
Absolutely the stralong -- this is the distance, which is the building of the psychology that we talked about your work.
And the everybody knowledge as it work?
So artist was protected by certain things like that, like that, so for example, coremed and too much narcism, right?
If you move your mountain the stralloon, you could not all the worker for her, the everything you have this genius that you have this genius to help the training of the landscape.
If you move your work was criticisms, it wasn't completely completely commity?
The everyone else of the genius was about the ignorance.
And so they looked people in the West creativity for a long time.
And then came up with the Renast, and everything has changed with a certain the idea of the big idea of the mammistake of the universe like the humor and misters, the misters, the mistakers, the mystery of the mystery of the divincing of divince from the divincing of divince from divin.
It was human beginning begins and people began to create the creative of the individual inside of the individual internal internal interior the individual interior of the individual interior of the human beginning beginning of the human beginning beginning to the human beginning beginning to the human beginness beginnetworking, and they begin the humanism.
And for the first one in history, people start to refer one or the other artists of artists like a genius to have a genius to have a genius.
And I have to mean a huge of a huge herror of a huge error herror of a huge error herror herror herror to a thism, and I have to have a huge of martishing heritism, I have to march, I mean, I have to must be a great deal of martish, I think it was a huge herror of a huge, I think that was a huge of a huge of a huge heritism.
The purpose of a simple person to create that or a simple person is actually receptance, and the surgery and the surgery and the source and the mystern, creative a lot of the table of the fourth of the table of the tasks, the human.
It's like you like you to get a few a few of the soil.
And just just to be incovered and deforms of etheless, and gender all these inimaginably inimaginable inimagination on the performance.
I think that the presensus of artists one of the last 500 years.
And if I think is true, and I think that is, what is we do now?
Can we do things else do we do that?
We can go to the sense to the sense of the old sensitive of the brain of the brain and the mystery of the brain and the mystery.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't just stering 500 years of thinking about 500 years of thinking about a rational talks.
And I probably probably think that it would be the audience of assigns of the question of the aspect of the street people predicted people in fact, which is what people predict people predict and sure the people predict and survey in their projects and the right now.
I probably not to cooperate to cooperate on this idea.
But the question I want to put it is -- why don't I mean, why not?
Why don't we think about this in the way?
Because it has sensitive sense of something else I heard in what we heard about the explanation of the creative process of creative process of the creative process of the process of the process of the process of the sense of the sense of the sense of sense of the sense of sense of the sense of a sense of whatever else we heard about as any else of something else as else of whatever we heard about as any else of something else I heard about the whatever we heard of any else of other thing else we heard of any else else else else we heard of the se.
The process that anyone who tried to create something -- practical is all the people here -- I always know that it's not always the behavioral behavior.
And in fact, sometimes can put the right side of the paranormals.
I had a bunch where I met a story where I met the extraordinary poetle, who now has been a 90-year-old people who now has been the poet to be 90 years that was poet to listen to the story of the story of the story of the line in the camp, and it feels a little bit of the camp, and it feel a little beautiful and heart in the camp.
The story of a tung of anting to the air.
And they practical clothes.
The synthesize, because you have the pamants of the page of the page of the page of the page of the page of the page of the paper of the sense of the synthesis the sential sense of the sense of the sense of the income come,
And that point that he has a single thing to do, and that is what it is, "Tay."
And the alerging water to the house and the trage, and the trage, and the past idea was to get a piece of the map of the map of the map of the past, and then when it was a little bit of the painting to paint a map.
Sometimes was not enough to the faster and the alerg, but not the roll, but not the role and the pursuit in the rostool, and it was the poems of the rostood through the camps, a different roots, a different cooks.
They were also in which -- and this is not going to look at this -- moments in which the story of the story of the story of the lost of the lost of the lost of the lost of the lost of the lost of the lost of the points of them.
The other home, the home, and the paper and the water and the water and the water and the water when the story of the exact of the other side, and the story of the other side.
The poems of the coad, and the trage, and the trage, and the masslimits of the mass-transcribed map.
And so in the situation, the poems of the map of the map of the map of the first nose, from the first time at the first thing of the first word at the first word at the first word for the first word of the first word of the situation.
When I heard -- it's supranatural exactly how it works in my own own creative process of creative creative creative process creative process of creative creative creative process of creative creative --
My creative process is not limited to this -- I'm not drive -- I'm not drive!
I'm a catching way, and the way I worked on every day to go and translate the same way and travel and training and training me and travel and trained me with hard and stretched with hard to stop and I am a bunch of a little bit of a catch, and I'm a catching catch, and I'm a catching catch, and I am a little bit of a catching to me and train, and I am a little bit of the slightly and tremen
But even me, I was in indark in my inside, even I was an attending that phenomenon that phenomenon that phenomenon that phenomenon that phenomenon that inside of the phenomenon to me, but even me, even I actually was even indam, but even no, I was even in the indarkness, but I was in the indarkness, even in the indarks, and I was a dary.
And I mean, I was and so many of you were and many of you do.
I had projects and I had projects that came from a source that I was not a hundred of a identified identified ield.
And what do you always have this always this?
And how do I assume that we should report us on the way that we don't lose our minds, and we love our minds, and I love our mind?
For me, the most relevant of our days, which is the musicians that we can do is the musician to do is a couple of years ago, I took a couple of years in the review of the review of the reviewing of the reviewing of the review of the relevant of the most relevant of the most relevant for the most relevant of our relevant days, the most relevant of us in the best way to do is to
I was talking about the subject of the subject of the artist, the entire artist, what the artist, what it is the Chinese inure, what they are able to control these impulse impulatively interiorized these inables impulse of incontrols the completely interiorized inside.
The time I was a long time in the line of landstory, and the story of a day and the Los Angeles and then all the way and then the everything has changed the top of the time and the everything has changed it.
While I leave a short of a short fragment from a broken and the amazing and the amazing and amazing and a little bit of the inspire and a time, it's not like to her, it's not like to her, but it doesn't even how to applyed it to the water.
It doesn't have no foot has no created, it doesn't have created, not reporto.
The only one to send that the neighborhood, and the "I will lose the "I will lose the money to the money to the money for always to always the money for always to always the money for always to always the money to always the feeling to the feeling of the neighborhood,
I'm not a good enough to reach a good enough."
And instead of the pain, just just stopped out.
He stopped the process and made something with all of the new and made a new way.
He was a look at the watching and said, "Sorry, don't see that I'm a volance?"
"I am seems to write a canted?
If you want to really exist, you know, inarily the right point when I can get it back to a moment when I can take me to the broken him.
If you don't don't even anybody else on today.
Tue, you releases it on Leonard Cohen."
The past has creative process has changed that.
Not opera, the operated to be as a such intunnels like that always intunnely.
But the processes in the agnose, and the agnosis the point in the moment that he took the hope that he saved the space of the space of the space of the space of the name and then he had to go back to where he came up with the Chinese and then realized it has to be something so that it has to be something so that they don't have to be a lot of attention.
It could be this collaboration and bization of a conversation of a conversation of a conversation of the exterior the exteriory, which wasn't too much like Tom.
And when I heard the story of the story of the way I was working and already working, and already saved a piece of a data.
This is a lot of addition when I was at the middle of "Manca, Rooll, and Ilove of the Manca, and I was kind of a kind of a kind of despairs that I was working on to do something that I was working on a best deal with a best risk and be the most progrest of you would want to be the one to be the one that the best best broken to the best risk of the book
Not just progress the best short of the book
I was able to think that I should just think I should just be able to abandoned the project.
And I remember the remember of the open and I was trying to recognize and I was trying to do and I was trying to do it.
I was a view of the way on the manuscripping and I brought a collapsed a collection of the cameras.
I said to yourself, "Asculta, and you know that if you know that if this book is not just the extraordinary is not just the extraordinary is not just the window?
Because you can see you see that I put a battle to him, and more than so I can do not get so much more than so can be so much as you can do not stand hall.
So if you want to be better than that, you have to do it with the approach, you have to do the door your door your down.
Okay. And if you don't have that, you know, at all, you know, at all.
And I will write a message because this is my message.
And I want to consign today I did my side side side of my head of my job."
Because -- the Conclue, in hundred years ago in the hundreds of Africa in the Northermal Africa to get people to get the months and the music and music and music and music and music and music in the long slightly in the long race.
And they were always wonder, because they were the professional dancy and they were remarkable to remarkable and remarkable remarkable remarkable and remarkable light?
But sometimes, very rule, and one of the interpret of the interpret of the community of communicate in the community.
I'm convinced that you all take all of the way to what I mean, because everybody is going to see the moment, so that I have a certain interpretation of interpretation of interpretation of interpretation of interpretation of interpretation of interpretation of the interpretation of the words of stories to know that I am convinced that you are convinced that you to know what I was going to be working on what I was going to go to the whole thing to
It's like the time is stopping and dancy and dancy is a kind of dancing dancy not anything else is done nothing is different, in the other hands.
In a time, it seems to be in the top of the trucks.
It's lighted from interior and light is the divinced of the divinced of the divinced of the divinced of the divinced of the divinced of light.
As when they were intamples when they were standing what was the namples were saying name.
They were mass and the maintains and the baths, "Allah, Allah, Alllah, Alland, Doamn, Dogamn, Dog, Does Dogamn, Dogamn,
It's God.
A historical historical historical historical historical and the Spanish and the pronunced with this century has been been the pronunced in "Oly" in "Oly" in "Ole, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Alle, "Oly."
and they hear the time in fighting the time with the flowers, the flowers.
In Spain, when a interpret interpret and the magic and the magic and the magic of "Allah, the landscape, the arm of the arm of the arm of the arm of the arm of the Spain, the arm."
The intelligence -- a God, a God.
It's wonderful, because we need to have something like that.
But the part of the next day comes to the next day when the insuspect of the insush is the great discoveries of 11 dancy and not a lipiece of Divin.
It's a diritor who are dangerous disease and drive and dors it could be the intimately.
You might be a couple of not only the name of the name of the name of the name of the name of his life that I should have a with the restor?
It's hard.
It's one of the longest acceptors of creative lives.
But it can't be a big kinds of course, if you don't think about the inceive of the most extraordinary parties of the most extraordinary part of your mind.
You can just create if you create that was just like you were impromised by a few source of a few moments for a few moments for a few moments of the next time that when you get the data from the time when the story, when the baby stood to be inside of the books.
If we think about this way, we all start to change the way that it is happening to change it.
I was so much like I started thinking about how I thought of this is a sure in the last months of the last months that will be published excess of the long excess of the excess of the muscles and infruit of my muscle.
And what I was doing, I repeated when you lose the courage is not the courage of the courage is not the theater.
It doesn't be the sperature. I just want to do the Continual Count to the continy of the continy of the one is it.
If you are dance, then dance, then dancy
If the genius divine and excess is repair and the censor the decades, and it is the extraordinary to your extraordinary equires your efforts and "Ole."
And if you not, dancing anything.
And with all of the "Ole."
I think these things and I think I should predam.
"Ole." "Ole" for you, just because you have a love and the inability to humanity and incapatancing and inability to participate in continuation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I talked about some of these projects, about some of these husband what it could represent new genomes of genome.
Now in fact, in fact, from a new point: we digitized biology, and now we're trying to start this code from this coddriving from this code and pursuing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing and synthesizing forward.
I tried to ask questions to ask questions.
"What is life life is a lot of biologists were trying to understand the biologists of different biologists of the levels.
I tried to different approach, simple approaching the components of the basic components of the basic components of the basic components of the landscape.
We already have already been 20 years.
When I sequenced the genome, this was the analogy of the world of the digital world.
Now we try to ask question: Can we can regenerate new form of life form of life force?
This is the map of a mice, Mycoplasma genome, which has the most most most of the most most of a species that can reply the laboratory.
We tried to see if we can come with a genome.
We had been able to suddenly the order of a hundred of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of the metabolic metabolic in comparison with us to us.
For me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can suggest at a moment at a moment of the moment, it's a little bit of a cell.
So I decided that the only way before we actually have this is to interested in this cromosome, so we can see the components to adress the most fundamental components in the most fundamental questions.
And so I started on the road, "Can we synthesiza cromoss?"
Maybe the chemistry of these molecules that I had ever ever ever done more larger we ever ever ever did ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever be?
And if you take a chromosome?
A cromoss, by the way, it's just a piece of chemical.
So our speed speed to a digitize of life has grown to a rhystage.
Our grandmothers to write code code and movements but it grows a little bit of the movement.
The last time has got to a cloud to a cloud exponential currently closer to a closer in the last time.
I started this is 15 years.
I went through a few ethapies, in fact, with a bunch of bio-ethical examples.
But it turns out that the synthesization is very difficult to be very difficult.
They're days, thousands of machine that are doing small pieces of DNA 10-letter, but it's a process of 10-letter, so why you build a long longer piece of longer piece of herrors longer piece of machines of machines of machines of machiners.
So we had to create a new methods to put these little pieces together and coreaching all the way and coreaching all the herrors.
This was the first tenth of information from information to information from the information of the digital sense of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the 174.
It's a little virus that humans bacteria.
We did design design, I went through the corectleck through the herrors, and I got a molecule molecule molecules of 5,000 literally literally just 5,000 literally literally in the gun.
The interesting interesting in came when I took this piece of chemical material and I put it in bacteria and I put it in the bacteria began to read the viruses of the viruses of the viruses of the viruses of the viruse.
The viral disorders were released and released and returned out the cells and human-collapsed cells.
I was talking to the oil industry and saying that I was such a clear that I was really clear this model.
They laughter than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software in which the software in a system in a system in a system.
But we wanted to do something larger things.
We wanted to build the entire cromoss of a bacteria.
This is 180,000 literally code of code code code of genetics.
So I said, "We were to put the walls in the housing of the size of the size of the housing of the houses of the houses of the houses of a cells of a cellular cells of a cell.
The deal is critically, and if you start with information of the digital information has to be very exactly that information has to be very exactly the exactly exactly the exactly exactly the exactly exactly the exactly the exactly the criticism is criticism is criticism is critically, the critically, and if you start with the information is critically, the digitically, the digital, and if you start with
When I was seen the first sequence in 1995, the standard of a price of a 10,000 walls of a wall of the wall.
I found it, I was in the next step, 30 herrors. If we were used to be used sequence the original sequence would have never been activated.
The design is designing of the projector that has been 50 little, which has to 50 literally have to 50 literally gone with all the other broken to build the sub-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-by-projects of the physical projects of the projects of the projects of the project is the project is the project of 50
We projects one.
You can read the "watermarket." The "watermarket." The deep one of this: we have a genetic code from the fourth C, C, C, G, and T.
Thrings of those letters -- those letters -- those letters of collapse -- a single amino anti-an-an-an-acid.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, though, and thinking.
The point we did was to hear the codition of the codnke.
Some people were deeply disappearing that it's not a poetry.
I designed those pieces so that we can diggate them with enzymes.
I'm enzymes that are going to get them and stopped them.
So we started doing the piece of the piece of five to 7,000 literally fashion these 1,000 literally literally to do the bunch of 1,000 literally literally games of the laws of the lawyer and then put 2000.
And every ethapies, we had these chargument in the abundance of the abundance, but we try to create a process process -- as you see a mine.
We try to get to the authoritories of authomatized automatically automatics.
So this looks like a basketle.
When we get to the market in 100,000 per per per per per per in E. collapsed in Earth's collapse.
They are slightly all the tools of the moleculation of modern moleculation of modern moleculation of modern moleculation of modern.
So we got to other mechanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the reward mechanism that biology that is using DNA to reply DNA and that took the characters.
This is a example.
There's a couple of an organism called Deinococcus of radiation that can be a millions of radiation rty range of radiation of radiation of radiation of radiation of radiation of rolling of a range of a rule of a role of Deinogy called Deinogs called Deinogs a namism called Deinog.
As you see in the paint of it, the cromosis of his chromosome in the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the comosmic panels of the panels of the panels of the panels of the panels of the panels of the panels of the panely, and you see in the panel, in the panel,
12 hours to 24 hours to the late of the late slamped it was to begin the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be drawn as a total.
I can live in living in the lives.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the extra new space of extraters, to find a new media movement.
In fact, NASA shower was happening there.
Here's a micrograph micrography of a molecules that we build these process process of the mechanisms of the adecades with the design of the aths I put the markets of the ath.
The rule together they put together.
This is not a picture of a microscope with electronics, just a photography of micrography of micrography of the micrograph.
It's so a big molecule, so we can see a microscope with a microscope of microscooptical microscooptical microscope of microscope of a microscope of a molecule of a big molecule molecule molecule, and it's so a big molecule of a big molecule molecule of a big molecule of a big m
These are images of collecting over a couple of about six seconds.
This is a public public public public public public public public public time.
These are over 580,000 literally choice code of genetics.
It's the largest molecules of people, with a definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely the largest structure.
It has a molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular
If we have a 14-hundred and without space, 142 pages this code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code of a genetics.
So how do we go a cromosom? How do I active?
The obviously, a pretty easy is to be very easily.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
And it's also easier when you get to the ekilarly, you can just take the nuclear and put the nucle's and put it together and put it on the cloneless of the clone.
And we have archachahahaha, but we show in the cellule, but we showed that we can do a completely transplant that we can do a completely transplant to a cell.
I pursued a crozman, the microbial species.
These are the second are about as a distance, and the mouth-distances.
I added a few genes of genes in this room for this cromoss for this crome.
I digerated him with enzymes to humans.
And it was pretty amazing it in the cells of the cells of the water -- and our chromosomes -- and the chromosomed cells.
In fact, we thought that this is how far can go out and designed to design a project of something more far away.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are all kinds of species that have been a second chromosome, or a second romosome, or a new species, thousands of new caracteristic disease, thousands of new characteristics in a second.
So the people who think about evolution is just like a single gene of a single moment has lost a lot of biology.
I'm enzymes, called the restriction, which actually digers, which actually digernal digers.
The Cromosome, which was not in the cell.
The cellular cells that we put it on the --
It was expressed and recognized the other chromosomed material, and so I got the chromosome, and so I got the new cell.
It became the blue of the genes that we put in the croom.
And after a very short time, all the time, all of the time, and all the characteristics of a new species of a new species, and the software that I put on the software that I put in in cell.
All protein has been changed the membranes were changed -- when we recognized code exactly what we transfer transfer is exactly what we turned on the exact of what we have was transfer all of the protein in all the protein in all the proteins were all changed proteins, all the proteins, and all the proteins were changing, the remote remarkable and change, the remote change,
That can sound like alchemistry of genome, but we can change the software to change the things pretty much quite dramatic.
Now, I had been susped that this is not genesis built three billion years and a half billion years and a half billion years and a new version of the Cambrief a new version of the Cambrief of Cambrief a new species of massive species, in which which it has been on design on design on design design.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty obvious from the point of view of needs of needs to be needed to be needed to be needed to be a needed of the newspaper of the point of view is pretty much of the obvious point of view is pretty much of the obvious point of obvious point of view of the obvious point of view of view in the point of view of view of view of the point of view of the needs of the needed.
We are on the way to go from six and a half billions of people over 40 years.
To put this in context for me in the context of me in 1946.
They're three people on the planet for each one of us in 1940s, they will be four years, they will be four years, they will be four years, they will be four years.
We have the problems of the issue of water potable, drugs, drugs, drugs, the flight six billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billions of the six billions of the problem.
It will be difficult to do it for us to do it.
We use 15 billion tons of tones of carried bon of oils of oil oil oil oil oil oil oils
This is a hundred million barily barily barily barily barily barily of barily barily of a young barily hundred million barrass' hundred million bars of a hundred hundreds of millions of the hundred hundred hundred hundred hundred hundreds of million barily a day.
When we will try to think about the process or any challenge process that this is going to be a challenging challenge, it will be a challenge.
Then, of course, is that CO2 from this material, which is that the atmosphere.
Now, from our discoveries around the world, we have a data of 20 million genes, and I like to think about 20 million designs like the design of the design of the future.
The electronic industries just a pain, or so that the diversity of components that came out of this.
We are limited here, you know, a real biological reality and a real biological reality.
We have now now now this technology again these kinds of synthesize, to do what we call the genic combinatoric combinatory.
We have the ability to build a big robot that makes a million crooms a day.
When you think about these 20 million different genes of genes of genes and try to optimize process to produce products process to produce the product of our ancestors, just a small team, we can change a small team, just to do a little bit of the last 20 years, just to do more biology than the last 20 years of science.
And this is just the samples of standard.
We can selection for viability, production or chemical production or fuels or fuels of vaccines, and it is a chemicals something.
This is a screen crowd of a software designing of design that we work and work and work and work and work and work on these species in computers in the computers in the computers in the computers of the species of the computers in the computers of the equy of the equire of the equire of the equal screen a screen sample of equipper and a fear of equal een shape of a bridge of the ef of the ef of the
You know, we don't know how it will it look like it will look at it.
We know how they look like their genetics.
Now we concentrate in the fuel of four generation.
You saw the recent that from the trumb is just a bunch of an awesome.
We have the fuels of the second generation that are going to get the third of the third fuel, which are the amazing fuels of diseases like the octanol.
But the only way we think that the only way we think biology can have a lot of the most costs and the limitations of the limitations of the limitation is if we start with CO2 meters as we start with the first generation of the first generation of the first generation of generation to this screen in about the fourth of the fueling 18 months.
The light and CO2 is a machine -- but in our discoveries around the world's discoveries of other ways we have all kinds of other ways all kinds of other ways kinds of other ways kinds of the world.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
She lives in the deep deep in the ocean, about two kilometers and a half of the couple of the farmers of fiers, the temperatures.
Transform CO2 in metan use hydrogen molecular as energy.
We try to see if we can take the CO2 capture, which can be able to be able to convert that CO2 back in the country, and to lead this process of the CO2 back in the fuel.
So in a short time, we believe that we think we could discover the question of the question of the question of the question of life life life life life for?"
We really know -- we have the objective models of the entire industry of industry of the entire industry of the chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical objective chemicals are really true, you know, we really know; we really knowledge -- we have the objective objective objective obective objective obective objective objective objective objective of the entire of the entire of the entire industry of the entire of the entire of the entire of the entire industry of the
Yeah. If you don't do this at TED, where in another parted?
Let's becoming a sure of energy of energy of energy.
But we also work now is to use these same source to invent vaccines for vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines we also work in the same way we also work with these same things, we also work to use these same things, we also work to use these these same survey works, we are doing these these same source now to inventing these same sourselves to invent now these same surveilly.
You see, this year, we always have a year with a year and a dollar and a dollar to the right light of the right speaker when it comes to the right now.
I think the situation can be changed vaccines before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before I think the situation of the situation of the situation can be changed the situation can be changed by the situation can be changed to change the situation can be changing the situation can be changing the situation of building vaccines before the before before before before before the before before the before before before before the before the before before before before the before
And this is how could it look at the future of the future changing arbores, accelerating evolution with the bacteria of the excitement of the excited -- and finally, the arch, and finally, the akario.
We are almost to improve people.
Our biggest is just to make survive that we have a chance to survive a quarter of survival to survive very much of you could do that. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you a long, very quickly, is a fundamental working, a new technology that I brought to Microsoft Microsoft a year. This is Seadrago. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon.
It's a local media that can interact with a high amount of data with a big data.
We look at a lot at many gigables of photography and slightly on the perfect, the arancing arranging through this one, rearranging it through this lot.
Not conteams as much information we look at how much information are these big images are these big images are the images of the large images.
Most of the photography picture, but this is a camera of the traditional camera from the Bibrary to Bibrary to 300 megapixels.
It doesn't important, because the only thing that should limit the performance of a system of the limits of your monitor the limits of your monitors of your monitor at a very flexible.
This is a book of a non-imagine example, a non-imaging.
It's about "The "Shie" of Charles Dickens. Every God. Each Dickens.
For example, that it's about text, and not imagine a picture of the text, we can do it really do that it's a representation of a text; it's a representation of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of you a picture of you a picture of you to you a picture of you to you the text, and you can do it to you look at you, and it's about the text, and it's not a picture of you can do it this so much of you can do it to look at this and do it something like that.
Maybe this is a way of read artificial in the shape of the electronic books.
I didn't want to recommand.
This is a more, it's a lot of real edian edian edian edian edian "Garance.
Each imagine represents a section of a sectionary sections.
This is really a really straightforward a loag of a version of the version of a review of a review of a review of a lot of dimensional media a lot of dimensional environment.
We did something small collection with this number of this number of "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian of "Garanulation.
I created a clamb of a false of a very larger than anything -- and I was a very larger -- and I remember a content content content of a content content of a content content of a content content of a content clamammed of a false clamammed a false clamamammed of a false clamamong the samplement clamammed of a very larger than anything in a very larger than anything -- and we have a very larger than any longer than any content remore.
If you want to see the properties of this machines, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specifications of technology.
And this is actually from certain ideas, the limitations of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of the monitor of the monitor of the limits.
We hope that this is the releasing pop-up-to-broken mizers, which are not necessarily -- which are not necessarily -- which are not necessary.
And of course, the maps is one of the evidence of the evidence of this gender technology for a gender technology of this gene.
I won't sit on this long time, just to tell you that we have a contributed to this contribute to this field.
These are all the way of the United States in the United States from a NASASASASA.
Let's go to something else.
This is actually active active active active active now.
This is a non-crowd project that together. One of the technology of the different technology is Seadragon and the other research of the research of the visual research of the visual identical research, the University of Washington Washington at U.Washington at U.Washington at U.Wash. Wash. Wash.
and Rick Szelki in Crecetation of Microsoft. A collaboration collaboration of Mick collaboration of Mick collaboration of Mick Szelissy Szelissy Szeliski Szeliski Szeliski ki Szeliski ki ki Szelki Szelki in Crecetor to Crecetart's Mick Szelki ki in Crecetarr.
So this is active active active active because of Seautiful because Seadragon.

And so, I think, it's so good in our system, that it would never go through our system that it would never go through the house to put it in the house to put it to the house in the house to the hythes, I mean, I think it's so well, I think it's so good at the time, I think it's so good that it's so good so well that it's so good good that it's so good so well it so well.
And it's deep the implement implement in our lives lives.
I'm going to give you some examples of what has made for us down,
This is a supermarket. It's not a very large.
I want to say two words about two words for the samples for saving the samples for saving the same.
175 sils for the hundred of my house and the 10,000 different kinds of measurements of meters and the 12 eets and the 12 eets of the 12 eth-ethy car in a very large number of their own own countries that you can buy the case of 175 that one of the 175 that one of the 175 that one of the 175 degrees that you can do it.
So it's the supermarket.
And then you go to the store electronents to configuration system -- CDD system, CDD system, CDD -- the house, the housing of the housing of the housing of the housing of the house.
And in this stories of electronents are a bunch of electronic systems.
We can configuring millions of and a half million parts, a different different stereotypes that are in the magazine.
You have to recognize that this means a lot of optises.
In other domains -- in the world's communication.
There was a poor, when I was a child, when I was a child, you can get any kind of service your phonic phonic tells the Ma Bell.
The crowd phone.
The poored, one of the consequences of this was not that the phone is the street the phone is the street the phone is the street the phone is the street of the same thing.
And those days are delong as a lot of water.
Now, we have a diversity diversity of phone, especially in the world telephones of mobilized phones.
These are the mobilized mobilizes of the future.
My is the middle is the middle -- with MP3 player in the nose of the nas and science and science and the chairs of the art.
And if you don't have it seen you saw it in the store you can get the line that in the line that you can see it in the room.
And the result is that it does people to put it in the store, and ask this question.
And you know what the answer to the question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to buy a lot of brief a lot of things.
And in other domains of life that are much more important than buying the bridge of the growth of the number of options.
The sanitary history -- in the United States is not to do you get to doctor and this is what to doctor and this is what to doctor to doctor.
Instead, you go to the doctor, and this is saying your variantage and variantage and variantage of B.
He has these rejects and these risks.
Do these relief remote and these risks, what do you want to do?
And you say, "Doctop, "Doctop, he has said to me, and these risks, and the risks, and the risks, and the risks, and the risks.
What do you want to do?
And you say, "But if you were in my place, what do you doctor doctor doctor says, "But I'm not in your own place." And I'm not in your patient." And what I say to the patient's benefit to be a benefit to a benefit to a benefit to a benefit to the benefit to the "But if you were in my job.
But what is actually a transition is a responsibility and decisions and decisions that knows something -- in the case of somebody who knows something that doesn't know anything that is not almost sure and it's almost sure of the best shape, and it's almost sure of the patient decisions -- in the patient of this patient.
There's a level of public medicine for the medicine for the medicine for the relief and like me, and like me, and you know, if you think about a logical logics, because we don't have a logics of us.
Why are they bring new public public public public if we can't buy them up?
The answer is that the people who do this is expecting to sound the next morning, and we have the next morning, and ask them to change our next to change our ethers.
Something that our identity has become a choice problem is a choice of the role of this role of showing this has been able to show this has been to show that.
We don't shape a identity of an identity inventing possibility to an inventor.
And we can reinvent us to reinvent us anything we have cheap.
And that means you have to decide when you get to hotter what you want to be a person to be a person to be a person to be a person to be the person to be the kind of person who you want to be a bunch of every day you want to be a day when you get you to every day you get you to every day when you go to every day when you go in every day you have to go to every day when you go to the paste you have to decide you have to deci
And the next to the travel for the training and family was a poor the family that the pursuing that the porness of everyone was that I had to get you to the travel to have kids like to have kids like to have kids like to have kids like to have kids like faster than you can begin to the track of the training for the track for the truck for the track for the training for the training
The only option was with five out with five when you do it after that you will do it after that.
Our days, we all are very excited about the inside of the road.
I put the incredibly students of intelligence and give them a little bit less than 20 percent less than I did not.
And this is not because it would be less than it would be less than it would be less the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of not because it would not be less than it was not less than it was less than it would not be less than it would be less than it would be less than it would be less than it would be less less than it would be less less less than it would be less less than it would
You know, because I'm precaught with all kinds of questions I should be a travel or not? I should do now? I should do now?
I should be a traveling later I should have me? I should have mean? I had to me?" All the questions that are the questions that are the questions that you are questions that you are questions that you are the questions of myself,
And they want to answer these questions, if this is not all of the tempts that they want to do a good noise and not a new new bad notes to my current collection to the course of these things are going to be a good newspapers,
And this is what we have to do is important, these important questions that you have to answers.
The best -- we're black and the southern and Carl with technology that allows us to work in every mind of every living in every mine, a little bit of every single place on the planet -- less than the planet of the Randold's planet.
There's a collection in a collect, which I didn't revealed it reveals, where the wireless works, where the wireless works.
I don't tell you about it because I want to use it to me.
So this incredible means that this incredible libertypes that we have in the work, is that we have to do a decision, is that we have to do a decision, and if you should be working.
We can go to see how our clothing our photbbal and we have the mobility and Blackberry in a bunch and Blackberry and the other laptop, probably the genes.
And even though all the prison in every minute we look at the mutily of the mechanists of the mechanics we should answer "Are water?
I should say to this email? I should write the circle of this screen is not a chance to ask is not the answer is not a different story, is not a different sample of the football of your mechanics will be very different without different without different without there.
So where we look at where we look at and small objects and small objects that are a living stuff is a stuff.
And the world that I was showed about it.
So I was to say that, I had some choice a choice of down, but it wasn't all a stuff.
And the world we live now is what we live like this.
And the question is, this is good or bad?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what we all know is a good at that, so I'm going to talk about what the broken is the bad.
All these choices have two effects of people.
One of the effect, is that produce, is that produce produce, is that produce produce than the iberation.
And so many options that can choose to their choices, people seem very difficult to optest something.
I give you a very significant example, a study of the investment of the penses of the penses of the penses of private plants in the plans of the investment.
A coleding my colethy had access to the data from the World Wanguagement of the mutual mutual mutual and almost 2,000 sequences and almost 2,000 sedience and almost 2,000 sedience and 2,000 sedids.
And what it looked like every 10 10-mutual mutual lutual landscape, the rate of participation that the land with two percent of the landscape.
You know, 10-funny funny mutual -- you know, if you get a little bit less you get the help. Why?
Because with 50 fond-funding mutual of the mutual choices of choice to choose to choose to choose you have a lay to choose.
And then on the poorest and then on the hoods and on the spread and on the spread and of course, and of course, and of course, the same, and of course comes to be coming to be coming out.
You know, this is not just that those people are going to consume that those people will consume because they didn't have money to get money to put money to put money to put a decision of a decision that the stable of a decision, that is so hard to the sample of money in the funding of the limits of the limits of the limits of the landscape.
The lawyer, they give them to 5,000 dollars a year of the long side of the language, which would pay the hell of compensation.
So the brain is a consequence when you have too much options.
And I think that the world to look like this.
You really want to take your decision if it's for the best of the grandmother, right?
You don't want to choose the investment of investigate or the soscar or the soscar for saving the mistake.
So this is a second effect. So we can do it and if we succeeded the reliable state of the training choices and do a little bit more and make a little bit more of the choice than we were had a little bit more of the choice of choice than we were able to have a little bit more options of options of choose to choose the choose.
And there are a few reasons for that.
One of them is that we have a bunch of silence that to the save of a bunch and it's not a perfect -- and it's not a perfect of the so-on is not the slight?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better choice that alternative that alternative images that you have an image that you have an image that you have been able to imagine the regret of choices that you get the attention that you get a decision, and these are a decision.
The more options, the more options, the more successful and regret to regret in the option of the option that you choose the option that you have a choice that you have a choice that you have a lot of the option that you have a lot of the option of option you have more options, the more option of the options, the more options, the more options, with the more option of the options, the more successful options, the more success of the option of you have a lot of the bathrother,
Secondly, what economists call the opportunity.
Dan Gilber of process in this morning, I was talking about how we evaluate the way we depend on what we eat the way with what we comparison what we do.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative to take a lot of alternative to imagine is easily to imagine the attractive attracts of alternative alternative and this is doing a little bit of alternative and this is going to make a little bit of choices that have changed.
Here's a example. I mean, I am New Yorkese.
But here's how I should should rather than we should recognize it.
We have here here is this couple.
A very expensive properties.
They were a superbeautiful day they had to be hundred of them.
What could I want to want to do you want to think about the dracuis: "It's cool, "It's hold.
Everybody in Manhattan are plenty of Manhattan are plected.
I could actually park in front of the office." And the space of two weeks ago, the idea that the rats of the idea that the dancy of the landscape.
The over-store-scales of satisfaction that we have choices of choices actually have the choices.
And the more options of options of taking options in the pursuit of the attracts of these options of opportunity to be perceived as we are going to be perceived as a costs of opportunity.
Here's another example.
This book says a lot of stuff.
We say that we should be lipped and probably we probably should do the things begin to do begin the slow.
But one of the things that tells you is that while you have a choose choose to do not do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things can have a lot of people who are doing what you do, and this is going to do what you do.
The third one, the extension of extension of extension.
That was that when I wanted to replace my blugegee to replace my blugees.
I just ask the time.
And there was a poor where the broken and buy it was a single and buy them and they were buying you like the love and they were incredibly comfortable, and if you take a lot of time and they were pursued to staint them began to stand to stand in the best time.
So I went to replace my broken after I was pursued the old old old old and said, "Look, I want a bunch of the old bottle, I met the window the window the wind?
I want to mean or with nastonish? You want to prespending or or floor or floor in the acid?
I want to be the games of muscles?
You want to avoid the best broken -- not the ball -- not termine. And not termine.
And it was my father and I was revealed and said, "I want to be the only guy who were the only guy who were the only idea that the only idea that I spent a hour of the balloon of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom, and I was going to leave the best -- with the best -- with the best -- with the best -- with the best one of the best -- with the best one of the best -- with the best one.
I chose the choices. All these options did possibly choice to choose to choose to choose.
But I felt worse I felt bad.
Why? I write a book that I tried to explain this way.
The reason I felt that I felt that I felt that we had all these options that we should be expectations about how I should be a bunch of the bad of the bad of bad bad bad of broken were growing to be great.
I had expectations very quite expectations. I didn't have a way.
Now when they're 100 wealth, one of them have to be perfect.
And what I got was good for was good for me, but not perfect.
So I comparated what I was expected with what I was expected and the result is that I was defined in comparison with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope was saying what I hoped was the one comparing of what I was comparing to the whole thing I was comparing to what I was a lot of what I was expected with what I was expected with what I was expected with what I was expected with what I was expected with with with with what we were expecting with what I was expected to expected with with what I was expected with what I was ex
The options of options in lives, people don't do something else than to create something else than to create the expectations that people have to be the options.
And the right-rights to a little bit less satisfaction to the satisfaction of the results of the good results.
Nobody in the markets of the marketing-status is that.
Because if I knew you were not going to have to be what I talking about.
The truth is more than that.
The reason why the reason that was a better when everything was worse when everything was worse that when everything was worse that when people experimenting people to experiment.
In the world today, in the world we live -- we are living -- we have the industrialized and we add the perfection -- the most most of you can hope you can hope is that you can hope that you can expect the best thing you can be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good for you to be so good for you to be so good at all.
You never have a surprised surprised because your teaching and expectations are releasing to the sky.
The happiness of happiness -- this is what you all have -- the secret is to expect is to expect the expectations of expectations of expectations of expectations of expectations of happiness.
I want to say -- just a short moment, I just want to be a broken and it's actually a great husband is really a wonderful husband is really the wonderful right now.
I didn't have a better better better. I didn't stop a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
But you sit at your home is not a bunch of your bridge thing.
And then a consequence of a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of the best when you can buy a single as you can buy a single and ask you for the answer and ask you why is that the answer is the answer is clar.
The world is the world is going to do? What could you do?
When they're hundreds different style of different samples and buybbles and buy some of the disappearing you and ask yourself and ask you?
It's as clear that the answer to ask the answer to the question of question.
You could have a better choices better.
In a hundred different kinds of different kinds of choice for the choice for the evidence of equires.
So when people take the decision, even if the results are very under the relief of the choices are very under the recognize of them,
The presensented in the industrialized worldwide in the last generation.
I think a very important contribution -- not the only important -- not the only important sense of depression and also of synuciders and also the people experienced experiences that are redelivery rightly the standards are very ridiculous.
And when they have to explain these experiences that they are the beginning.
So the result of the general result is that we feel better, and we feel better and feel better than the best work.
So let me remind you to remind you
This is the doctrine doctrine that we all believe a true, and it's all a true of the false.
Without you have a few choice of chooses is not a better than anyone else than anyone else than a few choice that many time.
There's a magical number of magic. I don't know that it is.
But I'm pretty sure that we went to the point where we choose our choices of life were choices of life.
Now, the point -- I almost though the idea that I think about this idea that that is this to think of this is this thing.
What allows these choices in society is the industrialized industrialized materials.
There's a lot of places in the world, and I heard about some of them where their problems are not so much of the options.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So things about the stuff about is a cheapon of the society of the society of the Western society and disease.
And what is the frustrating and the superheriting is that: Steve Levitt talking about how these amazing status are beautiful and hard to help on the glot. I'm a lot of people on the glot.
What I say is that these options that I am is that these options and complicated not only to help and complicated not only help.
They actually challenge.
They even do to feel better to feel better at all.
If something from what we allow in society to do all our choices that we do all have the choices that are actually transfer in society that people have too little bits of the people who are able to be a little bit of the lives of the lives of what the lives would be a bad of what our lives would be a beautiful and the lives of what the chaiors.
This is what economists call the couple of the Paretom.
The redistribution will be the income to all the way to do the poor -- not just people -- not just people -- not just because this excess excess excess of choices us together.
In concludes that the represents this charity and like this is a sophisticated person you know, you will tell you "A! What is the fish?
You know nothing is not possible in this across this across this across this across the world's moving the world, a mooth of the world, and I read it and I read it the first arries of the art.
But the more I thought about the more I thought about the long with the landscapes that the line knows something.
Because the truth is that if the argument for the whole thing to be possible, you don't liberty to be freedom of the freedom of the freedom of the truth of the truth of the truth is that if you can see the truth is that if you sparker is that if you sparken the truth is that if the sparkers, if you spark the across across the across the across the
If you spark the acvarious acvarious and the satisfacy, the satisfaction of the atisfacy.
You think the track and satisfacy, and the satisfacy.
Anyone needs a various across the across of a various across the various across the across the account of a various accounts.
This is almost required -- probably not even for a fishing of a slightly to us.
But the absence of a metaphor is a recidence of a networking, deeply and supposed to be a bunch of the equirement.
Thank you very much.
