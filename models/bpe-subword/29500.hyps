And I was the next week of the second diapositive to demonstrate the major or to the last three million years that the big state of three million years of the last three million years of the big state of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the hand the state 48 percent of the state of the Earth of the English of the second--year-old both
But this mornity of this problems of this problems because it doesn't look because it doesn't look at the gross of the game.
The polar is in a way, the heart of the climate system, the heart of global system.
She extends and contraction and contraction and they contract.
The next diapositive that I will show you a quick that I would be a quick of what was going on on in the last 25 years.
Ghe's pementary pementary is the great room.
So you can see the blue of the blue inkling inch.
This is the ancestors on the road.
And they give the window of the window.
The name is the permanentlemen, with a five-year-old old old or more than five years of you can see that it's almost like a body.
In 25 years has been to this one, at this time.
This is a problem because the challenge of the challenges of the oceaning of the article of the article of the article of the article
where it's a massive amount of massive carbon that is transformed in the road, is transformed in the micro-organisms.
Comparative pollution of the global data in the world of global inquires in the atmosphere, if we could go to the extremely extremely extremely extremely extremely extremely that point.
As a little bit in some of the Alaska metang metanos, the effective metanos,

HHere's Gore: Okay. She is OK. All right.
And a reason is that "the body" is Groenlanda is Groenlanda in north.
This is a rate that everything that everywhere.
But the volumes are much larger than that never never reach.
This is the Kangerluss-West in the Greenlanded.
If you want to stitting how you create the big levels at the topic levels on the top where this is the place where it gets in the high-standing in the high-standing story.
These debate very quickly quickly.

And so you read the way you read the read of read things.
On the global huscacier to a love growth of the incentiss.
And the disaster relies on all the global warming the global rate and the flaw of the precedented and the forever.
From fourth more in the last 30 years of the 75 years.
This is a absolutely unfortable.
If you look in context historical historical historical history.
In the last five years we brought 70 million tons of tons of tons of carbon every 24 hours of the oceans.
The next next one of the Earth of the Pacific, and the Pacific, and every part of the individual subcontinent where the individual requires of the oxygen.
The largest one that the only global warming global warming of global despairs, which represent is the argumentlemen.

The United States is one of the two marchitectures of China.
And the proposal was to build more fabrich.
But we start to see a change.
Here's the people who have analyzed in the last year, with alternative alternative proposition.

This picture of the image of something.
In the Cracier to me, at me in Tenness, a billion galored bystery of sterytelling the carbon was impractice.
You probably attention to the stird of stirly.
This is all the word of the case of the great deversary of the She intamed Cracier Cracier.
One of the carbon the carbon the bottom of the Cracier of Cracier was this.

That's why our principal is to spend a big sugar is to spend a big sugar that we can help us to help us to help us and complicity of the carribs.
The thing is that, in fact, in fact, the carrying is not dirty dirty is not dirty
We believe that it's currently -- and it goes and good.
So it will not the ingrijors for climate change.
And this is that we live in our hands.
Video: The Great a current of heart at him.
So let's do a team of this guy that is the curately the curately curately the curately bad of carbon the carbon the bottom of the carbs.
Here's the amazing is about the nice is about the name.
But this is the sound technology is the sound of the car.
And as the book is one of the main is one of the global warming global warming global warming technology that you can see the benefit that you can see the change that you can see here the what's going on.
The next one is the technology is technology technology is technology of the carbon the course of the carbon the course of the carbon the course of the carbon the road.
Al Gore: In the alternative alternative is the right economic challenge economic challenge of the security of the security of national problem.
Video: Narrator: The economy, economy, the national economy, the national cliff.
The thing that we live all the way to do that we have been dependent on the bottom of carbon: the carbon the street bon: the carbon the street blow.
But now we have a new solution to the redrawing to the course in the curately chair.
The energy of the American electricity with electricity 100 percent of the course of 10 years ago.
A plan to the stop of the world in the room in the world of stopping of global including the global stores.
In the south, a solution that is a big solution to help us solve problems.
The American energy America. Afled America.
Al Gore: This is the last year.

One of the most quickly required to independent dependent dependent on the fuel Barbon Barband is our planet is our remote is our energy required the new energy.
Barbed nroughly to create the jobs to create the job.
Narrator: The America. It's time for active active active active action.
Al Gore: There is a neighborhood of verb that says, "If you want to go to go to the only thing you want to go to the only thing you walk the only thing you can go away."
If you want to get to the window!
We need to get fast, we have to far today.
Thank you very much.
The English, I did a LHC.
And we promised to reach a data and then you can drive this data about how it works that it works on how it works in the room
So the ata-ma. And the people who didn't have been here, LHC is the largest stinitiative that was recertain -- Cirumpet -- Cirumint Skid or is recreating the Skid's recreating the conditions of a billion slightly billions of the second level of the unique of the universe -- the table of the universe -- the miles on the size of the second -- the size of the second -- the size of the second --
It's extremely ambitious.
This is the city of Geneva.
We photographs "Big Bangs" in the decade of the decades.
I work on this one. It's called ATLASSTLASS -- Lung, the 44 meters, diameter of 22 meters, a photography detectors here to be able to get the ATLALSSTALSSTALSSSTALSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS.
On the 10-seper ptemptation for the first time.
And this picture was done was the AS.
She was a challenge in the room in the room in the room
It's a picture of the first fashion the way that the third of the street in the engineer LHC, the car LHC, the car LHC, the bridge in the LHC, the bridge detector.
In other words, when I was seven that images at that images on that I was a very huge that it was a huge that is a huge successful for the very huge that is a huge success.
I don't know that if that was the largest ovative, or that when someone went on the both of the bottom and she seeks like the first page of the first page of the first land.
And it means that we did a culture of cultural impacts on the street of standing the street of the street impact of standing the top.
After about a seven of a sappeared of the apart, which actually had a problem -- these field -- these field aur.
These are the 13 thousands of both when the machines that are working on the power of maximum power to the power of maximum
Now, the engineering of the says, "I can't translate the attack attack of him, I am fighting myself."
But I can do that when I'm at the time I'm at the temperatures becomes what the Christmas are the cheap.
So as a 271 degree of the statement of the statement of statement and those are the way that they can transport the case of the foreign way.
At one of the other of the other 10,000 magnetic magnetic field in LHC, was a fabrication.
So that the competition is the 13 thousands of both 13 thousands of both electricity.
This was the result.
This is more presence of respect that those magnetic field over 20 tons, and they fly over 20 tons, and they fly 30 degree of the ton-hand in the way.
So we determine we determine about 50 50 percent.
We had to take affair, which we would do.
We reconditioned everything we repaid them,
And now we go back to the street in the subteran.
Pana march of the big LHC will be like us that we are like us.
We're going to go back and take us to figure out in hunger or hydroping in the hydrogen to the research that are elements to be the universe that are elements to be elements of the universe.
Now, of course, as a way in a way, those accidents recognize about extremely important engineering to extremely recognize to reject.
I think that the fact that the fact that is so difficult of the fact that we have been important to the fact that we have an important experiments like HCHC.
I'm going to leave the words of words that words are not the Britissues, Humphrage, when I think that the inut, when I said, I think that the inutterly protected to the Michael Farady, he says, "Nothing is not more dangerous for the progress are not more dangerous for the progress are not more dangerous to refer the lies are not such a bad, as we are not the bathletic words are not more and as a bad,
Thank you.
I want to start with the rate to remember the kidney of children, when you play with both board with both board.
On the big thing what they invented to get them to the check and get them to the closer and you start to figure out how to figure out how to solve and relief and religion and religion and relatively religious relatives.
The space is the space is the delivering of how we intelligence a big part of the world world of inconjection of the world of inconjuds.
So in the research, in the IT research, and we have the inspired of our physical objects -- impresses -- impressing my collaboratory -- and my collaborator -- I started to start my inced -- I started to start to start to start the right -- I started to get a computer, and when we were able to be able to make a mouth of this road, and we can be able to be a bad of the canny of the can, and we ashim, we could be the making, and we have the whether and the whether we could be the whether it is it was the whether it was the what's going to be an away, and the whether it's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
So what we want to do we want us to do we want to do we want to do?
And the question was so fascinating that I decided to ask the research, I asked the Siftable.
As Siftable is a computer, is a computer is a bisuary bisuary bisu.
They can be manufactures, I can perceive the recircumstance, and they have a foreign a radio ran and a reless.
The most important is that I'm palpable is that you can teach them as you can just missing them as you can just be like just watching them as well as you can just get the water.
And Siftables of an evil example of a new evil of a digital information of digital information in the digital of digital information
On the big thing that are instruments becomes more palpable to be the samples of the other consties of the action of the active active active active active active active and degrees and determine the styles, we can start explore the red, we can start explore and degree the brother.
I'm going to start with some examples of simple example.
This Siftable is configure out what you can imagine video game in a direction of a video directly in a direction of the rate philosphere, the rate of the roll, the roll.
These are interactive of the other consties of each other of the other one.
So if you put them on one language, it becomes a whole interested in interest.
If they're conjected to that, and I can become involve and that, and I can become confusion.
And I can feel the missing and incline.
We realized that one of the interesting of interesting involves is that we can use the gestures that we can use the gestablished as we could be able to culture how we could be able to culture a license license.
In this case, we have three Siftables as a galephones and they can use them and they can use them to reach the center where they will reach in the center of the center of the center where they will reach the center of this is the center of this case.
If I was too long with a little bit of a little bit in the inair of the inair.
There's also possibility of interesting interesting for education, like education, like the mathematics and listening and lives the possibility to try and slightly to see the results of the immediately required to see the results.
So here -- this is a Fibonacier that I have a simple program simple programs.
So here we have a game of words of words on the words of combining to Scrabs and Bogging and Boggle.
And then every single step on every single Siftable, and the massh of the Siftable, and the mash that I am verified with a dictionary.
And then you know, you just 30 seconds of seconds of seconds and we can get a new types and we can be able to read and new possibility of recognized.
Thank you.
These are the children who came up to the Media, and I came up to the Media, and I read and filmmaker and film a material that a material material.
And he lived at the neighbors.
And one of the interesting things that are interesting is that kind of applications is that you don't need to give them a lot of instructies.
All you need to say, "For the word "For the what's going to do.
Here's some other people are other people indeed people in the room.
This is our most tanar tester in our right right in the right right right in the right right right now.
It seems like everything that he wanted to take one Siftable one in one other way.
So it was just the bottom of the bottom
This is a interaction apply apply apply apply apply of animation.
We wanted to build a top of the people who invent language.
And this is Felix.
He can get new characters in the stage of the Siftable of Siftables that affairs.
Here's the soil, and it's the sound.
Video: The guy is the rate of it.
David Merrill: Now he got a traction, in the stage of the stage of the stage.
Video: The brother's porto.
Good goo! Yeah.
Miss Siftable-slips and asking them one language -- Video: Ham!
DM: I think about narrative.
Video: Okay!
DM: It's a story with the final story, and he decided what it is going to be drawing the way to draw the hand
Video: Zara, pis!
DM: The next example I showed you today is a today a today and interpretation that we built the music that we built the music that we built the role and in which Siftables and tobe.
Each one of these fourth has different variation of different choices that you want to use it.
And you can inject sound in a successful successful that you can ask you can ask the guard that guys you can see.
You can sound the sound of the sound of sound like a Siftable Siftable Siftable Siftable Siftable Siftable to be able to stop the tools.
There are evidence you can control the live, how you can be reverberative filter.
Here's a certain a certain in a certain hid-including it to the house it
It takes the effects of the general effects like the paper that the paper that the square sequence of sequence to see it.
Video: DM: We're going to start with a second Siftables arrative, and we arrive it in a series, we have been rhitling a series of a series of jitter.
Now a link line.
Video: DM: Now I bring the percupy of percuting.
Video: DM: And now I'm going to bring the movies of the effect of the effect of the effect of the lives.
Video: Ma: May grabs the second section of the second side or in a part or in a part or in a part or in a part or in a part of the window in a Video: DM: DM: DM: DM: DM: DM: DM: DM: DM: DM: DM: DM: DM: DM: DM: DM: DM: DM: My babove
Video: DM: Now I'm going to atask for more expression.
Video: DM: I can read the section of while the quantly.
So I don't have to do the plan, I can improvise, month, months in the window in the window in the window in the window in the window.
Now, in the sfars; I can get the top of the second section of Siftable-volume behind the street in the standard standa standard in the standard of the sentence.
Thank you.
As my own standing is my passion is creating new interfaces that are actually working with the way that it works better with our brain that works and our body can be able to our brain and our body wants and our body wants and our body wants and our body.
And today, I had a time to show this new space, and a couple of course, and a couple of course, and a couple of possibilities that I wanted to take them from the laboratory.
The Gand's retine that we are at the granted is that we are at this new generation of the instrument of instruments of the middle of the digital world that will bring our world information in our world information in our rules the world of our rules of our rules that they want to the rule of our rules that they would be able to add the rest of us that they want to add the rest of us
Thank you very much.
Astep, the square to talk to you to.
I'm writing.
He write the book is my teach, but it's more than that, but it's more than that.
It's all my mother love and fascinating.
And I don't just take this to the top of the time.
But these field said, something like a little bit like a bunch of the bottom and she said, "I determined me that I determined me to the landscape of the relationship with working.
And the reason is that I wrote this book, I hear "Manca, Rographer, Rograph," Road, Rool, Rool, Iubest, and Iubesture's hytherosied in my own home, and it became the reason that reason, and it became this important method of the bad sense.
The relief is that the original now, people go back and I would be condamn.
Serios -- condamness, condamness.
All of you to the ingriving and say, "You don't have -- "Do you don't have -- you don't have the performance you might not be able to depass your performance you could be able to depass your performance you can get the performance you can get the performance you can be able to reach though instead of the challenge.
Do you don't have the track of the intremendous to write your life that you ever get a book that someone who would you ever get the world that somebody els?"
It's very linearlier, it is very line.
But it would be more roughly if I was not remember about 20 years ago, when I started to get a great time -- when I was a standing -- as I was writing, I want to become a writer reacting to be reacting to the same reaction in a kind of slightly broken on a kind of broken as a kind of broken as a kind of like the same thing.
And people say, "Not the thing you don't have any more successful than you would never have success?"
Do you don't want to rejection is going to kill yourself?
Do you don't have the front of the life of your life in this field and not recognize that it will not deaths on a map of the spot of the center of the center of the center of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle is the frame of the mas?"
Something that is that this kind of like this.
The reposal -- the rack on the short of the question is "Yeah, is "Yeah, y."
Yes, you know, it's the teams of all those things.
And it always stost.
And the thing is in the roads that people don't macting to the other things that people can't intuitive.
As a big example of the big things that are infruit is infruit
But when it's about written about writing and I think about what I was like, "Why?"
Is it it is this rational rational not?
It's logic like anybody to take the way to be themselves that they feel like Perhaps were pretty much like Perhaps to do it on this amount of work.
And what is that the initiatively specific that seems like non-behind people who are really looking at the end of the benefit that other tests don't do it?
My fairly for example, it was the chemist, and you don't remember the 40 years of his chemicals like the chemicals is not asking somebody is asked to be asked to be asked to be a chemist.
It didn't have -- John, John, how do it works in the chemical?
It just doesn't really get it to the top of something.
But to be syncerized, the engineering that group not too cools that long the century remarkable of the century of the room to be alcoolic maniaco-depression.
We write the insand, we have this remarkable remarkable and not only writers, but artists like this reputation like this reputation like this reputation of the lab.
And everything we do is to look at the number of morning the number of morting, in the 19th century, in the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of young light and it took the young people and it opens on the product of the standing of the broken and the entire we going to do the left
And even that they didn't have the same seems like the providing seems to be really strongly the statement of your own statement.
Norman Mail, even before the last digital in my first interview, he said that "Each to my both ttom."
A great extraordinary about a great life about a life of a life of a life of a life of a life of a life of a life of the work of work of work.
But we don't even even when we hear someone saw someone saw that because we have heard that because we have been able to put in and I have absorsorsorbly absorsorsorry, and the idea that creativity and suffering the idea of the landscape, it will conduct the landscape, it will always be in a bag to the suffering on the suffering.
And the question I want to bring all today is all of the today is you know, you are the impacts with this ideas with this ideas in this idea of ideas?
You are comfortable with it -- because it is that you see how it is that you can see the hypothese.
I think it's odias.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to be dangerous in the future of the future.
I think it's better if we are better if we get our artists to live the artist.
And I know the sure of that is my homework -- in my handle -- it would be very dangerous to me to go back to my book on the book the book of this hypothese, special hypothese, special history that I know the test of the history that I know too teaching teaching the team now professional.
As a tank, I'm just pretty much in the 40 years.
And I have probably inly like four decades.
And it's very likely that everything I want to write with this moment to be judged by the mountain my own stream that the last last last money to the last month, corely cocore?
What would it be a shared way in some kind of the way here is already about the most successful friends that the largest successful as the most successful to be intamed already.
Oh, Oh, what oh, what do --
This is the gene gene that could be able to make someone to the nice to the nineath of the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I think about this message that I love this message that I love love.
And then the question is the question is it?
And so I put it on a lot of meditative, like manible now, to work now, to write now, is through the building that is through the cookay?
I have to find a way, to find a way to find a way to the pastra-mazing distance, and the one, and the third absolutely now, and the reactive lessons that will be able to reactive reactive reactive to what it write the what's going to be able to reactive what they write the butter,
And as we all look at the last year of this year, I went to the time that I started to see the time and I started to see if you were trying to see if you could be able to see if you could have more than the ideas about how to be able to be more sand, and the high-ground issues of how to help us creative.
So this is this to Greece in Greece and Roma and Roma and Roma
So the great cycle cycle is the sharing of the case of the case of the case of the case of the nurse.
But at the Great Great Rom, and Rom, and the Rom, and they didn't think that creativity in the home, okay?
People believe that creativity was a spirit of the people who are storing people in a source of a story, and unable to figure out the grandmother and needs and needed and needed to be able to understand the needed to be able to be able to figure out that creativity.
The names called these creativity of creativity of creativity "demonstrate "demonstrate "demonstrate the "demonit."
Socrossed was the demon that has a demon that has a department in the department.
The same relief had the same parents, but they called the creative, but they have a creatively gaterial genius -- genius to be able to be able to discover the horrible of the hands,
What is wonderful is wonderful because a genius didn't believe that a genius was a individual genius was a individual individual with.
And they also have a kind of a kind of entity was a kind of a diving, which is the true of the artist, in a kind of like Dobby, the house, who are asked the artist, who are the session and insession and insession and the insession and the respective of the work, the patterns.
Absolutely -- this is the distancing is the distancing psychology that we can protect the results that you can protect the results of your works.
And everything that the world is worth workers?
So the artist was protected by some things, like for example, a lot of narcism, cover for example, right?
If you were the mountain was stuck of the street that you could have the standing that the story that you would helped her to help that helped her her to help that helped her to helped her to helped her to helped her to helped her to helped her mountain the mountain the mountain was the stallo, if you were the stalone was the stralgic of the mountain the street was the street of the work of the work.
If you were criticized, it was not completely windows, right?
Everybody stood like the genius was about the ignorant.
And then people look at the West creativity for a month,
And then he came up and everything has changed and everything has changed the big idea of the big idea of the big idea that the mared, the idea that the humans and the horrible left to the horrible and mysters, the bar rainforests on the ground to create the horrible and the horrible and the reaching of the dival and reaching to the divail.
It was the human beings began to create that creativity began to creativity of the individual bear.
And for the first people in history in history of people started to refer one or one or one of the artists of the artists like a genius to have a genius of a genius of a genius and for the first genius and for the first time.
And I must be a great herror a huge error a huge error hert.
Permitmand the box, a simple person or is actually recepting and it is actually receiving the inside and the source and the source of mystern, creatives, creatively a lot of the table, creativity is a lot of the sacred, the broad, the broken of the psychological perform of the food.
It's like you some some some some of the hospita hospita so-hospital.
And just the incooks: and deform it in the stered of all these tools of the inimages of the inimages of the inimages of the inside of the food.
I think that the presence of artists one of the last 500 years of one year.
And if I think is true, and I believe that is, what do now: what do now?
Can we do things differently?
You can go to the sense of the source of the relationship of the relationship of the creativity.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't just stering 500 years of thinking about 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes.
And probably as the people in audience that would be asking absolutely ask the question of the stins of the stins that reach people the prevent that people are remote to their arming and surrounds and everything else and all the way they are all the way they are all to their own areas and they are probably in their own arming and they are probably in their audience to the people in the audience of people in the audience of the people who are the slightly in the public people in the mass of the top of the people who are the slies that they requiet re-top of the people who are the people who are the live people in the live people
It will not be able to cooperate on this idea.
But the question I want to put it -- why don't I want to put it -- why now?
Why don't we think about this in the way.
Because it has send sense of that any else of something else that we have heard explains the case of the creative process of creatively inner process of creative processes of creatively the process of the creative processes that are the sense of sense of sense of sense of sense of sense of sense of sense of sense of sense of sense of sense of sense of sense of sense of that any else of the creative sense of the top of that anything else else else of the top of the growth of them that any other other oning stop of the too we have the top of the top of the sense of sense of the
So design that everyone else that everyone -- practical to create something -- you know, the one here -- you know that it doesn't begin the rational rational way.
And in fact, sometimes can put the right side of the paranormal.
I had a bunch of a where I knew extraordinary of American Stone, American Ruth Stone, which is now has been standing in the room and she was storing to the story of the story and that when she was storing the story of the country to work on the Virginiginia to work on the ropp, and it feels like it was a brothern and it feels a bridge of the room.
The story was like a vantage of the law of the air.
And it turns out the rops.
The symbol is the sample of the paper paper under the paper under the painting.
In that moment that has a single thing that has a single thing to do, and I read the apattach."
And the game as as the water is the big housing of the house, and the paper and a piece of maps and a piece of maps and when she was a little bit of the past to get through the map of the maps on the map of the map.
Sometimes was enough to be enough to the alerga and alerg, but it doesn't get the house and the poem, and she didn't get the rostog, and she was the poem, and the poem, and the poem, look at the rost, a bad "All right, a poet "All right, a poet "All right.
And they were in that -- and I was not going to look at this point -- and I would look at the moments that almost loss.
Another hack home, and the poem, and the poems and the poems of exactly when it was asking the story of the hand and the story of the alebra and the story and the story and the story and the print him.
The paper coads and the sland in the body, and then in the massh of the mash massh on the massh of the massource of the massh of the massource of the first car stems of the conduct of the conduct of the coads of the coad.
So in the situation, the poems of the map of the map of the map of the first time at the first time at the first time at the first time the first time the first time the first time the first time the first time the first time the first of all.
When I heard -- it's exactly exactly how it works in my own process process of my process process creative.
My creative creative isn't limited at this -- I'm not driving -- I'm not driving the room.
I'm a catarrier, and the way I worked at the same time, and I would be able to sleep and slide and slightly and slightly and slightly standing with the hard to stand up with the hard to stand up with the hard to be a statement.
But even no, in indark in my indark was indeed to sometimes that phenomenon that phenomenon.
And I mean, I was and many of you were and many of you were and many of you have.
And I was the idea of design or ideas that I was looking at a source that I didn't know that what it means.
And what do you all this?
And how would it be reported as we should be losing us at the mind us to help us to help us to help us to help us to take us to the ramanatosid?
For me, example, the most relevant days, which is the musician that can be able to make it is the musician to a couple of years ago in the revil of years ago in the revil review of revil review of the review of the review of me,
I was talking about this suggest that and the thing was almost everything that artists the artist of the artist of the Chinese contemporary to control and control, what I get to control these creative impulses these impulses these inably improved.
The time the time the line of the land the story of a day that is like a day in the autopia and then it turns out the street and then everything has changed.
As a time a room of a brown of a brown of a piece of a piece of the spider, and the affect and such as the spirit and a sampling and a sampling and a sample, but it has no way to the splending, but it doesn't even how to the water.
It doesn't have no photography, it doesn't have no report report the report of the report of the foundation.
And the thing that is that the net of that screen growing in the interior "I want to lose the monkey, and can, and can, I will always to always to always the always of always to always the chance for always to always the always of feel.
I'm not enough to reach a good enough to reach it.
And instead of the painting, just stood up in the painting.
He recognized process and made something else and did all the new way of all.
He takes the water and she said, "Sorry, don't see that I'm not seeing like I'm voluntee?"
"Do you can seem like a cantest of all?
If you really want to be really excited to be in a moment of a moment when you get to the right time you get home to her.
If you no, by someone else and you can someone else on somebody else.
Do and you can read it on Leonard Cohen."
The past is creative process has changed this.
Not operates to be desired to be as intuned as intunately.
But the processes in the aggress around the hand the moment in the moment that he took the spired that he was the standing that he says the genide what he saw was saying to the tool, and he had to get to the arrid of the Chinese goes and then it doesn't have to be something that they don't have to be something to be so interiorized and Chinese and Chinese and
It could be this collaboration and bization and bizarre and the shape of a conversation that is like Tom.
And after I heard the story of the way I was working on the way that I was working on my way I was worth of a data.
This is my approach to me when I was at the middle of "Manca, Road Road is "Manca, and I was kind of a kind of like a kind of like a kind of like a kind of like it in a kind of receiving a little bit of the broken and you can be the most providing it to think that it would be the most providing that it would be the most providing that it would be the most providing that the best writing me to be the bath.
Not just provided this is the most providing the broken
I want to think that I should be able to reach that I should abandoned the project.
And then I remember As Againt all the space of opened and I was trying to come and I was trying to him.
I went to the view on the roaddress and I brought a collapses of a collect room in the room
I said to the voice says, "Asculta, and I know that if you know that if you don't be extraordinary is not just the same, right?
Because you can see that one to you like one at the bottom of all that I have to him.
So if you want to be better than that, you have to be better attempt and you have to do the door and you get the step on your room.
Okay. And if you don't want to do that, at the naive to do anyway.
And I'll go to write because this is my message.
And I want to consign today's today I did my favor."
Because -- the -- Conclude -- with hundreds of years in the hundreds of North Africa, North Africa, and they bring up the brown music and the music and music music and music for the music and the music to the music to the racing land.
And there were always wonderful for the dancing and they were remarkable to remarkable and they were remarkable to remarkable and it was cool?
But once you know, a very rare something is happening and one of the interpret of the interpret of the common the common the common the common the common bear.
I'm convinced you all style about what I want to all these vas, because of all the moment, in a certain the interpretation like a certain the interpretation.
It's like the time is that the time is the stop is in a kind of slamped by the way that you don't do anything else in the other 1,000 series in the other engines of the other hands.
Once it doesn't even even more seems to be in the room.
It's the light and light and light is the amazing of the divity of the dives.
As the time when they were intaming people standing what was the named name.
And I'm impressing the mains and they were "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, All, Doamn, Doamn, Doh, Doh, God,
It's God.
A history of interesting -- when the maps -- when the Spanish Spanish Spanish the Spanish century has been transformed to the "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Al
and they hear in the time in the fight and dancing and dances.
In Spain, when a interpret of recognized something impossible and magic and magic -- Allah, Allah, the arm arvoted to the arm arvoy."
And unintelligence -- a God's Godle.
It's wonderful for that we need something like this.
But the one part of the morning comes to the morning to the morning when you get the suspect of the morting, and it's not a 1111, hour horse and not is a lipiece of Divingly lipiece of Divings.
It's a discover that I think that I would like to be that they could never get to the same thing that never stood and it would never be able to be intimate in the tool.
You might not be no one that the name is the name of the Domness when he was such a way that they should be able to do with the rest of his lifespecially save?
It's hard.
It's one of the most weeky roaccept in the creative life creative.
But maybe it doesn't have a big chance if you don't think about if you don't think about the most extraordinary parts of the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary interior of the most extraordinary interior in the interior of the inside.
Maybe if you create that they were impromise to be excited by a chase of a chair of a couple of source when you get to the next time you would be more more than the other one, when the moment of the moments have inched to get the name of the sheets have been inched.
If we think about this is all of us all the way to change the way to change the way to change the way to change it.
I asked to think about to think of the last months of the last months of the last months that will be published by the course that will be able to excessive and infrared of my own own quire and infrastructure of my own successful music and infruit of my successful music and infruit of my success.
And what we do, what I do, repeated when you get the course is the course is the hand is not the hand is the hand is not the hand is the ama.
It doesn't be speeds. I just want you to go to the Contain the confessing you, anyway.
If you are dancing the dances, then dances.
If the divine genivine is reparties that are repartises to the extraordinary decade, even a clipped through your eform in your effort, then you know, then the stream, then the bad form "Ole"
And if no, dancing anyway.
And with all of that "Ole!
I think of these things and I think I should prevent them to prevent them.
"Oh, yeah, all you know, just because you have a love dragosting and incent the environment for the participation to the participate in the end,
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just Cohen: Ole!
We have more about some of these projects, about some of these projects and what it could represent us on the settles.
Now it starts from a new point, in fact, we digitized biology, and now we're trying to start this code and we try to go to this code and get to a new flight and feeling and shaping form and shapes forward form and shapes forward.
We tried all the time, we tried to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to try and ask us all the time.
"What is life is something that I think many biologists are trying to understand the diverse to understand the level of the level of the level of the level of the bottom "What is the living life is the lives.
We tried to different approach to the life component to the live life component to the basic component to the basic component.
And we already already already is about 20 years.
When I was the human, this is the human, this is the analogy world of the digital world of the digital world of the digital world
So we try to ask the question, maybe we can create new forms of life forces of life forces digital universe of this universe of this universe of the universe of the universe --
This is the map of a mice, Mycoplasma genitalist, which is the most reply that can reply the only thing that can reply the only replify in laboratory.
We tried to see if we can come with a genome and smaller genome.
We were able to suggest about a hundreds of genes in the hundreds of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of the map, it's pretty simple to our simple comparation with our comparation with our comparation with our own hands.
And really, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can suggest at a moment is a little bit like this to produce a cell.
So we decided that the only thing that the only thing we would really be able to seem to see this cromoss so that we can see the most fundamental questions to address in the most fundamental questions of the most fundamental questions.
And so we started on the road, "Can we can interested in a cromoss?"
Maybe it allows these molecules that we didn't have ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever before?
And if you like, if we can active.
A cromosome, by a piece of chemical.
So our speed to digitize at a life of the exponential rhytherapy.
Our grandmother code code code, it is the benefit that it flow.
The last time he got to a speed at a speed exponential currency.
And we started this is better than 15 years.
We went through a few equired, in fact, in fact, in fact, before the first experiments of experiments are before the first experiments of the first experiments of the first experiments of the first behind the first of all. We went through a few stepped through a few equired through a few etaphetaphetwork, we start by a few equietaphetaphory, we start by a few streetaphetworks.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult is very difficult.
These are thousands of cars in the world that are doing small small small small long games of the DN, but it's a process of the long, so it's a piece of degeneration, so that what we built is a piece of waters, with more than the arm of the waters, the apart.
So we had to create a new method to put these little bits, and it turns together and coreaching all the herrors.
This was our first tentative, the first tentation of the digital information of the digital genome of the Phi 174.
It's a little virus that killed light bacteria.
We did design the brother, we went through the corectling of the horror of DNA molecule molecule molecule molecule molecule of words.
The interesting interesting came up when I took this piece of chemical material and I put it in bacteria and bacteria has began to read this genetic code that code the genetic crowd this code code that code the country.
The viral articulation was then elidents in the cells and they were going to come back and they were killed and the cells.
I was going to go with the oil industry is very clear and says that we understand that it is really clear this model.
They have more than you walk more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software in which software in a mapping biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger something bigger than a larger
We wanted to build the entire cromoss of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 literally choice code genetic code.
So we said, "We would say, "We would go to the size of the size of the size of the size of the house to understand the size of the households that are component to understand the requires of a cell.
And of course, is criticized, and if you start with the digital information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly the exactly has to be very exactly exactly the exactly exactly the inign of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, and of course, of course, and if you start with the information, and if you start with the information is critical, and if you start to start with the information of the digital
When I was the first sequence of this genome in 1995, standard was a 10,000 per paper in 10,000 per paperts.
We found in the rest resources of the rest of the herrors. If we were used to be used to be able to be able to be activated to be activated.
The design is design is design for 50 literally 50 literally long, which has to get the other 50 literally 50 literally literally to build the sub-unit to design the sub-unity to design the same, and we have to design the compatible compatives.
We design elements of one.
You can read "watermarkets "watermarkets. Well ell at this: we have a genetic code in fourth code from four, C, Good.
Trigs from those letters -- those are those challenge codes -- one challenge -- one characters -- one choice every case every ame.
So we can use the genetic code to write work, to write a bits, though.
So the next thing I did was to hear that we were to hear the code.
Some of them were disappearing that it's not poetry.
We designed those those are so much so that we can dignose.
I'm enzyming and they have one and they have one.
So we started to do the benefits, began to 7,000 literally floating them to do it at the 24,000 literally charge to make the bridge sets in this room and then he asked the sets of these lawyers in the roots in the root of these 2,000.
Every every equired, we have these little bits in above them a way to create a process of the robust -- as you can see a robust -- as you see a mind.
We try to get to that point at that point of automatically automating.
So this looks like a theren themselves.
When we get to the market at the piece of 100,000 per paper paper in E. collapse.
It takes all the tools of biology of molecular modern.
So we are really, to other mechanisms.
We knew that there is a mechanism called the DNA, which biology is using DNADN, and that unless you can reach the benefit of the DNA, and that unfortunately.
This is a example of the example.
There is a named organism called Deinopens on radiation that can sugar sugar range of radiation.
As you can see in the slightly slightly to the brother.
12 to 24 hours later, he put it in the other asslammed it was at the beginning.
We have thousands that can do that.
These organisms can be drawling today.
I can live in the living in the living in the life of it.
I'm absolutely safe that life can be in space the extra new space of extra new medium.
In fact, NASA showed that this is going to get there.
Here's a micrograph micrography that we build these process process -- actually using the mechanisms of the mechanisms that we put the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of a piece of the rock that we put it on the rographer.
Drodies together automatically automatically automatically automatically
This is not a picture of a microscope with electrons, but just a photographer.
It's so a big molecules that we can see a large microscope.
These are images of collects over a period of about six seconds.
This is a public published that we had a little bit of time I had a little bit of time.
These are over 580,000 literally choice code genetic code.
It's the largest molecule has ever ever been definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely the largest structure.
It has a molecular molecular land.
If we get a funding a 142 pages, 142 pages and you can remember this code code this code code code code this code code code and you can integrate this code code of a genetic funding a funny funding a funny funny of a funny of a funny funny funny of a funny funding a funny funny funny and without space,
So how do we go to a cromosome? What are you going to active.
Eidentally, with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
Estore, you know, when you get to the ekinds of eking: you can just put the nuclear and that is something that you all the other side -- clear -- clearly you know, it's something that you all heard -- clarea.
And the archa, the archa, but we showed that we can do a cell, but we showed that we can make a completely completely completely a completely cle cells to be able to activate it to be able to activate it.
We pushed a crowd of the microbial species of microbial microbial microbial microbial microbial crobs.
And these two are about the second distance of distances, and the machines and sharing people and sharing the hands.
We added some genes that we can sell this cromoss for this cromoss for this cromoss
We digering them with the enzyming to human.
And it was pretty strongly when we put it in cells -- you will be the very sophisticated in our circle -- and our cromoss ended up in cell.
In fact, we thought this is how it's going to go into the projects but we tried to design something more far more than ever before.
This is a mechanism of evolution.
We find all kinds of species that have been recorporate a second cromoss of the second cromoss of the newspaperately new characteristic in a second.
So the people who think about evolution just as one gene only changing the time they lost a lot of time they lost lost in biology.
I'm enzymes called DNA, which actually digers, which is digering DNA.
Cromosomosomes that was in cell.
The cells -- the cromoss that we put them --
It was expressed and the other cells that the other cells like material al that material with the cells that we just got the cell.
It became the blue of the genes that we put in the cromoss that we put it in the cromosse.
And after a very short period, all the characteristics have loss loss of a new species in a new species in a new species, the based on the software that we put the software that we put the software that we put in cell.
All protein was changing the world -- when we were changed -- when we were changed -- when we transfer the genetic code.
This can sound like alchemistry, but we can also change the software enough to change the room the room the things that we can change the things that we can change the room.
Now, I have been described that this is not genetic -- but a half billion years and a half billion evolutionary evolution, and we have been on the Cambridge explored that we have a new species of Cambridge of the Briant, in which has a new species on design a digital special special bigital digital technology is a digital special special digital digital technology.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obviously obviously of the needs of needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to be able to be a needs of course, I think it's pretty much of the obviously is pretty much of the obviously indeed is pretty much of the obviously obviously aware pretty obviously aware pretty much of the point of view in the point of view in the point of view in the point of view in the ne
We are on the way we go from six and a half billion people and a half billion people over 40 years.
As this in context for me to me in 1946. I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for every single of us that existed in 1940s, they will be four years of the 40 years, they will be four years.
We have the problems of the issues of the slightly watching water square figure and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half of the issues of the issues of the issues of the issues of the issues of the issues of the issues of the issues of the issues of the slightly square hunging of the samps of the
It will be difficult to do it for us to do it.
We use over five billion books of book, more than 30 billion barrier billion barrier of petrol.
This is a hundred million barily barrasses.
When we try to think about the biological process or any process that this is going to be a challenge challenge to be a challenge challenge to be a challenge challenge challenge chance.
And then of course, it's that CO2 is that CO2 from this material that is in the atmosphere.
Now, from our discovering the world of the world around the world of the world data, and I like to think about 20 million genes, and I like to think about the future.
Industrial has just a paint of just a pain, or whatever it was diversity of the diversity that came from that.
We are limited here, in the first time, a biological reality and imagine of our biological image.
We now have been technology of all of these technical data of all of these types of synthesizer, combined to do what genimic genemic chemical chemical chemical thing.
We have a big ability to build a large robot that to make a million comoss on day.
When you think about these 20 million genes these 20 million genes or to try and try to be able to choose produce products produce the product or products that we can change the farmaceutical team, we can just change a little team, we can change more than the last 20 years of everybody in the past 20 years of everybody in the past 20 years of everybody in the science.
And this is just standard.
We can select the samples for the substance or fuels or fuels, or fuel,
This is a shape of a software design that we work that we can work and we can work and work and we can work on these species in computers.
You don't know how we can look at how it will look at how it looks like this.
We know exactly how their genetic code is their genetic code.
Now we now concentrate the four-generation to fight the generation.
You see, you see, in the room is just a nine.
We have the fuels of the second generation that they are going to get pretty much larger farmers that are today's fuel, which are the bigger or guys as the octaneously different from diseases or guys like the octaneous.
But the only way we believe that biology can have a major impact of the most cost-limited impact is if we start with their limited to the first time is their first time to the first time to design the first time to design the first generation of the first generation of the first generation of the food, and we believe that we would have the first 18 months.
Light and CO2 is a mile -- but in our discovering our world of other ways we have all kinds of other ways of other me.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
She reaches in the oceans, about two kilometers and a half kilometers and a half of the closer to the closer to the top of the fibers of the bear.
Transform CO2 in metan hydrogen meters, as the energy as energy.
We try to see if we can take the CO2 captures that can be easy transported that CO2 back in the hand then it turns out that CO2 back in the fuel.
So in a time we think that we can mean that we could mean that we could mean the question "What is the question "What is the question "What is the life?"
We really know -- we are -- we have been replaced to replacing the entire industry industry industry industry.
Yeah. If you don't do this at TED, where do we go to another parted?
Let's become a major energy.
But we also work now is to use these same source to inventing the vaccines of vaccines of vaccines immediately charguments.
You see, this year, we always have a year in the hand a dollar in the minus when he was going to talk about the right right of the right right now.
I think that the situation can be changed by the combined before before before before.
Here's how it could be able to show the future of changing arborel evolution, the armer evolution with bacteria and the arch, and finally, argue ariod.
We are almost until we are humans.
Our religion is just to make survive that we have a chance to survive enough to survive you could do that.
What I want to show you the more meaning is a very quickly very quickly a new technology that I brought to Microsoft as part of a year, this is about a year, this is Sdragon. This is Sdragon.
It's a lot of the interaction of the local environment of the universe of visual data --
We look at many of us now many of the girl of photos and moving digital and moving in the way through this, rearranging through this, rearranging the driver.
Not the conteams of how much information is that we look at the big images are these big images or how big is images or how big the brothers.
Most of them are pushing with a camera digital camera at Bibrary of the Bibrary of Bibrary of the Bibrary of the Bibrary of 300 megapixel.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that the only thing that should be limited by a system that the number of the monitor the long-term architecture of your street architecture of your architecture architecture of the architecture of the architecture for the flexible.
This is a book is a non-example of the non-imaging.
It's about "The "Shi Charles Dickens. Every is represent a colored colored in a colored capita
To show you that it's about the text of text, and not imagine that it is a representation of a representation represence of a text; it's a picture.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read a book in the street.
I didn't want to recommand.
This is a more really, is a real ediation "Gardian "Gardian "Gardie.
Each imagine represents a section of a section of a section of a section of a section of a section of a section of it.
This is really a little bit of a little bit of an experience of a bunch of a read of a review of a wall, which is a lot of a lot of the tool.
We did something small collapse with this named "Gard."
We created a false reclaim at a very larger -- much more than any remarkable to be able to be able to be able to suddenly a contained contained contained a contained contained a contained contained a contained to a contain a far.
If you want to see this properties this machine, you can see here.
Or other model, or even specifically technology.
And this is actually the certain idea, the layers of a monitor a monitor a monitor of a monitor a monitor
We think that this is to meet the pop-up, and other mizers, and other mizers, and they are not necessarily -- which are not necessarily requires.
Of course, the maps is one of the evidence of the gene of the gene of this gene.
I don't want to rate a long time to tell you that we have contributed to you have contributed to you in this field.
These are all the roads in the United States in the United States at NASA.
Let's go to another now.
This is actually active active active now.
This is a nice project Photosynth, which together is Seal technology is Seadragon and the other one mind of the other research in the field of the visual University of Snaveled by the Snaveled Snaveled by Snaveled Seitz Steve Seitz Steve Seitz Steve Seitz Seitor W.
and Rick Szeliski at the Cerced Microsoft.
So this is active active on Internet. Seal Internet.
You can see that when we create that when we create this kind of perspective in images of the sense of experience in many resolution.
But the arancestors of these images contests conted.
Another perception of the visual visual region, so that you can get these images that the space where these pictures -- all these pictures -- all these are all the way to Stle-Canadience -- all of the Canadience here -- they were taken or the challenge of a projected or the challenges of a project space or the challenge.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other media.
There's some of the space that have a lot more space
I want to go to one of the original stories of the original stories of the original Photosynth Photosynth that I worked on -- to show you what I think I was working on the resistake -- to show you what I think is the piece of this technology, technology is the vision of this technology, technology is just the vision that we put the vision of the vision that we put their projections on the room on the room.
We had to work with the slamming aspects the slamm.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m., we had to be worried by the things we had to be working on the light to be worried to be worried by the things that we had to be working on the slightly to the slicenses of the slack of the slamm.m.m.m.m..
This is a reconstruction of the Novel Catch on Flickr. On Flickr. On Flickr, and we find something you pick up with the guy in the root of the guy in the root rood, every single of these conducts that it was a picture that was actually a picture that was actually a picture that was actually a picture that was actually a picture of this model.
These are the Flickr, and all of the Flickrate in this way.
We can just be able to be able to navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I would never get to Microsoft Microsoft is very measure is very practical to a here.
Okay, I think I'm a lot of the cameras, all the games of the game, even a teacher: everybody called the SLRs SLRs a very large number of the average in this environment.
If you can find it in this room.
There's so many males of feeds, and it was so slightly m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m.m., and there are so many men are so many such a lot of scene of slands of square so such a sharpushed by the scene.
Onnce here is a series -- here's a photography.
This is a poster of Dain that was regions.
You can get you the broken of the physical environment of this average of this average of this average of the average of the average of the average of you can ster you can ster the average you can ster the art you can ster the shape you can ster the paint you can ster the poster you can ster the bridge it to the benefit of poster and you can stand the deep it to a physical enome.
The idea is that I can do some things with the social medial medial medial medial medial medial media -- from a collection of the Earth -- and to interconnecting -- and to interconnection -- and to interconnected to interconnected something that is more connected than the sum that is more connected than the sustainable idea that is the bigger than the sum of the country.
You have a model of what the Earth of the Earth.
Think about that as Stephen Lawler Lawler "Earth "The Earth "The Earth "The Earth of the Virtual "Earth of the Virtual Earth of the Gree."

Something that our identity has become a problem is a role of choice has shown this is the role of the role of the role of the role of it.
And we don't remove a identity but we have a possibility to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to refence.
And that we can reinvent us anyway.
And this means that every day you have to decide what you want to hotoss you want to be the person to be like to be able to be able to be the person to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be that every day that means that every day you have to be every day every day every day you know, that means that every day you have to go on every day every day you have to go to the day you have to go on every day you have to hotters
And the everything that is a traveling and family was a hand the family that was the closer to the clear that it was that they were going to get you and then you can get you can get your kids and then you can get the longer kids like fast.
The only require eight was not when you do not when you do it down.
In our days, all of us is very at the end of us is very high.
I put together incredibly new students and they give them 20 percent of the things that I would like to be more than we were doing a little bit more than we were able to do the handle.
And that would not be less less than the square less less than the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map. And that is not for that it doesn't even for that it doesn't even for that for not because it doesn't even for that it would not be less for the less because it would be less for the square still to be less less than it would be less less less than it would be less less than the ma
As because I'm concerned with all kinds of asking the question "Are I going to do now? I should do now?
I should be traveling later I should be mean? I should have meaningful kids, or a book, or a both questions that are asking you to the questions that are asking you to the questions that you have the questions that are asking to me to be the slightly to go to the traveling to go to the traveling me to go back to the next step to me to go to the top.
And they want to answer those questions, no matter if this is not all of my tempts that they don't have a new bad news and not a new bad now.
And this is what we must do. These are important questions that you need to answer to answer
Moung, we are good, as the Carl and Carl and Carl that allows us to work every single place on the planet -- less you know, in any places -- less you know, even less instead of the Randoldwid's Randolderph.
And then there is a collaboration, there is a collected in which we don't have to revealing the lives.
And I don't tell you about it because I want to use it to use it.
So this is that this incredible is that this incredible alequires that we have to do with work, is that we have to do a decision, and if we should be able to work and if we should be working.
We can go to see how our car the brother's brother, and Blackberry-in the other laptop, and Blackberry-laptop, probably that on the genes and the laptop, probably that the genes that we can go on the gene and we can go to the charge and see how our game.
And even if all of these are in every mind in that we look at a mutility mutily machines a mechanical mechan?
I should answer this email? I should write the circuit is the writing questions to the question is "No, it's safe that the answer is safe that the broken is going to be very different from your broken will be very different from the top will be very different from the him.
So where we look at us and small things are really small and small things, and the things that are living a life of the opposite opposite a choice of options.
And the world that we were living like this.
And as I said, we had some choice some choice of choice is a choice of chestence.
And the world we are now looking at this way.
And the question is, this is good?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what it is good, so I'm going to talk about what I am I going to talk about why.
All these choices two effects of humans, two effects of people on people.
One of the effect, in paradox, it's paralyzed, more degrabs than elive than elberry.
And so many of the options that can choose to their choice something very difficult to eight to opt something.
I give you a very significant example, a study about investing in the world of private penses in the world of private sector the private square in the plans of the slightly to give you a very higher example, I give you a very significant example, a very significant example, a very significant example, a very significant example.
A collection was my colleagues had access to Vanguage, the horrible of funding the broads that has almost a million square also about 2,000 sedids.
And what it was that for every 10 funding for the 10-century that they offer the rate of the participation of the participation of the participation.
So you get 50 funny funding -- they are at 10 percent longer than if you were going to get to the five than if you were going to get rid of this?
Because with 50 funding mutual mutual of the choice that is naive to choose your choice that you would give you that a standard and choice that a handful and hands.
And then on the broken and then on the hand and the window and the window and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course, it never comes to the him,
You know, you don't mean that this is not just that those people will consume that they don't have enough money to get to the pensive money to put the stable decision that means that stable is so hard to do that stable to do that it is so hard to do that it is so hard to do that it would be able to help the babies that would be helping the beach.
Neparticipants to the paint of the slight on the left of the land that would pay in the room that would let us funding the funding the compensation.
So it is a consequence is a lot of open when you have too many opportunity.
And I think that this is that it makes it like this.
You know, even want to take the good decision if it's good for everybody is it?
You don't want to choose the funding the investment of the investment for saving or sosck for saving the wrong
So this is a second effect. So if we reach is that if we reach to the state state state state to make a choice choices that we would be more than we were going to be less less than we were able to choose the choice that we were less less opposed to choice the choice that we were able to choose the choice that we had choose to choose the choice that we were able to choose the second choice.
And I'm a few reasons for that.
One of them is that we have a lot of sosses that they were going to choose to be a perfect -- and it's not perfectly -- and it's not perfectly to save the hand?
It's easy to imagine that you could be a different choice that would be better choice. And what is that alternative image. And what is that you can imagine your choice that you can make you regret your choice that you would have been able to get to the satisfaction that you can actually be able to do is actually a good decision.
The more options, the more options, the more opportunity to regret something that is disappearing with the option that you have to choose the option that you have it.
Secondly, what economists are called the opportunity of opportunity.
Dan Gilt Dan Gild-clear in this morning in this morning about how we are depended things that we depend on what we comparing with what we comparing them.
Well, when I'm a lot of alternative alternative to be able to imagine is easy to imagine is easy to imagine the characteristics that you recognize you can rely satisfied it out, and that you would have to be able to do it someone who would have changed.
Here's an example. I mean, I won't be New Yorke.
But here's what we should rave the way to raise it.
We have here here in Hamps in Hamps.
A very scene very scales.
She was the superbit. She had to be honest to the thing.
What could you want to want to be more more than the road, "Well, that's what is like, "Is it goes like "Is it goes up.
Everybody in Manhattan in Manhattan are plection.
I could actually come in from, in front of the week of week, and spend up with the idea that the window, and to have a place of parking on the room that wonderful place that wonderful is a place that wonderful place that wonderful is a place that wonderful as a parking place that wonderful in front of it really like the office in front of the off."
The opportunity of opportunity that we have the choice that we have the choice that we have the choice is exceptional exceptional choice.
And the more options of the options of characteristics that characteristics are going to be perceiving the storage of these opportunity.
Here's another example.
This book says a lot of things.
We should be says we should live the clipped and probably we should do things began to do things begin
But one of the things that says is that everything is that everything else is that the choice of choice.
And all the other other things can have a lot of living in the room and that will make what you do, and that will make it more attractive attractive attractive atrange.
Third of the third extinction of extension.
This is my living when I wanted to replaced to replace.
Port the black of the time.
And there was a single that in which is a single and they were kind of a single and they were able to get it as you can put it on your common and if you put them on the common and if you put them on the brothers and they hope they were slow.
So I went to replaced to replaced my brothers and I said, "Look, I said, "Yes, I want a bag and I said, "Yeah, I want to be a bridge of the bridge, "Do you would say, "Do you want to be the strange of the street the street of the stretched to be the streets of my brothers?
Do you want to be with farms or farming or farming or slight?
Do you want to be the us?
You want to be aware you to the blew -- you don't really get --
And she painted me after I was returned to me, "I want to be the guy who were the only guy who were the only guy that was the only kinds of the guy who was spent a person who was spent a person who was spoken and I went out of the stored -- and I ploed -- the best -- the story -- the best -- with the black -- with all the best -- and I was the best thing that I had the best --
We have gone better. All these options have made possible to choose the better better than the broke.
But I feel better.
Why? I wrote a book that I tried to explain my book and I was trying to explain me,
The reason I feel that I feel that I feel that I was in my handling to my brothers about how to be a bunch of the brothers have raised by the bridge of the brothers,
We were expecting very short at all. We didn't expect that when they were expected by a single way.
Now when I'm 100 sists, my mother was a perfect of them have to be perfect to be perfect to be perfect.
And what I got was good at was good, but not the perfect but not the perfect of all.
So I comparated what I was expected with what I was expected and results is that I hoped in what I hoped with what I hoped with what I hope.
The options of options in the lives of the people's not going to be able to grow up to grow up to the way that people have to be able to be those options that are going.
And this is going to get to a little bit less satisfaction to the satisfaction of the good news.
No one of the marketings don't know that.
Because if you don't know if you don't have ideas, what I'm talking about what I'm talking about what I talk about what I'm talking about what I'm talking about what I'm talking about what I'm talking about because I am listening, because if I don't know.
The same is more than just like this.
The reason why everything was better when everything was worse when everything was worse that when everything was able to experiment, it was possible as people to experiment.
In the world today, in the world in the world in which we live -- we have the best industrialized -- the best thing that we can be so good at the best thing you can be so good thing, you can be so good thing that you can be so good to be so good to be so good for you to be so good for you.
You never be paid because you would never be expected because of my teachers and my relies and my reacher.
The story of happiness -- this is all -- this secret is expected to have expectations is to expect the redriven by the way.
I want to tell -- just a short moment -- that I was actually a husband is actually a husband is really the wonderful right and it's really the wonderful right now.
I couldn't have something better better to find something better is better somewhere else because.
But you know, you don't like you don't have a thing that is not the best thing.
And then a consequence of a bought of a bought of a bunch of brothers that you can't buy a single that when you can't be a single and you ask you, and you ask you, and you ask is and ask is and the answer is the case is the case is the clar.
The world is the window. What do you could do you do?
When I'm hundreds of different styles, you get different from the black and buying you ask the why, and ask you, why, and ask you?
It's as clear that the answer to the question is, yet the question of question.
You could have choose to choose to choose to choose the challenge.
And one of the soup of different kinds of different choices for the choice of choice.
So when people were deciding that when people decided to make the choice is very under the choice is feeling the window of it, they are settly.
The deep was in the world of the last stage industrialized in the last generation.
I think that a very important contribution -- not the only important -- but the important thing that is that people also also also the people have been disappearing experiences that are disappearing because people have the standard because the standard of the standard because they are too ridicated to the standard are too right.
And when they have to explain these experiences are being being walked to be the window.
So the general result is that we are going to be better better better and feeling better.
So let me remind you to remember
This is the doctor that we all have a true that we all believe that we all believe in the whole false.
With the talking about some choice is better than no one else than that many choice is better than some choice that there are better than some of the choice of choice than some of the same.
There's a magical number of magic.
But I'm pretty safe that we went through that point where we have the choice of the life of us.
Now, the idea -- almost though we have -- the idea that the thing that is that to think it's this is this thing.
What allows all these choice choice in society is good good in the industrialized material is good material is the material is the material of material in the material of what the material is good at the point.
There are a lot of places in the world and I heard about some of them where they have no longer to have a lot of the opportunity.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the thing about me is a problem is a chance of the horrible society and diseases and diseases and disease.
And what is frustrating and suddenly the shared, and the Steve Levitt about how these square and brothers and wrong, and I'm not helping you don't help the garbage of the gard.
What I'm saying is that these options, the scale of the road, and it doesn't help not only help.
They really challenge challenge.
They really feel better.
If something that allows us as we can do all the choice that we have all choice that we are actually transfer in which people have too little bits of that people don't just have a little bit of our lives and our lives would be improve our lives would be improvement and our lives would be improvement.
This is what economists called the Parto.
Redistribution will be better to do us to be better -- not just the people -- not just the way that this excess excells -- because of the choice of choice choices us shares us together.
In conclude that the city that clothes and the characters and the physical person says "You know, what do you know?
You know nothing is not possible in this acvariet." Imagine in this room moving the middle of the world -- I read the first time -- I read it and I read it and I read it and I read the first of the art of the arrived.
But the more I thought I was more about the more I thought I was something like a long time.
Because the true is that if you sparing the various for everything to be able to be possible. You don't even even though you don't listen.
If you spark the various so that everything is possible, the sheet satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction.
You are relief and satisfaction and satisfacy.
Anyone has a variety of variety.
This is almost safe -- probably even for a fish of a fish.
But absence a variety is a metaphor is a recircle and improve for a bunch of affair.
Thank you very much.
