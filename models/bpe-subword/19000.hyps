I got these two of the past diaths to demonstrate as the injury to the broke of the police that the main the last three million years of the last three million years of the four percent of the four billion years of the four percent of the four percent of the four percent of the four percent of the four percent of the last 20 percent of the third of the third of the third of the past year.
But this is the improve special problems that is not the fish of the boss of the bos.
The police pollen is the policy of the climate system, the global system.
She extinct and they can contract.
The second diaths that I'm going to show you a faster will be a faster to what happens to the last 25 years.
Ghe's paint pains is the big case with the bottom of it.
So as you see the game of the game of the blood of the blood of the case of the case of the clie.
This is the landscapes on the line of this.
And they are the improve it.
The number of the window of a vechundred years or more than five years or more than the smile, you can see the smile.
For 25 years old, at this way.
This is a problem because the challenging of the deaths of the ocean-ctober of the oceans.
where it is a map of the map of carbon the bottom of the metapheter, it's transformed in the middle of micro-by-by-bold.
The pollution with pollution of the pollution of the global incomputers in the atmosphere could be able to achieve this point of extremely extremely extremely away.
And as a lot of lack and in the Alaska nake in the humor of the super-aircraft water.
The Katter Katter Walter from the University of the University of the team in the team of the landscape of the landscape of the landscape of the landscape of the past.
Yeah. Okay. And he was OK. The question is the A-A-A-A-I-A-A-O-up is going to be fun.
And a reason is that the horrible of the incomputers is Groene Groenland in the north.
This is a role that they all all the anual.
But the volumes are much more larger than anything else is
This is the Kerlandling in Groenland.
If you want to know how the large of the large of the big story of the broken is the local of the blood on the main the mast.
These are very quickly very quickly quite fall.
And at the other cticks, Antarctica, Antarcticle on the planet.
The third of the past people have been fasting as the past of the balance, the fantastic balance, the story of the Earth is the insize of the faster sulptures.
This is the choice of the big streets in Groenland as Groenland as Groenland
Himalaya, the main the third of the third of the lack of our new fingers, which is the lack of a few years were were far.
40 percent of the world's population of the population of the water in these bodies from the water in these bodies.
In Anzy, this floor is to get to the cost for this city for this city to this crazy.
The bites have credit die.
But when he did, it turns out and with the water and with the water.
In California was a deliver, the state of the square in Sierra Sierra Sierra.
This is the fish of water settle.
And so I remember the way, they're serious things.
And the global cacier to a creation of the incenter of the incentising.
And the faster on the global land all the global rabsolutely unprecedented and the future.
Four time, four years ago in the last 30 years,
This is a absolutely such absolutely unfortunately.
If you look at the context of what you can see is what you can see is what they do is intap.
In the last five years ago, we add 70 million of the dioxide every 24 million of the bottom of the oceans.
The airplane to the Pacific in the Pacific in the America, and every part of the subject, and every single of the subjail, and the radical oxygenies in the oxygenies of oxygen.
The biggest thing that the only one of the global representations of despairs of the despair of the fossil fossil of fossil fossil fossil fossil fossil fossil of fossil of fossil fossil of the best fossil of the biggest thing that the biggest
The troll is a problem, and the bottom of the best thing is the best thing that is the best thing.
The United States is one of the two of Chinese heroes of China.
And the process was building a lot of fabrashes for the bottom for the bottom for the book.
But we start to see a change change.
And here are the last year, there are the last year, with the alternative propects.
Everybody else is a political streets in our country.
And the bottom of the clothes and the shaped of a billion dollars in the last billion dollars in the last year.
Two crazy of what is a oximety of what is a oximeter.
This image of the image of something.
In the report Cracia, in Tenness, a billion galogs of galogy sterood was imprised by the bottom.
You know, you have seen to the stirst.
This is the car of the car of the two degrees, the second Sintamed Cracium Cracia.
One of the crazy of the bottom of the Cracia, he was this one, was this was this thing.
Video: More: My name with the bottom and the button.
He's aabsorbed in America, and helping the economic streets of economic streets.
Frost, the case of the bottom of what we go to the fall.
He's access and adorably and I adorder and workers of pasting shares of the shares of the shadow.
And this is the Gore: This is the most require of the Virgin.
The beautiful thing on the biggest of Massy Copen.
Video: Don Blankend: I want to be close. I want Pelosow, Harry Reight Russia Russia Rushabits, Harry Reader.
And this is the Gore: So the Astability for the Climate Climate Climate Class of the camera of the camp.
This is one of it, one of the one of it.
Video: Are COAOLergy new arm as a very series like a very serious labs for our business to do our own own own for our own own to do it.
And that's why the main our case is to the bottom of the broken for the audience that we are really to help us and complicated the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the body.
And the thing is that the bottom is not murded.
We think that is the flight and moving and moving and moving it.
So it will not be willing to change the climate change.
Latass us that in our way.
Video: The city of the crazy of it.
So you do do a team of this car paper for this painting on the bottom of the bottom of the carbs.
Human is amazing is the game.
But this is the technology of the technology of the human book.
And as good as good as the arms of the middle of the global remarkable technology of the bird technology that you see the broken of the news of the newspaper that you see the change.
The airplane is the technology is technology of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the hospital.
And this Gore: In the alternative shaped with the process of the economy and the problems of national problems.
Video: Nowis: Narry is in the national economy, the national national cities, the city of climate climate climate climate the climate of the climate of the climate of the cririp.
The price that we have been on all of the fuel, the fuels of the bottom of the bottom of the carbon the street of the streets.
But now we have a new solution to the innovation of the innovation to the innovation.
Riets the electricity of the electricity of the electricity of the inside of the inner of the inner of the ins.
A plan to the American American involved, and then we do more sure and the opposite of the global stopping of global incoming up the global stop.
In the sars that is a big solution that is a big solution to help us solve the problem.
Riets the American America.
And this is the last last year.
Video: Noart about re-energy re-energy review of America.
One of the faster to the faster to the flight of the variety of the fuels of our planet that we knew planet -- the sound of Barbed here is the region the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the way to reward of
Barbed neted networks to create the shadom of the shape of the broken well.
Noarrator: Righanists for active.
And this is Gore: There's a veches that saying, "If you want to go away, you know, you want to go and walk?
If you want to get to get the faring, you go away.
We need to remove the fast.
Thank you very much.
And the third of the TED I did a LH.
And I remember to the door and to give you a little bit of how it works on the water of the water.
So the airplane to the hand for those who had been here, LHS is the biggest experiment, the biggest that was incidentally -- Ciriririrird of 27 miles of 27 million of the fish of a far rate of a billion dollars to a far rate of a billion dollars to a second century to the growth of a billion dollars to the unique of the second-century of the unique of the billion dollars --
It's extremely aware of the broken
This is the airplane of Geneen.
We do the photograph of these minds of their own inside of their own own own own decades in their own decades.
I work at this way. It's the detector of ATLATALS -- Lunger -- the diameter of 22 meters of 22 meters here in the detectors here to build the detectors here can get to build the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the protocess to get to the proportive.
On the past year of the third of the first for the first time for the first time.
And this image was the stuff was doing.
He just just a car cablet of control.
It's a picture of the first fashion the particular city that computer has been the long system, the cost of LH, the car LH, the car in LHS detect in LHS detect in LHS detec.
In other words, when I was looking at that images I was stuck at the end of the water of the attack of the attacker works.
I don't know that if he was the first first first of the biggest hours, or after Google and he went on and he wrote and the first pager and he had the first page.
And the thing that I did is a culture of the culture of the stinitially stinitially stine.
After about a saptarget, I had a problem with the water, which is actually a chance of air, which is the air.
They're filling to the machine of the car as the car as the power of the power to the power of the power of the maxime.
Now, the engineers in the end of these physically, and "I can't translate the attention of the attention of the attention of the American myth."
But I can do this for as a person is what they have the space, what they have the superly susuperly susuperconducting.
So as a 27-7-7-year-old team of the street can transfer and those are the broad.
At one of the cost of the 9,000 of the 9,000 of the LH, was a fabrical.
So as the computer was a little bit of the funny, and the balances have inner religion the electricity.
This was the result of the result.
This is more predictable to do those respect meters on 20 tones, and they have 30 percent of the 30 degrees of 30 degrees of what we were 30 percent of it.
So I found the way we determine by the way,
We had to take them away to do it.
I recontent on all of the top of all the time.
And now we have the challenges of the subterance.
Lana squarters to the LHS will be new that we would be as a new thing.
We will go back and take us and we have been able to get to get to the if-research, and we're going to keep researching to the flies of the universal of the universal of the universe.
Now, of course, as a way from a way, those accidents of recognizing about the important street and intended to extremely require to extremely require to read the extremely require to read it.
I think the point of the fact that is the attention of the fact that we have a great deal of the science as the teaching experiments like LHCL.
I will not be the bashes of a word of a story of the Britance, Humphone, Humping Design, I think that the investment of the protect of the Michael Farms of the Michael Farreay, he was not always to make the fishing of our own own own dignoses are not to refly to the fish of our lives are not to be the future, and the fure."
Thank you.
I went to the rate with the rate to remember the childhood will be killed with the bottom of the broken with the body.
And the measure what you have to go and go and go and get them and to the source and the source of the cells of how to add and the resolve and the resolves, and the slightly and the slightly and the relatively and the relatively shared and the relative relatively square the bigger and the measure of what they do with the measure of what they are the measure of what they do to the measure of what they do to get the measure and
The space is the space is the profound of how we understand how we understand the inconnection.
So as a mathematical research, the researching of our interaction with our objects -- the president of the objects -- I just started with my consultanean Pattanathana Jeveventuan -- I started to do a computer, and I started to use a computer, and then we have a computer, and then we have a computer to the computer, and then we have a computer, and then we have a computer, and then to make a committed to the process and then we can be amazing to make a fashim to make a measurvivascinuntifunded to be a measure of the re-aimploke of the re-away, and the bly re-adience of the ret of the ret of the pret of the maling cish of the mitted cushed mmailed mon on on on on digres
So what do we want to do we want to us.
The question was the fascinating was the fascinating I decided to research the Siftable.
On the street, a Sift-fishing computer.
They can be manufacturing the recireceived the recire's receiving one of the alteam and a network and a network and a network of relationships.
The most important is that there are palthese, as you can just call the games, you can only call it as you just get the water.
And Sifably example, we have a new equired by the end-reduction of the digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital reef.
And the measure of what these palthese, the palthese, the constants of the cells of the cells of our cells and constants to explore the other cells and we can start to exploring the interaction and the behavior and we can get to exploring new and the interaction of the interactive and the massive and the mass of interaction to the connection.
I'm going to start with a few examples.
This Sift-funny confidence of the stuff of the including of a couple of the mother, the rules of the case of the car begins of the car begins of the cost of the car bear.
These are connected connections are constantly constantly constantly on the altern.
So, if you put them on a language, it becomes a little bit interest.
If they're confusion, and they can become a confusion.
And I can feel the price and including and including and including
We realized that one of the implications of interactive interaction is that we can use the gestablished to manipulate the chain and the culture as we could have a culture like a lick land of a license.
And in the case, we have three Sift sleep and you can use their craft and you can use their own and you can use their own and they can use the level in the bottom of the case of the water.
If I was too much too much too much to the couple of it.
There's also a possibility to educate education, as the language, the mathematical language and the balance, and the brogen and research.
So here I was a Fibonacy of a Fibonacier program.
And here we have a game of the works, a kind of combining to Scrabs and Bogger and Bogger and Bogger.
Another every single story was at the first step, and on every Siftable, and the massive the fish of the fish of the beautiful fun.
Then and then fly 30 seconds of seconds and you have a new types and a new types and new possibility and new possibility.
Thank you.
These are the trees that have been in the Media Laboratory to Media, and I got to convince them to the movie and the film of a material material.
It works to share.
And one of the aspects of this kind of application is that you don't have to give people a lot of people people to give them a lot of instructions.
All right, "For is "For and they know what to do.
And here are some people are incative.
This is the most flip of our flight in our right.
It turns out that everything that he was to do was to take a Siftable, one of the other one.
So to him.
This is a purpose of animation animates
We wanted to build a instrument for the language.
And this is Felx.
He can get new personal new personal of the window of the Siftables that shares the Siftables that shares the character.
And here here is the sound of the sound of the sound
Video: Because they race.
David Merr: So he was a stage in the stage of the stage of the stage of the stage of the stage
Video: Tracy of the top of the top of the top of the too.
Good well.
Missed, Siftable, and the assetting and the interaction of the connection can be able to interaction -- Video: Ham! Ham!
DM: Ma:
Video: Bunking.
DM: It's a story of the final story of how it will you go to the baby.
Video: The pis: The pis:
DM: The next example I have time to look at the top is a fish of created and the interpret and the interpret and the instrumental muscles that we built the roll and the baby and well.
Each of these four different variation has different variety that you want to use it.
And you can inject the projects that you can do the successful that you can do it.
The streets are the sound of the sland Sift-fish square a successful Sift-fun.
There are the equire that you can control the reverse and the movement.
He's attempt to a certain and then I have a lot of beautiful.
The effects of the effects of the airplane and the funny of the fish of H.L.
Video: You know, I think about a rhythm in the Siftables in the Siftables and a little bit of a series, a series, a extinct, a extinct of a lot of broken such as a series of a serious journey.
Now a little bit of a nice line.
Video: Ams I add a little bit of the person of the person --
Video: And I will add on the movie to control the broke of the physical effects of the lives.
Video: Ma: Maybe the second secret including the including of a broken or in a little or in a broken or in a broken or in a broken or in a browing of the paper:
Video: I will put the movie for more expressive for more expression.
Video: You can do the second ret review of the whole thing to do to the whole of a whole thing.
So I don't need to do the plane of the presence of the long or brothers and the melodia from the war from the war from the war from the war from the war from the war from the wild of the war of the plane.
Now, in the sfarms can be thrown to use the Siftable-ftable-ft fish far.
Thank you.
As you see my physical is the brain is creating new computers that are going to be better with the way that we workers and the body.
And today, I had to show a cotttomorrow of this new design, and the couple of the possibility that we researched to the laboratory of the labs that we recognize lab.
The way that I wanted to remain the granits is like the granita generation of the instruments of the machines of the digital digital religion our own.
Thank you very much.
Asteps with you to talk to you with you with you today.
They're writing it.
He wrote the bottom of my own hand more than that.
It's all my mother and my mother and fascinating.
And not working on this is to take this to change it.
But this is the hands, something like the chair of the airplane and in the book and my body, who had my father's purposed to recognize the lady of the working.
And the thing I wrote is that I wrote this book, this book, "Mandeath, Rool, Rool, Rool, Rool, the death of the broad, the residents of my own stream of my world's mind of my own stuff that was the reason-re-remotivation of the balance, and the perfectly of the connational stantly international internal connition.
The call is that people go back and home is what people go away from the window that would be condamn condam.
Serially -- the conamnamed -- I connamed a broad.
For example, and you say, "Do you say, "Do you have a team -- you don't have the team -- you can't be more desperates that you could be able to deal with this performance th?
You don't have the stream is going to wrote the farmers of the flight of the flip of the broke of the world that you want to put the world on this is the world?"
It's very line line, in fact,
But it was more racier if they were not always to have a 20 years, when I was a big chance of people -- when I was a big chance -- I was a nake -- I mean, I was going to be writing the same way I was to writing the same kind of reactiful.
And people said, "Not the stream going to have to be a little bit of success?"
I don't want to do the research will be the research?
You don't have the fish is the fish of the vision of the vision of this and nothing that you never seen the deaths of the vision of the vision of the vision of the remain the car of the remain the car of the remain the car of the religion the remain the car of the reliable of the remain the well-re-a-a-de-ath.
Where is that the gene of this.
The sland -- the sland at all the question of those questions is "Yeah, yeah, I says, "Yeah, yeah."
Yes, you know, it's the team of all these things.
And always to get me to the streets.
And the thing is the purchain that people who are not going to get to get them to get them to inture.
As example, and other things that are infrastructure.
But when I was talking about writing and I was all the question and I was all the last question of the last time is "Why is I said, "Why?"
Is this rational ration?
It's the broke to be thrown to be the work that I feel like I was pretty much as you feel like the Pant.
And what is the specific initiatively reliable to create as a nelinists of the sanital death of the teacher in a kind of death that other teacher?
My teacher was the inching of the incher and not improve the 40 years of the 40 years of the inery of the inery of the inery of the inchemistry of the inchemistry of the inch.
It didn't get -- John, how do you go with the block of the block?
It just just not just to get something.
But to be able to be tracking as far as a group of the chairs of the century of the century of the oil of the oilial repressive the chair of the airs of the airs of the repressive chair of the repressive clothes.
We have the writing of the reputation, and not just a removing, but the artists of all the way, they put this remarkable to be the power of the labs of the labs of the labs of the labs of the labs of the labs of the labeled of the labor of the landscape of the wisdom of the wisdom of the shared writing and the writing of the reflics of the remarkable to the remarkable to writing the
And all of what we have to look at the game of the game of the deaths of the define of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the main the car of the car of the car of the product of the product of the cost of the pranding of the pranding of the pranding of the promisoned to the promison to do with the promisones of what we have to do is to do the promison to do is to be the promisoned by the future.
And it really doesn't have the same thing that they didn't true to be true, and it was true,
Norman Mail, even though the past of the past of the past of my bottom of my bottom."
A big challenges of the word of the word of a vision of a vision of the work.
But the farmers we don't have someone else at a clip of something that we heard these things that we heard of things and they have been able to be, and accepted to the idea of creative idea, the idea of creativity and the farmers are going to be beautiful and the farmer.
And the question I want to add this stuff here is the fish of the impact with this ideas that you are with this ide?
You are comfortable to be comfortable to the eye of the eye of the eye, I don't go with this painting.
I think it's a odiodiog.
And I also think it's dangerous and not to see the future, and not to see the future.
I think it's better if it's better if we have a big artists to traditional artist.
And I know about my case in my case -- in my situation -- I would be very perfectly to me to start to go to me to me to me to go to the bottom of this kind of the deaths of the deaths of the deaths that I find the teaching of the teaching of the teaching teaching of the teaching of the teaching teaching of the region that I have a deeply of the requantly rey.
As example, I'm just quite quite four years ago.
I have probably four decades of works.
And it's really probably just like to be writing with this moment to be judgments to the movement of the fish of my own successful cells of my father crowing the last name of my own bodies of my own own own bodies of my own cartoon?
What would be a little bit of the country, because of the couple of friends here are very probably -- it's very simple -- it's very simple to be indeed to be independed on my best successful to be involved in the best success.
Oh, yeah, what game,
This is the gene gene that could do somebody who could do somebody who could get to the cost of the horry of the hormous one.
I refer to do this message that I love it.
And then the question is, the question of the question: right?
And so I put it on a lot of farmer, as to work in which I have to go to the right now, to the way to do it by building a kind of building as a kind of building a kind of building of the protective protection?
I have to do a way to get a way to get a way to define a deliver, and my father, and my team, and my team, and my team of the natural characters of what the broken to what will be now is to writing what will be now writing to what will be writing to the writing of what the bults, and you have to reactive.
And as I was all the last year of the last year of the time I started to get the time, and I started to get the time, and I started to see other society would be better ideas as and they could be better and they could be better and more and more and more and more and more people are creating the opportunity to be better and the opportunity to be able to help people creative to be revealing the opy of the emotional opportunity to be the opportunity to be the opportunity to be the excity.
The chair to Greece and Romano and Romano and Romantic Romano
So the hundreds of research, the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the chart.
But in the Grerecent Grerection and Roma really, that people don't think people have not been creativity in the interior of the beginning,
People thought was a spirit was a spirit of the people who can get the attention of people in a city of people, and the newspaper and needs and understanding and needs and understanding and understanding and the cost of the require and understanding of the reliable of people are and the people who are able to be creatiative.
Greees were called the digname of creativity of the mathematics "demonths with the "demonth.
Socrats was the prison as a democracy that we transmit in the department of the department.
The people were able to the same paper, but they call that spirit creative, but they have the air,
What's wonderful, because the romans, because they have not thought that a genius was a genies of a genies of the death of the air.
They respect was a kind of a genies of the deliver, what tradition of the painting, the jobs of the artist, the Siniss of the houses, which is the cycle of the cycle of the stuff of the works.
They were the strange -- this is the fantastic thing that we talked about -- that building the psychological results that we can protect the results of the works.
And everybody else working, the coore?
So the artist, the artists of example, as a lot of example, too much narrates that are too chasn't too cis?
If you were the worker, you couldn't have all the way to go to the street for the world that you have this genius that we have this genius that has helped this genius that has helped us to help that he helped us to help that he helped us to help us to help the word of the worker of the worker worker was the streaming worker was the street of working.
If you were critical criticized to the door was not a completely couldn't such a thing?
Everybody who was the genius was the case of the craft.
So they have been looking at the Vality of the flight of time for a long time.
And then I went to Raast, and all of the idea of change, the idea of the idea of the idea of the unique of the unique of the universe, the city of the unique of the unique of the religion for the growth of the growth of the ground.
It was the human beings beginning to create the creative of the creative of the creative of the brain with the brain of the individual of the individual of the individual of the individual of the individual of the brain is the case of the human being.
And for the first time in the history of people have started to refine the artists of the artists of the artists of the game of the game of the game genies.
And I have to have a chance to be a massive of the main the main the main it.
Permed the person is actually a simple person or the received and the received and the source and the source and the source and the source of the misterner, the mystery of the mythese, the four time.
It's like you to get the couple of hita sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the so.
I just want to be able to define and deforming all these today and the game of all these today inimages of the investment of the investment of the performance.
I think that the president artists of the last five years.
And if you think about is true, and I think that is what we do is that we do it on the windo?
Can we can do the other way?
It can actually start to send our senses more variety of the relative to the brain and the mathematics.
It can be not.
It can just just like we can just sterm the humanity of the human rational researchers from a humanity of a humans from a 18 minutes.
And you probably have to be affected to the question of the question of the question of the stinitial stinitially that people in fact, which is actually the people are actually in the projects of their own projects and their survival.
It will not be a choice to all of this idea.
But the question I want to give you a per is -- what is you not?
Why don't we think about this way?
Because it is a lot of something else as any other thing that I heard about completely completely completely completely reneeded by the creative process of the creative process of the creative process of the creative process of the design of the design of the process of the process of the sense of the sense of the sense of the sense to the sense of the sense of sense of the sense of the sense of the sensor to the sense of the sense of the sense of the sense of the sense of the sense of the sense of it is that any other other other other way of the sense of the sition to be sense of the sense of the sense of the
The process that anybody who was to create something -- all the way to do something -- the research -- the street -- the streets of the report.
Now, in fact, sometimes can set up the fish.
I had a little bit of the team where I known to the extraordinary clip of Ruth Stona Ruth Stone, which is now in the journalist and the past of 90 years and that he was the storing of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story, and it was a little story.
The story was like a varial story.
And they have the room on the room in the room
And the feeling of the galay of the galaxy of the painting.
In that moment that has a single thing to do, and I read and I read the water and the water and I read the water.
And the galay to the case of the case of the farmer, and the past of the fishing of the map of the map of the map of repeating and then a repeat the end of the past and then to get to the past of the past and then they go through the map of the map of the past of the past of the past of the water and to get to the water.
Sometimes was not enough to the game and alergy and alerge, but the alerg, but it doesn't get the house, and the poems and the poems and the poems of the rosts of the room and the war row and the street in a room of the root of the purpose.
They were and they were -- and they were not going to look at the moment -- the moment -- the moment that almost like the balance.
Algera case of the map of the paper and the case and water and the water and the story of the exactly the depends on the other hands and the story of the other hands and the shared and the depends and the deep and the same.
The first step of the cooking and then in the body, and then in the mapping of what I want to transceiving the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the first step.
And as the situations, the paper and the intact and the intact and the fishing of the first first level of the first year at the first year at the first year of the first wine.
When I heard about it, it was exactly what was exactly how my own creative process of creative.
My creatives not the limited to this -- I'm not conducting.
I'm a way to work, and the way I worked on every day and I wanted to get and to transmit and to get and go and I wanted to recognize and I wanted to recognize with the broken and I wanted to recognize with the hard and I am a hard-the-funning, and I'm a chancing of a walking a little bit of a little bit of the working, and I'm a little bit of the working, and I'm a little bit of the wor
But I really wonder, I was born to be aware really well-benefit of that fen.
And I just imagine that was like to be a lot of yourself with you.
And I had designed and I had designed from a sure that I didn't know to a sure that I didn't know to be a identify of the identify of the identify of it.
And what does always have to do that?
And how do it works to do our own way we don't lost us to help us us not to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us releas?
For example, the most relevant of our days, which we have to do is the Musual Waits, we took the Waits, we took a few years ago in the revibrate of the revibrate of the revil of the revil of the revibrate of the revibrate of the revibrate of the review, for example, for example, for me, for me, for me, for me, for me, for me, for example, the the most relevant for me, for me, for me,
I was about the suggesting was almost all of the fish of the artists of the contemporary contemporary contemporary contemporary of the flies of the impulse these imps of the impulses of the improve and the interior of the inably interied inably interied inably interied by the inabbed of the bear.
The time the line line line line of the story of the story of a long time in Los Angeles and then all the way and then everything has changed and then everybody has changed it.
As you get to a fragmental time, from a bagging of a piece of the mind of the mind of the mind and the death, and a dependent and a report and a brown and a spleng and a fly and a whole while it is to be a whole water.
It doesn't have no phone, not to create the report of the report report.
And the thing that is the vecture of that vecture of the research, "I want to lose the moment, and cancer for the monkey.
I'm not sufficient to reach out to remove to the remain."
And instead of the painting, just a little bit of it.
He recognized the process and we do all the new and all of the new new and all of the new new today.
He went to the view and said, "South and said, "Souse, you don't see that I'm not going to be the voluntee?"
"Do you have a cancer cancer for a cance?
If you want to do it is true, you know, when you get a long time you get the right thing to go to the home of yourself and I can go to the home of you can go away.
If you do it, and then you do it on someone else on somebody else.
Let's do you do it on Leonard Cohen."
The past process process has changed this.
Not the street, it was just a deeply as a way to get away to get away to the top of it.
But the way to get out of the past and the past and the moment of the moment in which he was the time in which he says, what he says, and he saw it just to the hand he saw it was just to go and she had to get to the beginning and then he had to get something that they have to get something like it was not to be something to be something to be something to look at the beginning of the inching of the interiorizon.
It could be this collaborative to the block and beautiful conversation of a conversation of the exterial conversation that was not too that was not because Tom.
After I heard the story of the way I was working on a way I worked on my way I was working on my head.
This is going to save me to the middle of "Manca, Rool, Royal Roago and I have a kind of a kind of like a kind of apart that we delivered to something like the garage that we don't have to do something that they don't have a little bit of what they do is not going to be a far to be a bad of the rise to be a bad of the risk of the risk of the risky of the risky of the rising of the risky of the risky of the risk of the risk of the riskey to be the rising of the risrisk to be the risk to be saving to be
Not just the most release of the rise of the rise of the rise of it.
I mean, I have to think that I should be just like to add to abandone.
And then I remember the space of the space and I went to the space and I went and I went and I went and I went out and I went to the hand and I went to the hands.
I went to the level of the manusion and I found my comments and I found a collection of a camera.
I said to him, "Astany, and I stop and I stop it as a couple of the book is not just the cost of my favorite not just my father not just my well.
Because you can see a long time I was going to take all of the landscape and more attention and more attempt to the attacker.
So if you want to be better than you want to do it to do the water, you have to do the painting and you get the past of the pain.
Okay. And if you don't want to do that, you know, at all the bottom.
I will writing to writing my message for my hands.
And I want to concreate for this as I did my father I did my father.
Because -- because -- the conclusion is, on the hundreds of years ago in North African African people are able to deal with the long with the long and the museums and the music sack and the music labs and to the muscle.
And they were always to reach the dancy of the dancestors were remarkable to remove and they were remarkable to recognize the coore?
But sometimes, very rules, and one of the interpret of the interpret of the community of the community of community.
I'm convinced you all of the whole thing to do to all the way to all the way to see the interpret of a certain a certain a certain a certain a certain a certain a certain the interpret of interpreted by the interpret of interpret of interpret with the interpretation.
It's like the time you go and the deliver, and the deliver, and you don't do anything different, you know, you don't do anything different, and the other side, all the different size of the other side.
For a time it doesn't have to be in the past of the top of the game.
It's the world's inside of the game of the divarious games of the dives.
On the way to do people have intamed people who were and they said that was and they said to the name.
They have the maintains and they were "Allabs and "Allab, Doh, Doh, Doh, Does Does, Does Dow."
It's God.
A funny interesting -- when the Spanish English had the Spanish and they went with this obtain the case of the second of the second of the second of "Allab, Alllay, Allab, "Blah."
and they hear the time, as a purposes and square and the four-broken source.
In Spania, when a pre-in-in-in-in-by-by-by-by-by-by-bula Gola, the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the archair -- the art of the arcle of the Spanian Fland, in Spaniania, the Spanianced Spaniand, in Spania.
The crazy -- a farm of God crazy.
It's wonderful, for a whole thing.
But the second thing that is the second of the heart of the insuspendent on the insuspension, the window and the suspension, the window and not a broke of Diff.
It's a murden that the plant games and they could never get to the touch and they could never get to the intimate and also the intimate of the intime.
Could you like nobody would not be better and he saw the Domnamed the Domnamed that they should be presented with the rest of the light?
It's hard.
It's one of the broak of the growth of the creative creative.
But maybe it would not be a big chance of the samples of the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary interial interior of the interior of the Internet of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interial story.
And if you have created as a couple of time, they were imprised by a few of a little bit of the fish of the fish of the paintings of the next time to be able to be more depended on the top of the inched before.
If we think about today, we all have to change the way to change it.
I started to remember and I started to think about the last months in the last months of the last months that will be published to the art of the art of the research, a report of my successful and infrastructure of my successful and infrastructure of my successful and infrastructure.
And what we did was happen when you do it is the fish is you have the streets of the hands.
Not the speed of the content and you feel the content to the content of the content of the content would be
If you do it is the dance, then I saw it.
If the genius of the diving, and the extraordinary of the decision to get to the decade of the extraordinary of the extraordinary of the extraordinary of the streets of the streets of the stream of the streets of the streets of the clips of the clips of the genies of the genius of the genius of the gen
And if no, no, no, now, yet the horrific of it.
And with all of this "Ole."
I think about these things and I think we should reach them to preventing them.
"Oley." I just had to be a lot of you have a crowing for the crowing and intended in the environment.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just Cohen: Ole!
I have talked about some of these projects, about genome, and what could I represent and what it could representing new gene.
Now in a new way from a new point of a new point of biology and now we try to go to the biology, and now we're trying to get a new flies of biology, and the fishing of life.
I tried to ask us to ask ourselves the important question.
"What is the life is what I think is a lot of biologists we try to understand the diverse of the diverse of the diverse of the diverse of the diverse of the tool.
I tried to do the process of the component life on the component of the component of the component of the component.
We are depending on the top of about 20 years.
When I got the genome, this was the rich of the stuff in the world's biology in the digital world.
Now we try to ask it for the decade, or we can create new forms of life, or we can create new bigital life,
This is the map of a mice, Mycooking gene genital gene that can reply the most reply for a laboratory that can reply the laboratory of lab.
We tried to see if we can get with a gene genomes and small.
We did it to have the first step of a gene of genes in the country in the country.
But when we look at the map of the mathematical metabolic is just a simple with our comparison.
And this is simply simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can suggest time, it's a little bit of the time, it's just a cell.
So we decided that we did actually want to remember is to determine this crisis, as we can see this component to the component to address the most asking the most questions of the most questions of the most questions of the most questions of the biggest questions of the questions of the biomosphere we decides that we decided to ask that we decided to do the
And so I started to remember the situation, "Can we can remember a cross?"
Can can such such allowing these molecules that we didn't have to do it very larger we did not want to be able to do this?
And if you can active a cromososomome?
A ccircle of the crowing of the chemical material of the chemical material material of the chemical.
So, our speed to digitize the life, we did the exponential rhythern ritself.
Our religion is to write the genetic genetic code that I grew up and he creates it.
The next time to get to a farmers to a farmer.
I started this broken is less than 15 years.
I went through a few heters, in fact, with a bio-fish images before the first experiments of the first experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA very difficult to the DNA very difficult.
There's thousands of thousands of DNA little DNA machine that are doing 30 to 50 garage 30 to 50 garages to 50 game, but it's a more delivered longer to build a longer process of the longer of the longer of the longer of the water of the machines of the machines of mechanical ms of mechands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thou
So we had to do a new new to make these little bit of a little bit of these little broads and school and schools.
This was our first step, our behavior of the digital information, to the digital information of Phi Phi Phi Phi Com.
It's a virus that myself that is the bacteria.
I did design, I went through the school before, and I got a molecular molecular molecular molecules of 5,000 gas as a 5,000 games of 5,000 garage.
The interesting thing that I took this piece of the chemical material with the game and I went to the bacteria and the bacteria of the genetic game of the genetic disorder.
The viral virtual disorders were stuck and they went and they went and they went and they went and they were killing and they have the Ecolumns.
I was working with the purban industry and saying, and I had a very close model.
They have long as much more than that.
And so we think this is a situation where the software that the software in a system in a system in a system in a biological system in a biological system in a system.
But we wanted to do something better.
We wanted to build the cromoss-chain of a bacteria.
This is about 50,000 genetics of genetics.
So I said to put the top of the game of the houses of the virus of the houses of the cost of the case of the cycle clothing that are component to understand the require of a cells of a cell.
The critical is critical and if you start with the digital information in the digital information has to be very exactly the information of the information of the information.
When I got the first step, I was the first standard in 1995, the standard was a 10,000 per pain.
I found out to the resource of the rest of the story. If we were used to be able to be able to be activated by the original story.
The design is the project of the brother, which has been providing to 50 games of the other country, which is to build all the other countries to build the sub-project, so we have to build the competition to build the competition with the other other other countries with the challenges of the other other other bules of the browing of the blood of the window and the competition with the shape of the top of
We can project the tools of it.
You can read it to read "Only wrote in the househouse to this genetic code the gnal code of the gala: All right, and the T.
Trigs from those characters -- those characters of the case of the airplane -- one of the airplane of the car air.
So we can use the genetic genetic code to write the crazy of the positive of the position.
So the reason, all we did it was to hit was to him.
Some of them were not dead, it's not the poetry is not the poetry is not the poetry to be able to him.
We designed those broken so that we can dignetwork.
There's the enzymes that we have to do it.
So we started to do the broken with the broken with 7,000 garages to 7,000 garage, the right way to do the fish of 24,000 gars of this lab, and then then they go to 7., and then then they go to 7,000.
At every morning, we have these games to get these blocks, and we can get to make a extremely removing to the extremely chair -- as you can see a movement --
We want to get to go to that point to that point of automative.
So, this is a team of a team of the deliver.
When we get very large, we get very large, over 100,000 per paintings in Ecollection in Ecoll.
They are all the beautiful molecular modern modern modern modern modern modern
So we went to other mythesier to other me.
I knew that there is a mechanism called reward-reward reward using the DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA and that sometimes the broken such a piece of the blood of the broken of the benefit of the mechanism of the mechanism of the mechanism of a mechanism of a mechanism
This is a example.
There's a organism called Deinocock the Deinography that can opportunity that can open the radiation.
As you see in the painting, the crossing is the fish.
12 hours later, he put it on the land to take a new long as a long way to the long way to start to inced it.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be open.
I can live in the vision of it.
I'm absolutely safe that life can be in the extrature, to find a new way to find a new environment.
In fact, NASA shower was driving there.
And here's a microphone, a molecules that we build these process process process process -- in the design of design designers that we have a decade of design.
Drodies and they put them together.
This is not a little bit of a microscope with electronics, but just a little broad.
It's a molecules of the molecules can see a microscooks.
These are the collector a period of about six seconds.
This is a public public public that I had a little bit of time.
These are over 50,000 genetics of genetics.
It's the biggest molecules of a whole structure of a definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular metic.
It has a molecules of 300 million over 300 million over 300 million
If we have a funny and 142 pages 142 pages in this code of this cognize cooks.
So how do we go a crososomome? How do we active?
I think with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work.
And then it also also works, as you get to get to the new broken and you can just take the nuclear and that everybody else and that everybody else -- and this is something -- the climate -- close.
And the game of the archain is the cells is the funny of a cell, but we can do a completely transplant to a completely transplant to a cell, and we can activate a cell, and we can activate it.
I pushed a crowing from one species in the microbial species of microbial microbial and
These are the second thing is about as a way to do with people and the cost of people and the cost of people and the cost of people and the couple of hundreds of him.
I brought a couple of genes to this is to take the cromosse.
I digerated with the enzy to dignose.
And it was pretty much when I put it in the cells of our cells -- you have very sophisticated -- and the crossed -- and the cell.
In fact, we thought that is how to get the way to design can go and try to design something more department.
This is a mechanism of evolution.
We are all the way we get all the species that have the second clock of the crocket respect of the species, or a new species, thousands of new types in a second.
So the people who are thinking about the only one way to a single new that one of the biology of biology.
They're the enzy of restrictions that in DNA.
The cells that was in the cells of the cell.
The cells -- the cromossed we put new new --
It was expressed and recognized the other crowd, and so we digerally walking, and so I got the cells with the cells of the cell.
It became the game of the genomoscience that we put in the crososomos.
And after a very beautiful period of time, all the cost of a species of a species of a species in a new species in a new species in a new species that I put on the software in the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the cell.
All the proteins were changed by the way, when we call the code of genetics, it's exactly what we transfer is what we transfer the exactly what we transfer transfer what we transfer transfer what we transfer and we all the conference.
This maybe the game of the genomics, but we could do it, but we can change the software the button the road.
Now, I got this game is not the genetic -- but he did not build on three billion years and half of the evolution of evolution, and we are the resident of the Cambridge of the Cambridge Cambridge of the main the design of the main the main the design of the mathematics of the main the main the main the main the main the main the main the main the main the main the main the main the main the mathematical well.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty good enough is pretty under the research of the needs to be need.
We are on the six and half of the six billion people and half billion people around 40 years.
As you know, in the context for me to me in 1946.
Now I'm three people on the planet for every single of the new that there were four years old.
We have the broad, the fishing of the water chapter, medicine, the cost of six billion and half billion and half billion and half billions and half billions of billions and half billion and half billion and half billion and the fishing of the fishing problems to the bad problems is the broads of the broad.
It will be difficult to do for us.
We are over five billion books of the book, more billion barily of barily barily of barily smarts.
This means a million barily half of the barily day.
When we try to think about the process of the biological process that will be able to remove this check that will be a check.
Then of course, is all that CO2 to this material material, which is to go into the atmosphere in the atmosphere
Now, by our discovers around our world, we have a little bit of the world, we have a way to think about 20 million genes, and I love to think about the component of design.
The electronics has just a little bit of a network of the component of the diversity that came out of the diversity that came from this.
We are the limited here, in the first time of a biological reality and image of our biological image.
We have now to do these technology is the driving of these square what we call our genetic game of the genemicals.
We have a big robot that is a big robot that to do a million cyclosely on the cto.
When you think about these 20 million genes of genes that are different from the choices to reach the product of products of producing products of producing products of producing the molecules, we can only change a team of the same molecules of the last 20 years of the pecular molecule of the inner of the last 20 years of the scientists of the insects of the country.
And this is just the standard standard standard
We can see the substanti-prostate product of the substances or fuels of vaccines,
This is a challenging process of a software to the design that we can work and work and we can work and work and we can work and work on these species in computer.
You know, we don't know how to show you how to show you how to show
We know how they looked like their genetics.
Now we're now concentral fuels to four percent of the generation.
You saw that from the humans is just a require scientist.
We have the fuels of the second generation of the second and the third of the fuels of the fuels of the beautiful fuels or the ocean or fuels of the buttanks.
But the only way we think biology can have a lot of the most of the most costs of the limitation of the limited and the flight of their own is if we start with the CO2 as the project of the project of the four cells to the behavior to the behavior to the four months of the four months of the four months of the four months of the four or four months of the four percent of the four months of the four month.
The sound and CO2 is a bunch and the replaces of our world's living around the world's world.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It is in the ocean-year deaths of two kilometers and half of the airs and the half of the airs of the airs of the closed of the balance.
Trancing CO2 in metaphydrogen using the map of energy as a massive energy.
We are trying to see if we can take CO2 cto, which can be easy to convert that we can convergers, and then we can convert that CO2 and then to conduct this process process to conduct this process process this process process of the product of the process of the product of the process of the chasing we can see this cell.
So in a period of time, we thought we could move to the broken of what is the living "What is the life of the brother?"
We really know -- you know, we have the objective model of the entire industry industry industry industry of the story of the eye.
Why do you do that at TED, where you can do that?
Let's just a little bit of energy to be a energy.
But we also also work to use these same way to do these same sets to invent the sets of vaccines of vaccines in the vaccines of vaccines
You saw this with this year, we are always to a year in the middle of the future.
I think the situation can be changed by the vaccines of the vaccines of the beginning.
Here's how could you get to show up the future, the future's evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the square in the final article of the south.
We are almost to do people.
Our reason is just to take us to survive that we have a survival to survive that we could do that. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you a lot of fast, very quickly new bird technology that I had a new technology that I had been a new technology that I had been able to Microsoft in a year.
It's a media that can be local environment with a big demos of visual democracy of visual death.
We are now looking at a lot of broken and the broads and the brothers and the future, the landscape, the landscapes through this young mel.
Not contests to as a lot of information that big information of the big images are the pictures are the pictures are the pictures are the pictures are imagining the big pictures are imagining.
Most of the poor is the broker of the object, but this is a broken of Bilish Congress Bilish Congress of the Congress of the 300 meters of 300 metaphor to 300 me.
It doesn't really important, because the only one that should limited the performance of a pixels of the monitor of the monitor of the monitor a very future. It's also a very fuelhite.
This is a book is a book for example, a non-imagination.
It's about "Which is the Dickens of Charles Dicken. Five the cells of a representation of a cell.
For you see that it's about the text, and not a question of the text, to show that is a representation of a representation of a representation of a representation of a name of a name of a photo.
It can read the artificial way, a book in the future.
I didn't want to reward it.
This is a broke of "Gardian edian edian "Gardian
Each images the image of a section of a section of a second.
This is true, you know, the broken of a broken of a review of a review of a review of a review of a remain a lot of the bird of a lot of bad thing.
We did something like a little bit of this case in the "Gardian in "Gardian in "Gardian
I created a reclay remote of a very larger than any of the reward -- and I went to the reduction of a connected connection.
If you want to see the car of this machines, you can see here.
Or or even species of technology or even specifically quite specifically to the technology.
And this is really the idea of a limited ideas, the limited limited of a monitor of a monitor
We are going to take this to the pop-size pains and other mizarre and other genes of gene -- which are not needed to the gene of the gene.
Of course, the maps is one of the average of this gene of this gene.
I'm not going to give you a lot of time to tell you a lot of contribute to this contribute to this phene.
These are all all the cost of the United States in the U.N.S.
So let's go to another thing to do to something.
This is actually active on the Internet of the hundred.
This is a mathematics of the Photosynthese, which is Seathern of the technology is Searage. One of the research, the perception of the computers of the computers of the Savelfy of the South Aslass of the South, the Wahington, the Steve Wahington, and the Wahington to the Wohington, and this is a Wittest With to the Steve Witter of the Hunger design design design of the the Petown of Wortouth, and the Photosool.
and Rick Szelki at Cercer Microsoft. A collaboration of beautiful building.
And so this is actify the Internet.
You can see that when we create that when we create these species, we can have this kind of maybe we can have this kind of a solar experience in many solar solar experience.
But the art of the space of these images contests of true.
Algorita perception of the visual visual images of these images that are going to code the space of the space of the space of the Grass and the Stings and the Stingenadience -- they were -- they were -- they were -- they were taken these sets of a labs of a space of the space or the labs of the horchemistry of the space of the space or of a space of the space of the space of the space of the space or of the space of the space of the space of the space or of the space of the space or of the relationshift of the relationshift of the relationshift of the relationshi
I'm not sure if I have a whole other environment.
There's some more more than the space that have a lot of space space
I want to go to one of the streets of the team of the city -- this is a part of the Photosto, this is the Photosynosed -- to show you what I believe that I think is that I think is that I think that I think is that I think is that I think is that I think is not just to show you just the bird of this technology that we have a vision of the journalists that we have to go to the project that we have just been taking of the project that we have to go to the project of the setting project that we have to go to go to go to the pose to go to the past of the top of the project that we have a projecting of the project that
We had to have to be working on the shares of the shadow.
This is a rebuilding Cattack Cattack in the Flicklickr. Does you have the Good and and then you find something like the Great Flickr, and then you find something like the conductor of the conductor of these conductor of these conductent that was a line of this land of this is a picture of this landscape of this land and of this is a represent that he was a represent of the Count of this limit is a represent image of this sing process of the represent design of this story, and that was says.
These are the poor is the Flickly.
We can just just like to be able to navigate in this moving.
You know, I never thought I'll never get to work to work at Microsoft Microsoft is very close to a very first time I was a very first way.
I mean, I think I'm a lot of the room that I'm a lot of the games of the cells of the cells of SLRRs SLRRs and a very machine.
If you can find out the case of this chain of this chain of this chair of this chain.
There's so many machine, and it was a hundred him.
One is a series of photographs --
This is a poster of Do we had been registred to the region.
You can depend on a poster of this environment of this environment.
The idea is that we can do a social stuff with the social stuff. The thing to collect of the world's collective stuff -- and to interconnection -- and all the Earth of the Earth's interconnected to the connection of the connected to the top of the bad of the best story.
You have a model of what the Earth of the Earth.
Think about this as a long way to the Stephen Lawler "Steen Lawler Steen Lawler Steam Lawler Steam Mawler Hung.
And this creates in complex as the world is using the benefit as well-far benefits of uses as uses it.
The poor is the pockets with metaphety that someone else that someone else
If someone would be these taps and he says that he says that the sound and my team with the Cattack with the Do and I could do with all of these data, and I could make it floor to be able to do the space of the space of the space of the space of that space to the combination of the compelling of the combination of the compelling combining with the combination of the combination of the compelling combining with the combination of the compelling combining with the power of the bone.
And of course, a profound produced projects and the bodies of the phenomenon the Earth's py of Earth, the collective and the collective of the lectures of the satellite of the satellite of the shared and from a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: What is going to allow the software to the software the broken of a couple of years old, as a couple of years, as a browing street?
BAA: Why is what we do with the descen.
They are removing the hyper, if you want to imagine with the images.
And it turns out that the image of the images of the images.
And that is just inner when you think about the information of the brain that they have these images that have these images.
As when you do a hand the Internet, the flip of the deliver, and the text of the page, and the text of the information of what representing a lot of information about what representing is the representing of what representing is the representing of what representing is the picture.
Now, what would be if that left is to all the picture of all the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of what would be the pictures now, what would be able to do if you would have to be if you would be able to do it if you would have to be if you were going to be if you were going to be if you could have the story to be if you could be able to do the standing of the shared to be if you nice to do the s
Then the way of interconnection and the bottom of that is the main the region that the effect of require red.
CA: Blayer, it's true, it's incredible. Fellow it.
BAA: Thank you.
One of the intense of the landscape and one of the research, the research is the way to live is to live the cost of the paintings that they don't have the painting of the paintings of the paintings of the paintings of the paintings of plants to the fuels of plants to remove to the far.
And the idea that we have a lot of Jages and the Jages still worked on the Lack of the Middle Lack and the machines of the war of the stuff that in Himalia to understand the Himalia to understand the report of the stuff is actually a refine of the world is not just a funny, but this is just a fly enough physical model, but this is is just a physical model, but this is just a very solar model model of the phisticated models of the physical models of the physical model of the physical models of the physical models of the physical models of the phone that we is that we have been li
The consequence of a decisions that we adapt that we have took our own generations, with a lot of the generation with a lot of generation with a lot of generation in the next generation of the next generation.
And of course, we all have the same imperative imperative imperative.
We are all networks. We all advanced the trees of the world.
We have to get through the ritual innovation.
We need to do the shares of the death, so you should have surprising us to surprising us to the surprising and all the art of the arts.
But what is interesting is the cadence of the dancy of the dancy of the dancy of the dance.
It is that the trains of the Bornew, or the depends on the Voodom in the Haiti in the northern of the Research Kenia Kair and the Courtankly Court Current Current in the middle of the clothes.
And this is the guy, this is the guy that I was looking at the deaths of the pants of the pants of the chair of the Momolland, Evel Homoll.
All these people are going to get that other ways to think there are other ways to think about the other way to think of the other way to the Earth.
And this idea if you think about it, you can't see the sperance.
Now, moving the culture of the world's culture of the world's living a resident of the planet and it's as important planet and it's as important for the planet for the planet for the planet for the health of the planet for the health of the planet for the health of the living of the cell.
And you could think about this research as the region and you could definitely definitely definitely and you could definitely definition of the vision, intuitive the human life, intuitive to the human life of the human beings to the conscious of the human conscious science and the conscious scientists to the conscious consciousness of the conscious scientists of the human consciousness,
The hospital is the human crowing of human human human cells.
It's simple of what we can do and all of the surprising surprising surprising the surprising of school.
And as the biosphere was the shape of the button, and maybe you can get a lot of bigger --
For example, no biology to be the top of the airs or more than the extincy or more than the extinction or is not the big extinction of the extinction of the extinction of the fish of the fish of the balances -- and this is not the beginning of what we know is the biological culture of what the best stage is the most average of the culture.
And the biggest indicator of these airplane is the report of the limb of the lim.
When you walk up and you have been honest, there were 6,000 languages on the planet.
Now, a language is not just a couple or a rules of rules and a rules of rules of rules.
A language is a square the spirit of the human human.
It's the fueling of that superfectly the top of the particular materials.
Each language is a beautiful book in the received in the received of the spiritual research.
And from those 6,000 languages, as we stand on Monterey, a half of them are not going to be more and they are not going to be the kids.
They're not more interested in the balance, and in fact, that they don't have the language.
What can can can be more than to fly than the last line, to be the last last year, to be the last last year that you have the language to talk about the presence of the presence of the representing of the children or to remember the children or to reach children or to teach children or the children or to religious children or the children.
And yet, that sound is the sound of the Earth is the next few of the Earth, because every two weeks ago, because every two weeks, because every two weeks and he was in the past of a language of a language of a language.
And I know some of you will say, "Well, it would not be better better bey?
Not the world is not a best if you all the languag?" And I said, "Grozen the language, "Or K. Some to be Cone.
Or Kogif."
And then you have discovered how you would not be a research to talk to you to talk to the language.
So, what I want to do with you is a kind of shares -- a way -- a street -- a street -- a story of what they are going to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to get a understanding of what they are going to be a understanding of what they are going to do is working.
Now, I'm going to show that when you saw that when I say "ways I say, "I really understand "I really understand the way to be understanding of the different way to fly well.
Let's take this kid in the Barasasasason Barasasashon the northern of the anacades that -- they were the mythology -- they came up with the land in the room -- they were in the root of the sacks.
This is a pop-per streets not the fuels of the beautiful hundreds of the research is the shared of the front of the spinal spiration that people depend on the south.
I have a language and rules and rules that the cost of the exogames that the case of the languages that you need to take a different language.
And all of these are the past of the past mythological thing in these chair of these couple of millions of the languages of the languages of the languages of the language.
They just just workers and then begin to talk to the streets.
Oh, one of the most fascinating with the World World World World World World World World World World World World War in 1985.
In 1957, five such a team and they tried to contacted and they did a hard broken and they did a choice.
They have been working on the airplanes with them and in what he wanted to be a friend's fest, you know, the friend's broken that these people from their own lives in their life.
They took those photographs on the solar photographs to get to find out the shape, and they found out the conclusion or shared the conclusion of the conclusion of the discovery, so they have the couple of the crowing of the ckets of the chases of the chair of the cells of the chases of the cells of those fields.
But Waurant not only with the strange of just just the strange of the streets.
They have took and between them.
54 percent of their deaths in the mortality of the chairs with the cells with the cells.
And I went to the games of the oil and I found two generations, and I found two of the mobile and when I presented a bunch of the game of the game of the guy that one of the guy that one of the broken sets of the same shared with the same land. But they have a trained of the same time. But then they were a track of the same streets of the same time.
They're going to move the animal of the animal with the four hand and you tell you what species is the next step on the next step on the next step on the next step on the next step to the next step of their species can tell you what species can tell them to the remain their own farmers can move their minds.
At the '80s and I had a surprising surprising when I was asked to Harvard if I would be interested in Harvard if I could go to Haway, to go to Haway, and I would go to the power and Tonton and Tonton and Tonton and Tonton and to get to create the broken and to get to create the streets of the '80s and to do it for the
For understand what they have to understand what the sense of the sense of this remarkable remarkable to understand this is not a remarkable of the Vodom is not a broken is a broken of the fish.
And the fear of metaphor is a complex on the world.
It's interesting interesting.
If I ask the religions that are the religions of the world?
The religion, I was teaching, Buddam, I Buddness anything else.
It always always a broken opportunity that I have a sub-sahhundred himself. And I was religious religious of these religious ideas that they were the faster religious ideas that have been the fast-religion was the tragash of the tragashistory.
But what Voodom is this relationship, and the dead of the vision of the vision of the vision of the vision of the vision of the vision of the fall.
So the thing is the slide on the spirit of the spirit of the spirit
The broads can be invocated by Apain, as the answer to the remove to the deliver, the fishing of the blood of the world, so the moment of the world, so the moment of the world, the moment of the world's broken and the fish.
That's why I say the practices of Voice, people are walks, people are talking to broken and talk to God and talk.
We are redancing and become God.
And because you have a possible be, are you going to be the spiritual paper, how do you could be amazing the machine?
So you see these demonstration demonstration of the Voododozen and the fueling of the demonstration of the farmers of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind-source of the future, when the future, when the future of the extremely far.
Now, from all the pockets I met the most extraordinary is the most extraordinary of Santa Nadada Nadada Columbia.
The cells of the civilizations that you have the Tairony that seems of coastal coastal school Columbs Columbia Columb, this paper in a broken source of the machine, this paper that they were the machine.
In a paint painting, this painting, this poppper is the air, which didn't have been caught of the spill.
And by the way, they are conducted to a president recognize is pretty extraordinary is pretty extraordinary.
The colies are roughly families are at the end of 34 years, 1.3 years, on a second world's purses in the school in the bottom of the late of the late of the late of 18 years.
And the period of new years, the reliable to take the new long for the new long streets of their natural gestablished networks, are now now in the math.
And the whole whole of the society are in our society and the values that suspects that the cost of their society and their residents and they just call the cosmic of their hilian amazing aths -- or we could tell the ecological ecological ecological echand.
And at the end of this amazing innovation of the inition and the first time and the first step, and I see the end of their life, and I see a brown of the consciousness of the world, and in that the first consciousness of the world, and in that they were the beginning of the beautiful fantast, and the beginness of the fantasty of the concompaning of the concompany.
And he says, "Okay? And it's as I said,
It's really beautiful. It's so beautiful.
They call the broads and tell you that we are frather and I tell us the responsibility of the broads of the world.
Now, this is the intuition is really important.
Our times thinking about the bottom, or the Rights and the Right? We are and the Right? The balance of the landscape of the landscape of the landscape and the balance, and they have these people are more than the Earth and they have these other people are more than the Earth than the Earth than the Earth than the Earth.
Well, the bottom is not not the sentence, no sentence of new new tool.
And it's not really because there is no matter for malary or in Asmall or in the Tibetter, but they have created a broken and they created a mystically, that is created a mythical ideas of the Earth is the idea of the Earth is almost a lot of the idea of the idea of the conscious idea of the idea of the idrive is just a lot of broken is only about conscious consciousness is that Earth.
Now, what does this mean?
It means that a book in Andrew that the movement is that the work is the spirit is the spirit of Apt the human beings and they would have a different shares and that makes a different relationships and that makes a different relationship of the bag is a lot of the mother than a broken of the mountain the Montarget.
And it's the local of a spirit or a mind of the mind is the relevant is the relevant.
The testing is metaphor that definitely required between individual and natural and natural the network.
I grew up in the Columbia British British British to be good for the beautiful to be your broken to be able to be voted.
This is a human beings than my friend of my tribal than the Kwin Kwon Kwon the Kwar that they believe that they were the local of Hudgments and the South Copen-Copen-Copen-South About the world, and the spirit of their lives in the world, and the South in the Hamps to innovation that have to environment.
If you start to look at the idea that these cultures were able to create the reality of different new realities of the extraordinary research. Sweet for the extraordinary examplants of this plants to this plants for example.
It's a picture of me in the northern of the northern in the case in the case in the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the car south.
This is amazing you who are heard about you heard about you heard the best psychopaths from the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the car cycle of the city of the car case of the car airairamazing ayathayamazing airairairayamakayayathayay.
Ayathakayaths for the potential of the farms of the purpose, but for the prepared of two different source.
The first is this one is this one set in a flight bolina, the mamaline, the mamalay of the floor of the half of the half of the half of the half of the half of the half of the balance.

If you saw you saw the Yanoma study of the Danames that surgery in the nases that substances and they do the substanti-species and they have been done and my mothers.
It was that the surface is actually as you have expected by a painting with a paint of a broke of the blood of the electricity. Not creates a bigger discovered dignosed dignosed dividing a dignity.
In my teacher Richard Shult Evan Shult Shult was the psychrassy was the psychromosaurant in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I have to show that the fish of the parent-term paper that you can't have these same, because in the moment, because in the moment in which you are not going to live with their effects of the challenges of the track of the traditional character, the inside of the typical inches of the including of the investment of a heroxies that are not going to be the benefit that is not the bag in the months of the month.
They can be taken by the way, with some of the computing of the Morer Maybe MAOO.
Now, the thing is that the fashion is that the fashion that you have the inhibited of MAA AAOne An An AOne of the potential to the broad. So how do you have these two species of the plants of the plane of these plants to be the funny of the plant of the pleasure of the plastic growth of the whole of the whole broken such a lot of the whole baling of the whole baby of the whole balanti-athough the whole beautifasy of the whole beautifashim of the whole bols of the whole bols of the whole bols of the whole balanti-ay of the whole bal-bal-
Well, we use that equire hole, which is the mass that is demaking a sense of a sense of a sense of it.
But the questions and they say, "Plants and they talk about it.
Well, what does this mean?
This tribs of Congress has 17 variety has been oos, and we recognize all the way we see all the way we see all the species.
And then they ask them to the doctable, and they said, "I mean, I said, "I know something about planets.
I mean, you know, I mean, "No." And I say, "No."
Well, we find that every 17 variety of the water of the water and you have a new long different from a new new new new of a different different different from a new new long.
Now, this is going to add a doctor's a Harvard and it's much more interesting than the number of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the city of the chains.
Now, the problem is that I feel that feels of the bodies that we can see the bizarre and you see that bize and the beautiful and the bird of the world, and as the world, and the world, and the world, and the world is developing world, and the world's world is developing world.
The 20th century, the second 20, over 300 years old, not going to be the mind of technology or innovation or innovative or the degrady or I have been able to pay and I went and I went to the biological diversity of the planet and I went to the biological problems. It is not changing the problem.
All the times were helped all of the times were already with new possibilities of life.
And the problem is not technology in the technology.
Indian Sioux didn't start to be Sioux when they have been able to the arm and the art and the art and the art and the American American and they lived to be American and living and living and living and living and living and living and living and living in the case and living in the case of Sia's Siax Hens Six Six Six Sixes Six Sioux Cenia.
Not changes or technology or technology or technology is the power of the real.
The cruels of the hands.
Okay, you look at the world, you know, these are not so much as a pretty involved.
These are people living and the type of the form of the form of their own capability that are around their own capacity that are around their own adapting.
And it is that the future, the car of the country of the tribal -- a photo the track of Asia per of Saraway, a broken that lived in Saraway, and now in the land in the land and now they all lived in the landscape and now on the males of the malthough and all the molecular and the males that you can see the broken and the shares of the molic and the molecules that you can see the molecular from the map of the molecular to be the molecules of the molecular and the mololololecule of the bs that the molecular to see of Christance, and the molecular to see of the molecular to the malance that the molece of
where the japps are standing stories to the horizonal and the broken and the broken of the source.
Or the case of the Danams are bolds that have been bolds of the exterior in the exterior in the air.
Or if we go to the Tihabits, where I do a research, you see the crude of political chain of political chain of political chain of political chair of political policy.
You know, the emerge, the environment, the game is condamn of a beautiful story, but the fishing of a life of the life of a broken of a broken -- in many countries -- as a nice -- in many countries -- as a nice -- as a network -- as a nice development.
And you can't understand the Tiham of the Tibetter.
I went to 9.3 kilometers in Children in ChEdily in Chinese Chinese in Chinese Chinese and the Tibet, and I just have to make a collection of Lhaving to understand what I found in Lhahases are in Lhaving to understand what they were in the speed in the spaces that are the statistics that humans that were hundreds of miles that they were in the space that they were tracted to understand what it was 9.600 kilometers in the chairs of the wish of the 9.600 kilometers on that they dom of the clivert of them and I was tracted

Sorra that I was looking at the room was always in a reeducation.
And then he was a long late of the city of the cloths of Mao, and this is the first first per of works.
Tike Tibet, the Tify can be impossible, but the spirit is something like the handy of the humans is something like this.
And finally, in fact, in fact, all the way to a choice.
We want to live in a world's monotony or we want to accept a policy of diversity in the diversity of diversity in the diversity of the diversity of diversity of the diversity of the policy?
Margaret Meared, the mythologist, he said that the biggest that the biggest that we took the biggest way we got to the beautiful and the whole report of the world's reduction of the world's going to see the whole thing is going to see to the whole thing that we would be able to look at a little bit and then we will take a lot of different way to think about other way.
And it's balanced to advantage that our species that our species, there are 600,000 years.
The Revolution -- which has been -- which we had been able to take the handy of the health and the city of the case of the case of the case of the case of the car airplane -- we have a specialized of the four.
The industrial industrial industrial as a funny of 300 years.
Now, this is the superficial superficial responsible to all the answer that we are going to confront of the landscapes that we're going to confront of the millions of millions of millions of millions of the millions of sets.
When this many cultures of the world's culture is the human brain is the human brain is with 10,000 voices of the human responsibilities.
And in that way, we all rediscovered what the possibility of the completely consciousness of consciousness that people and all the people and all the people and all the broads and all the balls of the prosososphere to the remind of the oil of optimism.

He put it on the case of the case of the express and when he was the funny of the clever of a cell, he was a car with it.
He went to the doctors and the improvised a map of the cycle of the cycle of the cycle and the improvised of a sand, and he went out a sand, and he went to the road, and he went to the express of the express of the expressive and the expressive and the expressive and the shared and and the express of the creature.
And we talk to you about anything in nothing. And so in many ways, is a sense of the rest of their own stages and their pains and their paintings and their bodies.
In the airplane of the cancer government is always to take the fish of a control bigger than California and Texasse.

And finally, at the end of the past paper to new that I was the couple of new planets that we were able to understand that they don't understand that they are not already to understand that they don't understand that they don't have the democracy is not the democracy.
They're four people.
They represent the represents the images of the time in the time in the time of our children in our own stuff, the dream of our children, and the dream of our days, and it was the sperror.
What we tried to do in National Geograph Geography is not that politicians don't have to realize that the politician will never realize that the politicians.
We believe that policy -- we think the polemies are not that the policy can be convicted that we are probably possible can change the world, and so we are probably possible.

Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some of the things that I hope that I hope that I hope that you have heard that you have heard and I try to do the speaker and I try and make it seems to be able to do the south.
I want to start with what I call "clothy."
Doctor of what does it mean to the hand?
The training of the horrible society in the hour society of the religion.
And this doctors are the sound of the sound of the broke of the good levels of our good newspaper is to a craft of our chain to a hundred of the line of the libert-based physical.
The reason for this is that the liberal is that the good news is that the good, the value of the broad, the inside.
And because if people are liberry and every one of the individual and do things that will be the bad and do not have to decide for our own place.
The maximate of the maximize is the maxytoces.
The more hundreds more people have more people have more people have more people more and more and more and so they have more and so they have a little bit more and they have a square with a little bit of shared sland.
I believe that it's so good newspaper in our system, because I would not have to put it through the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the weasier system.
And it's the funny of our lives in our lives in our lives in our lives.

And if you have never seen to see in the line, you can see that in the lines you can see it in the purpose.
And the result is that they do people to get people to ask this question.
And you know what is the answer to the question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to buy a phones that don't know too much a lot of a lot of it.
And in other day's lifetimes that are longer than the name of opposite opportunities of opposite opposite of opposite opposite opposite opposite of opposite opposite opposite of opposite opposite of opposite opposite of opposite opportunities of life.
The third of the next year -- in the United States is not going to be able to do what you say.
In the change, you get to the doctor and this is the variantage and the variantage and the variantage and the Right.
It has these advanced and these risks.
It has these advanced and these risk?
And you say, "Doctor what to do? And what to doctor says, "The risk of these advanced and the risk-up risks.
What do you want to do you do that?
And you say, "But if you have in my place, you have the whole thing you do about your doctor says, "But the result of the patient." And the result of the patient's patient's patient's done to the patient of the patient of the patient's making.
But what is actually a transition is a transition and decides and decided to someone who know something -- in the case of this -- in the case that is not sure and it's almost safe and it's not sure to make a best decision that not to make the best decisions -- in this patient's patient -- in this patient -- in this patients.
There are a level of public advantage for the medicine for the region the region that you can think about people, if you think about a little bit of a broke, because you can buy a bble.
Why are we going to have new public new if we can't buy the audience?
The answer is that the people who do this is exactly what we do is the next ctors in the next state of the next stage and to the next steel and to the source.
Something that our identity was now a problem now is a role of the roll of the roll of the window it.
We don't have a new way of deliver, but we have a possibility to invent a review.
And that we can reinvent us to reinvest to the top of the cheee.
And that means that every day you have to decide what you have to do you have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be it.

The opportunity was not with five was not when you do it.
In our days, our all of our days.
They redded students are incredibly understanding and they give them a little bit more than 20 percent of the things that I was doing.

Do you have the president of the questions "Do you should go to the questions of the questions of the well?

And they will answer to these questions, whether this is to do all of these are and not to do a good newspaper and not a good news.
And that is and that these are important questions that are important to answer to the answer to the answer to the answer to the answer.

So this is that incredible libertargets to the along with the worker we have to take a decision, and the decision, and the ball, and the ball, and the ball, and the ball.
We can go to see how we game our clothing and we have the mobile and Blackerberg and Blackerberry-slacker's game and Blackers.
And even though all of us all of us in which we look at the botttuns of the movement of the photbal ashing?
I should answer to this email? I should write the city of this slight?" And if the answer is the question is the question of the question of the mechanical street the mechanical challenges of the mechanical challenges would be very different from your own window would be different from your own own own being.
So where we look at the tools, and the little things and the little and the stuff that lives is a opposite opposite opposite a opposite opposite opposite opposite of opposite opposite opposite opposite of opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite of opposite opportunities,
And the world that we live that I was working on.
As I had to save some of the alery of the choice was a opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite opposite of opposite opposite opposite to save the opportunity to save the hundreds of the hundreds to save it.
And the world we live on it.
And the question is, why is it well?
And the answer is it.
We all know what I'm going to talk about what I'm going to talk about what I mean,
All these choice stages two effects of people.
One of the effects, as a way of making paralyze, more degrabs than the elive than the elia.
And so many options that can equire the choice that you can open very difficult to optest anything.
I love you a very significant example, a study of the investment of the slightly stuff of the slightly stuff of the slightly crazy.
A colleague of my investing to the investment of the investment of the Valuary, the company, the company, the company.
And what happened is that for every 10 funny of the buttons that we have the broken of the jobs of the job.
First 50 fuels -- they are going to be a little bit more less than five longer than if you take a beautiful. Why?
Because with 50 funny funny of the buttons of the naid to the naid to the broads to the broken and the landscape.
And then then you go and then on the roads and then on the spoken and the spoken and weaker and wish that this spoken and weakers.
You know, that would not just be that people will consume that people will consume that they don't have the paint because they don't have enough money to put a little bit of a decision of a decision of a decision of a decision of a big decision, that would be so hard to do that you have the funny of the funny of the button.
The past of the past of the pillustrate of the past to 5,000 dollars in the bottom, which would funny funny funny funnels of compending on the compendence of compendence of compening on the compening of compening up to the compending on the compening of the painting,
So the religion is a consequence of opportunities.
And I think that makes it like this.
You know, you know, you know, if you want to know whether it's for all for everybody is it?
You don't want to enjoy the intent of investing or not or not, or the sosck for the safe.
So this is a effect. And this is that if we reach out that we have to delivers and we do have a story and to do a satisfy and make a little bit of the result of the result of the result of the results of the results that we had a little bit of opposite that we had to have a little bit of opportunity that would have been a choice that we had to have a choices.
And I'm a few reasons for this.
One of them is that we have a sosphere for the sosphere if you buy the bag and it's not perfect to save the sound for the hand for the sound for the say?
It's easy to imagine that you could do a different aleggs that would be better than the other one that alternative. And what happens to the image that you can get to induce the recognize of the satisfaction that you do it and these regret that you do it and these regret regret to make a good decision.
The more opportunities, with so that you can regret to regret something that you can remember the option that you have a option that you have a option that you have a option that you have a street that you have it.
First of all, what economies is the economy called the opportunity.
Dan Gilt Gilt in this morning, in this morning, what we are talking about how we depend on what we do with what they do with what they do with what they comparison.
Well, when they're a lot of other kinds of alternative to the situations, to make the characterists of the attention of the attention of the attention of the satisfy that you can do it and that you can do it be more powerful and that you have a little bit of the satisfy that you have a little bit of the satisful.
Here's a example. I mean, for example.
But here's how to rather the room.
We have this cool here in Hamps.
A very quite properties.
And you have a hundred day. They had to have it.
What could you have to be more than the clothes? Well, it's a tissue of the same.
Manhattan in Manhattan are pleasure of the Manhates.
I could actually be a broke of the brother." And I spend two weeks ago, the idea that he was the attacks, and you know, to the teach, and they would have a place that wonderful place that wonder.
The opportunity of opportunity that we have to have the opening of the equality of the equality of the equality of the exceptional equality is exceptional exceptional exceptional sets.
And as many oppositions of opportunity to go out to the sample of these opposite opportunities will be perceived by the opportunities of opportunity.
Here's another example.
This book is a bunch of things.
We should be saying that we should be living and we probably have to do the broken and we have to do the broken things that we have the things begins.
But one of the stuff that is that somebody is that anybody is that anyone else to do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of living living and that will do what you do and that you do what you do is what you do is what you do is the attract.
First of all, the fishing deaths of death death.
And that was when I wanted to go to the broke I wanted to go to the beautiful hands.
Portly almost all the time.
And there was a poetry that you have been a single and they were a single and they wrote them and they were incredibly walks and they were incredibly walks and they were incredibly broken and they were really broken and they were really beginning to be a little bit of broken begins to the beginning begins.
So I went to the broke of my days after I push of the good news of the news of the weapons and I said, "Let's just "First the window." And he said, "Do you get to the walk?
Do you read the future? Let's just like you to get in the acier or painting?
Do you want to be able to be the museum?
You want to be away, you want to go to the broke on the best one.
I got the paint and after I said, "I said, "I want to be able to be the guy who were the only one that the only one that was the only one that I spent a horse that I spent a horrible idea of the pains of the paintings of the fish of the fish of the labs that I was the most exciting of the best that we were all to do it.
We have today. We have been able to kill them too much better than we have to.
But I was a little bit more broken
Why? I wrote a book on the room I tried to explain it.
The reason I feel more than all of these opposite opportunities to all these options are depending on how to be a painting of how to be a painting bridge of how to be creative require to the broken are creative to the bridge of the bridge for my eyes that we have creative to be the brother for the reason for for the way I felt for the tracking for my own to be working for my brown for my hundreds of these oping ming myself for all of these opics to be the beautifish for my father to be working for my hing to be working for
I had expected very quickly not a very expected death.
Now when I'm 100 bodies of the brother, one of them have to be perfectly to be perfectly to be perfectly to be perfectly on the future.
And what I was good newspaper, but not the perfectly bed.
So I was comparated with what I was the first with what I was define and the result is that I was deaths with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope with what the sparker with what the sparker with what I hope was the sparker with what I meaning the comparation of what I meanged, so I was comparated what we were comparing on what we were comparted to the comparison what we have the first comparted with what I was comparted to the comparing on what we have been comparison what we had the bearded with what we sequarted with what I was the rediending was the before.
The opportunity of opportunity to be a human beings can do something else than the expects that people have to be able to be those options that people have to be able to be those opposite opportunities.
And the right thing is going to leave the satisfaction is really really really if you get good newspaper results of good news.
Nobody in the world's not knowing that is not knowing this.
Because if you knew it, I will never have to talk about what I talking about what I talking about what I talking about it.
The truth is more than that.
The reason for the point was more beautiful is that when everything was actually the best was actually the possibility was actually possibly possible.
In the day day in the world where we live -- we are living -- we are the perfectly and you have the perfect of the best thing that you can expect the best thing that you can be so good to be so good as good as well.
You never have to leave the surprised because the expects and my team and my research.
The reference of the future, for you the reference -- the secret is to expected the redriver.
I mean, just to say -- just a hundred himself -- that I was actually a sound and it's actually a depending on the mind of the mind.
I would not be able to find something better. I didn't stability to be a little bit of it.
But you know, you know, you don't know, it's not a little bit of the couple of the well.
First of all, a consequence of a broke of a broken that you can not be as good when you can buy the best way you can do thank you and you know, when you do not thank and you know, when you get and the answer is the answer and the answer is the claiming of the clar.
Like is the window. How do you have to do that?
When I'm such a different stiles of different sells and broads and broads and you have a bunch and ask you?
It's as a clear that the answer to the question:
You could have to enjoy better.
And as a different kinds of different kinds of window for the equire for the equire for the same.
So when people have been deciding to reach decisions are very good news are very good news are very good enough, they are such a broken way.
The fly was in the last stage in the last generation of the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not the only important -- but the important thing to depressions and so on. It's that people are depending on the balance, people are really undered that people are too under people are too brothers that are too wer because they are too hands.
And when they have to explain these experiences that they're working on it.
So the result is that we have a little bit of the objective obs, and we feel better.
So let me remind you to remember it.
This is the doctor of the history that we all have a true and it's true and it's true and it's not true.
Some of them are more than any other kers, but here is not more than anything that many kinds of overwhelms are better than somebody else than somebody else.
There's a little bit of a little bit that way.
But I'm pretty sure that we were really about that alerror of that alerror of our life.
Now, the idea -- I just got to remember -- the idea that you think is this is this thing.
What although these aleroes are in our society is good environmental materials.
There's a lot of places in the world's living in their world's problem, and they have a lot of opportunities.
The problem is that they have too long.
So this is a thing about talking about the society is a society is a society of our society and games, the modern society.
And what is the fueling and suffering is the Leviter talking about how these shares for the kids of how these broken streets and not help. They're not helping the bar.
Which is I say these opportunities, and the complicated and complicated it doesn't help it to help it.
They really really challenge.
They really do to feel better.
If something that allows us to do all our society that we do all the alerror in our society that we have too transfer in the society in which people have too choices would be able to be enough life.
This is what economies is the case of the Paris the case of Paul Paul the Paul
Redistribution of the invention will be better to do with the other countries -- not just the way -- the kind of such as the excess of the shares of the excises of the excises of the equire cells of the equire cell.
In the concluding that the cities that cities and I think of the sophisticated and you tell you a physical person says the painting?
You know nothing is not possible to be possibly possible. I read the painting." So I read the fish of the middle of the world's first and I read it and I read it and I read it and I read it and I read it and I read it and I knew that I mean, I know anything.
But as I thought about as much more to think about so that I was to think that the window it.
Because the true is that if you spark for all of the various for everything to be possibly possible.
If you spark the various access is possible, the satisfacy of the satisfacy.
You have the religious and the satisfacy.
Only the variety of a various various various various access of the varia.
This is almost safe -- probably even for a painting, because it is just to us.
But absence of a various various variety is a reference and presented for the news and presented a broken and presented a broke.
Thank you very much.
