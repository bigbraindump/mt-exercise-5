Video: The COtor: The COAL: we see the climate changes like a very serious threatening for business to business for our business to make our business.
And why our principles is to spend a big surface of money to spend a big shares to help us to help us to help us and really, we have complicated to show us and complicated our truth of carry about cars.
The thing is that the case is not dirty of the bad is not dirty bad
We think it's the current -- and the mirracles.
So it will not reach to change the climate climate change.
Look at this point.
Video: The Cargovernment is curriculum of himself.

Thank you very much of thank you.
And the last year, I did a street to LHC.
And I promised to come to see a story about how it works about how it works that works.
So here is the massh of the best that were not here, LHC is the largest stinitial stinitial stinitial stinitial -- Cirumps -- Cirump of 27 kilometers or is to recreate a billion dollars to the ground of the universal growth to the ground of the universal second the sequence of the universe.
It's extremely ambitious ambitious.
This is the under of the Geneva.
We make photographs "Big Bangs" in the interior in the decades.
I work on these. It's called the ATLATLATLATLASTLASS tracks, diameter photos of 22 meters -- the detectors here to the ATLS in building the ATLS in building proportion.
On the last year, I went to the last year, I went from the first time.
And that was the ATLATLAS.
He causes a huge case in the room in the room.
It's a very first picture of the first fascycles that the track of the street of the system LHC, the LHC, the LHC, the deliberate of LHC, the detector.
In other words, when I was set that image that image about 10 several of the worker I was working on the worker that is a huge successful for a huge success.
I don't know that if that was the largest ovative, or that when somebody else went on the Google and the first page, and he sees to the first line that the first line of the first way.
It means that I did a cultural impact of the cultural impact of stine.
After about a seven to a seven seven to a problem with the apart, which was actually a problem -- these field flip -- these field flip -- these field.
Those are the transportation of the 13,000 feet when the power to the power to power the power of power.
Now, the engineering of the street and says, "I can't translate and said, "I can't be a myself."
But I can do that for that when I'm at the temperatures become the superheriting the super-conducts.
So as you can 271 degree of the street of the street of the streets can transport these fields can translate the couple of the forever.
At one of the laws of the networks, in LHC, was a fabricatic defect of fabricative.
And so that the comes to the common and the 13-driven dge of electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressionate that they can return to the magnetworks, and they fly over 20 tons, and they fly 30 degree of way.
So we determine about 50 percent, we determine 50 magnetwork.
We had to take it affair, which I was doing.
I reconted it all reconcerned all of the toilets.
And now we go to the magnetititil in subteran.
The square at the big street of the LHC will be like new that we're going to be like now.
We're going to go from again, and we have to get in the hundred or hydrogen to the research to find out that are the elements to be the elements to be the elements to be the universe to the universe.
Now, of course, as a way of recognize recognize of recognizing about extreme and engineering to extremely report.
I think that the data, I think of the fact that is that we have been so hard by the fact that we have inside the fact that we have a very important experiments like HC.
I'm going to ask the words of words of the words of the Britisfy of the Britispherrase, when I think about the inner of the protecting of protecting the Michael Faray, he said, "No is not more done to deal with progress of our minds are not farmer to our minds are not working on our stinitial words, are not finally finishing our lives are the beautiful, the light of our words, as well."
Thank you.
I want to start with the range to remember the kidddle to play with the bottom of the bottom with books.
On the monkey inds of watching to the water, to go to the fall, to the colocologist, you actually have a squatters and to figure out how to figure and return to the spacecraft and the spacecraft and the spacecraft of spacecraft what you do to the spacecraft to the clude what you are invented to the cludgment.
The space is the profound is the profound of how we intelligence we understand a lot of the inconject.
And so that we can research, the research, inspired by this useful interacting with our physical objects -- impressing with my consultant, and my collaboratory -- I began to the Jeevan Kalana -- I was when we use a computer -- we were going to use a computer couple of mouth, and we can draw a digital research, and we can dack a masssk the mouth, and we can drightly remainly remaintains to the water,
So we want to think about how do we want to do it?
And the question was the fascinating fascinating to ascinating the research, I decided to build Siftable.
All of the Siftype is a computer computer computer bisure.
They can be manufacturing to the recivil recivil can perceive the mission of the rest of the food of the forever.
The most important is that they're like the palpable of games, like the game, you can missing them as just watching them as just watching it.
And Siftables of an example of an equipment of the manipulation of digital manipulation of digital manifts.
On the months are getting more constantly constantly constantly constantly constants to the other constants of the other actises of the other actises and constantly our actissue and receive us to explore new and degrees of interact.
I'm going to start with some examples of simple.
This Siftable is configuring video to predict video of video of video of a direction, and if you have the philosphere if you reach the other parts of the part, if you remember the rule of the parts of the part.
These portrait are constantly interactive of each other.
So, if you put them on the other ways, it becomes the other things.
If there are inconfushed and that, and they can become confusion.
I can feel like the miscing and including and including and incline.
We realize that one of the interesting of interactive implications is that we can use the gestures that we can use the gestures, how we could be able to a culture like we could be able to a license like we could culture a license lycle.
In the case, we have three Siftables configuring as well-painted and can use them to return to the center of the center, where they will remember the center of the center, where they will remember the centers.
If I was too much, we can actually get in the inside of the inner inside of it.
There are also also interesting to educate education, like education, like the mathematics of language, mathematics and live and ligent people to see the results of possibility to see the results.
So here we have -- this is a Fibonacibonacy with a simple program with a program of equative.
And here we have a game of the words, a kind of combination of combination and Boggle.
Think of the first one is a literally lack to the intimately, and the massshaking, and they try to form with a dictionary to form with a dictionary to a dictionary.
Then you can get 30 seconds 30 seconds of the literacy of literally such as a new types and possibilities of true.
Thank you.
These are the kids who came to the Media Labies of Media, and I had to try to move them to the move to the film and moving.
They like to live them to the neighborhood.
And one of the interesting things of this kind of apply apply is that we don't have to give them a lot of instructions.
And everything you have to say, "For word," and they know what to do.
And here are other people are other people intrigger.
This is the most tant, our ster right, play in our right.
It turns out that everything that he wanted to do was to do was to take one Siftable to do one of the other ones.
So it was just to him.
This is a interacting apply apply apply apply apply.
We wanted to build a instrument to the language.
And this is Felix.
He can get new personal characters in the scene of the Siftables that affesles that affairly.
Here the soils of the soil.
Video: The bridge of it.
David Merrill: Now he got a traction, he was a traction,
Video: The beautiful porty.
Good good.
Miss Sifty-session and assing it can make a charge to interact with the person's personal -- Video: Ham!
DM: M: I think the narrative.
Video: Okay?
DM: It's a final story of open, and he decided to release.
Video: The war sands.
DM: The Ultimtimtimtime, to look at the time to look at the today is a live and interpretated music and interpretated music that we built the Siftables that Siftables that Siftable and the baby.
Every of these four various various variation has different choices that you want to use it.
And you can inject the sound of successful as you can ask the key to the typical thing you can ever ask the type.
You can sound the sound of sound sattack of the sound of sound to a success of successful Siftable Sifts.
There are effective effects that you can control the live and the filtry.
You have a certain a certain and then it can include it to him.
It is the effects of the general effects like the tempt that the flip of the squared of the sequencing to see it.
Video: MVideo: MVideotables in two successful Siftables to a serious serious series, we have been inside a series, a serious serious, I have longer ritself.
Now I put a link line.
Video: M: Mr: My put the percus of perceive perceive the perceive
Video: M: And now I'm going to bring the filtrack to control the effect of the training of the lives.
Video: M: Maybe the including inside of the inclining inclining or in a part or in some part.
Video: M: M: Make I'm going to get for more expression.
Video: M: M: Maybe I can read the sections of what the amount of red.
So I don't have to do the planet, I can improve the long story, months of the wall.
Now, in the swimming to the insurance of the secsections of Siftable-volume of the volume, including in the streets of volume, including in the stanga.
Thank you.
And as I see the passion is the creating new computer is the creating new computer that works better with the brain that works better with our brain that works and our body and our body is working on our brains.
And today, I had time to show you a time to show that this new space, and some of design and a couple of design that we try to take them from possibilities that we try to take them from the lab.
The one that I would retiny retinire is that we are at this new generation of instrument instrument of instruments of instruments of digital fuel in our world of digital rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules that are going to retiny.
Thank you very much.
Astt with you to talk about you to all the way to play with you today.
I'm writing.
He write the book is my teachery, but it is, of course, more than that.
It's all my mother and fascinated the bad and fascinating.
And I don't have this to do it is changing.
But these are the hopely, something like the strange of the lots of my life, and in my life, and in my life, and I determined me of my relationship with the work.
And the worker is that I wrote read this book, that I was the "Manca, Roaga" -- the Roaga" -- that is the dealing to deal with the demand that is the most important myself to a sensition to a sensitive sensitive sensitive sensitive sense.
The reliable is that the original thing that I go now, people are going to be condamnations.
Serios -- damnature, condamnes!
All of you can recognize and say, "You don't have to say, "You don't have -- you don't have to be the them?
You don't have it works is going to write as you can write your life, the far of life that are ever grow?"
It's very line linists,
But it would have been to remember if I were not going to remember 20 years ago, when I was just 20 years ago, when I was a great stream when I was a great stream -- like I was a writing removed to reaction -- like I was like a kind of reactive reactive reaction of reactive reaction.
And people said, "You don't have no way that you don't have never have any success?"
Do you don't reject the judgments will kill you knew about it.
You don't have the front of working in this field in this domain, and nothing to be in this domained is not going to deadly deadly in the deaths of the dreams of the middle of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the screen is not the front of the work?"
Something like this.
The reassrocket -- the answer to all those insects is "Da."
Yeah, you know, it's the themselves.
And he always stuck to me to my hands.
And you know, it's in the flight in the way that people who can't get to the other things that people can't get them to them,
As an example of the big algorithms that are infrustrated infrustrated things.
But when it's about writing the word that I was talking about the last last time I was all asked in the last last last time is "Why is "Why is "Why is ""Why is ""What are you going to ask the last time is "Whereare you but when you talk about while it's about writing about written about written about writing about written about writing the word about writing thing, and it's all about writing the work?"
Is it something rational rational rational not?
It's logic as anyone to the workshops to be the working that was enough to do it was pretty much like this Pamant.
And what is that specific initiatively that seems that seems that seems to be in the own mental sanitation of mental sanity?
My father for example, was the chemist, and I don't have to remember the 40 years of the climate of the chemical engineering somebody who would be asked to be asked to be asked to be a question.
It didn't come -- John, John, like the chemical engineering in the chemical?
It's just not just not to get it into the question.
But to be syndromebs that have been caught to the crowd to the second of the century of the remarkable to be alcools to be alcools.
We write writers have this remarkable remarkable remarkable remarkable and not only writing the rest of all sorts of all sorts of all the way.
And everything we do is to look at the number of death deaths of the death of the 20th century, in the mind of the minds of the mind of the American creative minds of young and it opens and it took by the degree of America.
And even those who didn't have hear that they didn't have to be able to actually have the distracted to the own stage.
Norman Mail, indeed in the last last year, in the last last story, he said, "Every long time."
A great great extraordinary of the mountain the work.
But we don't cause when we hear somebody says, that we have heard about that I heard about many times and I heard about many times and buying it and broken it is a completely chair and the idea of the creative ideas and the art is going to be broken to the bad and as art, it will leave to the bath, it will leave to the suffering to the bathroom.
And the question I want to bring all of these types here is: are you here is: are you with this ide?
You are comfortable to comfortable with it -- because it turns out with this light -- I don't have to do with this ipotty.
I think it's odiodia-hand
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to see it dangerous in the future in the future.
I think it's better if you include the artists of artists to live the rockets.
And I know about the case of my case -- in my case, my situation -- it would be very dangerous to me to me to me to me to me to try to get indeed the chair of this hypothese, special is now the special tests that I find the teachers.
As for example, I'm quite quite in the 40 years.
I have probably including the money before the works.
And it's very probably likely to write that I will write to be judgments like the mountains of the money to the straight of my last money to the streets of my last last last year?
What would be to tell the far to mention the samples of the friends here are already -- it's really probably likely to be a successful to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be already to be already to be intamed to be intamed to be to tell the far the farming the farmer to tell the future of the food far.
Oh, Doh, I think of the gand!
This is the gene gender to somebody to get somebody to get somebody to get to the 9th of the 9th of the morning of the morning of the morning.
I want to do this in the continuation that I would like to do this.
And then, the question becoming the question,
And so I put it in the room to myself to work now, that I have to work now, to work now, to go to write a kind of building to write a kind of building a kind of building that building protective, the core?
I have to have a way, to find a way to remember a distance, to the fly distance, and my father ably safe, and my father absolutely unfortable to reactive what will be writing about what will write about what will write what will write what will write about what it writing is going to write what it is writing a way.
And as I was in the last year of the last year of the year, I started to get to the time to find out the time, and I started to see other society to see other society to see if we could have better ideas and more than the ideas and more than how to help us creatively to be able to help people creative.
The recital was in Greece and Roma Greece and Roma
So the marriage, the case of the case of the case is inchance.
But in the Great the Great and Rome, and Rom, and the Rom, the revenue, the human-coming from the human being?
People believe that creativity was a spiracy that can be able to help people in the people in the people in the people in the newspaper and needed to the needs and needed and needed and needed to be needed and needed to be able to find out that the creativity.
The records called these spiracy spirit of creativity, the term of the term "demonstrate "demonstrate the "demonstration.
Socracy was the faimos because it has a square the intelligence of the intelligence of departs.
The research, but they were the same samples of the creatively creativity, the genius of the genius.
What is the wonderful thing that is not the wonderful genius didn't believe that a genio individual genius was a pretty cleaning individual individual individual that is a pretty much fun.
I think that a kind of a genio was a kind of a divity of the divity of artist, the wall, the wall, and the artist, and the insession of the house, who are assession and insession of the works, the artist, the artists of the works.
Absolutely restralosed -- this is the distance, which is the distance, which is the psychological results.
And everybody knows that that work?
So the year was protected by certain things, like this.
If you were the stralosystuck, you couldn't have the stuck for her, all the way to her, all the way that we helped this genium of the shared that the genius helped it.
If you were criticizing the criticize was not completely well?
The world as the genius were about the kind of the genius.
And then people look at the West creativity for a long time.
And then he came up with the Renast, and the whole thing has changed the big idea of the big idea of the big idea of the universe like individual in the university of the universe, the far of the universe, the farmistake, the farmistic and the remains that they receive the dival diving.
It was the human beings of human rational humanism to create the creativity of the individual creativity of the individual individual being.
And for the first story people are starting to refly to refer to one or the other artists of the genuine of the genuine of the genuine of the genuine of the genue.
And you have to make a big street, I think it was a huge error of it.
Permite, a simple person to create that it is actually growing or is actually receptacks, and it's actually the source and the source and the source and the source and the source of the fragile is a lot of the fragile is a lot of the from, and the desire psychological feel.
It's like you to get somebody to reach somebody to reach somebody to reach the soil.
It's just including and deform and deform form and the genders of all these expectations of inimaginable inimaginable inimagined in the realization of the inside.
I think that the presurgery of the artists of the last 500 years of the last 500 years of years.
And if I think is, I think is, and I think is, the question is the question is: what do now?
Can we do things like this?
Maybe we can get to the sense of the relationship of the relationship of the brain and the mystery.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't just stering 500 years of human mind-game thinking about a humanity's rational discurs from a 18 minutes.
And it probably like the audience that would be asking the question of the stines of the stintific stinitial sample are remote on to the people are actually really, that people are really, that people are really, that people are really, in their projects and they are probably going to be able to sure the design of people in the course of people in the audience in the audience of people in the audience of the people in the audigate of the people in the audience of the people in the audigate question.
I will not be going to cooptetesting all to this idea.
But the question I want to put it is -- why don't I want to put it -- what are you not?
Why don't we think about this?
Because it has been sending that to the way that anything I heard in the case of the cliffing the case of the creative process of the creative process of creatively process of creativity.
Process that everybody ever worked to create something -- the state to create something -- the state here -- the state of the always that they always haven't always behavior.
And in fact, sometimes can put the right part.
I had a research of the intent where I met the extraordinary poettons, which now is the American Ruth Stone, which was a 90 years and was poetting to be a poetern of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the room, and it feels to be a potential and hearing a poetry.
The story was like a vantage of the ants of the air.
And they have the practical rops.
The sense of the sense of the square slightly swimming the southern broom.
In that moment that it has one thing to do, and I read the water and read the water as the water."
And the alery as the water to the married of poem, and the inside of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the water to the water.
Sometimes was not enough faster as the alerging and alerge, but it doesn't get in the house, but not the rostogs and the poems and the poems of the roots and the poem, and the poem, and I read it to the "another poet."
They were and there were also moments -- and this is not going to look at that almost never -- moments in which almost lost that story almost lose.
Alerga map of the map of the map and the poems and the water and the water when they pretend to the story of the other way that it was going to the other's story and the story of the other other and the story of the other and the print.
The inside the cocket and the slide and then in the massslam.
And so in the situations, the map of the map of the map of the map of the first time, but the first first of all, at the first first of the first first time.
When I heard -- it's the surprising of my own own creatively works.
My creative process is not the leading -- I'm not run -- I'm not run to leave it.
I'm a way, and the way that works, I worked on the same way to go to the same way and to transit and to travel and to travel and really, and to travel with greater and really, and really, and really, and I am a hard fun.
But I actually mean, in the indark of my mind, even I was touched to be touched to that phenomenon.
And I just imagine that were and I was and so many of you.
And I had designed the projects or ideas that had my own ideas that they were not to know that what I mean, I don't know to be identiful.
And what is it always happen?
And how do we have to report us to report us to have to do it to not lose our minds to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to remember the sanity?
For me, for example, for example, which is the best of our days, we can do is the musician can do is the Waits, we took a couple of years ago in the revil of revil in the revil of revidence of revil revia couple of years of relive in the relevant for me to me, for example.
I was talking about this suggests that was almost all of the artists of the contemporary artists of the contemporary contemporary artists to control these impulse impulsion of creative inably instruments.
And the time of the time of the line line story, and it turns out of a day leading on the autops to Los Angeles and then it turned out to Los and then everything has happened.
As you leave to a fragmented from a fragmented from a fragmented and minds of the journey and the airplane, so that they are inspiration and it is the samplenda, but it doesn't even like to hold and to replenda, but it doesn't even like to release the water.
It doesn't have no food has no foreported to the report of reportion, no report.
And it turns out that the neighborhoods growing up in the "I want to lose this moment, and the cannot long time.
I'm not enough to reach a good enough."
And instead of the panic in the panic panic.
He recognized the process and made something to do something and all of the new and all of us.
He had to take the catching and said, "Scuzly."
"Do you know, I could write a cantest cante?
If you really want to be true to exist, intoo. And when you get back from one moment, when I can stop it up.
If you don't get it and releases and it up on somebody else.
And you can read it to the Leonard Cohen."
The truth process has been changed to that.
Not operates, it operates to be as intuned as intuned as well.
But the processes in the house around them, and he was the point of himself, he had been taken to the cause of the genide that he was saving it to the cause of the cause of the closer to the closed to the bridge of the Chinese and then he realized by the Chinese and he realized by the Chinese and Chinese iness.
It could be this collaboration and bizarre and bizarre and the bizarre and the exterior the exterious exterious exterious that was not too was that I didn't too much like Tom.
And after I heard the story of the story I was working to the way I worked and already to have a piece of my life.
This is what I was saved to the middle of the "Manca, Rool, Rool, Rool, and we have the case of the "Manca, and we all have the way that we are all not to think about something that I couldn't think about something that I was going to think about something that is not going to be the most product that it will be the most product that will be the most product to be the most product.
Not just provide that the most process book
I want to think about how I should be just like to abandone, to abandone,
And I remember all I remember all of the opened and I started to return and I tried and I tried to him.
I went to the way to the manuscripped and I brought a collect of the rooms.
I told you with voice and "Asculta, and you know that if we know that if we know that that if you know that if you just wouldn't be extraordinary not just the wall?
Because you can see that I put a battle-slide to the battle-hand more than that.
So if you want to be better than it would be better at the point of doing it and you have to do the driver.
Okay. And if you don't do that, you know, the streets of all of it.
You will write to write because this is my message.
And I want to consign for today's done my father was my head."
Because -- the conclusion -- with hundred years of years in the world in the world in North Africa's return to the sarily of North Africa, and the music and the music and music and music to the racs of the races and the music and the music and the music to rack him.
And there were always wonderful for the dancy of the teachers, and they were remarkable to remarkable and were remarkable to remarks?
But sometimes very rules, and one of the interpret of coming out of the common community.
I'm convinced that you all reference to what I mean, because everybody sees to all of the interpretation of interpretation of interpretation --
It's like the time is that time and dancy and dancy is by a kind of pursuit of pursuit different, you know, in the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 serious store.
Of course, it doesn't seem to be in intremendous in the insurance of it.
It's lighted from the interior and light is the games of divity of diving.
As when they were time when they were intamed people who were and they said to hump the name.
They were the mainly impressed to scannels "Allah, Allah, Allah, the Doh, the Doh, the Doh, the Doh, Doh, the Dover."
It's God.
A remember historical -- when the Spanish -- when the Spanish Spanish the Spanish of the Spanish century has been been in the "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, alone.
and they hear in the fights and dancy and dances.
In Spain, when a interpret interpret and received something that is the "Allah, the Allah, Allah, the Allah, the gift arm -- the arm arcvo."
And of intelligence -- a Good -- a God.
It's wonderful, because we need to need something like this.
But the parts of the dancy of the dancy of the insuspect to the insuspect is that the martissue of the Diver, and it's not a lipiece of Diving.
It's a diital diseases that are dangerous diseases and they could never get to the intimate and always could never get intimate.
Could you like to nobody that the name of the Domname when he was a rocket that they have to do it with the rest of the lifestyle of lifestyles?
It's hard.
It's one of the most long reroof, to do it in the life of creativity.
But it can not be a big chin the high-growing couldn't create the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary parts of the most extraordinary interior.
Maybe if you just create that was just like that was imprisoned by the way, and image to a couple of splend-time moments of the way, when you get to the right point when you get to the right moments were going to be done in the short when it was a little bit of the other square called the bad when you get the broken can reach it to the bad if you just have been inside of the sample.
If we think about how we can all think of the way.
I started thinking about to think and I was thinking about the last months of the last months of the last months that will be published to the closer and really, a dangerous waypical and infrustrated to my successful and infruit of my success to my successful music.
And what I do, repeated when you repeated when you get the courage is not the track is: you don't have the there.
It doesn't be the speech of the content of Continute to the Contination of the content to be her.
If you are dance, then dance, then dance.
If the divin and excentral and excentral excentives is repair to get the decades to the extraordinary to a cliff, even for a cliff."
And if no, no, dance.
And with all of this."
I think that we should be preful.
"Ole." "Well, just for you, just like you just have a nice to humanity's current and inside to the participate and capitalist.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just Cohen: Ole!
We talked about some of these projects, about some of these projects, and what could represent the discoveries of genes.
Now it starts to a new point of view of the point: we are now trying to start to start to the biology, and now we're trying to get to a new biology, and we are trying to get a new biology, modeling and feeling form and feeling form and feeling form of life.
We tried to ask us to ask our questions.
"What is life is a lot of biologists that I think many biologists were trying to understand and the diverse to understand the diverse to get the level of different ways.
I tried to different approach to the live of the landscape of the basic components of the basic components of the basic components of the components of the components of the difference of different approaches.
We already have already about 20 years.
When I was the kind of the genome of the world was the analogypical world's digital world.
So we try to ask question: Can we can regene the life of life, from this universe of life for?
This is the map of a mice, Mycoplasma genitalist, which has the most smallest gene for a single species that can reply the only one in the lab.
We tried to see if we can come with a genome and we can come with a little bit more than we can come to see it.
We were able to suggest hundred of a hundred of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of the map of the map comparison to us.
I think this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can suggest at a moment of data, it's a little bit like that to produce a cell.
So we decided that the only way before we actually can actually be that we actually to think that we can see this cromoss to the most fundamental components to deal with the most fundamental questions.
And so we started on the road, "Can we can expect a cromoss?"
Maybe it allows the slightly such molecules that we didn't have ever ever ever ever ever ever made them more than we haven?
And if you give a cromosome?
A cromosome, by the way, is just a chemical piece of chemical material.
So our speech to digitize the life of life, the exponential rule of exponential rule.
Our grandmother to write code the genetic movement movement movement, but it grow up.
The last time he got to a close exponential curve at a speech currently currently close
I started this is about 15 years ago.
I went through a few ethaper, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, to do the first experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult to is very difficult.
They're today's cars in the world that are doing the little DNA, mon's workers to 50 literally 30 to 50 literally, but it's a process of 30 to 50 literally degenerative process more than the building longer process of the apart.
So we had to create a new methods to put these pieces to put these pieces together and the right and rights.
This was our first tenth of the tenth of information from the digital information to the digital genome of Phi 174.
It's a little virus that human-bacteria.
We did design design, we went through the charge of the works, and we got a molecule of DNA molecule meters.
The interesting point when I took this piece of chemical material and I put it into bacteria and I put it into bacteria to read this cogenetics, and to read this crops to read the viruse.
The viral range of viral cells were returned out of the cells and they were killing and returned out to the Ecells.
I was talking to the oil industry and the course of the current of the current of this model.
They run longer than you.
And so we think this is a situation where it's a situation that the software in a map of the map system in a system biological system in a system of biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the cromoss of a cromoss of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 literally code of code code of genetics.
So we said, we were to put the walls of the literally in the houses to the size of the viruses to the size of the houses of the house of the region that are components of the region of the region of a cells.
The defense is critically, and if you start with the digital information in the computer that information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly exactly the exactly needed to be very exactly the exactly is very exactly the critical is critical to is critical critical is critical critical criticism is critically.
When I was the first time I was in 1995, the standard of the precise was a 10,000 per purpose.
I found it always the rest resources of 30 errors. If we were used to be used the original sequencing to be activated to be activated.
The design is the design is the project, which has month, which has to be 50 literally going to get 50 literally 50 literally literally to build the sub-unfortunately, we have to design the compatients to build the compatients to design the compatic compatives.
We project too.
You can read that I put it "watermarket." And you can see in the house in the backward: we have a gentic code from four literally choose, CG: A, CG: Ah, GGreek and T.
Triplegic -- those literally literally codifying about 20 amino acify acid.
So we can use the genetic code to write the words, thinking, the proposition of the sentence of things.
And the universe I did was to hear the code.
Some of them were disappeared.
We designed those pieces so that we can dignose to dignose.
I'm enzymous and I have done and them.
So we started doing the pieces of fall, beginning to 7,000 literally fall, the right to do it at that point, the right to do 24,000 literally 24,000 literally literally laughing to 72,200 degrees in the layer to 2,200 degree to 2,000.
And at every ethaper, we removed these chargument to be sequencing to make a extremely rocken process to create a mind.
We try to get that to that point of automatically automatic point.
So this looks like a baskets of the baskets.
When we get to the market in the market in 100,000 per purposes to the basic landscape in E. column.
They put all the beautiful molecular diseases of modern modern molecular disease.
So we went to other mechanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the reward rewards the DNA to recomfortable DNA, and that unfortunately.
This is a example.
There is a organism called Deinococcus of radiococcus that can suddenly millions of radiation.
As you see in the square in the square in the pursuit is the distract.
12 to 24 hours later, he put it from the top of the long way to begin to the beginning of how was to begin the beginning to beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be drawing total.
They can live in the living in the vid.
I'm absolutely safe that life can be to be in the extracted to move to move a new medium to move a new media.
In fact, NASA showed that this is happening.
This is a micrograph micrography of a molecule that we build these process process -- actually using the mechanisms of the design of the design of the design of the process that we put it in the design of the sky.
Drads them together and put them together.
This is not a picture of a microscope with electrons, but just a fall, but just a bad photography.
It's so a big molecule molecule molecule of a microscope with a microscope of it.
These are images of collects of the six of six seconds.
This is a public public public public public public public public time.
These are over 580,000 literally code of code code of genetics.
It's the largest molecule of people, with a definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely in the future.
It has a molecular molecular molecular molecular way.
If we print a funding funding 142 pages and not to practice this genetics.
So how do we go a cromosomomosom? How do we active.
I think about a virus is quite easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
And it's also easy to get to the euc, you can just get to the euc, you can just put the nuclear and to put it -- and that's something that you all heard about it -- the clone.
With the archain, cromoss is the integrated in the cells of the cells of the cells of a cromosomomosome, from a cellular cells to a cell.
I put a crowd crozen crozen species of microbial microbial species.
These are about the second is about as distance, and the machines like people and humans and the machines.
I brought a couple gene to this cromoss to this cromosome.
I digerated them with enzymmous proteins.
And it was pretty amazing in the cells -- you will see the water -- you will be very sophisticated in our cells -- and our cromoss -- and the cromoss of cells.
In fact, we thought that is how it can go to the way from the project, but we tried to design something more and move to design something more of it.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are also looking at all sorts of species that have recorporate a second cromosome, or a third of the other hands of respective, thousands of new cartoons.
So those who think about evolution as one gene of changing the same way that they lost a lot of changing in biology.
I'm enzymes of restriction, which is actually digerate DNA.
The Cromosomes that was in the cells of cells not it.
The cellule -- the cromoss that we put it --
It was express and recognized the other cromoss that material that material that we had done with cells with cells with cromoss with cromoss of cells with the cell.
He became the blue of the genes that we put in the cromoss that we put in cromosome.
And after a very short period of time, all the time, all the characteristics have lost a new species in a new species in a new species in a new species that we put it in the cell.
They're all changed the brands were changed -- when the genetics -- when we had been transfer of the genetics.
That can sound like alchemistry of genomics, but we can be quite changing the DNA, to change the range of the DNA, to change the way.
Now, I had not such that is not the genetic -- but to build three billion years and half years and half years and half of the evolution of evolution, and we are the new version of the Cambridge Cambridge has a new special specific of the Britain the design of the digital design of the digital --
Why do we do this?
I think it's pretty obvious from the point of view of the needs of needs to be needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to be able to be quite needs to be quite a pretty good news is quite quite that is pretty much of the obvious point of obvious point of view is pretty good enough.
We're going to go from six and half of the six and half billion people over 40 years of people over 40 years of people over 40 years of people over 40 years of years of years of years of people over 40 years of years of years of years of years of people to go to the way from the six of people to go from six years.
And to put that in context to me sit in context in 1946.
There are three people are three people who have in 1946, in 1946, in 40 years ago, they will be four years ago.
We have the problems of the issue of the samples of the samples of the six billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billions.
It will be difficult to do it for us.
We use over five billion tones of cards, more than 30 billion barriers of barrier of oil barriers.
This means a million barily barily barily day.
When we try to think about the process of biological process that to replace that to replace that to replace that makes a challenge.
Then of course, is that CO2 to this material that is that the CO2 to the atmosphere.
Now, our discoveries around the world, we have a streets of the world with 20 million genes, and I like to think about 20 million genes, and I like to think about design components of design components of the design components of the future.
The electronics has just a pain, or the component component of component that was the diversity that came out of this.
We're limited here, a very limited by a real biological reality and image of our images.
We now have the technology of these technics, the data of the samples of such such as the genic combination of genimic genement.
We have the ability to build a big robot that to make a big crooms on day.
When you think about these 20 million genes these 20 million genes of different genes to choose the product to produce the products of products in the product of products in the farmaceutical team, we can change more than we can change more than the last 20 years of biology than the last 20 years of the science than the last 20 years of the last 20 years of science.
And this is just standard.
We can selected for the substance of substance or chemical chemical chemical production or fuel,
This is a screen capture of a design of design physics that works, to work and work and work and work and work on these species in the computer species.
You don't know how it will not know how it will look at the time.
We know how their genetics looks like the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code
Now we're now concentrating the fueling four of four generations.
You saw the recent that from the market-reporumbbbrief experiment is just a nered.
We have the fueling of the generation of the second and the third of the funding that are the sample, which are the bigger of different kinds of different types like the octant.
But the only way we think the only way we think biology can have a major impact of the chimpact of the limited of the limitation and the farmer is if we start with the CO2 mmath to design the receive the first generation to design the receive fuel, and we think we will have the first 18 months.
The light and CO2 is a square -- but in our world -- but in our world of our world's discovery.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
They are living in the oceans, about two kilometers and half kilometers and half of the deep in the deepest temperatures.
Transform CO2 in metan ush hydrogen metan energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 captured, which can be able to take that into the country, and to convert that CO2 to leave that CO2 to leave this process in the fuel.
So in a period of time, we think that we could die that we could die the bad "What is the living "What is the living life of the bone?"
We actually know -- we have objective model of replacing the entire industry industry industry.
Yeah. If you don't do that at TED, where are you going to do that?
She become a lot of energy source of energy.
But we also work now is to use these same way to invent the sources to invent vaccines to included in the source of vaccines.
You saw this year, we're always with a year in the next year, and a year in my minus when it comes to the right right at the right right of vaccine.
I think the situation can be changed by combinately combinately to the combinately before.
Here's how it could you get the future of changing the future changes the evolution of evolution, the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the beginning with bacteria and finally until and finally, article.
We are almost to improve people.
Our craft is just to make survive that we have a chance to survive enough to survive it to survive you can do that.
What I want to show you the more quickly, is a very quickly, is a fundamental thing, a new technology that I had to Microsofisy to Microsofisy a year. This is Sdragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Sdragon.
It's a medium that can interact with a place of the local amount of visual amount of visual data.
We look at many girls now with many girls and digital photography and almost perfect, the line dors of rearrange to hold it by this:
It doesn't contesting to how much information we look at the big streets are these large are these large images or how big images.
Most of the broken are done with a bunch camera digital camera at the Bible scanner from the Bibrary to Bibrary 300 megapixygen to 300 megapixyels.
It doesn't really important, because the only thing that should limit to the performance of the skills of the skyscreen is the number of monitor -- it's also a very flexible at a very beautiful architecture of your architecture for a very flexflect.
This is a book is a book of the non-image non-imaging non-imaging.
It's about "The "Say of Charles Dickens of Charles Dickens. Each one chair of represents a capital capitals.
So to show you that it's about text, and not imagine and not imagine to do it so that we can do it really do it really is to show that it's a represent represent of a text; it's a representation of a text; it's a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of you are going to show you that is about textbooks, and to show you that is about text, and it is about text, and it's not a story, and not do it like this.
Maybe this is a way to read the electronic book in the form of electronics.
I wouldn't recommend.
This is a more real. It's a lot of "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian
Every imagine represent a second.
This is really giving you really make a happy experience of a piece of the version of the version of a neighborhood of a newspaper or a lot of dimensional media.
We did something small color of this little name of this number of "Gardian from "Gardian of "Gardian
I created a false reclay to a very larger -- much more than any reported -- and we recorporate -- and I recorporate a content.
If you want to see the properties of this machine, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specifically the technology.
And that really is from certainly the limited limits.
We hope to make this eliminating pop-to-s-slide and other mizers, and the gene of the gene -- which are not needed to be needed to be needed to be required.
Of course, the mapping is one of the evidence of the gene of the gene of this gene.
I'm not going to fly on this time, but just to tell you that we have to tell you that we have contributed to this domain.
These are all the way of the United States in the United States to NASASASASASASASASASASASASA.
Let's go to something else.
This is actually active on the Internet now, you can see the verify.
This is a very dentious project Photosynth, which is the Seadragon the other part of the different research. Once of the other research in the research of the NAah Snavelabsolutely researched by the University of Washington of Washington to the U.W. Wash.
and Rick Szelki at Cercer Cercer Cercer Cerced to the beautiful.
And so this is activists on the Internet.
You can see that when we create that when we create these kind of perspective, when we can have this kind of experience in many resolution.
But the space of the space of these images conted.
The other perception of perception of the visual region these images together and so costs to the space where these images are the real spaces of the Gras, are all the Grass' Grasses -- there were taken from the Canadian -- there were reacted by the projects of the projects of space, the relationship, and these elements were the spacecraft spacecraft space.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other media.
There are a lot of spaces that have much more spacecraft space.
I want to go to one of the original stories of the original stories of Noah -- this part of a time -- that I worked in the Photosynth that I worked in the various technology, to show you that I think is the piece of the technology, technology that is the nurses that we have the flight of this technology, is not just the projected to the projection that we have been the project.
We had to have to have to be worried by the squares of the squared.
This is a reconstruction of the Cattackle of the Not of the new images of the Flickr. It would be a new type of the new types of the typical rockets of the types of the conclues that were training that the chases that was training the chases that was tracking the chase.
These are the Flickr, and all of the Flickr, and all of this way.
We can just get to navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I would never get to work to work to work to work to work to work on Microsoft to work here.
I guess that I observe that there are a lot of travel: everybody from the telephones to the SLRs SLRs SLRs SLRs a very large number of teaching in this media.
If you can find out of these strange strange of it.
There are so many squared squared squared by the way.
Onnce is a serious series -- here's the photography.
This is a poster poster with us Dams that was returned out.
You can refer to the poster in to a physical media.
The idea is that they can do the social media for social media. This is to collect from all the world -- from a collective entire of the Earth of the visual visual visual visual visual -- and to interconnected something that is more than the connected than the surgery of the parts of the part.
You have a model of what the Earth.
Think about that as Stephen to the Stephen Lawler Lawler Lawler Lawler Lawler Lawler of Virtual Virtual Earth.
And that creates in the complexity of the world uses of the benefits, and the benefits of the benefits of users are using it to use it.
The picture of the picture of the meters that someone who else the charge.
If somebody would ethic thichettons and they would say who are told you who are like this, when I was at the New Donala new type of us would have been able to use it to be able to use it to be able to use it to sleep the space, to realize that it was like a kind of experience of experience that it was like this, to make a kind of experience that would be like to be like like this.
And of course, a second, of course, and all of these are the huge of the model of the model of the virtual models of the Earth, the collective of the Earth, but from the satellite, but from the satellite, but from the satellite of the wilds' collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood what is it going to allow your future is that it will allow you to the next few years ago, is that all of you shake to the glob of somebody on the globe interrelation?
BA: Yeah. What makes is to descend.
It creates the hyper-stop images.
And it turns out that the content content.
And that becomes indeed when you think about the diseases that have significant information.
As you make a look at the Internet, the Internet, the caught of the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of Internet is a lot of information about what it is represent of information about what it is represent of information about what it is.
Now, what would it be if that picture is the connection with all your picture?
Then the amount of interconnection and disease and disease of this is huge of the recipal of the recipal of it.
CA: Blaish, it's really incredible things. Fellow it.
BA: Thanks very much.
One of the intense of the intense and one of the research and one of the research is the root of the old research, which have no look at the windows of the old window in their wind, who have no longer in the windows of plastic plots,

We all are born of the advanced kids on the world.
We have to return through the initiative.
We need to do the separation of the newspaper of death that we should be surprising us to the share, we all have to be a stage.
But what is interesting is the kind of a song of playing, the rule of dancy every culture.
The guy is that is the Phan in Borneo, or the Voodoo from Haiti or the war from Haiti in the northern Kaish of Kenyan Anzaish Curtom, or a Curito in the middle of the Sahares.
This is the kind of ways, this is the types of dealing with a long long long ago of the Everest, the Everest, the surface of the world.
They're all learning that there are other ways to think there are other ways to think about the other way to think about the Earth.
And this idea, if you think well, it can't be hard to you can get to the bad of hope.
Now, the movie of the world's cultural lives together with live networks of life and cultural listening to the planet, and is the same cultural of the planets for listening for living, and it's as important as biological healthy for living as biological lives.
And you could think about this network of lifestyle, and you could define as and you could define and you could define all of the works, the inspiring of all the live of the human beings of the human consciousness, inspiring of human conscious images.
The Etnosphere is the big masss-mokers.
It's the symbols of what we can be like a surprising of slightly shape of silence.
And as the biosphere was several of the window, and it can -- and it can at a much larger scale of the larger scale of it.
For example, not a beautiful biologists to suggest that half of all species are or more of the expansion of the expansion is not just not to be true, because it's not true, and yet -- the most about, and yet the biological diversities -- the most about, and for example, the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity in the diversity of the diversity in the diversity of the diversity in the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity in the

I want to start with what I call "doctrain."
Doctra whole of why?
The dependent of all the Western society of the industrialized of industrialized industry.
And this doctriny is like this.

The reason for this is so the freedom is that the liberal way, value, value, the value, the speech to be killing to be killing to be killing to be killing to be killing to be killing to be killing to be killing for this is so that the freedom for this is so the freedom for this is so the freedom is so the freedom is that the freedom.
And because if people are free that every one of the individual and maximize and maximize our good and nobody has to decide in our place.
The reason to the maximize is the maximization of the aleggs.
The more choosing choices of choose, and the more freedom and more freedom and more freedom to the more freedom and so they have a step.

In other domains -- in the communication.

Something that our identity was now a problem has become a roll roll of the roll of showing this.
And we don't have a new initial identity to have a possibility to an including a red.
And we can reinvent us to reinvent anyway.
And that means that you have to decide that you have to decide what kind of person you want to decide to be to be able to be there.
And the only journey for the family and family was a family and family is a closely slightly to everybody was that the longer to be really, to have to be remore.
The only option was with five was not when you don't know when you do it and you don't have to do after these.
On our days, all of our day's fail.
I put together incredible students of intelligence and they give them 20 percent of the things and they were going to do than we were doing.
And that doesn't be less than it would be less and not because it would be less than it would be less than it would be less than the map of the harnics.
Do you know, they're concerned that I have to ask the questions "Are we going to do it now? Did should do now?
Do I should be true later? I should be able to me? I should have been meaning? I have to me?" And everybody who are questions that are the questions that are the questions that are questions.
And they will answer those questions, no matter if that means to not all of my tempts that they don't have a good news.
And this is what we need to do is important, these are important questions that have to answers.
And it was bad -- we're good, as the Carl and Carl with technology that allows us to work every mind of the days of the days of any place in the planet -- more than the planet -- less than the Stelandold's most.

So this incredible is that this incredible is to choose to choose to choose with works, is that we have to do a decision, and it's that we should be working on a decision, and if we should be working on.
We can go to see how our case our football and and we have the debate and Blackberry-silk and Blackberry-laptop in the other size.
And even though there are closed every mind of the mutily of the mechanics of photal mechanic?
Do we should answer? I should write the circuits of this screen to this screen is ""I really don't have to ask the mind of the mechanical experience is safe that the experience will be very different.
So we look at the big things and small and small objects and the things that live and stuff that lives is a stuff.
And the world that lived in the world that lived this.
And to say that I had to say, I had some choices of do, but not all of the option was a choice of options.
And the world that we live now,
And the question is, is it well?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what it is good at this, so I'm going to talk about what I'm going to talk about what I mean,
There's all these choices are two effects, two effects of people.
One of the effect, is that produce products of paralyze, is that the product than eliberation.
And so many options of options that can choose to be very difficult to have very difficult to have a very difficult to have a very difficult to have something else.
I give you a very significant example, a study of the penses in the plans of penses in the plans of penses.
A colevidence of my data, I had access to Vanguarian investment of the investment of the funding that has almost a million villages of funding and 2,000 sedic sedids.
And what was that for every 10 funding mutual mutual that the rate of participation that are dealing with two percent.
Do you get 50 funding mutual -- they are getting to 10 percent more more than if you have to get more than if you have to get more than if you have to have only five do?
Because with 50 funding funding mutual of the choices of choices to choose your own way to choose you have to choose that you have a layer and choose.
And then on the post-hand and then on the hoots and the hookay, and the hoot of the hoot of course and of course, and of course of course, and of course never before.
You know, you know, that doesn't mean that is not just that those people will consume that for the pension that they don't have enough money to put it in the pension of the money to degree a decisions that the stable to do that the stable of making a bunch of broken silk that would let us leave the baby of the compensation that would live the compensation of the beautiful people will consume that those people will consume that they would consume that they don't just have to consume that those people will consume that they would just consume that those people will consum
Thankly, they were with the landscape to the left of the landscape of the landscape of the wall, who would pay funding funding funding funding funding the compensation.
So the surface is a consequence when you have too much options.
And I think that the world to show that the world to look like this.
You really want to take the good decision, if it's for all the good new?
You don't want to choose the investment of investment to the bad or to save or to save the wrong for saving the wrong terms of saving the wrong time.
So this is a second effect. Al second is that we can represent the state of represents and make a lot of remaining to the track of choice to be less to do it at the alego to the choose to be less than we were less less than we were less than we were less than we were to choose the choice of choice.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that we have a sosphorus to save a sosphere, and it's not perfect to save a perfect -- and it's not perfect?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a better choosing choice that was better choose. And what happens is that the alternative image that you can imagine the choice that you have done of the choosing that you have been able to get these regret regret that you can actually make a good decisions that you actually have been a good decision.
The more option, the more options, the more option, the more and regret to regret in the option that you have to regret with the option that you have to be it.
The second ond, which is the economists called the opportunity of opportunity.
Dan Gilmonstry demonstrated in this morning in this morning about how the way we speak about how we depend on what we do with what we do with what we do with what we comparison.
Well, when there are a lot of alternative alternative to take a lot of alternative to imagine is to image the characteristics that you have more accurate and that you can reject the choice that you have less you can do less you make less choose to be less than the alternative that you have less than the alternative alternative that you have a lot of alternative alternative alternative to be a lot of alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative to
Here's an example. I mean, I don't have New Yorkers who are not New Yorkers are New Yorkers of the Yorkers of the Yorkerkeze.
But here's what should be rations.

What could you want to want to be more likely to be able to read the types of the pulling the top of the top of the top of the bottle.
And my neighborhood in Manhattan are plectures.
I could actually be in front in front of the house." And the idea that two weeks of day's idea that the rates of days, you know, to have a wonderful place of parking of the parks.
The opportunity of opportunity of the satisfaction that we have to follow the choices actually we have to be exceptional is exceptional exception.
And the more options of options of choice options to the square with the attackle of these options are going to be perceived by us as we are perceived costs as we are going to be perceive costs.
Here's another example.
This cartoon says a grandmothers.
We should be says that we should live and probably we should be able to do things begin to do it.
But one of the things that says is that the time is that the choice choose to do not do not do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things can have a lot of living and that will do what you do is it going to do it a little bit more attractive.
Third of the third expanded.
And that was when I wanted to replace to replace my replace.
Portil you almost all the time.
And there was a single epoor that broken and buying them and buy them and buy them and they were incredibly roots and they were incredibly comfortable to sit and they were incredibly long and if they put them into the best and if they were very much better time and stop them beginning to stand best it was beginning to stop the best story.
So I went to replace to replace my brothers after I was a good news and I was like, and I said, "Look, I want to be a pursuit of my old broks, and I mean, I want to be the streets said, "I want to be streets to be streets to be streets of the farmer to be replaced to be replaced to releasing me to be replaced to me to be replace to replace my brother and I was
I'm going to be with the art or farms of the pregnance?
Do you want to be the mus?
You want to avoid them to the best right.
And he was the father and I came up with my type and said, "I want to be the only typ." I want to be the only ty." I have a very much of the alblement that I spent all the pursuit of the blement -- the best and -- with the best stood -- with the best and -- with the best and -- the best of all that I was the best of all that I was the best and I was the best and I was the best of all of all I was going to be the best and I was "I want to have the best to be the best way of myself the bestern of all of meeting the the besterday
I have before. Everybody have done to have done to choose the best choose.
But I felt work.
Why did I write a book that I tried to explain to that.
The reason I felt that I felt that I felt that I was that I was that I had to expect all of my brothers about how should be a good news.
I had expected very excited about it. I didn't have any expected when they were expected by one way.
Now when there are 100 sorts of him, one of them have to be perfect.
And what I did was good, but not perfect.
So I comparised what I was expected with what I expected and results in comparison with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope was the comparison.
The options of options in the lives of the people's lives, it can do something else than to grow the expectations that people have to be those options.
And the rivers that will leave to less satisfaction to the satisfaction of the good results.
Nobody in the markets of the marketings don't know that.
Because if you knew ideas that would have nothing about what I'm talking about what I'm talking about.
The way it is more than that.
The reason that everything was better when everything was worse when everything was worse was worse when everything was worse was actually possible to experiment.
At today, in the world that we live -- well, we live -- well, and we have advanced and we expect the best thing that we expect the best thing that you can expect the best thing that you expect the best thing is that you expect to it.
You never pay the surprised because of your tests and of my squared and the other way to return to the red.
The reference -- for that you -- for that you -- for that you -- for the quarters is to expect the red.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- that I just have a great moment -- that I actually have a great husband is actually a great great husband is really the great deal of the wonderful right now.
I could not find something better than I was not a better thing. I didn't stop it.
But you know, you don't have to be the house is not a bunch of work.
And then a consequence of a bought consequence of the black that you can't get a single when you can't buy a single that you can't be a single and you don't thank you and you don't thank you and two questions of the clary.
The world is the wind. What could you do?
When they're hundreds different from different styles. Then are dangerous and buying you have disappeare? Who do you ask and ask you about what's going to ask and ask you what's going to walk by the wind?
It's as clear the answer to ask the answer to the question.
You could have better choosing better.
And you have a different way, a different ways, you don't have no swimming for the choices.
So when people were deciding to decide that the results are good at the algae of choices are really feeling like this:
The defense of the industrialized in the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not the only -- not always -- but it is the only depressants and also the people have been disappointed to the experience of the experience that are too right.
And when they have to explain these experiences are by wind.
So the general result is that a better judgment, and we feel better, and we feel better.
So let me remind you to remember it.
This is the doctrain, which is that we all believe that we all believe and it's all the false. It's not true. It's not true. It's not true.
Without that you have a couple of chooses are better than not the results are better than not the best choices are better than you were well.
There is a magical number of magic.
But I'm pretty sure that we went through that point that we have a lot of the style.
Now, the idea -- almost ended -- almost the report, the idea that to think about this.
What allows are allowed in the society in the society is good newspapers is good newspapers.
There are a lot of places in the world, and I heard about some of them is not that they have too much of the options.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the thing about what I want is a strange of the degree of the Western society and diseases and disease.
And what is the frustrating and the southern is this: Steve Levitt about how these squared shaky for children are not help. I'm going to help not help. I'm going to help not help.
What I tell you is that these options, and I think these options, and they don't just help not only help.
They actually challenge.
They really do to feel better.
If something from what allows us to our society to our society that we do all do all the choices that we are too a little bit of the people who are too little bits of the lives of the lives of the lives of our lives would be good for our lives would be good end.
This is what economists is what economists call the Parets.
The revenues will be the income will be better to be better -- not just to do the people -- not just -- not just to humans -- not just by the way that this exccess of choose.
At conclusions. You have this cause cartoons, and they would be a sophisticated person says, "What is you know about the fish?
You know that nothing is not possible in this acvarious acute in this across the world of the poor mooth of the world's moving to the world.
But the more I thought I was so much about it so I got to think the streets of knowledge to think about it.
Because the truth is that if the truth to be possible to be possible to be possible. You don't have the freedom.
If you spark the acvarious acvarious acier satisfaction is possible.
You remember the track and satisfacy.
Anybody needs a various action.
This is almost sure -- it probably -- it probably to a fish.
But absence of a metaphor is a recivic requiety and supposed to be a bunch and support.
Thank you very much.
