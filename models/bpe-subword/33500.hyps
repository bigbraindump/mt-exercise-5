And the year I argued these two smart slide to demonstrate the polar of the polar that most of the last three million years of the last three million years of the last three million years old, it was a little bit of fourth of the last percent of the last few percent of the same.
But this morning of this is special special issues because it doesn't look at the gross of the guy nothing that doesn't look like the gossion.
The polar is is a way of part is a way that the building of global building.

This is the anual anual anual gain.
And they give it a little bit of a window window.

That's why our principle goes to spend a big main a big shape for the public fortunately, and we have the truth.
The thing is that, in fact, in fact, it's not dirty dirty bone.
We believe that it's currently -- and the floor and well.
So it's not going to ingrijors for climate change.
Lask that we realize that we are in our lives

So let's do you do a team of this city of this city of installation of the carbon the carbon carbs.
Hello. Masinaria is about about is crazzgomots.
But this is the sound of the game of the game of the game of the game.

Thank you very much of it.
The year I did a TED I made a LHC.
And I promised to come and give you a data and give you a data apart of that works in this way.
So here is the horrible. And for those who was here -- LHC is most experiment is the most experiment that was certainly recreated the 27 miles -- Cirumination or is about 27 miles of a few million or is more than a billion of more than 600 billion of the universe -- the massh of the unique -- the massive of 600 billion times a second.
It's extremely ambitious.
This is the city of the Geneva.
We make photographs these mind "Big Bangs" in the decades.
I work on this way. It's called the ATALASTALS -- Lunger -- Lunger -- Lunger photographs a photography of the AT's detectors here to be series to proportion.
On the year 10 sepatient I started the first time I started the first time.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
He causes a huge cells in the room.
It's a physical picture of the first particular particular particular room that has been able to the LHC, the LHC, and the LHC, and the deliberately deliberately deliberately detector.
In other words, when I was seen that I was seven that I was a 10-seped machine, which is a huge successful for a huge successful thing.
I don't know that if that was the largest ovacute or that, when someone went on the page of the page, and he seeing the first page of the art art of this way.
It means that I did a cultural impact.
After a climate sappeared a problem with a problem with these physical problem, which actually had to make with these aur.
Those are the 13 transports of both when the machine works at power to power to power the power of power to power the power of power to power
Now, the engineering of his life and says, "I can't transport the atmachiners. They're being myself."
But I can do that when they're at the temperatures become the top of the superconductor.
So as a 27-27, as a field of the street between the street and those are those are able to transport like these kinds of such house can transport silence.
At one of the laws between 9,000 magnets in LHC, was a fabratic defect.
So that competition was a little bit of a young people who were inspired by both of the electric resisten.
This was the result.
This is more impressioning that those magnets are making a meters, and they have been funny about 30 cloth.
So we determined about 50 magnets of 50 magnetwork.
We had to take them to the affect took and down.
I reconnecting it all repair all the time.
And now we go to the magnetish back in subteran.
The past to the sexy of the LHC is will be like new LHC is going to be like us.
So we will start to go back and float and we have to get data or hythesia, and we will continue to be continued to affect the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, those accident, those accidents accidents about the important and engineering and engineering to reject the extremely reject.
I think that the fact that the fact is so difficult to be so difficult to the fact that we have the very important experiments like HCA.
So I'll let the inchoice of a scientistian British Davy, Humphrrey Davy, when I was a receive beyond the protect of the protect of the protect of the protect of progress that we had no longer to progress are funny not enough to progress are funny not finishing the light-termind and finished well."
Thank you.
I wanted to start with the ramming to remember the childhood, when you play with the bottom of the bottom with the board of the bottom of the board.
On the months of what you have to engineering them to fly and teaching them to the cology of the cology of how to figure out how to figure out how to figure and removing and removing the relationships.
The space is the professor is profound a big part of how we intellect.
So in the research research research of this usual inspired by this physics -- inspiring with my physical consultant, and my collaboratory -- I indeed my collaboratory -- I indeed to the collaboratory -- I indeed a computer in this unplan with a computer floor of this fun floor of this farmers that we figure out a deeper and information of a floor of a funny that we can remembers and information
So what do we want to do we want to us.
The question was so fascinating that I decided to ask the research for the answer to the Siftable.
On the short Sift-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-sanitation.
They can be manufactures, they can perceive perceive the perceior perceived a radio and a wireless and a radio radio radio radio radio radio radio radio radio radio ran and they can be a reless.
The most important is that they are palpable to do the game as the case of the game as just approaching it.
And Sifabove examples of a new equipment of a new manipulation of digital information of digital information of digital information
On the massh of what these instruments becomes more painter, more constant constantly one of the constant constantly of our actism actissue of the inceive and determines of interact.
You start with a few examples of examples.
This Sift-Sift is configure video video guns in a handle in a handle in a handle in a handle in the other hand, if you reach including the including including the including including ink.
These portraits of interactive are constantly one of the other.
So, if you put them together, I put together, it becomes interested in other interest.
If there are inconjected and that, and they can become confusion.
They can feel the missing and clining and incline.
We realized that one of the interesting involates of interacties is that we can use the gestures that we can use the gestablish, like we have a color how we have a color how we have a liquid lick of a lhighly license of a lhigh school as a lymmethood that one of the involving one of the interesting of the in
In the case of this case, we have three Sifables as a galetettled and can use them to return them into the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the case of this case in the case of this case in this case, we have three Siftables of this galted.
If I was too much fun, we can actually fly in the inside of the crops.
There are also interesting possibility for education, like education, like language, mathematics and logical logical and logical people's going to give the people to see the results of the results of the results of research for the results of the results.
So here I -- this is a Fibonacy Fibonacial programs.
Here we have a game of the words, a combination of combination and Boggle.
Finally, in every Sift is a literally in every Siftable, and the massh that I try to form the word of form that they try to form with a dictionary.
And then after 30 seconds of seconds are rety-tech and a new ty-settled and new possibilities and new possibilities of trip.
Thank you.
These are the children who came in excursive in the Media, and I had to make them convinced them to try to make them a movie.
They love them to the news.
And one of the interesting of this kind of application is that kind of application is that you don't have to give them a lot of instructions.
All of you have to say, "For a word and they know what to do.
Here are some of people intrigging them to him.
This is the most tanar tester in our right, game in the right.
It seems like everything that he wanted to do was to put it on the other other one.
So for him to him it.
This is a interaction apply apply of animation.
We wanted to build a top of the people who invest language.
And this is Felix.
He can enter new character, just the stena, just the Sift of the Sifables that affects that affects the characters.
Here is introducing the sound.
Video: She race.
David Merrill: Now he got a tractor in the stage in the stage of the stage.
Video: Tractor the portop of the beginning.
Good woo! Yeah.
Miss Siftable and Siftable and assing them one can make them interact with the characters -- Video: Ham!
DM: I create their narratic narrative.
Video: Heal!
DM: It's a final story with the final story of how it will draise it fashioned it.
Video: Zara, the sanit!
DM: The last example I showed today is a today to make it is a music instrument and interpreted music and instrument that Sift the role role and took the sound of sound like Sift and tobas well.
Every one of these four different variation has four different variations that you want to use it.
And you can injects injects in a successful way you can assemble the guy that guys you will.
You put the sound sounds touches of sound Siftable-samples of a successful Siftle.
There are effects that you can control the live, like the philanthrop.
He's atasses a certain sounds and then they including it and then they have the help.
Look at the general effects like tempt and volume volume that is apply the square sequencing to see it.
Video: DM: DM: Dever, we start a second Siftables in a successful baby, and we have a series, and we have a series of a series of a series of a series of a series of the well-to-g.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: DM: Dealth pery the percupy perceiving percues.
Video: DM: DM: And now I'm going to add the effect of the live of the live of the live ve ve ve ve for the live one.
Video: DM: Ma: Maybe the second secsecond secsecsecsecond or in a part or in a part or in a part or in a part or in a part of the other or in a part of the Videoty's work.
Video: DM: Don: Now I'm going to atask for more expression of the expression of the expression.
Video: DM: Don: May retack as a quantum as a cances.
So I don't have to do the plan, I can improvise, months of the walking or massive or make.
Now, in the sex, I can throw the insurance of using the Sift Sift Sift in the Sift in the stangle.
Thank you.
As I see my passion is creating new interface, is creating new interface, that it works better with the way that works better with our brain and our body body and our body body and our body body and our body body and our body body and our body body body and our body body is seeing the brain is seen as well.
And today, I had a time to show this new space of this new space, and a few of the process that we try and put them out of the possibilities that we try and stover.
The one that I was a retinier to retinet is that we're at the new generation of instruments of instruments of instruments of digital instruments that will advertising our remain our world of our rules in our world of our rules in our retine.
Thank you very much.
Astep, I have to talk to you with you today.
They're writing.
He wrote is my teach, but it's also a more than that.
It's all my mother love and fascinates and fascinating.
And I don't have the this: She changes the time.
But these guys are kind of like that love enough to live in my life and in my life and in my career, which he determined me of my relationship, and I determined me of work.
And the thing that I wrote is that I wrote this book, this book, "Manca, Roah Roa-Iube, Roail Iube, Iube, and he was a sensor of the chart of the cartoon for a symphysical methaling in the world for a sense.
The religion is that the horrible people are going to be damnature.
Serible -- condamnature, condamnature."
At example of instead of land and you say, "Do you don't have the themselves, you don't have the performance of this?
Do you don't have the team is going to keep the life of the life of the life of the street the book a book the world that you want to put the world on the world that ever be?"
It's very linest, indeed,
But it was also a remember if I was not my remember like 20 years, when I started to start to be a great time -- when I was a writing -- as I was a writing -- as I was a writing reaction -- I want to react the same reactive reaction of reactive reaction on a frick.
And people said, "No, no, you don't have any more successful than you have never been successful for successful to you?"
Do you don't test the wild of the reject?
You don't have the fear of your life as a life of your life and nothing in this domain, and nothing to come here and you won't come to deadly deadly on a farming dead of the pharming of the center of the mirrrules of the middle of the case of the screen of the second of the screen of the inside of the inside of the work?"
Something like this.
The reassessment -- the rack on all those inside questions is "Yeah, I said, "Yeah, yeah, I said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I ask the assessment --
Yeah, you know, it's teaming all of those things.
And he always photo.
And so it's the teams of floor many other things that people can inherited them can't involved.
As a big example of the largest things that are infruit are infruit are infruit
But when he talked about writing the word that I was thinking about what I was all the last time is "Why?"
Is it something rational right?
It's logic as anyone to be the themselves to be the themselves to make them have been enough to make it at this Pamant.
And what is so specific initiatively that seems like non-inistic inistake is really sanately in a kind of kind of a mental teaching that other professional teachers are doing a kind of a teaching teaching teaching teaching issues are attempted attempts to be attempted to the inside.
My teach, for example, it was engineer and not remember that in the 40 years old, you know, the engineering of the engineering is not a chemist.
It didn't come up with -- John, John, how do you go with chemical?
It's just not just happening to come up with something.
But to be honeybeeke-engineering engineering for the century of the century of the reputation of the reputation of the own.
We write inkers, and we have this reputation, and not only writors, but artists like this reputting this reputation that they have this reputation of being powerful labeled by the labeled of being powerful labels.
And all of us do is to look at the number of morning the number of morting, just in the 20th century, in the 20th century, which have died by the mind of creative, which have died by the young and opening on the own handling of the own men and open.
And even the same thing that was a characters seem to be a degrees of the own talent of your own talent to the talent of your own talent to the talent one.
Norman Mail, indeed inside the last dign, in the last book, she said that "Every y" was a little bit more than my book."
A great main extraordinary mountains about a life.
But it doesn't have the clipied when we hear someone day's heard that I heard of these things that we heard of things and put it together, and it was a complete and suffering and suffering and suffering and suffering and suffering and conduct the art and conduct it all the inherent and conduct the suffering and conductor.
And the question I want to address today today today is there, you are in this is: You're all impacts with this ide?
You're comfortable with her such as a light of the light of the light of the light of this ipotter.
I think it's over.
And I think it's dangerous and not as well as well as well as well as a perpetual in the future.
I think it's better if it's better artisted us to live of the artists of living to live to live of living to live in.
And I know that I certainly my situation -- my situation -- my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to come up with my intuition of this ipottery intuned in the hypothesis now professional teaching teaching the circumstance.
As for example, I'm pretty much in a 40 years.
I probably have a decade decades before the money before.
And it's very probably like, I will write incept to be judges like the mountained by the money as a successful money as a successful challenge of my neighborhoo?
What would be to say the maining machines, because of all of the people here are already -- it's very likely to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be a lot of people would be able to say the farmers of men,
Oh, oh, oh, what okay!
This is the kind of gypes that could make someone to the horse to the sleep of the nine of the non-morning.
I refer to do this message that I love message.
And then the question becoming wonderful question?
And so I put a lot of meditative, like manify that manify now, to work now, to write a kind of a building psychological building psychological protective, right?
I have to think about a way to find a way to get a way to figure out a distance, and my team, and my team, and my team, and my team, and my team, and the team,
And as I was all the last year models in this sense of the time that I started to come up with the time, and I tried to see if other society to see if you could have better ideas and sanatisfy to be better ideas about how to be able to deal with how to be helping people create in art of the art of the art of art of the art of art of the art of the art of art in this sense of art in this sense of art in this sense of a challenging of the purpose, and I started to see the purpose sense of this
The recircle in Greets and Roma antic Roma ancient and Roma antic Roma antic Roma
So the main the main the city chair is shark.
But in the time Great and Roma antic Rom, and the Romantic Rome, and the human-coming beyond the human-being?
People thought that creativity was a spiracy that was a massh of a source of a moster and unfortunately, and unintelligent and unexpected and unexpecutive.
The Great these spirit of creativity, creativity, the term of the term "Maybe the term "May."
The overcross was fairly because it thought it has a smart that the shape of the shape of department.
The research on the same parents, but they called the creative, but they called the creative, genius.
What is wonderful, because the romans, they were actually thought a genius was a kind of a genius was a cheeath individual cheers.
They thought that a genius was a kind of a mesh of a divincing of the study of the study of the wall, in a kind of like Dobby, and insession of the artistic and insession of the artistic and insession of the work, model, model, model, model, and the result of the works.
Absolutely strallowed -- that's the distance, which is the building that I was talking about -- that built psychological results.
And all the world step as a work?
So the year year is protected by some things, like for example, a lot of narcism, right?
If you were the mountaining was the stralucted, you couldn't have the world as you had this genius as a physics that you had helped you to helped you to helped it.
If you was criticized criticized the wine, right?
All the world as ignorance.
So they looked people in the West period of time for a long period of time.
And then came up with Renast, and all of the idea, the idea of the big idea, the idea of the big idea, the idea of the universe as individual home, the center of the universe and mystering and mystery for creatures.
It was the human beginning is the human rational and people started creativity as creativity of the individual beginning.
And for the first oversial history, and they start to get a or another or one or one or one or one of the artists of a genius.
And you have to make marriage, I think it was a huge error herror hers.
And the pyrolling person to create as a person or it is actually receiving the receiving and the source and the incher and the incher and the incher and the inside of the myster is a little bit of a fourth of the four-too many of the psychological novel of a fragile of the psychic person is a little bit of person to be a little person of the person is actually a little person of the person of a person of the person is actually a person or person to make the receive
It's like you to reach someone who are a so-sashite.
It's just a incovoice and funny and shapes of these expects are all of these inimaginable inimaginable insight.
I think that pressure this prison us one of the last 500 years.
And if I think it's true, and I think is, what do is we do now?
Can we do things like el?
And maybe we go to the senses of the senses of the brain and the mystery of the creativity.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't just stering 500 years of thinking about 500 years of thinking about a humanistory, and in a 18 minutes.
And it probably as the audience that would be asked the question that the question of the stiintive style, which is actually the people who are actually presented the people prearing and all of their own and all of their own and all of their own and all over the projects and all over the projects and all of their own and all of their own and all of their own affect in their own audience in the audience of people in the audience of people in the signs of the assessing of people in the asseting question,
It probably will not be going to cooptest on this idea.
But the question I want to put it -- why don't you -- why no?
Why don't we think about this?
Because it has sensed as any else of something else I heard in the explanation of the crazy of the creatic processing process of the design process.
The process that anyone who was trying to create something -- practical -- I mean, you know, all of the behavior that doesn't behave behavior.
And in fact, sometimes can put the paranormalist.
I had a research where I knew that I knew extraordinary American poettone, which is now in the 90 years ago, which is now in the 90 years ago, and that was the postory of the story of the type of life is intaming the windge of the winds of work, and she feels the camp, and she felt the room, and she heard the rock of the room.
The story was like a vantage of the layer of air.
And it goes up to the case of the camps.
The sense of the sense of the pamters are swalking the painting.
And that moment that has a single thing that has a single thing, which is quite a single apattach."
And the alerging aps to the house and the house, and the engineering and a map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the house.
Sometimes was not enough as a alerging and alerging and alergy, but not the rule and the house, and she was not the rostog, and she was the rostood on the rostood on the rosteel on the rostealing rook."
They were also in which -- and this is not going to look at this point -- when the story of the losing story as much as much as much as much as much as much as much as a losing of the losing of the losing of the losing of the loss that -- and they were not going to be in which -- and they were going to look at that -- and they were going to look at the point where -- and I'm going to look at the times -- and this is not going to look at the point of it.
Other home, the map of the map and the paper and the water and the exact of the exact of the exact of the exact of the other and story that was indeed with the other and the story and printed it with the other and printing and printed it to the other.
The first car the poems of the coad, and the source of the massh of what the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the cropps of the croppen the poemed of the clippper crowd.
In this situation, the paper peak of the perfect and intack and intack at the first time at the first year at the first year at the first year at the first year at the first time.
When I heard -- it's exactly exactly how my own own design.
My creative process is not limited to this -- I'm not drift.
They're a kind of working on the same way that I was going to go and recognize and to travel and to travel and recognize and really, to travel with hard and really, really hard to stop and stretched a hard and a story that I work for a hard and settle, and I'm a way that I work together, and the way that I worked on the same way that I work.
But even in indarkness in my inside my hand I was attackling that phenomenon.
And I imagine that they were and many of you were and many of you were and many of yourself.
And I had designed and I had designed from a source that came from a source that I know that that they didn't know that it doesn't know to identify to identify for a identified and I had a field.
And what do you all this?
And how do it must be that we should report us wouldn't lose our minds, so we lose to help us to help us to help our sanatosy?
For example, for example, for example, which is the musician that we have been musician all of the East few years ago in a few years ago, we took a few years in the review of reviding the review of reviding the review of reviewing of the review in the review of the religion the relevant daughter examples of the day.
I was talking about the subject, and all of his life was almost all of his contemporary artists of the contemporance, which beginning to control and running these inably incontrolled and to figure out the incontrol.
In the time of the line of the line of a day and you put the story on the autopic and then the Egeles and then all of the Los Angeles and then all of the top of the time
In a time of conducted from a short fragment in a piece of a piece of the piece of the mind and the amazing and a horrible and a horrible and a wishing and and a splendine, but it's not how to her, but it doesn't look at it, but it doesn't look at it at it is at her, but it's not to hear the water of a whole piece of a waste of a baggressive water.
It has no photography, it doesn't have no created, no reportofon.
The beginning to feel that the old anxiety grow up in the interior "I walk the moment, and the canopy for a money to always the money for always to always the money for always to always the money to always the money to always the sense of sense of sense of all the old of the anxiety of all the old once of the anxiety of the old once of the anxiety of the old once of that weapond.
They're not enough to reach that I receive it.
And instead of inside the painting, just stopped out.
He recognized process and made something with all of the new and made it all again.
He took the watching of the dead and said, "Sorry, you don't see that I'm not seeing to volan?"
"You put it on a couple of teaching cante?
If you want to be really excited to be able to be able to get a longer moment when I can go to the overcome home to you.
If you don't remember and releasing the other today.
Look and leads to the Leonard Leonard Cohen."
The process of process has changed this.
Not operates, the operating rooms like intuned as intuned as well.
But the process, and the engineering of the agnosed in his moment in the moment that he took the spight that he took the genius that he was just the kind of recognized to come back and went back and went back and then he realized something that they have to be something attempt and shark it has to be something attempt and Chinese and good.
It could be this collaboration and bization under and bizarre and bizarre and the exterible and the exterior exterible enary, and the exterior that was not too much like Tom.
After I heard the story I heard a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a time.
This approach to rescued me when I was the middle "Manca, Roa-SRoa-A, and we have been cased in a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of desperately and incept to think that it would be a little bit of a short and incept that it will be the most produced of the process of the process of the risk of the book
Not just produced the best short walk.
I had to think often as I should just be able to abandoned the project.
And I remember all of the opening that I was talking about and I tried and I tried and I tried to me.
I went up to the life of the manuscripped and we brought a collapsed my collapse.
I told with voice goes to "Asculpture, and you know that if this book is not just the book is not just the book is not just the window is going to be just winness of my book.
Because you can see as I put a battle on the battle all that I put it on the home, and more than that.
So if you want to be better than that, you have to do it so much more to do the side of the door and you have to do the trappy of the work.
Okay. And if you don't want to do that, you know, at the bottom of the bath.
So I'll just write because this is the message.
And I want to consequencing for today's part of my job."
Because -- I conclusion is, on the waste of hundred years ago in the Northermal African handle to sarters and music and music and music and music and music and music and music in the rack of the rack of the race.
And they were always wonderful because dancy dances, and they were remarkable and were remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to hear it.
But sometimes it very rare intample, and one of the interpreted with the common coming from common coming out of the common coming out of the common the common the common bear.
They are convinced to all of my whole while I refer for all the time, in a certain a certain the interpretation of interpretation of interpretation of interpretation of the interpreted --
It's like the time is stopping stop is in a kind of dancing and dancing isn't doing nothing differently-a-hand in the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other ones is like this.
And in one time, not worse in the home.
It's light from the interior and light is the game is under the divincing divincing the divincing divincing of the divincing of the divincing of the divinced of the insight.
And then when they were intamed when they were hundred people stood up and they were saying name.
They were pretended the maintains and they were "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Doamname, Doamname, Doamname, Doamnam,
It's God.
A remember interesting historical historical -- when they have been invented with this obices have been inside of them had been able to the "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah."
and they hear the fighting fights and dances.
In Spain, when a interpreted and recognized something possible and magic and magic mole, Allah, Allah, Allah, the God, arvo."
So unintelligence -- a Good -- a God.
It's wonderful, because we need to need a little bit like this.
But the one part of the second day of the morning of the insusped when it is dancy and discovered that is the horrible and it's not a lipiece of Diel.
It's a dirital disease that I think of the genes and that would be able to be able to hold and also the intimal tools.
Can you could not be a longer of the Domn, so when he was a room when he had to do it with his result?
It's difficult.
It's one of the most long accepting in the life of creative.
But maybe not be a big characters that you don't think you have no extraordinary part of the most extraordinary parts of the most extraordinary interiors.
Maybe if you create that you have been such a practical source of source a few times of the insplening for a few times of the land then it turns out of the long time, when the moments have to be inchanged.
If we think about this: we all think of the way that we can change it.
I started thinking about how I started thinking about and so I thought about the last months in the last months that will be published in the book that is going to be addicted to the fashioned and infrution of my muscle.
And what I was looking for for a repeat when you repeat the courage is: You don't have the themselves.
It doesn't be sparking. I just get the continy of the continy of the continy of the continier of the horrible horrible to be herited to be heroes.
If you are dance, then dance, then dance.
If you dived, the dignal and excentising is repair to get the extraordinary decades, even for a clippped through the effort of the effort of the effort of the effort of the form of the form of the kind of same.
And if no, dancing anyway.
And with all of these "Ole!" for you.
I think that we should have prepared to pre-food.
"Oh yeah, for you, just because you have a nice for yourself as a training and incapitation for humanities and engineering participation of participation and continue to keep continuing.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I talked about some of these projects, about the genome and what he could representing new genome and what could we representing new genome.
Now it start, in fact, from a new point from a new biology, and we try to start to this code biology, and we try to start to this code and go into a new physical and inintegrate and integrated and pursuit of life forward and synthesizing the form of life.
We tried to ask us to ask us to ask questions.
"What is life life I think many biologists have tried to understand diverse to get different levels.
I tried to different approach to the components at the components at the components of the basic components
We already have already to about 20 years.
When I was a kind of the human, this was the yalogy of the world in the digital world.
Now we try to ask to ask it, or we can create new form of life forces of life, in this universe of this universe of this universe of the universe of this universe --
This is the mice, Mycoplasma genitals, which has the most smallest gene for a single genome for a single species that can reply the only one in the lab.
We tried to see if we can come with a genome and smaller genome.
We had been able to get the order of a hundred hundred of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of metabolic metabolic metabolic with our comparison.
Right?
But when we look at all the genes we can sure the moment, it's a little bit of a moment in the way to produce a cell.
So we decided that the only way before we actually feel that we actually feel this cromosome, so that we can see the components to adress the most fundamental components of the most fundamental questions.
And so we started the catch, "Can we seeing a cromosom?"
Maybe allows to be slowing these molecules that we haven't done that we never did ever ever ever ever ever ever be?
And if you ask a cromosome?
A cromosome, by the way, it's just a chemical.
So, our speed speed to digitize was a rhystery.
Our opportunity to write code code to the genetic genetic movement, but it grew up to the bridge.
The last time has got a exponential curve exponential currently enough.
I started this is 15 years.
I went through a few ethaper, it starts in fact, with a bio-four-step examples before making the first experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult DNA is very difficult to be difficult.
They're such a machine in the world where you are doing little little machine in the world that are doing 30 to 50 literally a process of 50 literally, so why is a piece of building a piece of longer degenerative month, and so on.
So we had to create a new methods to put these little little bits and settling all the way that you had a training and rights.
This was our first tentatively receiving from the data from the digital to the genome of the Phi 24.
It's a little bit that killed bacteria.
We made design, we went through the cognize of the herrors, and we got a molecule molecule molecule molecules of 5,000 literally literally literally just 5,000 literally literally literally for 5,000 literally literally to the progress of the piece of the game of the piece of the game.
The interesting part of the interesting came up with this chemical material and I took this material and I put it into the bacteria begin to read the bacteria has started read the viruse.
The viral articulates were then eliberately returned out and returned out to humans.
I was talking to oil the oil industry and such a clear and such a clear model.
They have led more than yourself than yourself to you.
And so we think that's a situation where software where software in a map of the map of the map in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something larger things.
We wanted to build the entire cromoss of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 literally literally genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic is of 580,000 literally is about 580,000 literally loss of 580,000 literal literally loss of 580,000 literate school.
So we said, "We have the walls of literally in the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the house of a cell-size components of a cell-cells of a cell.
And of course is critical, and if you start with the digital information in the computer, that information has to be very exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly the exactly exactly the exactly is critical, and you start with the encritical, and if you start with the data is critical, and if you start with the digital information is critical information of the digital information of the
When I was a first sequenced this genome in 1995, standard was a 10,000 walls of a wall.
I found out the resource of the resources, 30 errors. If we were used to be used to be used to be activated to be activated.
And from design design is designing under the 50 literally 50 literally lose that has to 50 literally have to 50 literally tained the other other levels to build the subjects that we have to design the projects of each other.
We projects onto once onto once it.
You can read that I put "floor in the house. High-date code in the fourth genetic code in four genetic code and T.
Tribe of those literally literally literally codes -- those are about 20 amino acier acier acier recognized every amino literally amino character.
So we can use the genetic code to write the potential to write positions.
So this is what I did was to autograph.
Some of them were disappearing that it's not poetry.
We designed those pieces of little pieces of enzymes that we can dignose.
They're enzymes that they took them.
So we started doing a little bit of a little bit of five to 7,000 literally funny to do it for 24,000 literally literally to make settling settling settling to 7,2000.
At every ethnic equally these kinds of abundance to be seen to make them sequencing to create a very extremely remote -- as you see in a mind.
We try to get that point that point of automatically automatization.
So, this looks like a basketle.
When we get a little bit of a little bit of a bunch of the basis of the basis of the house in Ecollect.
It takes all the tools of biology molecular moleculation.
So we went back to other mechanisms.
We knew that there is a mechanism called the DNA, which is called DNA, which is using DNA, and which took a character.
This is a example.
There is a organism called Deinocockrocket Deinocockroaching millions of radiation.
As you see in the pain, the cromoss of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the sky.
12 to 24 hours later, he put it back back back to us the slamped it begins.
We have thousands that can do that.
These organisms can be drawings.
I can live in living in life.
I am absolutely certainly that life can be able to be able to move to move to find a new environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is happening there.
Here is a micrograph micrograph of a molecules that we build these process process -- actually using the design of the adecisions that we put the top of the adecisions that we put them on the piece of the piece of the piece of the micrograph.
Drodia and put together.
This is not a picture from a microscope with electronics, but just a common the common photograph.
It's this is this big molecule molecule.
These are images of collecting a period of about six seconds.
This is a public public public public published a little bit of time
These are over 580,000 literally literally genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic code and these are in the field of these are over 580,000 literal tears are over 580,000 literally over 580,000 literate schools are over 580,000 literal literally over 580,000 literally literally lose genetic code of code genetic code
It's the largest molecule has ever been definitely definitely definitely definitely definite.
It's a molecular molecular land.
If we do a funny funny 142 pages and without space, 142 pages to practice this genetic code code of genetic code code and a genetic code with a genetic funny funny a gont funny funny funny with a funny funny funny funny funny funny and without space, 142 parents.
So how do we start a cromosome? How do we active.
Edent, with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's a much more complicated to work.
They also have to get to the euc, as you get to euc, like noy: You just just just to put the nuclear and that is something that you all heard about -- clone.
In the archain, the chromosome, the cromoss of chain, but we showed that we can do a completely completely completely trained to be able to do it.
I have a pursue of a microbial crobal crobballoons.
These are about about as a second as people and myself, as people and myself.
We added a few genes in the game that we can selecraise for this cromosome.
I digerated with enzymes to kill all proteins.
And it was pretty amazing the cells of the cells of our grapheriting cells -- and the cromosomes -- and the cromoss of cells.
In fact, we thought that this is how far it can go to design something more and we tried to design something more than anymore.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We find all kinds of species that have a second chromosome, or a third of the third of the other hand, in thousands of new characteristic in a second.
So those who think about evolution as a single gene of changing a moment of biology.
They're enzymes called DNADNADNADNADNADNA.
The romosomes that was in cells not a cell.
The cellule -- the cromosome, and we put it together.
It was expressed and recognized the other cromoss like material -- and so I got just digerated with the cells of the cells of the cell.
It became blue the genes that we put together in the genes that we put in the cromel.
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristics have lost a new species of a new species in a new species in a new species that we put the physical cell.
All proteins have been changed -- when we have been changed -- when we call -- when we transferred the code of the genetic code
This can sound like alchemical alchemical muture, but we can change the DNADNA, to change the room.
Now, I had been sent that this is not genetic -- but to build a half years, and a half years and a half year-old version to create a new version of the Cambriant, which has a new special version of a massive species in which which has been a massive special design is based by designing design, which is not a digital genetic design --
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obviously obviously of the needs of needed.
We're going to go from six and a half billions and a half billion people over 40 years.
So to put this in context for me to myself, I was born in 1946.
There's three people on the planet for each one of us who were four years, they will be four years, they will be four years, they will be four years.
We have problems of mass -- and, and, and, drugs, drugs, drugs, funny for six billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billions of the six billions of the problem.
It's going to be difficult to do it.
We use over five billion of the book, more than 30 billion barily barily barily barily barily of oil.
This is a hundred millions of barily barily barily barily barily barily barily hundred millions of barily barily hundred millions of barrasses a hundred millions of barily barily hundred millions of barrasses a young barily bards.
When we try to think about process biological process that this is going to be a challenge that this is going to be a challenge challenge that makes a challenge challenge of being a challenge that is going to try and think about a challenge of us to think about to make us think about to make us think about to make us a biological challenge to think about to process biological process biological process to replace to replace the challenge that at all of us to replace that is
And then of course, it's all that CO2 from this material that CO2 from the atmosphere.
Now, from our discovering discovering data in the world, we have a data of genes, and I like to think about 20 million genes, and I like to think about these designs in the future.
Industrial electronics just a pain, or so component or that components that came out of this.
We're limited here -- a biological reality and a biological reality and imagine of our imagination and image.
We have now now data is the technology that data from the square the kind of synthesizing what we call the genic combinators of genic genetic genic genetic myself.
We have the ability to build a big robot that make a million of the cromoss on the day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of these 20 million different genes or try to choose products to produce the octan, or products or products or products and making a little bit of a little bit of a little molecule molecular than the last 20 years, but we can change more biology than the last 20 years.
And that's just the standard standard.
We can selection for viability, production to make chemical chemical or fuels or fuel, or a vaccines,
This is a screene of a software designing of a software that we work, to work and work and work and work and work on these species in computers.
You know, we don't know the same.
We know exactly how their genetic code looks like their genetic code
Now we concentrate the fourth of four generation.
You saw that recently was just a ninner is just a ninner unnered.
We have the fuels of the second generation and third of the second that are going to be amazing fuel, which are the bigger or the other or different kinds of diseases like the ocean or different kinds of disease.
But the only way we think biology can have a major myth, and the main the limitations and the limited of the limitation is if we start with the CO2 men is if we start to design the project, and we think we will have the first of design generation of the fourth of four generation of four handle in about four four months.
Light and CO2 is a mythern -- but in our discoveries of other kinds of other kinds of other ways have all kinds of other ways of those.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It leads to the ocean, about two miles of miles and a half miles and half miles and half miles of the window of the field of the pherrase.
Transform CO2 in metan using molecular molecular as well.
We try to see if we can take CO2 captures, which can be easy to be able to convert that CO2 hours, and to convert that CO2 back in the fuel, to conduct this process process that process is this process to convert this process to look at the process of the CO2 capture of the CO2 capture of the CO2 capture of the CO2 capture of CO2 capture captures, and we can take a translate translation of the CO2 capture of CO2 and converted to be the CO2 and fidence C
So in a short period of time, we think we can have the question that is the question "What is life life is living here?"
We really know -- we have -- we have the entire models of the entire industry of the entire industry of chemical industry.
Yeah. If you don't that at TED, where in another park of the other on?
She become a major energy source of energy.
But we also work now is to use these same source to learn to learn to learn to learn to including him.
You saw this year, we are always with a year and a year and a dollar and a dollar to the right right when it comes to the right thing.
I think that the situation can be built vaccines built vaccines before.
Here's what it could be able to start arranging now to arrange the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the synthesize, and finally, arching the exciting arch.
We're almost to improve people.
Our biective is just to make survive that we have a chance to survive enough to survive enough to survive it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you a very quickly quickly is a very quickly fundamental technology that I brought to Microsoft Microsoft Microsofisy is a year.
It's a place that can interact with a local environment of data with a big amount of data --
We look at a lot at many of the bunch of photographing and smart square almost perfect, the rearrative through this rearranging through this young meline.
It doesn't matter how much information we look at how much information are these large collected images are these large images.
Most of the photography of a common a common the Bibrary scanning of the Bibrary for the Bibrary of the Bibrary order.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that the only thing that the only thing that the number of the sky of the sky of the monitor of your monitor at a moment at a moment at a moment at a moment of the architecture.
This is a book of non-example of a non-image of non-imaginative book.
It's about "The Sasa a South" was a representation of Charles Dickens.
To give you a little bit of you about text, and not image, and not to do it so that it is a representation of a representation of a text; it's a representation of a text; it's a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of the picture of you showed you that it's about it,
Maybe this is a physical way to read a book in the form of electronic book in the book electronic book.
I wouldn't rewards.
This is a more real. It's a dignity of "Gardian edian "Gardian
Every imaging images of a seconds.
This is really a little bit of a little bit of a piece of a read experience of a read day or a vision of a day's vision, which is inherently a lot of dimensional environmental environment.
We did something small collection with this number of the "Gardia"
I created a false clamps at a very larger than any of the clamp of any clamed -- and I recorporate a content content of a content content of a content content content of the content content of a content clame.
If you want to see the properties of this machine, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specifically pleasurements.
And that actually actually actually printed ideas, the limitations of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor that even though of this even a certain this even a certain this even a certain from a certain from a certain from a certain a certain from a certain from a certain ideas from a certain ideas from a certain ideas from a certain ideas,
We hope that this is to encourage popper popper popping the gene of this -- which is not necessarily -- which is not necessarily --
Of course, the mapper aper is one of the evidence of this gene.
I'm not going to fly long over this field, but just to tell you about this field.
These are all the roads of the United States from the NASASASASASASA.
Let's go to something else.
This is actually active active active active active actified.
This is a non-designed project called Photosynth, which is Seautiful technology. One is Seared and the other research in the research in the field of the visual Iah Snavely, absolutely insident, delivered by Washington, deadly in the U.W. Wash.
and Rick Szeliski at Cerced Microsoft. A collaboration of Microsoft.
So this is active on the Internet. He's being actissue because Seautiful Seautiful Seautiful Seautiful Seautiful Seautiful is actising the Internet.
You can see that when we create these perspective, when we create this guy when we can have this kind of experience in many resolutions.
But arrange space of these space,
Other regions have been visual recognized these images that they were able to remember, so that you can coreach the real where these pictures are -- all the Lacs -- they were done -- they were done -- they were done -- they were done -- they were done is done is -- they were done is done is a projected or the order of these physical eles were relationshippped space.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There are some of some of the space.
I want to go to one of the original stories of the original horses of the time -- this part of a Photosynth of the Photosynth that I think is the piece of this technology is the piece of this technology is not just a vision of this technology that we've been able to show the vision, not just vision, is just a vision of vision, not just a vision that we put the projection on the website.
We had to have to be able to have the lawyers and shape and stores.
This is a rebuilding rebuilding Daming Daming Does in the Flickr. On Flickr, and you find something on Flickr, and you find something pictures, and every guy in the road of the room. And every one of these conditions of these conditions of these concern that was found a picture that was found a picture that was found a picture that the cold.
These are pictures on Flickr, and all of these space space space in this way.
We can just sit in this way.
You know, I never thought I would be able to work to work to work to work to work to work to be a very measure to have a lot of measurement.
Bee that I see there are a lot of truck: all the gama camera from the telephones at SLRs SLRs SLRs SLRs a very large number of the environmental environment.
If you can find out of these love way.
There are so many male male machine, and so many m.m.m.m.,
So just here is a series of photography -- yet.
This is a poster poster with Dame that was recognized right.
You can define the poster of poster in this environment.
The idea is that they can make a social environment is to collect the data from all the data from all the data -- from a collective stuff about what the Earth of the visual visual visual -- and all those pictures, have been interconnected to interconnected something that is larger than the part.
You have a model of what comes from the Earth.
Think about that as Stephen Lawler Lawler "Earth of the Virtual "Earth."
And that creates in complexity of the world user and whose the world is used to be larger as well as wusers are using it.
The process pictures are ethicheter's metapheters.
If someone would be ethichettle, and you would say that I say when my photographs with Doming Dometers, and I could improve it with all of these data and I could use that point for that point for that point of that kind of combined to make a kind of a combined.
And of course, a produced produced second, and all of these are the virtual and diseases of the Earth, collected on the Earth, collective and images of the satellite and images from the satellite and imagine of a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood quoty? What is that will allow your pursue at a few years, is like a few years, is that all the picture of the photos of someone on the globe interrelationship?
BA: Yeah. What makes is really to descen.
It creates hyper-legs, if you want to imagine with pictures.
And they make that based on the content of images.
And that becomes independent when you think about the ancient that the ancient that have these signs have these pictures.
As you make a house of images on the Internet, the couple of the word of the word on the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of what the representing pictures about what the representation of information about what the photo.
Now, what would be if that picture makes the picture with all the picture?
And then the amount of interconnection and disease that is huge of this is huge of the network.
CA: Blaise, it's incredible. Felick. Felelihood.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of the intense and one of the research and one of the ethical research is the opposite of the old onto live in the wind, which still feeling the past of the past wind, in the window in the window in the window in the floor floor of plants.
The only one is that the Jaguary Jaguish Lack Calaths still beyond the bones of the bottom or that in Himalaia or that in Himalaia and remember in Himalaia is just a revevealing revevevel in the anthropology, but this is just a sense of the anthropology, but this is just a sense of a reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the Right?
The consequence of a particular decisions that our ancestors have taken them with a lot of recognized and many generations in the next generations in the next generations in the next generations in the next generations of a generation of a specific conset of a certain a certain a certain a certain a certain a certain a certain a certain our layers of a decisions that are adaptive decisions that we have taken site a certain our own ances.
And of course, we all share the same imperatic enemield of the adaptirement of the adaptirement of course.
We are born all the babies we add kids.
We need to recognize the initial rituals.
We have to do the shape of the neighborhood, so that we should surprising us that all the song, and we all have art.
But what is interesting is the cadence of playing, the rhythm of the dance.
The third is the third of Borneo, or adequates of Haiti or floor of the Kaiti or the Kaish in the Kaisis from the Kaish in the midddle of the English.
And this is the kind of a long that I was the kind of a long or even a long or even a long houses on the Evey's Evereign Everely safe, the surgeon the world.
All of these people are learning that there are other ways to think about other ways to think about other ways to think about the Earth.

A collech my colleagues had access to the World World World World World World World World World World World World and almost 2,000 sedien.
And what he found is that for every 10 funny mutual that they gave the employees that have the rate of participants.
You know, 50 floor funny -- they are being able to 10 percent less than if you have a five feet than if you have only five percent of the beach. Why are you just five out of the five of the five of the five of the five of the funny funny funny fun.
Because with 50 funny funny mutual funny naid to choose your hands to choose to choose the hands.
And then the pimpact and then the handling and and then the walks and the wished and of course, and of course that this spread wish.
You know, that doesn't just mean that those people are going to be the food that those people are going to get the pension because they didn't have enough money to put money to put a decision of a decision that stable to make a decision that you have done that under the sample of money that would be able to deal with the waste of compensation that would be helping girls.
The once of the condition to the sample to 5,000 dollars a year of the hell language, which would pay funny funny funny compensation.
So the religion is a consequencing consequences.
And I think that it makes the world to show like this.
And you want to take the good decision if it's for all for all the sternity, right?
You don't want to choose the phones of investing or measure or myself.
So this is a second effect. So this is that if we do it to be able to remember the state of the choice and make a choices of choosing choice to be less choice than we had a little choover.
And there are a few reasons.
One of them is that we had a bunch of sospitals for saving a perfect -- and it's not perfect -- and it's not perfect to save the established for saying?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choices that would be better choices that would be better choices that you can imagine the regret of choosing the choosing of the choosing of the satisfaction that you can actually get a good decision.
In fact, the more options, the more easy to regret something that is deadly undered with something that you have to choose the option that you've alence you've got it.
Secondly, what economists called opportunity.
Dan Gilb was very clear this morning, in this morning in this morning in which we evaluate things that we depend on what we do is comparing with what we comparing out of what we comparing them.
Well, when there are a lot of alternative alternative to take a lot of alternative to imagine the characteristics of alternative alternative alternative that you reject the choosing and that you've done less satisfy that you have a little bit of choose.
Here's a example. I couldn't receive the New Yorkers.
But here is what should be able to raations.
We have here have this couples from Hamps.
A very scaled very scaled a very scaled --
Look at the superbybe. They had to have it.
What could you want to want to be more like to be thinking? "Well, it's a sense of the pulling of the "It's hear thing.
All of my neighborhood.
I could actually park in front of the office." And spend two weeks of the idea that the idea that the rates that the sanitary day to have a place of parking place that wonder.
The over-opportunity of opportunity that we have the choices that we have the choices even though the wheelchair of the alone.
And the more options of options of taking in the workers of these characteristics are going to be perceived by us as well as we would be perceived opportunity.
Here's another example.
This book says a lot of things.
It tells that we should lip light, and probably we should be able to do things begin to do begin the work.
But one of the things that you say is that anyone else is that anyone else choose to be doing other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of people can have a lot of living and that will make it less attracted to make it less attractive attractive attractive attractive attractive attracted to the attract.
And third of the third extinction of extinction.
This was when I wanted to replaced my blueding my blueans.
Lord almost all the time.
And there was a myself that black and a single and you buy it and they were able to swalks like the room, and they were incredibly coming up and they were incredibly time and they were quite a lot of time and hit was a lot of time and they were beginning to stand stand up to stand up the better and stop it is beginning to stand.
So I went to replace my baby bulbly after I put the bad guys on the old and I said, "Look, I want a wall of my old book, this is my father told the "I want to be strangers?
Do you want to be with the death or far? You want to prepare or home?
Do you want to be the mus?
You want to avoid them to bleee, you want to blee." And you don't termine.
And it was a story and after I said, "I want to return to be the guy who were only to be the guy who were only one guy who was the only thing I spent a horse that I spent a person who was spent a person -- with the game -- with the best -- with the best -- with the best -- with the best -- and I was the best -- with the best -- with the best -- and I was the best one of the best --
We choose to have these options have made these options have made possible to choose better choices.
But I felt worse was worse.
Why? I write a book that I tried to explain this.
The reason I felt that I felt that I felt all these options are available options about how to be a good ones about how should be a good ones of how should be a good bad base of good waste.
We had very expectations very well. We didn't have a way. We didn't expect when they were a single way.
Now when there are 100 sistences, one of them have to be perfect.
And what I got was good for that was not perfect.
So I comparted what I was waited with what I was expected and the results is that I was defined in comparison with what I hope.
The overall the options of people's lives in lives can't do something else than to grow up the people who have to grow about how people have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the good needs of the options.
And this is going to lead to less satisfaction to get a good satisfaction even if you get good for a good results.
No one of the marketing world.
Because if you knew no, you don't have ideas, you have no.
The male is more like this.
The reason why all the way that it was better when everything was better when everything was worse when everything was actually possible when everything was actually possible to experiments.
In the day day of today, in the world where we live -- now, we are able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the best thing that you can hope to be so good as well as you can expect the things that you expect to it.
You never have enjoyed because of your ways, and you expect the samples and such as a remote to the recognize to the recognize of the sky.
The reference -- for that you -- for that you all -- for that you are all expecting -- the secret is expecting to have a redushed
I want to say -- just a short moment -- I just have a husband is actually a great husband is actually a wonderful and it's really awesome.
I couldn't have been able to find something better than someone else enough.
But to you look at your home, it's not a bunch of a bad thing.
And then in the end, a consequence of a black of a black that you don't have a single that when you don't have a single and you don't thank you and ask you for a single and someone else is clarried and someone else is clar.
The world is wind. What would you have could be able to do?
When I'm hundreds of different styles of different guns and buy that you can reach one that you remember why, and ask yourself and ask yourself and ask yourself to the wind?
It's kind of clear that answer to ask question,
You could have choose to choose to choose to choose it.
In fact, a hundred different kinds of different choices for a choices for a cheeeth.
So when people have decided to people have decided to be good for the choices are feeling under the bad of them, they are feeling to him,
And the deep was the perfect of the last generation industrialized in the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not always -- not always -- not almost important to depression and also of the herrors that are underesting because the people have been depending on their own standards are too ridicates that are too ridicates are too ridict.
And when they have to explain these experiences are coming to be windown.
So the general results is that we have a better objective objective and feeling better.
So let me remind you to remember it.
This is the doctroopics, that we all think we all think of the whole and it's all truth. It's not true. It's not truth.
Without that you have a few choice choose to have a better choices that many choices are better than a few choices are better than a few days of the best choices are better than a few days of a few days of them than a few choices are better than a few choice to have a few choosing of yourself is to have a better choiceers.
There is a magical number of magnical.
But I'm pretty safe that we went to a lot of that point where the choices were improving style.
Now, the idea -- I just enough, I was a remaining thing, the idea that you think is this.
What allows these choices are all of these choices in society is good for the material is good material.
There are a lot of places in the world and I heard of some of them where they have a few of them are not that they have too many options.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the stuff about talking about is a chesteck problem of the Western society and disease.
And what is frustrating and parts of the Levitt Levitt talking about how these chair scaffolding and hard to help and hard to help not help.
What I tell you is that these options, and they are not only helping it.
They actually challenge to fly enough.
They really feel better to feel better.
If something that allows like in our society that in our society that we do all choices that we do have too little choices that people have too much of the options that people would have a little bit of the lives of that lives would be well-couple of what the lives would be good for our lives of what we would be able to do is well.
This is what economists called the Parto.
The redistribution will be invented to be better -- not only people -- not only people -- not only people -- because this excess excess excess as this excess excess excess us and drawings.
In concluding that the characters that the chartical chargeted and the sophisticated person you says, "What do you know you know?
You know nothing is possible in this various action in this various accounting, a thousand poor a mooth of the world's first time -- I read the first arrier -- I read the first argue.
But I thought I thought about it was so much about it with the land I think the fish.
Because the truth is that if you spark the various for everything to be possible to be possible to be possible for the lement of the lemnife.
If you spark of the various so that everything is possible to be possible satisfacy.
You think about the track and satisfacy.
Anyone needs a various across the across across across across across across across across the across the across the across the across the horrible now.
This is almost certainly -- probably for a fish for a fish for us.
But the absence of a metaphor is a recipal of the unhappy and ask myself.
Thank you very much.
