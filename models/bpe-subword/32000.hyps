The year I showed these two diaposed to demonstrate the winning of the polar of the polar that the big polar of the last three million years of the last three million years of the big states of 48 percent of the large of the large of 40 percent of the large of 40 percent of the big state of 40 percent of the big state of the slightly led of the slightly to the second of the s
But this morning, this is the special of this particular issue because it doesn't look like the gross of the gross of the gross of the gross of the gross of the well.
The polar is is in a way of the bottom that the climate system.
She was expected and contraction and contraction.
The next whole of the diaposition that I will look at what it would be a quickly severely on what happened in the last 25 years.
The chemances of the magic is the big steps with the rocke.
So as you see expanding of the white blue inch.
This is the ancestors on the ancestors of the nice of the nice of the nice of the network.
And they willing to the windows.
His is the permanmanent of the windows, a old old old of five years or more than the sanging of the sanging of the sanging of the body.
In 25 years of that, at the time, at this time.
This is a problem because the challenge of the disgusting of the article of the article around the article around the article of the article of the article of the article of the article of the article this is a ticket of the article of the challenge of the problem.

The cells of the World World World Within the global atmosphere if you could go to the extremely the extremely extremely extremely extremely affect.
As a certain in a certain in the Alaska metant, the metage of diseases the water of the water water to the water.
The Katter Katter Walter University in Alaska was on the other team was on the other left land a different law of the past.
Yeah. Oh! She is OK, the question is OK, the question is if we are going to be broken.
And a reason is that I enormous reasonable of the incalzero-inquest inquared in north.
This is a range.
But the volumes are much larger than the rest of it.
This is the Kanglusion in the Groenlusion of Groenland.
If you want to know how the large levels of how the large of the large of the broken is the place where the best state where the big stream.
These debate very quickly on the broke.
And the other capital plant, Antarctica mass-wicher.
The paste people have the past people have reported as the continent of the continent of the continent is negative, the West the Antarctics on the Etarcticle on the varcticle on the waste of the sully.
This is the choice seven the seven the edge of the marriage, as in Groenlanda.
In Himalaya, the third of the third of the shadows, the varef seeing of the new form of years of years of years were killing with a few years of years of years of the year.

In Anzy, this guy is the water of the water of the water of this city to this city for this city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of Anzy, and Anzy, and in Anzy, this yzero Anzy, this guy, this guy, this guy, this guy is Anzy, this guy is the water is the
The bits, they great.
But when it was willing to go and water and water and water with water.
In California was a 40 percent of the four in the street in Sierra Sierra.
This affected the reserve of water.
And the predictions of how you read the read of read --
On the global world has led to a range of the incentiss.
And the disaster on the global global world have grown up with a rate rate rate and the farmer rate and the farms.
Four times more than four years of the 75 years of the 75 years.
This is a shadow model.
If you look at the context of the context of what happens to see is what happens to see it.
In the last five years ago, I added 70 million tons of dioxides of dioxide every 25 million tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of the oceans.
The next thing to the attention to the Pacific, the Pacific, and the West in the American substanti-suburban of the individual remains of oxygen in oxygen in oceans.
The largest causes the global inquares of global despairs of the despads of the fossil fuels.
The trolling is a problem and the best problem is the most serious cost of the best thing.
The United States is one of the mathematics of China.
And the proposal was building was building more fabricates for the carbs.
But we start to see a changing change.
Here's the ones who have angry the past of the propitch.
All the politics of the politics in our country.
And the industry and the oil of oil spent a smart of the dollars in the last year, the last year of dollars in the last year of the last year of dollars in the last year of the last year of the last year of the clock.
promote case what a cool of what a oximoron.
This picture of the picture of something.
In the preport Cracium in Tennessed, a billion galom of galom of the galogy.
You probably see the stird of the stird of the stird of the stirl.
This is all the way the case of your couple of the second deversary of the Stampled in Cracium Cracier.
One of the craft of the carbon the Cracium of Cracio of Cracio was this.
Video: All the beautiful cost of the cost of the bridge.
He is in the abundance of the economic growth of the economic growth of the economic growth of the economic growth of the economic growth of the economic stream.
Frost, the case with carbon that I will go on and rather than the brost.
He is access to the workers and the workers and the workers of the jobs.
Al Gore: This is the surprising of the Goreat Vest.
The largest on the largest cost of Masssm is the sex of Masssly.
Video: Don Blankenship: I want to be clarded the Pelos, Nano Pelosos, Harry Reid Reid Reid Reid Reid C.
Al Gore: So as Alianta Climate for the Climate the second campaign the second campaign for the second campaigns.
This is one of them is one of them is one of them.

That's why we call the principal is to spend a big sure of money for the equity of the public speed to show us and the truth.
The thing is that the beautiful is not dirty dirty is not dirty dirty and the murdark.
We think it's running -- and the middle and the middle of it.
So it will not ingrift to the climate change the climate change the climate change the climate change the arguments.
Lask that we can figure out our bones.
Video: The Cargovernment, you heard a currently deployed on it.
So let's make a team of this city of this chair of the craft of the carbon the carbs.
Ob! Masinaria is a case of the gomots.
But that's the sound of the technology of the cost of the cost of the currently cleaner.
And as the book is one of the principal is one of the global remarkable of the global remarkable of the crazy of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the whole thing you see here.
The unique is going to attention, this is the technology of the carbon today.
Al Gore: In the sentence of positive positive to the economic challenge of the security of the security of the security of the security of the security of the Al Goreat Al Goree.
Video: Narrator: Narratory, the economy, the security of climate climate climate climate climate climate of Vide.
The intack that we leave all the way to now, dependent on the bottom of carbon the bottom of diseases died and oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil stain.
But now we have a new solution to the indrazy to ies' incurately to the incurately incurcing.
The energy energy in America, 100 percent curately the electricity of the current before the bridge.
A plan to the third of the America, and then it makes us safe and the global stopping the global story.
At swimming solutions, which is a big solution to help us solve the problems.
The energy energy energy require more than America.
Al Gore: This is the last year.
Video: Narrator: It's about the re-energy.
One of the longest way of inline to inline the future of the old fuel fuel of the old planet that our planet is the Siitor is here the Siitor is here the new energy is here the new energy remarkable energy.
Barbed nr.2: We invested the jobs to create job.
Narrator: The American energy for the America. It's time for active.
Al Gore: There is a per of the african who says, "If you want to go fast, you go quickly.
If you want to get the far to get inside the well-walking inside.
We need to get fast, fast.
Thank you very much.
The year at TED I made a introduced to LHC.
And I promised to come and give you a data data on how it works on how it works like this.
So here's the amazing was not here, and the most who was the largest experiment that was the most experiment that was the most awish of the Stremeter-and-of the Stremer is to 27 kilometers of the second line of a billion times a billion times a billion times a billion times a billion times a billion times of the second of the second second.
It's extremely ambitious.
This is the art of the Geneva.
We are photos "Big Bangs" in the decades in the decades.
I work on this. It's called the ATwo is the detector of AT, -- Like the four training, diameter of the Metraculy of the AT's detectors here detectors here to the AT's proport.
On the ptember of the patient for the first time the first time for the first time.
And this picture was doing the ATS.
It causes a huge of control.
It's a picture of the first fascycle of the physical phases that the system of the system of the system of LHC, the LHC deliberath of LHC deliberating.
In other words, when I was seven that I was seping that images I sat at the water that the water work, which is a huge successful successful for the huge of a huge success.
I don't know that if that was the largest ovessels, or that, when someone went on the page of the page of the page of the page of the page of the land the first shot.
It means I did a cultural impact of the cultural impact of the stiinside.
After about a sex seapart, I had a problem with the apart, which has had been doing these field -- these fields -- these fields -- these field.
They're the slightly 13 thousands of middle of the maximum of maximum to the power of maximum and the power of the power of the maximum of the food.
Now, the engineering engineering and says, "I can't transsport the attacks. I'm being mit."
But I can do that when I'm going to do that when I'm temperatures become the superconductor.
So as a 271 degree of the space, and the space, those are the space, those are the couple of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the crops of the case of the case of the waste of 271 degrees of 271 despering to 271 degree of the stories of the stories.
At one of the country between the 10,000 magnets in LHC, was a defect of fabricatic fabricatic fabricatic future from the fabricative.
So the common the common the common and the 13 thousands of both of the electricity.
This was the result.
This is more precious to think about the magnets of the magnets of the clothing about 30 down.
So I deterioritous about 50 magnetighly 50 magnetigh.
We had to get affair, what we have to do and do it and down.
I reconcerned about all of the top of all the way I repair it up.
And now we go to the magnetish the subteran.
The big sfarmer on the LHC will be like a new water of the LHC will be like a whole couple of silence.
We're going to go back and waiting for us to get to the if, and we will go to the research for the research to find the research to the universe to the universe.
Now, of course, like a way to a way of recognize accidents about the importance of the importance of the importance of the extremely engineering to the extremely rejured to reject.
I think that the database is so difficult to the fact that we have to have the fact that we have some of the experiments of the experiments like LHC.
I'm going to lask that inches the word of a British Davy, Humphrey Davy, which, when the water experiments of the protect of the protect of the protect of the protect of the protect for the progress of our deliver, and we are the southern of our stands, like our features are not going to be able to presence our lives are finished to our lives, like the light of the words of the words of the words are light to be the light to be the lives, and our listening word as well-termistinister and the world.
Thank you.
I wanted to start with the range to remember the range of childhood that you play with the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bots.
As the masss invented to the water and water and water and they get the water colo, and you actually get invented how to figure out how to figure out how to resolve the challenge of space, and the relatively spatial relationships with spaces spaces of space.
The space is the space is the profound of how we intellect, we can see a lot of the world of the inconnection.
So I think about a research of IT inspired by this usual inspiration of our interactions with the consultant consultant consultant -- and my collaborator of Jeevan Kanan Kanan Kana -- I was a computer, and when we use a computer, instead of this mouth that perhaps a computer, and as information as a digital depending on a digital digital and the immediately chair,
So what we want to do we want to us.
The question was so fascinating the fascinating as I decided to try to research the answer to the Siftable.
As a Sift Sift is a computer, a computer.
They can be manufacturing the recivil can perceive the recipal of the food of the food of a radio radio radio radio radio ran of the relationships.
The most important is that I am palpable to choose the bottom of the game, you can see it as a water.
And Siftables a new equipment of a new equipment of the digital manipulation of digital manipulation.
As the masss are becoming more psyches more constants of the foreign constants of the other active active active active requires of the action of our active and destruction of the interactive and destruction to explorate new interactive and disease.
I'm going to start with some examples of excells.
This Sift is configure out to predict the video of video video of video in a direction, and the water of the water roll in the other parts of the parts of the parts of the part, the rolling in the other parts of the ath.
These interactive interactive is a constantly constantly one of the other.
So, if you put them on the other ways, it becomes interested in the way.
If they're inconnected to be able to do it, and it becomes to confusion.
And I can also feel and inclinical missilence.
We figured out that one of the involves of the interaction is that we can use the gestures of the insight of the winning of how we would have a culture of how we could be a license a license.
In this case, we have three Siftables that we have configuring them as a well-pain, where they can use them to remember the center in the center of the center where they will remember the center of the center of the center of this case in the center of this case in this case of this, we have the Siftable, we have Siftables of
If I was too much, we can get the slide and the cleaning to the air inside the air to the air up.
There are also interesting to education, as a language, as the measures and the measures and logical logical logical humans to see the results of the results of the results of the results to see the results.
So here I -- this is a Fibonacial to a simple program with a simple program with a simple program of equatic equative.
Here's a game of the word of the word of the words, like the Scrabble Scrabble and Boggle.
Only every one of the first one of the first table, and the intimately on the measure of the measure of form that I try to form the word with a dictionary.
And then you know, by 30 seconds of the types of the types of the task and a new types and new possibility.
Thank you.
These are the nistake in the Media Lab at the Media, and I was trying to move them to the movie and movie and movie.
It loved to neighborhood.
And one of the interesting of this kind of applying of this kind of applying is that you don't need to give people a lot of instruction.
All right, "For word is "For word and they know what to do.
Here's some other people are doing a few people intrip.
This is the most tank, our tester in our right, play in the right.
It turns out that everything that he wanted to do was to put the Siftable.
So to he's only been home.
This is a involved, interacting with the animature.
We wanted to build a top of the language.
And this is Felix.
He can introduced new character, just the Siftables of the Siftables that affold.
Here's the sounds like the sound.
Video: The race.
David Merrill: Now he introduced a traction,
Video: Trace.
Go! Yeah! Yeah!
Miss Siftable, and the laws and the laws of the allow of the characters of the characters -- Video: Ham!
DM: I think the narrative.
Video: Okay!
DM: It's a final story, and he decided to open how it will open the way to draw the brother.
Video: Zara, the sick.
DM: The next example I showed you today is a today to create the music is a beautiful music that I built the music that I built the Siftables that Siftables that I had the role and all the role and all the role and bas well.
Each of these four different variations, you have the choices that you want to use it to use it to use it.
And you can inject the sound of sound that you can assemble the market what guys you can assemble.
You put the sound sound sound the sound of sound sound of a Siftable Sift-Sift-broks.
There are equally equally that you can control the live and the filters and the filter.
You know, you have a certain sound and then I can inclinical inclinical to the a-help.
It's going to be the general effects like the tempt and volume the water that the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the general equally the general equals like the general effects like the general effects like the general effects like the tempt of general food like the tempt of general form like the tem
Video: M: M: Maybe we are the second Siftables of the Siftables of a series, we argue, a lot of branch, a lot of branch.
Now a basic line.
Video: Don: My read the perceived percup.
Video: M: Ma: Make to control the movie to control the trading the track of the lives.
Video: Ma: Maybe the second inclining inclining in a paradia or part of a part or something.
Video: Ma: Make the movie for more expression.
Video: Maybe I can do the second quantly re-second while the quantity.
So I don't have to do the planet, I can improve to preallow or long-term or long-term long elodia in the wall.
Now, in the swimming to estompet the second Sift of Siftable-volume, inclined by the volume, inclined in the stangle of volund, inclined in the stangle of the waste of the waste of swapped in swalking the samping, I can go to the share, I can find the wincluding the top of the sentence of
Thank you.
As I see my passion is the creation of new interface, the Internet that is actually a better way that it works better with the way that our brain that works and the body of our brain.
And today, I had to show you a new space, and a few of this new space, and some of the design that we try and put them out of the possibilities that I wanted to get out of the laboratory.
The cost that I wanted to retina retina grandmother, we are in the new generates of the instrument of the instrument of digital require the world of our land our information in our world of our land our information in our world of our land our information in our world of our landscapes.
Thank you very much.
Astep, the site of the nerable.
I'm writing.
It write the book is my teacher and it is, of course, more than so well than it was so much of the attention.
It's all my mom love and fascinates and fascinating.
And I don't the astep, it is to change it.
But these field said, something like a little bit like a quite in my life, and in my book, which was my life, which was my grandmother and I dealing with the land the allim of the relationship.
And the thing that I wrote is like I wrote this book, and the Rographics "Manca, Roay-Iubeth of the book, which is the awful types of my book, and it became this important mega-in-sensor that important, and became this important mega-in-seller international mega-seller international button of the beller of the bottom of the beller of the bottom of the botttttttttttttom.
The reef, the require that the people who are going to be condamnature.
Serious -- connect -- damnaturedamnatured.
Are example of the ingrift and I say, "Do you don't have the team, is the team, you may not be deposed to be able to detail?
Do you don't have the teaching you will keep writing your life, your life on the far of the book that you ever set up a book that ever seen the world of that ever beat?"
It's very linears like this.
But it was more running if I was not the way I was going to remember like 20 years, when I was starting to be a great time -- as I was a great time -- as I was a writing, I want to be reacted by the same reaction of the same basis on a kind of reaction of reaction on a kind of reaction of reactive reaction of the kind of reactive reaction of the kind of reacts to reaction if I was a kind of reaction of reaction of the same time.
And people said, "Not that people would never have to be able to have no success?"
Do you don't track the World Well will kill you knew ide?
Do you don't have the fear of the life of your life, and nothing that you don't have any opportunity to dead, and nothing that will never take a chargument a church of the case of the center of the center of the center of the midle of the middle of the center of the center of the midd?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the answer to all those inininsulls is "Yes."
Yeah, you know, it's the team.
And it always stopped me to hold me of it.
And I am is the teama lot of things that people can be able to be able to intuitive.
As a big example of the big things that are infruit are infruit infrared.
But when I talk about written about writing the thing I thought, and I also thinking about why?"
Is it something rational rational?
It's lots of the wind to the top to be the floor to work on the mountains that they felt like the Pamant.
And what is so specific initiatively what the creative seems like the non-term as a very non-teaching teaching in a way that other teachers don't do it?
My Tatal for example, it was engineering and I don't remember the 40 years of the engineering of the engineering engineering someone is not a question of engineering if someone is not a chemist.
It wasn't intamed -- John, how do it go with the chemicals in the chemice?
It's just not just the way it doesn't get something.
But to be honeybed; the engineers didn't slide for the century of the century of the century of the reputation of the reputational maniaco-depressive.
We write a reputting this reputation, and we don't have this reputation, but the artists of all the way of all the way of waste as they have this reputation of the labels.
And everything we have to look at the number of region the number of registration of the registric in the center, in the 20th century, which have died by the teacher of the teacher and open, which have died by the crop.
And even the same same same same thing, who didn't have hear the step to be really struggle of the task of the talent of the talent of the talent of the talent of the talent of the talent of the talent of the talent of the talent of the teaching of the state that they didn't have the same same same thing. And the same same same same same same thing.
Norman Mail, even before the last disease, she said that "Each of the books had a little bit of my books a little bit more than the book."
A great masss about a life of the mountain a life.
But we don't machieve when we hear someone day-saying that I heard of things so I heard of things so I heard of things and I have absorsorbed and suffered as a collective idea and suffering as a collective and as argue, and it will lead a charmer and a long enough.
And the question I want to address today I want to address all of the point of all of this idea: Are you with this ide?
You are comfortable with it -- because it is the light of how it is the light of the light of the light of this per slides with this ipic.
I think it's odiodid.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't want to see it danger to see the future of the future of the future.
I think it's better if you get the artists of artists to live the artist.
And I know the sure of the case of my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to me to me to me to me to me to me to come up with the city of this hypothesis now the presence of this teaching teaching teaching in which I know the teaching teaching teaching in which I am am now a teaching teaching at the end.
As a tant, I'm pretty much in the tant, I just just 40 years.
I have probably like four decades before the mountains.
And it's very probably like, to be able to write and with this moment to be judged by the way, the mountain the money to the last money to my own story of my past long the last money to my past the last couple of my pit?
What would be saying to say the mallies, because everybody here are already -- it's very likely to be like the largest success of my land of my most successful to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be able to say the largest of the men.
Oh, I amn, what yeah, what yeah.
This is the kind of a guy who could make somebody to get the nice to the ninequire the ninequire that person.
I go on to the continuation that I keep this message.
And then the question becomes the question is it?
And so I put it on the mother, like the manible that manible to work now, to work now, to write a kind of building a kind of building a kind of building a kind of building a kind of closer to protective, right?
I have to get a sense, to think about a way to get a way to the pastrally distantly distance to me, the ones that I write nature, the natural law of what it will be now before I writing to what it written by what it written by what it is.
And as I was all the last year of this sense, I started to this sense, I started to get the time to see the other society to see if the societies of the society to see if the idea of how to be able to see how much more sanatotic ideas, and the challenge of how to be helping people creatively to think about how the emotional check to the art.
This is what this is what it was the Greece and Roma Roma ancient of the ancient Roma
So the big cycle of the city of the city of the city of the case of the city of the cycle cachieved.
But the Great the Great Rom, and Rom, and Rom, the Rom, the World Well before the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the hunger Great the Great the Great Great Great the Great Great Roma Great the Great Rom.
People believe that creativity was a spirit of the pocket that the pocket and unfortunately, and needs and needed to understand the intelligent reasons and needed to understand the neighborhood.
The crops called these creativity, the creativity, the term of the term of the term of the term of the term of the term of the term of the term of the Real."
It was the father's father's father's a demon which is transmitted the site of the site of the site of the departs.
The range of the same samples have the same set of the creatively and the mosphere and the genius.
What is wondering, because the romans was not a genius didn't think that a genius was a genius was a charge individual cleaning individual cost of the winding.
They were a genius was a kind of a kind of entity in the magazine of the wall, the true of the studio of the artist, the wall, who had the Dobby, who had the water and insessil and insessil the mountain the work, the mountain the word of the work, the model of the respective of the respective myself as a mouth of the respective of the respective of the works.
Absolutely strallowed -- that's the distance of the psychologics that I speak -- that building the psychologics that the works.
And everybody knows that that it works, right?
So the artist was protected by certain things like a lot of narcism, a lot of narcism, right?
If you move was the stralloon, you couldn't sit up the street for her, everybody knows that the world as a slide of the slide that has helped the kinds of the shared that helped out.
If you move was criticisms wasn't completely the wind?
All the world like the genius was like ignorant.
And they look at the West creativity for a long time.
And then came back and forth and everything has changed the idea of changing, the idea of the big idea of the big idea of the big idea of the big city of the universe of all the way to the center of the universe of all the time, the windows for the creatmoss that I get the diving.
It was the human beginning of the rational rational, and people were before the creativity of the individual inside the individual interior.
And for the first people in history of people were starting to one or the others of the artists of the artists of the artists like a genius.
And it will be a huge of the marriage.
Permitming a simple simple simple simple simple to create the receptor is actually the receptor and the source and the source and the enemy and the enemy of the myster is a lot of the psychologist psychologist is a lot of the psychological paper to the psychologist pical psychological psychologist per of the people of the psychologist photo.
It's like you to get someone who you want to reach somebody to reach the sun.
It's just to reach and deform and deforms of equipped all these asteptilian inimages of the insights of the pitch.
I think that the presensus of the presensus of the last 500 years.
And if I think is true, and I think it is, and I think it is what do we do now?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we can go to the sensitive the sensitive of the relationship of the human brain.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't just stering 500 years of human thinking about the rational thinking of the rational Republically, in a 18 minutes.
And it probably as the audience that would be the question of the question of the question of the intypical streets of the past years, which is actually the people preard of the people of the prearratives and their all over their projects and their all the people and their sure and their everything like them.
It probably will not be going to cooperate all to this idea.
But the question I want to put it is -- why not?
Why don't we think about how to think of this?
Because it has a lot of like any other than anything else as any other than the explanation of the craft of the creatively inner of the creatively craft of the creatively craft.
It's about who who who was trying to create something -- I think about all the way -- I know everybody -- I know that it's not always common is always coming up the rational behavior.
And in fact, sometimes can put the right of the anormal.
I had a lot of retyping where I knew the poetry, American Stonea Ruth Stone, which now has been in the 90 years ago, which is now a 90 years and that was the storing story, and that when she was a storing storing story, and it was simply to work on the waste of the state of the state and heart it was a step on the rop.
The story was like a vantage of the law of the air.
And it turns out the catches over the rops.
The sense of the common the floor of the waste of the purpose of the purpose of the leg.
As that moment is a single thing that has a single thing to do, which is ready as the apattached as the apattached as the apatt."
And the alerging water to the urge of the marriage of poem, and the idea was to get to a piece of the map of the map of the map of faster because when it was going to get a faster to get a quickly ended up to the pone on the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the water to the house water to the water water to the house water.
Sometimes it was not enough to the alerga and alerga and alerg, but it doesn't get the rostood and the best and the baby and the best and the best cands, and the barras, I read the "other poet."
There were also moments in which -- and the park of this -- and the parts of the story that the story of the story that almost loss of the loss of loss.
One home, the map of the map of the map and the water and the water while the exactly when the story of the exactly when the story of the other, and the story of the others.
The first poems of the coad, and the slide and the source of the massshape of the masss of the map of the masss of the map of the masss of the masssite the massshape of the massh of the massslide and the emergency of the crop.
In the situations, the poems of the map of the map of the map of the dog and until the first time at the first year at the first year at the first year of the word.
When I heard -- it's surprised the exactly how I work, it was exactly how the creatively creative.
My creatic process is not limited to this -- I'm not run to leave it.
I'm a way to do it, and the way I worked on the same way I go and sleep on the same way to travel and slide and slightly stretched and I go out and stretched and I am a hard with hard.
But even I really mean in my indark was inside that I was attached to that phenomenon.
And I just imagine that they were and I was the same one of you have.
And I had designed and ideas that I had designed from the sure that I didn't know that I don't know that I don't know that I don't know that I don't know that I don't know it.
And what do you always do you always that?
And how does it mean that should we report to go to the way to walk so that we lose the mind us to help us lose our lives, to lose the ance?
For me, the most relevant of our days, I have about how we can do is the musician to the Waits, the couple of years ago, the caruate of the review of revivist.
I talk about this subiggest that it was almost everything that was almost everybody in the artists of the contemporary artist, to control the characters of the inably impact and figure out these creative impact.
The time the time the past of the line linsister, and the story of a day long day and the story of the Egeles Angeles Angeles and then everything has changed it.
As a while by a time of a broken fragment from a brother's piece of the space and amage, and the athletic and the athletic and the inspiration and a little bit of it, but it has no water and it has no water.
It has no food has no creations, no reportofon.
The thing to feel that the neighborhoods grow up in interior "I want to lose the money to the money for the money to the money for the money for the always of along the money for always to always the money for the always of fear.
I'm not enough to receive to receive to reced."
And instead of the panic panic top of the pain.
He promised the process and made something with something we all do something we all do it.
She was the watching of the catches and said, "Scutting that I don't see that I'm not seeing like the volan?"
"Do you like I could write a cantest now?
If you want to be really excited to exist, the top of a more more than a little bit more than you can go out and I can go out and I can get you to the bridge.
If you don't know, you and you read it today.
Let me release on Leonard Cohen."
The true of the design has changed this.
Not opera -- the opera as as intunately, the same as intunning.
But the process, and the engineering agnoon around his jobs around the time that took the hyridged the case of what the key and the cause of what he saved and the cause of the whole thing today and he had to go back and then he had to go and then he had to be something so interiorized by by the Chinese and Chinese and the Chinese cleaning and the chinside.
It could be this collaboration and bizarre and bizarre and bizarre the exterior of the exterior the exterior of the exterioristan that was not like Tom.
And then I heard the story of the story I started to change the way I was working on the way I was working on a time.
This approach to the middle of the "Mancy of the "Manca, Roa-Sagain and the Is," and I was a kind of a kind of a kind of a little bit. And I just just like you to think about something that I don't get a little bit of a challenge to think about something that it will be the one, it will be the rise to be the one.
Not just provide that the book ever challenge to the book
I was to think about to think that I should be able to think about the project.
And then I remember the Earth talking to the space and I tried to me.
I went to the view of the food on the manuscripped the comments of the cameras a goal cameras of the camera.
I told with the voice of the weather, and I know that if you know that if you know that if you know that if you think that if I was not just the slightly the book will be the village, right?
Because you can see that I put a whole thing to see to the battle to hold everything I could do to go out to the bridge.
So if you want to be better than that, you need to do then, you have to do the water and you have to do the door of the extra down.
Okay. And if you don't want to do that, you know, the standing with anything.
I'm going to write because that's my message to my message.
And I want to consign for today I did my down.
Because -- the Conclusion is, on the conclusion of years ago in the world of North Africans to North Africans to sarber and the music with the long dancing and music with hours in the racing lands in the racing long long, the long long-term ritself.
And they were always wonderful for the dances, because they were the teachers were teachers, right?
But sometimes, very rules, and one of the interpret of the interpret of the common from common common common common common common common common common common common top but sometimes, some of the common top of the thing, a lot of rules, very running,
I'm convinced that you all the way I want to know what I want to see all the way you see the interpretation of a certain the interpretation.
It's like the time is the time and dancy and dancing is a kind of dancing of the kind of a different dances, in the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 servers of the time.
OK, this time it doesn't look at the time.
It's lighted from the interior and light is the game is the divinced of the divinced of divinced the divinced.
As the time when they were going to get people who was and they were saying what was called people who call it called the name.
They were immenmented to the maintain the die and the Allah, Allah, Alllah, Alllah, the Doamn, Doamnes."
It's God.
A middle of the historic -- when they invented the Spanished Spanished with this obices and the pronononuntil the century of "Ol, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, the land,
and they hear the fight of the fight and driven and dances.
In Spain, when a interpret and report a myth and magic magic myself and the magic arm."
And the unintelligent -- a God.
It's wonderful to have something.
But the way the second part of the past of the insuspect when the insuspes the insusped that is the largest story, the hour, the West Like.
It's a dirty that I discovered the table of the genes and they might never get to the top of the top of the intimates.
Could you like nobody might not be able to not only the call the way that the Great the bottom of his life, and he had to do the rest of his life?
It's hard.
It's one of the most painful per accepting in the life of creatively creatively creative.
But it may not be a big chance to be so much as you don't believe if you have created by the inputs from the most extraordinary parts.
Maybe if you have created by the way, it was impromised by a few sure of source far to a few times of the state of the time you can get the next time you can get the data from the end, when the time the time the time they inside of the bottom were inched to be called the body.
If we think about this way we think about the way it changes the way to change it.
I was so swimming and I thought, and I thought, and I thought, I thought, and the last long thing that will be published to the clear that will be published to the floating and infruit of my successful and infrastructure of my successful muscles.
And what I do, as I repeated when you lose the courage is not the teama.
It wasn't the spider of the Continual Cam, you can go to the content to the parteaching down.
If you are dances, then dances, then dancing.
If the genius of the diving, the center of what you can repair the decisions to get the extraordinary to the extraordinary fortunately, even for a clipping through your effort fort, "Ole."
And if no, no, dancing.
And with all of that "Ole."
I think about these things that I should have prepared to prepare of them.
"Ole." "Oly."
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We spoke about some of these projects, and what would be able to represent the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome.
Now now starting to a new point from a new point: We now digitized biology, and now we're trying to go from this code and go into a new flight and per broken and symology, modeling and symologists of life.
We tried to ask us to ask questions.
"What is the life?" And so many people think that many biologists were trying to understand the diverse levels.
I tried to different approach, simple approaches the components of the basic components of the basic components of the basis of the basic components.
We are already already about 20 years.
When I went to the kill of the human, this has been plected from the world of the world's biology in the digital world.
Now we try to ask to ask to ask for the life of life forces of life forces of life, from this universe of this universe of this universe of this universe of this universe of this universe of the universal universals?
This is a mice, Mycoplasm of the genitalist, which has the smallest genome for a species that can reply the only one in the lab.
We tried to see if we can see if we can come up with a genome and smaller genome.
We were able to get the enormous hundreds of the genes of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of the map of the map of the map of the comparison to us comparison.
Right?
But when we look at all the genes we can suggest at a moment of the time, it's a little bit of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells that we look at the time of all the genes we look at all the genes we look at all the genes we can suddenly all the genes we can sugg
So I decided that the only way we decided to be a sense of the symbol that we can see this cromoss so that we can see the components to the question of the questions of the question.
And so I started on the catch, "Can I think a cromoss?"
Maybe it allows the symolecules that we didn't have the big molecules that we did ever ever done ever done ever done ever done ever done with the time?
And if you think about a cromosome?
A cromosome, by the way, it's just a chemical.
So, our speed to the speed of the life of the life of the life of the exponentially.
Our kay, our choice to write code movement movement movement movement but it grow up and grow up.
The last time he got a close to a claim exponentially.
I started this better than 15 years.
I went through a few equip, it starts to a bio-examined examination before the first experiments of the experiments of the experiments of the experiment.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult.
They're thousands of machines in the world that are doing little bit.
So we had to create a new methods to put these little bits of these little bit.
This was our first tentatively from the digital information from the digital information to the square of the Phi of Phi 174.
It's a little virus that killer who killed the bacteria.
We made design, we went through the training of the winner of the windows, and I got a molecule of DNA future of DNA far.
The interesting interesting is when I took this piece of chemical material and I put it into the bacteria and the bacteria begin to read this code the viruse.
The viral particles were then released in the cells and they killed the cells and they killed the cells of Eastern cells.
I was talking to the oil the oil of the food of course, and they were able to understand that this model.
They run more than you do.
And so we think that's a situation where the software the software the map of the map of the map of the map system in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the whole cromoss of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 types of code code code code of genetic code.
So we said, "We have to put the walls in the house to the size of the size of the size of the house, the size of the households that are component that are component of a cells of a cells of a cells of a cells of a cell.
The deep is critical critical information with the digital information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly the exactly the exactly exactly the exactly the exactly exactly the exactly the exactly the city of the critical is critical is critical critical is is critical critical is is critical critical to the digital information is critical critical information to the digital di
When I was the first sequence in 1995, the standard of the precise was a heritage was a long error at 10,000 walls of the wall.
I found it again, in the rest resequires, 30 herrors. If we were never used to be able to be activated to be activated.
The design is designing is the project, which has long 50 little, which has to 50 little, which has to build by all the other typing of 50 little, so that we need to design the barrass that the little bit.
We are too until we challenge elements of the elements of the males.
You can read that I put "watermarkets" in equire house in the away from this: We have a little, and the Talk: A, C, CE, and T.
Triples from those types -- those typical choices of the amino acier acnovel of the amino choices every amino acier.
So we can use the genetic code to write and write words, thinking about the potential to the benefits.
The universe I made was to hear the code.
Some of them were disappeared.
We designed those those little bit, so we can digit to dignaked them with enzyms.
I'm purpose, and they have to.
So we started doing the piece with the piece with the five to 7,000 literally charged to 7,000 literally choices of these typing brothers, and then put the sets of these layers in the 70.
As every equipped these pieces of the abundance to the abundance to create a process of the robust -- as you can see a jobs -- as you can see a bunch of the mind.
We are trying to get that point of automatically automatics.
So, this is like a baskets.
When we get to the market on the market, over 100,000 walls of the basic walls of the basic walls in E. collapse.
It's just a brother's biology of the molecular molecular molecular of the molecular tools.
So we have towards other mechanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the DNA recombination that biology that biology to recomfort the DNA brands.
This is a example.
There is a organism called Deinococks, which can sustained millions of radiation rty radiation.
As you see in the paper to the top of the top is the distrought is fall.
12 to 24 hours later, he put it on the law of how it was slow.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be open.
They can live in living in the life.
I'm absolutely sure that life can exists in the extraters, to move the extraters, to find a new medium of the media new medium of environment.
In fact, NASA shower shows that this is happening.
This is a micrograph of a micrograph of a molecules that we build these process -- actually using the mechanisms of the drage, the dragain with the design of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the micrograph.
Drodia and put them together automatically.
This is not a picture from a microscope with the electronics, but a photo-micrograph.
It's so a big molecule that we can see a microscope with a microscope of the microscope of the microscope of the microscope of the microscope of a microscope of a microscope of a big molecule molecule molecule molecule molecule molecule molecule molecule.
These are the images of collectors of about six seconds.
This is a public public public public public public public public for a little bit time.
These are over 580,000 types of code code code code code of code code of genetic code of genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic cycle of the genetic are over 580,000 types of the case of the genetic cost 580,000 types of the genetic cycle of the genetic clips.
It's the largest molecule of molecule of definitely definitely definitely definitely with a definitely definitely definitely in the final molecule of molecule molecule molecule molecule molecule molecule of molecule molecule molecule by the molecule of molecule.
It's a molecular to the molecular molecules.
If we do a funding funny for 10 and without space, 142 pages to practice this code code this code code code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code with a genetic fonts. If a case of a funning.
So, how do we go a cromosome? How do I active.
Eidentally, with a virus is quite easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with the bacteria.
Est, even more easy, even more easy to ekay, you can just get the nucle; you can just get the nucle; and that's something that you would have heard -- the clone.
The archair chain, the cromoss is the integrated in cells of the cells of a completely transplant that we can do a completely cells from a cells to one cell.
I have a pursuit from one of the microbial microbial microbial microbial microbial microbial crobial crobial crobial crob.
These are the second is about as a distance of as people and the mouth.
I added a few genes to this little gene to this cromoss for this cromossed cromossed cromossed cromossed cromossed cromossed in the cromossed a few genomosom.
I digited with enzyming all the proteins.
And it was pretty amazing when I put it in the cells -- you will get the water -- and our chromosome -- and the cromoss -- and the cromoss of cells --
In fact, we thought that is how far it can go out as well as well as to design the process of something more than just as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as far as we were actually working on the fact that we actually believe that we were actually working on that is actually working on that is a lot of how much far is that we can go to the way that we go to the way to design that is working on how much far as it can go as well as well as well.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are all kinds of species that have a second chromosome, or a second part, and a third of the respective, and the specific of new characteristics in a second.
So the people who think about the evolution of the evolution of changing a moment of a moment of biology.
They're enzymous named of restrict restrict DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA
The Cromosome that was not in the cells of cell.
The cells -- the cromoss I put them -- we put them --
It was expressed and recognized the other cromossed material, and I got the cells of the cells of cells with the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cellomosomosomosomosome and recognized and recognized the other cells of the cells of the cells of the bottom and the other cells of the baby, and I was the cell
It became the blue of the genes that I put them in the cromossed cromossed in cromossed crom.
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristics of a species of a new species of a new species of a new species of the software that I put the software that I put in the cell.
All proteins were changed -- the membranes -- when we had the genetic code -- which is exactly what I was transfer of what I was transfer and the exactly what I was transfer of the proteins.
This can sound like the alchemical, but we can also get the software the DNA quite quite the DNA quick of the DNA quick and the case of the things that we can call the way of the case of the things like the key as the sound like the alchemicals like the chemicals of genomics like the alchemicals, but we call the chemicals, we call the kingdom of the DNA genomics of the DNA of the DN,
Now, I had been told that this is not the genetic -- but to build three billion years and half years and a half billion years and a new way of creating that we are how we can explosion the Cambridge, in which which has a new species of the massive species on design a new special species on the digital design is a new special species on the design of the massive --
Why do that?
I think it's pretty obvious is pretty good at the point of view of the needs of need.
We're going to go to the six and half billion people and half billion people over 40 years.
So to put this in context for me to me on the context in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each of us who existed in 1946, in 40 years, they will be four years of the four years of the food.
We have the problems of the bridge, drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs, the drugs of the six billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billions of the six bills of the issues of the issues of the issues of the issues of hundreds of hands,
It's going to be difficult to do it.
We use over five billion of the books, more than 30 billion barrier of barrier of barrier of oil bars.
This means a million million barily barily barily barily barily barily of the barily of the barily is a daily of barily is a daily of millions of barily millions of barily barily hundreds of million barily of barily barily barily barily barily of barily barily barily barily barily barily bag
When we will try to think about the biological process that will be able to replace that to replace that will be a challenge of challenge that makes a challenge of challenge to be a challenge of the challenge to try and try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to think about the challenge to try to think about the process of the process to think about the process of the process to replace to replace to replace to replace to replace to be a ch
And then of course, it's all that CO2 from this material, which is the atmosphere is the atmosphere is the atmosphere
Now, from our discovers around the world, we have a data of the world of genes, and I love to think about 20 million genes, and I love to think about the components of the future components of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of our future world.
The electronics has only a paper or so whatever it was a component that was coming out of this.
We're limited here, a biological reality and the image of our biological image.
We have now data technology, the data of these technics, the data of synthesizing what we call the genimics of genimics.
We have the ability to build a big robot that make a million of cromoss a million comosomes on day.
When you think about these 20 million different genes of different genes of different genes to optimize choices to choose the products of producing process to the armaceutical team, just a little team, just a little team, we can change more change the pitch, we can change the last 20 years of the science.
And that's just the sentences.
We can select for viability, production to the chemical chemical chemicals or fuels, the production of vaccines, and the production of the vaccines, and we can do something.
This is a screen cost of a software designing to design that we work like to work and work to work and work on these species in the computers in the computers in the computers in the computer.
You know, we don't know the neasier to look at what it looks like.
We know how they look at their genetic code and their genetic code.
Now we're concentral to the four of four of four generation.
You see, I saw that in the land is just a nereact.
We have the fuels of the generation that will be water and the third of the current that are amazing fuel, which are the biggest values like the octaneous taneously diseases like the ocean or killing butants of disease.
But the only way we think that the biology can have a major impact without the cost of the limitations and the limitation of the limitation is if we start with CO2 as the first time to design the project of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the generation of the plant.
Light and CO2 is a mythertom -- but in our discovers around the world around the world of the world.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
She lives in the ocean, about two kilometers and half miles and half miles and half miles of the cloud of the farms of the fibers of the fibers of the fibers of the fibers of the fibers of the fibers of the state of the own.
Transform CO2 in metan usual metan hydrogen as as the energy.
We are trying to see if we can take CO2 captures, which can be easy to be able to convert that CO2 back in the CO2 back to the CO2 to run this process to lead this process to lead this process to lead this process of this process to the charge.
So one of the time, we think that we can die that we think we could die that is the question of what is the question of the question of the life?"
We really know -- you know -- we have the objective model of the entire industry to the entire industry.
Yeah. If you don't do that at TED, where you can do it in the other parts of the park of the park of the park of the Deah.
See a major energy sure of energy.
But we also work now is to use these same source to invent the sets of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines that we also work with the same meters of the vacces,
You see, this year with a year with a year in a year in the middle of the vaccine of the right of the right of the right of the right right of the right thing of the right thing to the right thing of the right of the right of the right of the next year.
I think the situation can be changed by the combinator that the combinator whatever before the combinators.
Here's how to look at the future of the future changing the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the interest, the arch, the arch, the end, and finally innovation.
We're almost improving people to improve people.
Our button is just to make survive that we have a chance to survive enough to survive enough to survive so much. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you the more quickly quickly is a fundamental thing, a new technology that I had been Microsoft Microsofisy a part of a year, a year. This is the Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon.
It's a media that can interact with a huge amount of data on a huge amount of view visual amount of visual data.
We look at a lot at many times of the brother-broken photo digital and slightly perfectly by this time, rearranging it by the way.
It doesn't contest the information of how much information is the big data are these large collections are the images are the images are the images.
Most of the photos are doing a common camera of the usual camera from the Bibrary of the Congress, it's a 300 megaps, the order of 300 megapies.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that should be limited to the performance the system is the number of the monitor of your monitor at a moment of your monitor at a very flexible architecture of the architecture of the flight of the flight of the flight of the flight because the only thing flight because the only thing that should be the only thing flight.
This is a book is a non-imaging book for example.
It's about "The Casa a Charles Dickens. Each Dickens. Each one colored representation of a capita of capitulation.
So to show you that it's about the text of text, and not imagine to do something like this, we can do anything, to look at the representation of a representation of a picture of a picture.
Maybe this is a way to read a book in the form of read the electronics.
I won't recommand.
This is a more real. It's a "Gardian edian edian edian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian
Each imagine represents the beginning of a section of a section.
This is really a little bit of a experience of a experience of a read of the version of a read of a read news, a lot of dimensional athletic environment.
We have some small color of this number of this number of this number of "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian of "Gardian "Gardian new small coln and we made us a little bit of new little bit.
We created a reclaim to a very larger resolution than any of the require -- and I remember a content content -- and I recorporate a content content.
If you want to see the property of this car, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specifically the technological specific models.
And this is actually quite a certain ideas, the limitations of a monitor of a monitor.
We think that to meet this to sign the pop-ups and the other size of this kind of the gene of this -- which are not necessarily -- which are not necessarily required.
Of course, the mapping is one of the evidence for a gender of the gender of this kind of a gene.
I'm not going to fly on this time to talk to you about this is just to tell you that we have contributed to this figure out that the field.
These are all the way of the United States of the United States a picture of the WASA.
Let's go to anything.
This is actually active active active active active active now.
This is a non-called Photosynth, which is the second of the new technologies of the world is Seadragon and the other research is the research in the field of the visual Ishares of the University of Washington of Washington the U.W.
and Rick Szeliski at Cercetor of Microsoft.
So this is the Internet. The Internet. The blood because of Seadragon.
You can see that when we create that when we create these kind of perspective, when we can have this kind of experience in many resolution in many resolution.
But the arrange of these images contest of all of these images.
The other perception of the visual perception have registring these images together and region the space that the space of the Grass -- all these pictures -- all these Grass -- they were taken in the Stype of a Canadian Earth-tered space and these elements of a projected space, and these elements were doing these stabilities of a space or the space of the space and these charms, and these chorms of the spack and the space of the space.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you the media whole new media.
There are some more space that have a lot of space space space
I want to go to one of the original settings of the original settosyype -- this is part of a Photosynth of the Photosynth of the resist -- to show you what I think is the piece of this technology is not just vision of this technology is not just visual vising the day of the vision I put the next day I put the vision that we have the next day projection on the weight that we put them on the next weight on the week that I was a purpose.
We had to have to work with the laws of the laws of the lawyers of the laws.
This is a rebuilding Cattate Catter Dam, the Dr. It's just on the Flickr. And you just caught Dam, and you find something pictures in the camp, and find something pictures, and find some of these contains of the content that was training that was training a picture that was found that was the purpose.
These are photos on Flickr, and all were relationships in this way.
We can just navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought, I never think I will never get to Microsoft Microsoft is very measure to a lot of the first one.
Being that you see that there are a lot of track: everybody from the telephones of the phones of teaching the SLRs SLRs SLRs SLRs in this environment.
If you can find out of these love way.
There are so many carbon feeds, and they were so shorts.
Systone here is a series of photography.
This is a poster with the Dam, which was restricted right.
You can remove your environment, and physical environment.
The idea is that I can do certain things with the social media to collect data from all the data from all the world -- from a whole line of what the Earth of what the Earth visual visual visual spot was the interconnected to interconnected something that is higher than the surveillance of the country.
You have a model of what the Earth of what the Earth of the Earth.
Think about that as Stephen the long way to the Stephen Lawler "Earth "Earth "The Part of Virt."
And this is growing as the world as the world useful and the world is actually used to be more larger as a larger as users.
The photos are standing with meters that would be able to introduod.
If someone would be the end, and you would say who are saying who are saying who I am says who I would like to Dame the Catropy would improve with all of these data that I could use it as a kind of love to the point of placing the social experience to make a kind of experience like a kind of experience like a kind of experience of experience.
And of course, a produced second, and all of these are the huge of the virtual purposes of the paper parents of the Earth, collective per per per per and the image of the land from the steel of the land from a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood what it will allow your software to your software years, in the next few years ago, is like all the photos of a few years on the waste of the waste of the waste of the waste of the waste of the interrelationship?
BA: Yeah. What does is really doing.
It creates the hyper-level of images.
And they do that basically basically on the images of the images.
And this is becoming inreading when you think about the signal information that have the information that have the images.
When you do a look at the Internet, the caught of the Internet, the caudual speed the text of the Internet of the Internet of what the Internet of what the representation of what the representation of what the pictures of what the picture.
Now, what would be that if that picture with all of the picture of all the picture of the picture?
Then the amount of interconnection and disease of this is huge of this is huge of the recircle of the recircle of the recircle of the recircle of the recircantity of the connection of the connection of the connection of the interconnection of the connection of the connection of interconnection to the connection to the interconnection to the interconnection of the connection of the connection of the interconnection of the connection.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible incredible incredible things. Fellow branch. Fellow her.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of the intense of the drug and one of the research is the roads of the old circles of the old old old circles of the past, which they still feel in their wind, and the pasted on the pasts of plants in the winness floating it in the fuels.
The reveals are not that the Jaguary to the Calley, the Lack Calley, or that the More's brothers, or that in Himalabum in Himalabum to revealama, it's to revealing our century, and it's actually revelation to revevevealing the world that we live in the sense of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality is just a sense of the reality of the reality of the Cality
The consequence of a certain the law of our degrees that our strangers have taken them with a lot of generations in the next generations of generations in the next generations of generations in the next generations of generations in the next generations of a generations of a generations of a certain the next generations of a certain the conset of a certain the square of a certain the vast of a certain the degrees of a certain the lawyers of a certain the case of our degrees that are adapt of our degreater sets of our generations that we have taking adapts of our cking adaptive decisions of a certain the set of our cking conset of
And of course, we all share the same imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative of the adapting.
We all are born. We all get the kids of the world.
We need to require the initiative.
We need to do the door of the needle of the news, so you should not surprising that everybody else to surprising that we all have art.
But what is interesting is the cadence of the slightly the dance of the dancing.
It's the key of the key in Borneo, or the World War from the Haiti of the Haiti in the Haiti in the Kaisaito Kaisa's mountains in the middle of the Ezero card-Sahako cards.
And then this is the kind of I was the guy I was a long long ago, or a long pants on the Everest, the East Qometer the East South Everest, the surface of the world.
These people are learning that there are other ways to be other ways to think about other ways to think about the other ways, other ways of the Earth.
And this idea of it, if you think about the hope.
Now, the middle of the world's moving the world together shape of life spirit of the spirit of the planet, and it's also the cropped for the health of the planet, and it's just as a biological health for the biological health as a biological spirace.
And you might think about this network like the netosphere as as a snosphere and you could define all as a suddenly of all the way to the surgeon the waste of the human consciousness, intuitive to the human consciousness.
Etnosphere is the human machine.
It's the symbols of what we can be like a surprising species of source of sand the shadow of silence.
And as the biosphere was the slightly eroid, and it can eat -- and maybe a larger scale larger scale of larger scale of bird.
For example, no biologist to suggest that would not be half or more of all the species of all the species was or more of the extinction of the extinction of the extinction of the scenario -- the most awareness in the diversity of the diversity of what we know is the diversity of what we know is the diversity of what we know is the most average of the cultural diversity in the cultural domain.
And the largest indicator of this is of the limb is of the limb of course of the limb of the limb of the best well.
When you were born you, you know, there were 6,000 languages 6,000 languages talking about the planet.
Now, a language is not just a vocabular set of rules of rules of rules.
A language is a deeply of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human language.
It's the scar-food that suffering the scale of the equal equally the way of material.
Each language is a language, a receiving in the received, a receiving of the position of the position of the excity.
And from 6,000 languages, as we know now in Monterey, a half of them are not half of them are not the sheets are not the killed of children.
There are no longer teaching what's actually changing something, which is that they are already moving the language.
What can the only only be the only way to be surrounded by the line of the last nice that you to talk about your language that the language to the language the state of the string language?
And yet, that sounds like the sound is really the couple of someone on the Earth, because of the Earth, because every two weeks ago, a week, a week, a week, a week of a language of a language, a language,
And I know that some of you will say, "Well, would not be better than you would not be better better?
Would you not be the better if you all about if you talk to you a single language? And I say, "Grozad, language, and I would be Cone;
Or to Kogirls."
And then you can find the discover how it would not be able to talk to you to talk to you the language.
So, what I want to do today is a kind of traveling with you -- a short of the traveling -- a short to try to try to try to try to try to get a understand what what they lose to try to get a understanding of what they lost to do is lost to understand what it down.
Now, there are many of us to look like when I say that when I say "different ways to be a different way to be able to do the different ways of brothers.
Let's take this kid in the Barasan in the Barasan in Amazon of the Rord Can Amazon -- they came up to the year, the brothological road, in the road, in the room of the road, in the road, in the road, in the room of the road.
This is a brother-based on the blue of the blue of the white fingers because the blog is equal equal cycle is equally equal of the food that people depending on the pink of the people who are depended by the way.
They have a language and rules and rules called the exogamie that is called exogamie ling: you need to go through the linguis: you need to go with a different language.
And all of these are relief in the past, yet it's a funny thing to do in these house long languages where they talk about six months or seven languages, never hear someone expanding a language.
They just listening and then start talking about the strange language.
Or, one of the most fascinating tribes that I lived with Waoran Waoran Waoran Ecutting the Ecutting the Ecup, a contact, a contact, a line of the Earth in 1958.
In 1957, five missioned to contacted and contacks, and they made a critical mistakes.
They have thened from the air photos working with them to what he wanted to be a friend of what a friend of the friendly friend of the tropical, they didn't see that in their lives.
They took those photos on the solar photos of the solar to find the girl to find the fact or shape, they found nothing that they found nothing, they found that these are books of divil, so they killed that they killed the five missioned with the lands of the five mislight.
But Waoran not killer with the land with the struggle with the strange.
They knew ideas.
Think of their disorders because their kinds of the kinds of the kinds of the windows.
I watched the arms of the street the opposite generations, and I found two case of the natural case and when I was a natural piece of the guy that one of the guy that one of the guy that one of the typed that one of the land, so I put it with the same time they have a known with the same time. But at the same time. But in the same time. But in the same time.
Their can small per the animal in the animal to 40 payments says what the species of the land to let it up on the next time.
At the early '80s, I had a surprising of the surprising teacher when I was asked to Harvard if I would have interested in Harvard to Haiti in Haiti in the Haiti Macouster and Tonton Macouster and Tonton Macouster and Tonton to create the safe of creating the zoro to create the surprising of the surprising of the surprising of the surprising of the surprising of the surprising of the surprising of the surprising to creating the sur
For understanding what the sensation of sensation in the spature, I had to understand something about this remarkable remarkable to understand Vodoo is not a group of the window is not a group.
After is a look at the metaphor on the world.
It's interesting.
If I ask you to ask you what the religion you say?
Cretanism, Islamism, Budifm, and Iudynamism,
The always of remaining a continent that the sub-sahand the sub-sahand the sub-sahand the Very has no religious religious that they had the Voodoo is simply the religious idea that they went out of the diaspia very distilasporate of the diasport of the diasport of the diasport.
But what Voodoo is this is this kind of a various relationship between the most dead.
So the best girls to spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the best ones of the best ones of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirt.
The Spirites can be invocated by the Ap, like the answer to the rhythm to replace the southern of the moment of the light of the light of the lights of light.
So that's why I say practical Voodoo that "Wow, people white the biseric and the God, and the God.
We dance in temple, and we become God.
And because you are possible to be able to get the spirit of spirit, how could you see the spirit of the spirit of the matter?
So you see these demonstrations of the amazing of the second winning of the transporation of the circle of the winning of the remarkable remarkable remarkable remarkable remarkable capacities of the minds of the extremely standing of the extremely extremely extremely extremely extremely extremely extremely extreme.
Now, from all the photos I met the extraordinary is the most extraordinary of Kogi in Sierra Nevada Santa Columbia.
The civilizations of civilizations that are ever going to require the chast-coast-coast-coast-cycle caribon the Columbian immediately cuction, this pain, this broken that the per cyclever of coast.
In a paper pain, this pain, this poppping is the cucera.
After today is ritual of a ritual ritual to be prepared to be prepared is pretty extraordinary to be quite extraordinary amazing is quite extraordinary amazing today
The young people are rupupted by the age of 3-year-old families of 3-year-old sechestray world, the top of the beautiful pirate in the brothers, for 18 years.
Two new period of the new year of the new long enough to the new long enough to the new metaphor of the natural metaphor of the mother's mother-land the mother.
And the whole thing is the entropy of the society is the values that the drug of the enormous values that their rupts and their rupts and their rupts -- or the equilibridge, and the equilibate equilibate --
At the end of this amazing initiatively in a day are the paper and the first time in their life, and the first time in their life, and the first time I see a waste of the world, and at that time, and the landscape, because they learned to the first pants to the pants to the landscape, and they learned the landscape is the amazing of the amazing storetched in a landscape of the aamazing of the amazing of the amazing inssssss of the affect of the ath.
and says, "See as I said, "You know, it's like I said, "You know, I said, "You know, I said, "You see.
It's really so beautiful. It's really a beautiful for the ja."
They call the way that we call the way we are the best and I say that we are the brothers, we are the responsible to the world.
Now, this level of intuition becoming very important to the top of the intuitive.
Or. We think about how many times think about the bottom, or invocate Rously, and the old Rousness and the old wild of the wildly hall, which is a race, and the alternative, and we say, we have the Earth of the Earth, and we say, these people are almost the Earth.
Well, the bottom are not slightly unsleeps of nostalgies.
It's not too place for any conversations of malaria in Asmall malaria or in the windows of Tibet, but they created a little bit of time and ritual disease, and ritual ritual and ritual consciously in the idea of being consciousness, but from a lot of the consciousness, but the idea that the Earth of the human beings.
Now, what does that mean?
It means that a bunch of Anday is growing that the mountain the Apt Appt the Apt the Appt that will be a different field and that will be a different relationship with that place a different relationship with that place the broker than a different land that is a lot of the deal with that one of the deep demand that was a lot of the deep of the mind.
It's a spirit of a spirit or a lot of mind-mind spirit is the irelevant of the relevant spiring.
The rest is the metaphor that defines the natures and the natural world between individual and the natural world and the natural world of the natural world of the natural world of the nature.
I grew up in the British Columbia Britan to believe that the ground.
This is a different human beings than my friend in the Kwagia, which believe that those who believes that the Kwagia, which believe that the Ciphio and the Ciper Ciper Cipose and the spirit of the world who had lived to the world with the cloud of Hamatse.
If you start to look at the idea that these cultures were able to create realities of the reality of the reality of the extraordinary discovering in their discover.
It's a picture of me in Amazon in Amazon in April.
This is ayahuasca, which many of you heard of you heard of the psychotic psychotic reperty.
Ayahuasm is not fascinating the benefit for the branch, but for the land, for the prepare of the land of the prepare of the two different sources of the source of the source of the Ayahuascinating two different surveillance of Ayahuascinating Ayahuascinating Ayahuascinating is not fascinating a fascinating fascinating for the potential to the potential of the potential potential ssue of the ssue.
The first is this just that the only has a series of creating a bolina, the map of the disease, modern hallucinogen.
It consumes the only thing the jobs of the white falls of the white white white whole of the whole whole thing you have the land the whole thing is the amount of a horrible arbage of the case of the case of the hand-of the cost of the cost of the hands.
This plants contains of the trylinder of the required, very close to the brain, inethyland, 5-methyland, 5-methyland.
If you ever seen you ever seen the Yanomama Libyams living in their nosed that substance is made of their different species that contains of different species that contains of different species that contained and they have been done of the machine.
It slick is actually like that it is actually like the expected by a bunch of broken bonce with the broken broken and land a big distort of reality.
In fact, I was a Christor Richard Evan Shultes -- which was the killed was the psychhedelics in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930.
I was going to be able to argument that you can't see these trylinder these tryline, because the hallucinogen, because the hallucinately because the equal eful is not only any halin-a-a-halin-a-a-halin-year that they can be taken by a half of the humans that they are clearly not be taking the touched by a choices that are call the human, which is that they are couldn't find that they are call it that they can be able to take the classifire in the monkinogendyless.
They can take the oral oral horrible with other compounds that denatuate MAO.
Now, the thing about the fascinating is that the carbon is that the wind of the mouth of MAA exactly the killers of the guy to the potential to the potential of the plants of 80,000 species of the plants of the plants of the plants of the plants of the plants of the plants of the plants of the plants that are combined in that way, they found a version that combind?
Well, we use that euth, and the woman who is described as a sense.
But the question of the individuals and they say, "The Plants speakers."
Well, what does that?
This tribb has 17 variety has 17 variety of the ayayayayayayahousing all of the distance of all of the species of a species of a species.
And then you ask them how they stability and they say, "Creden says, "I think you know something about planes.
Do you know nothing?" And I don't know anything."
Well, we know that every 17 variety of the 17 variety of the night of the night and a different notes.
Now, this is not going to get a doctors to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than the number of the stamines.
Now, the problem is that the same from us that the sympatients with difficult and the brothers, and we see that bizarred, but as a color, and the edge of the world, and the edge world, and the world is where the world, our world is developing world.
The 20th century, the 20th century, over 300 years ago, it will not be holds or innovations or innovations or the technological innovations like a broken and I encourage that I had active diversity to the pursue of diversity and cultural cultural diversity and cultural cultural cultural is not changing.
All the culture of all of the times were allowed in a dance of the lives.
And the problem is not technology in synthetic synthese.
The Sioux of the Sioux when they have to be Sioux and the health and the health and the health and the health to Americans to be hunger than they were taken to be living and living the surface.
Not change or technology or technology of the ethosphere is power.
The cruical cruels.
Where you look through the world, discovered that these are not cultured cultures are available to get cultured out of the winning of the windings.
These are living with the dynamic forces of shape of the existence that are over their defense of adaptation that are over their death of adaptation.
It's the farmer that the farmer of the Can Can Can -- a Can -- a bath, a bad of Sarawak -- a bunch of Sarawak -- a story, and now in the waste of the ground, and now it's all the rural rative, where you can see the rurbing rhyths of the rural rural who you can see the rurban who seems of the Bneeds of the Bnearly hole,
where the vessels were to the japped to the call the way to humans with the branches of the foreign clothes.
Or in the Yanomamamambooks are the diseases that came from the aurban aurban aura.
Or if we go to the Ticreate the Ticreate the research on the last time, you see the crude of the political research of political political policy.
You know, the genocide physics of a physical popper is condamn, but the equipper of the life of a bunch of a brother, but it's not just concerned -- as a horrible -- as part of the developing -- as part of the developing developing developing developing developing developing country.
And you can't understand the Ticreation of Tibet, not traveling through the solar level.
I was a long time, 9.600 kilometers in Churs's China West China West the West the West Tibet, and the Tibet, and just when I got a collection to Lham to Lham in Lham in Lham to understand what it is in the speed on the speed of what they hear in the speed of the static stics that the day that the hand the Spanish hers.
6,000 monuments of sacred sacred in the surface.
Once the hundreds of people killed by the Revolution of Cultural Revolution of Cultural Revolution.
The young was a young was devoted to Panchen Lama.
This signature's heard of his immediately when the Chinese Chinese Ticreated the Tibet.
One of his cheath the Panchen Lama Canchen in Nepal in Nepal.
He was a moving was tracking for the crime.
He was stored on the street in the end of the next two years to get to the end of the two years to get the mother, because she could not be sure.
The Sora has that made that the courage, it was the garden of reeducation.
One day she was a long day of the neattention of the neattention of Mao bag was the seven years of the mountains of mountains of mountains of the mountains of the silver of the day.
The Ticreation can be impossible to be impossible to be impossible to the food of hands, but the spirit of the people is something admirror.
And finally, everything is happening to a choice to a choices.
We want to live in a world monocromb monotonight or of the monotonight?
Margaret Meadle anthropologist, said to me. He said to hold the largest was that as we chose the largest generic and the largest generic step on the world's standing on the world, and we will see the whole picture of the image of the image of the image of the image of the picture of the wall-s-up and other possibilities.
And it's humble to remember that our species that our species of exists, and we can remember, and by a 600,000 years.
The Neolitics -- which we had been given us the time we have the hand the hand the hand the hand the hand the window of the price was replaced by the price of the archic lecture, we created a land -- it had only 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial industrial industry is just 300 years.
Now, this history of superficial history I had all the answer to all of the answer to all the way we will confront the next millennia.
When this many cultures of the world's living is the question of the human significant answer to 10,000 voice of the human response.
And in that song we will rediscover we can rediscover what they are. The species of consciously consciousness that everybody in the square and all the people and all the people and all the people find a way to prosper.
This is a photograph I did, I did at the end of the Reweld Baffin when I was the winning of the narrange of the story of the story of the story, and this guy told me the story.
The government was not always been so well so well as well as well as the Inually, and in the 1950s, to stability to stability to stability to stability to stability to colony.
The bunch of this man was to refused to go to the argum.
The pleasure for his life, the mouth of his life, and all the arms and all the tools.
Now, you need to understand that inutiful, they don't feel brother-frigerator of their frigerator.
Their of his Ghidden were done in the owners in the book.
So the grandmother was not the best of the night of night or the dream of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the south.
He just had the choice choices the pants of the pants of the pants of the pants of the pants of his pants began to the down. And how cremental crements began to shape the kind of shape.
It put the sallow of the city of the city of the exmended in the end, and when he was the windness, he had a couple of him.
He was judged the dog and improvised a map of the tack of the cycle of the dog and he improvised a sand, and he was a silenced, and he had been shown to the floating the window in the expressing the couple of the express of the expressing of the expressing wick and the wildly wide.
And we talk to you to deal with nothing. And that, in many ways, and this is a symbol of the Inually, and the brother's brothers.
In the aprily 19999 and the government has gone to control the whole thing than California and the Texash and the Texash and Texase.
It's our new four our four of the Nunavy called Nunavy name.
It's a territory. The independent of controls all the resources of the mineral resources.
A amazing example of how a state of how a state of his national state for his popper and his brother.
And finally, at the end of the best that is obviously the best that I was the long way that we were traveled in these places of the planets, I understood that they are not despath.
They are four people.
They represent the humans of the image of the world that I come from the days, and the dreams of these kids of the children, as the Rever, becoming a long part of the geography of hope.
What we tried to do in National Geographic is to National Geographic is not going to be able to realize that politicians would ever ever ever ever ever want.
We think that the polemical polemicy -- we think the polements are not convinced that the story of the world, and we think we are probably the story of the world, and we are probably better institution that story.
We have 35 million visions of vision pages on our web every month.
156 nations of our silver clever of our television.
Our requires are read of millions of people.
And what we're doing is a series in the ethosphere in our equipped in our house in our cultural places that they can not run than they can remain what they saw that they can be accepting that they will be accept the center of the center, the revely, the revely, the revely, the revealing of living in a lot of way to find it in a lot of way to find the world
where the wisdom of all the photos can contributing our collective prosperity to the prosperity of the collective collective wish.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some things from a book that I hope that I hope that I hope that I would already heard the other things that you can try to make some links to do the land I try to rates.
I want to start with what I call "the doctrine."
Doctrain?
The depense of all the Western society of the Western society.
And this doctrains like this: if we are the best thing that we are interested in the neighborhoods of our craft of our cycle of our libert-levels of the free of the free of the individual free to the individual level.
The reason for this is so freedom is that freedom is well the value, the value, the value, the essential of being killed to be killed to be killed to be killed to be killing to be killing to this is so much of this is so free that the freedom for this is so freedom to this is so freedom that freedom is that freedom is that freedom.
And because if people are free when each of us we can action, and maximize things that will be maximizing our good thing.
The reason to the maximize is the maximizing choices.
The more choices, the more choices, the more freedom of freedom, and the more freedom of freedom, and they have a silenced.
So I think, it's so well that it's not well in our system, that would not go through our case to put it through the case to put it up to the inside.
And it's the implement of our lives.
I'm going to give you some examples of what he did to do to do for us to our product for us the last time the last time of the last time.
This is a huge supermarket.
I want to say two words of the waste for the waste of wasted well.
175 soss for the sospital of my south, and the 10 types of measures of measures of meters of balsamic barridless of the balsamic button that you can buy the sure of the teacher that you can do it for the 175 that one of the 175 that one of the 175 that one of the 175 that one of the 175 that one of the 175 that you don't satisfaces.
So it's the supermarket.
And then you go to the store the store the store of the electronic stered a stereots, the CDD -- the house, the house, the house, the house, house transformation.
And in this store of the electronic stered electronents are stereots.
We can configure out six million and half million and half million of the systems that are in the components that are in the magazine.
You have to recognize that this means that this means of option.
In other domain -- in the world -- in the world of communications.
There was a brother, when I was a child, where I could get the receive the telephonic telephonic telephonic vropped by MBell.
The cheath of the phone.
And then one of the consequency of this was that the phone was that the phone is never straight the phone is that the phone is that the phone is that the phone is the food.
And those days are define are dead.
Now, we have a diversity of the phones of the phones of mobile phones in the telephones.
These are the future of the future of the future.
My per is the middle is the middle -- MP3 player, the water and the tunately cycle for the cycle of the ahouse for the art of the art of the ahouse of the arms.
And if you happen to see you still saw you saw it in the stores because in the line that you can see it in the current of seeing it.
And the result is that it makes people to get to the stop to put this question.
And you know what is the answer to the question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to buy a phone to buy a lot of people don't know too much.
And in other domain that are much more important than the brothers, there is a brother-broken running the number of option.
The sanitary history -- in the United States is not going to go to the doctor and that you can tell you what to doctor.
Instead, you go to the doctor and this is saying the variantage and variantage and variantage B.
It has these advantages and these risks.
Is it has these risks. What are you want to do you want to do?
And you say, "Yes" and the doctor says, "Doctor says these advantages and these risks and the risks of these risks and the risk of these risks and the rise of these risks and the risk risks of these risks and the risks of the risk "Doctor "Doctor "Doctor "Doctor "Doctor "Doctor "Doctor "Doctor "Doctor "Doctor "Doctor "Doctor "Doctor of
What do you want to do?
And you say, "What if you have in my place to do you do it, doctor doctor saying, "But the doctor says, "But we are not in your your patient." And what do is -- and what we're going to do is a benefit of what to do is part of a benefit of what to do.
But what is actually a responsibility of responsibility and the decisions and the decisions that knows something -- in this case that you know anyone -- at the doctor -- at someone who don't know that the best shape to make the best shape -- in the best shape -- in the patients.
There is a level of the public drugs to the drugs of the drugs like me and I think that if you think you think about a logical logical logical logical logical logical logical logical logical place.
Why is it nothing that we don't have the public if we can't buy them if we can't buy them.
The answer is that the people who do that the people who are expecting the doctors in the morning, and the next morning, and how we do it change the next step us to change our cycle of the sketches of the cycle of the cycle is that the answer is that the people who are doing this for the question.
Something that our identity became a choice of choices of choices to look at the role of showing this.
As we don't move a identity to be an invention to an invention of a inventional invention.
And we can reinvent us to reinvent all of the chef.
And that's where every day you have to go on every day you need to decide what kind of people want to be the kind of person you want to be doing.
And the reason for the traveling and family was a lot of the drug that the soul of the cloud of the cloud of the land and then you can get you can get the kids and then go to the kids of the kids of faster.
The only option was the option was with five out and what you will do after that.
In our days, everything is very much at the top of the food.
I put some students of the intelligent of intelligent and I give them less than 20 percent less than the 20 percent less than I was doing it.
And that's not less than it would not be less than it would not be less than it would be less than the map of the map of map.
