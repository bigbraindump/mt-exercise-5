And the year I showed these two diapositive to demonstrate the way to demonstrate the big of the last three million years that in the last three million years of the last three million years of the four million years of a little state of the four percent of the southern of a little bit of four percent of the southern of the last percent of the southern of the southern of the slightly
But this is the obvious driving this special issues because not look at the gross of the gross of the garden.
The polar is is in a way, the heart of the world that the heart of global system.
She was extinct and contraction and contract.
The next diaposition that I will look at the fast will be a quick of what was going on on at the last 25 years.
Gheight is the big is the big is the big ball.
So you see extinct your bastrathleted.
This is the analyzee of the analyze.
And they wallowed the various window it.
Asay's fishing the floor a fourth of five years or more than five years of such a body, you can see it's almost like a body.
In 25 years of this, at this time, at this one.
This is a problem because the issue of the challenging of the ocean's ocean.
where it's a massive carbon that carbon that carbon that carbon that is transformed in the metan charged metan micro-organisms.
The motivation of pollution data in the global core of global atmosphere can be able to go to the fish of extremely extreme that we could go to the point of extreme that point.
She in certain acting a little bit of the Alaska metant, the metance-metand,
The Katter Katter's University from the University in the Alaska was on the team with a different law of the equipper in another non-slap.
Gore: Oh, yea! She is OK, you know, it's the question is the question is if we are going to be bad.
And a reason is that the enormous of the heroes of the northern in northern north.
This is a range that all of the analye.
But it is a lot of larger as any of it.
This is the Kangerlussing in the Groenlanded.
If you want to know how the ground growing is the big levels on the big levels on the top of the best in the big stage.
These are very quickly very quickly.
And the other capture, Antarctics the largest ctickets on the planet.
The past people were in the past of the world as a black of the world's overall the world's story is negative the Antarctics on the World World World Western Etarget all the way over the top of the top of the top of the top of the past.
This is the equality of the mark of the big level, as in Groenlanda.
In Himalaya, the mass-fishing such as a new form of the new form of the new form of a few years of years were the garden.

But when it turns out and so far and the water and the water.
In California was a 40 percent of the fourth in Sierra in Sierra.
This is the reserve reserve water.
And the predictions, you know, they're read -- you know, they're seriously real.
The global was all the global growth of the incentises.
And the releases are on the global land in the global rats' rate and farming and far.
From the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the 75 anteriors.
This is a shape of absolutely until
If you look at the context of the history of what is intample.
In the last five years I brought 70 million tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tonight to the oceans.

And the proposition was built more fabricate for a lot of brother.
But we start to see a total.
Here are the last year, the last year, with alternative alternative propects.
All right, there is a political type in our country.
And the industry and the carbon and the oil and the farm of the last year, a farm of the last year.
The promote carbon what is a oximetymous.
This picture of the picture of something.
In the prisoners, at me in Tennessed, a billions of galoes of galoes was the impractical charged by the carbon was imprisoned by the mouthier.

Al Gore: So the Astana Climate for the Climate Climate for the last year.
This is one of them, part of the one of them.
Video: ALergy COALergy has a very serious threatening for our business.
That's why we can do our principle is to speak a big shape of money for public equity to argue the cheap of the charge of the carbon that we really really really really the carbon about carbon of carbs.
The thing is that the carbon is not discoveries not did.
We think it's currently -- and moving -- and my brother.
So it's not going to be driving for changing changes for change.
Latish that we would remember it.
Video: Carb: Carbon a flawyer of it.
So let's do you do a young people to do a house of course,
Human is a little bit of the name is like this.
But this is the sound of the technology of the carbon the course.
And while the carbon is one of the principal of global income, the global technology of the networkers of the networks.
So let's take a lot of attention, this is technology of the carbon today.

Right? Our energy in the electricity of 100 percent curators.
A plan to the American America back to the third of the stopping stopping stopping the stopping of global income.
At sfars; a solution that is a big solution to solve our problems.
Right? You know, the American energy of America.

If you want to get the part, you go out the well-well.
We need to go fast, we need to refast.
Thank you very much.
And the year I did a TED I made a LHC.
And I got to come and come up and give you a lot of remains about how it works.
So this is the biggest one. And for the people who have been here, LHC is the largest stive that was the most experiment that was recreated by 27 kilometers -- the Strems of 27 kilometers or is to be a billions of square in the grounder of a billion times of the universe -- the military of the universe -- a billion times of the universe.
It's extremely ambitious.
This is the city of Geneva.
We do photographs "Big Bangs" in the decades.
I work on this one. It's called the ASTLASSSStor TASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS.
The 10 sepatient in the third of the first time.
And this picture was made by ATLAS.
He just a slide of a camera in control in control in control.
It's a very first picture of the first fashion particular particular LHC, the LHC, the LHC, the LHC, the LHC deliberate in the HC deliberath in the HC deliberate in the HC deliberate in the HC deliberate in the HC deliberate in the House is a particular image of the massive of the main the southern of the main the High school of the massive system that was the massive system of the top of the main the consummer in the House of the Hathern of the top of the top of the
In other words, when I wanted to take that picture about 10 sepatients, I was standing as a very successful thing that is a huge successful successful success.
I don't know that the largest overcome the largest oversion, or if someone went on the page, and he was the first page, and he was the first page,
It was a cultural impact on the cultural impact on the stine.
After about a seven-seven paper with a problem with the problem with these fishing art, which was the aur.
These are the 13 thousands of both both when the power works.
Now, the engineering of the sentence and said, "I can't transport the attack attack."
But I can do this because when they're in the temperatures become what the speech of superaters.
So as a 271 degree of the hot of the hot of the hot of the street can transport of the horse of the horse of the right.
At one of the country in the 9,000 magnets in LHC, was a fabricatic far.
So the comes was the shape of both and the 13 thousands of both both of electricity.
This was the result result.
That's more impressing that they are retirements in 20 tons, and they were funded about 30 tons, and they were always to 30 clean.
So I determine the average of 50 magnetititiate 50 magnets.
We had to take them to the affect that I was doing it.
We reconfident to, I repaid, I repaid.
And now we go back into the subteran.
The past of the sfartist LHC will be as new as we are going to be as we are as we are as a new thing.
We're going to go back and we are to, and we are going to get data in hythese, and we will continue to be researching to try to figure out that are the elements that are elemental to be the universe.
Now, of course, as a sense of these recognizes that are recognizing about the important engineering and engineering and engineering to extremely reject.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult to be difficult the fact that we have a little bit of the experiments like LHC.
You will be the words of the words of a word of a stify of the Britisphant, when I think I think that I think I think that I think that the prisoners, and I said, "Nothing that Michael Farchael Farchael Farchael is not more than not as a southern of our mind-tools are not worse in our minds."
Thank you.
I would like to ask to remember to remember the kidddle of childhood, when you play with the board, when you play with the bottles.
On the masssive to the water, to go and go to the shape and satellite them to the shape of silk and removed them as to the issue and manipulate them the issue of issue and manipulate them into spaces and the relatic relatic relative to spaces and the relatives.
The space is the profound is profound about how we understand how to understand a lot of the inconject.
So I think that we can see the IT inspired by this utility of our interactive interactive physics -- impressing with the physicists, and collaboratory -- I was my collaboratory -- I started with a Kalania Kenania -- I started to get a computer, and we would be able to a couple of course that would be able to a computer, and we can be able to be a mouse and whatever it can be a massive and informed by a couple of the mouse of the massive and wheelchair,
So we want to do it again?
The question was the question of fascinating I decided to ask the research, I decided to build Siftables.
On the Siff is a Sift of a nice computer.
They can be manufacturing the reciprocess can perceive the mission of one alted, and they have a ran ecran an ecran of a non-radio roll reless.
The most important is that the palpe, so as the case of game, you can just missing them as it as it just watching it as it is it.
And Siff the example of a new example of a new manipulation of digital manipulation of digital information.
On the masssive is more constantly more constants to be a missing missing of their constants to one of their humans and our constants on their house and our connections to explore our interactive and distractive and distractive and distractive.
You start with a couple of example.
This Siff is configuring is configuring video to predict the video of a video direction, if you can move the mother, if you can include the parts of the parts of the part, the rule of the part.
These are interactive constants one of the other.
So, if you put them on one of the other thing.
If they're confusion, they will get it and it became a confusion.
And I can also feel the missing and inclining.
We realized that one of the implicative implicative implications is that we can use the gestures of manipulate the manipulate of manipulate how we would be able to hit a license license.
In this case, we have three Siff configuring as galets and they can use them to reach them in the center in the center in the center in the center in the center in the center in the center of the center where they will amest.
If I was too much, we can be a lot of inades.
There's also the possibilities for education, like education, like education, as we would be play with the game, and the mathematics of the possibility of the possibility to the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the results.
So here I -- this is a Fibonacibonacial program with a job.
Here we have a game of the words, a combinator a combinator and Boggle.
At every single paper in every Sift is a literally on every Siftable, and the mother, and they try to teach the word with a dictionary.
And then I was about 30 seconds of seconds of seconds and you have a new slightly new positions and we can choose and new possibilities and new possibilities.
Thank you.
These are the kids who came to the Labies came to the Media, and I was to take the Media, and I was trying to make a material material.
It was a good neighborhood.
And one of the interesting of this kind of applications of this kind of applicated.
All of you have to say, "For and I know what to do.
Here are some people are a few people are researching it.
This is the most tant, our rough, the game of our right.
It turns out that he wanted to do was was to take a Siftable.
So for him was just the bottom.
This is a type of animating.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who invite the language.
And this is Felix.
He can get new characters in the scene, just the Sift of Sifables that affect the Sift of the characters.
Here is the sounds of sound.
Video: The race.
David Merrill: Now it turned a traction, it was a traction,
Video: The ball.
Good well! Yeah!
And the Siff and Sifting and ashion one laange the chart of the beginnings -- Video: Ham!
DM: I think the narrative of narrative myself.
Video: Okay!
DM: It's a story of open story of open, and he decided to defy how it will be done
Video: Yara, the sand!
DM: The next example I showed you today is a time to do is a very funded music and interpretated music and interpretation that I was recently, and in which Sift and in which Siff and in which Siff and all of the sound.
Every of these four variation has four different choices, you want to use it that you want to use it.
And you can inject the sound of a successful that you can assemble, you can assemble.
You are slightly sound of the sound of sounds like a sound Sift of a successful Sify Sify Sify Sifts.
There is the effects that you can control the live and filter.
You know, you have a certain sound and then they were able to inclinics.
It is the measure of the general effects and volume the airplane that has been amazing the square to see it.
Video: Well we will start with a Siff in the Siftables in the Siftables of a series, we have a series, we have a seriously hitself in a seriously hitter.
Now a type of basic line.
Video: M: Now I bring the percubomers.
Video: M: M: And now I'm going to bring the movie, to control the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the lives.
Video: You can be including the inclining inclinining in a section or in one part or in one part or in one part or in one part or in one of the or or in other people.
Video: M: Now I'm going to attack for more expression for more expression for more expression
Video: M: M: I can do the second in while I can do the second while
So I don't have to do the planning, I can improvise, and I can improvise or melodia in the window in the window in the window in the window in the window of the window in the wind.
Now, in sfars; I can get the tool, I can use the Sift of Sift Sift Sift Sift in the stangle.
Thank you.
As you see my passion is creating new interfaction is the creation of our human beings that are actually working with the brain that works in which our brain that works in our brain.
And today, I had a time to show this new space, and a couple of design, and a couple of possibilities that I would give them out of the lab.
The Gand's retine that we are like we're at the new granittee of instruments of instruments of instruments of instruments of digital digital digital world.
Thank you very much.
Astep with you to talk to you to all of you today.
They're writing.
He wrote is my teach, but it's more of course, more than that.
It's all my time, and the big bones and fascinating.
And I don't like this to do this is changing.
But these physics to said, something like a little bit of the living, and in the botttom, and in the bottom, which was my father's line of works.
And the thing I wrote is that I wrote this car, this car, "Manca, Rograph Great the "Manca, Road Iubestern them." And the really, I was a sensor of my books in my books in the world for a sensitive sensitive sensitive sensitive of the physical sensational of the physical sensition of the physical sensitial physical.
The research is that the original is that the people are going to be condamner.
Seriods -- yeah, yeah, conamnamed --
All of the example of the top and you say, "You don't have the teama teama team, you can't be able to be performance you can't be performance this?
You don't have the team is going to write the far of his life, you know, the far of the far case that would be a couple of books that would be a couple of the world that would ever be a couple of the world that would be on the world?"
It's very line restrict,
But it would be more run if you don't move it doesn't measure about 20 years ago, when I was about 20 years ago, when I was a great standing of people -- when I was a writing of the same -- I was a kind of fear -- I was like a kind of farming kind of farming on a kind of friction of the far.
And people said, "Not you don't have any of you have never never had any success?"
You don't like the humilination will kill you knew ide?
You don't have the fear is the fear of the word in this field in this field and nothing here and nothing here and will not be here and I'm going to deaths on a dream of the speech of the center of the center of the center of the midle of the midd-farm?"
Something that kind of like this.
The slide -- the rack on the bottom. "Yeah, it's "Yeah, yeah, right."
Yeah, you know, it's all of these things.
And always he was always st.
And you know, it's in the far as many other things that people don't fit in other things that people can't inture.
As a big example of the big things that are infricos.
But when it's about written about writing and I all think, and what I was all the last time I was """Why is I said, "Why?"
Is it something rational right?
It's logic to be asking to the top of the word that they felt like it was pretty much worth to do it in this Pamant.
And what is attached by creative innovative that seems that we are true, is the very elinists of the attention of the attention of the kind of a kind of kind of teachers.
My father example, for example, and it wasn't remember and I don't remember the 40 years of you have the chemistry of chemistry of the chemistry of the chemistry of the Chemistry is not a chemist.
It didn't intampled -- John, how do it with the chemical?
It just doesn't really get it into the sample,
But we would be syndromes are chemists not too clevers too chair to the second of the century of the reputation of the maniaco-depression.
We are writers of insang and we don't only have this research, but artists have this reputation as they were to be the power to be the power to be the power to be powerful to be the powerful lab.
And all we have to do is to look at the number of deaths in the number of deaths in the middle of the mind of the mind of the mind of the creative of the American creative proprisoners.
And even the same thing that didn't work, they were hunted to be restricted to be the distracted.
Norman Mail, even before the last digm of divid, he said that "Five me a little bit of my cartoonists a little bit more of my card."
A great tourisial about a mountain the word of a movie of a life.
But we don't even as a list when we hear it on someone day-daughter because I heard these things like this, and I heard these things like creatsorry and I can put together, and the idea of creativity and suffering and suffering as a creative and the art of the art of the art of the best and the art of the blood under of the suffering of the suffering of the blood until we hear and the farming thing that is going to be a whether in the farmacticke.
And the question I want to bring all of all of all of all of all of all of you here is: you all with this ide?
You are comfortable to be -- because of the eye of the eye of the eye -- I don't mean with this ipotter.
I think it's over.
And I also think it's dangerous, and I don't want to see the future, and I don't want to see in the future.
I think it's better if you get the artists of artists to live the rocket.
And I know that I was that my case -- in my situated -- it would be very dangerous for me to me to me to me to me to me the art of this hypothese, in the hypothese, in the hypothese, in the circumstances in which I know that I was now teaching teaching teaching the teacher.
As for example, I'm pretty much in the tanard, just in 40 years.
I probably probably probably like four decades.
And it's very probably that I would write the moment to be judged by the moment of human beings as a mountain my grandmother, my father's standing of my last both of my book, right?
What would be saying to say the measure of the bottom here we're already -- it's very probably -- it's very likely to be a very successful way to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be indeed to be the slightly would be able to tell the fatty of the sample,
Oh, I said, "Oh, what you w!
This is the kind of gas could do someone to get someone to the case of the heart of the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I think about this message that I love this message that I love it.
And then the question becomes indeed, right?
And so I think that I would like to work for a lot of meditative myself to work now, to write now, is through the building of a kind of like building a kind of like building a kind of corectly protective, cost, cost, cost, cost, cost, cost, and so forth?
I have to do it in a way, to give a way to fly a distantor to me a distantor to me, and my team, and the them, and the them, and the them, and the third that will be now before I writing what I mean,
And as I was all the last year, I was this sense of this sense of time, and I started to come up with the time, and I tried to see if you could have the ideas if you could have better ideas and the idea of how to be better ideas about how to be better ideas to be able to do people to be able to help people to do with the art of the art of the art of the emotional emotional emotional emotional emotional emotional models of the emotional modellline in this sense.
The recircle this is the ancient and Roma and Roma Roma ancient of it.
So the great case of the case of the Chidea.
But as Grecent and the Roman ancient and Roman ancient creativity is the beginning of the human beings in the homok?
People thought that creativity was a spirit of the people who can be able to attack people in a source of a reason in a reason and unfortunately, and unfortunately.
The name was called these creativity of creativity of creativity, "Mrimosy."
Socracies because it has a mon has a mon that has a mon that is transmission in the department.
The rest of the same parents, but they call that spirit of creativity, genius to the creative.
What is wonderful, because the romants don't believe that a genius was a genius was a kind of a kind of a kind of a charge individual character.
I think that a genius was a kind of a divinced of the measure of the artist, and in a kind of like Dobby, and the Dobby, and the insession of the author and insession and insession and insession of the worker work, the model, the model, and the mountain the word of the works.
Absolutely -- this is the distantor -- this is the distantor that we were talking to -- that we can protect the works.
And everything that was working on the way it work?
So the artist was the protected of things, like for example, like for example, but much of the corect?
If you were the work was the stralosye, you couldn't move the world for her, everything that you could have this genius as a square the square that help.
If you were criticized, it wasn't completely the window it?
Everyone in the genius that was a couple of course.
And then they looked at the West creativity for a long time.
And then came up with the Renast, and everything has changed with a certain idea, the idea of the idea, the idea of the universe as individual in the center of the universe and the mysters, the mysters, the farmistake, the farmistic tools that they were releasing the hundred and release.
It was a human beginning, and the humans have started to creativity as creativity in the individual beginning.
And for the first history in history of people were trying to refer one or the other, and the other genies, in place, instead of the genius of the genius of the genius of the genius.
And you have to be a great heroes, I think it was a huge error a huge error.
Permitted, a simple person to create it or is actually create the receptor is actually the source and the source and the source and the source and the insurance of mystern, creative is a lot of the brothernal responsibility is a lot of fragile physicist.
It's like you to take a couple of a couple of soil.
It's just the incovocation and form over, and the genes of all these affects all these inimaginable inimaginable inimaginable.
I think that the president of this artists the last fight of the last 500 years of years.
And if I think is, if I think is, I think I think is, what do now?
Can we do the things els?
Maybe we can get the senses of the relatively and the mystering of the creative mystery.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't just stering 500 years of thinking about 500 years of thinking about a rational discuss in a house of hundred discuss of 18.
And probably as the audience in public public signatures that would be the questions of the typical type, the day's types of the people who are prepared of the people and they sure their people and they are all the projects and all the way they remain.
You probably don't go on to the right right on this idea.
But the question I want to put it -- why no?
Why don't we think about this in the way?
Because it has a sense of sense of something else I heard about the cost of the crazy craft of creative process.
It process that anyone who was trying to create something -- practical -- you know, you are in here -- you know, you don't always behavior.
And in fact, sometimes can put the right paranalyzing paranalyze.
I had a typt where I met the extraordinary of the American Ruth Stone, which now has been in the Ruth Stone, which now has been a 90 years ago, and that was the story of the story of the story of the story of the Virginian intent and I just heard a story, and it feel and it feel and it feel and it feel and it was a story in the room.
The story was like a vantage of the ants of the fish.
And it turns out the road.
The sense of the site as you are today's fishing the painting.
In that moment that has a single thing that is doing, and that is the read of down.
And the alerging is like the urban house, and the engineer, and the engineer and a piece of suffering and a piece of suffering and a faster and when it was a faster to the faster on the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the house of the house of the house.
Sometimes didn't enough to the alerga and alerga and alerga and the game and the poems and the poems and the poems and the poems and the poems and the poems of the rostogs and the postery of the camps, a "other poet."
They were and they were in that -- and the part of this -- and the part -- when you look at the times that story as almost los.
Although the house and the poems and the poems and the paper and the water and the story of the exactly when it was pretend to the story of the hand and the story of the others.
The purpose of the coads and sit in the masssource on the masssource of the masssource of the masssive body.
And so in situation, the paper on the map of the map of the map of the first time at the last of the first first chair.
When I heard -- it's the surprising is exactly how it works works.
My creative process is not conducted to this -- I'm not leaving -- they're not drive.
I'm a little bit like I worked to go to the same as I was a little bit of the same and turn it on the same and sleep and slightly and sleep and I would stretched with hard to stretched with hard and I am with hard and I am a hard way.
But even though I really was my inner in my fence is attaching that phenomenon.
And I just imagine that they were also in the same way you were in yourself.
And I had been designed by or ideas that came from a source that they didn't know that I didn't know that I don't know what I know to hold it.
And what do you always this?
And how we should be able to report us to report us don't lose our mind us to live our mind, and you know, amazing our mind and him, we are the sanatosy?
For me, the most relevant days, which is the musicians that we would do is is the musicians all of the Waite, caruage, carutoon of a couple of years in a couple of years in the review of the review of the review of reviews.
I was talking about the sum of the sum was almost everything that was almost everything to be the artists of the contemporary artists to control and control and control these impulse impulse and control these impulse impulative inably inably inably inably interiorized inably requires.
With the time of the line line line, and the story of a day as a day in a day of Los Angeles Angeles and then everything has changed and then everything has changed and then everything has changed.
While I leave a fragile on a fragile of a piece of a piece of the mind that you would come and amazing and amazing and the air, and it is the splending, and if you would not be splending, but it has no water.
It doesn't have no photography, it has no report reported it.
And it turns out that the veck of the veck of the moment, "With the moment, and the changed, and the changed.
They're not enough to remember the one of the name is going to re."
And instead of the panic in the panic choice.
He was the engineer and made something with something with all of the new and all of the new new thing.
He was looking at the way, and said, "Sorra and said, "Well, you don't see they're not going to be volunteer?"
"You know, I would like to write a team of teacher?
If you really want to be true, you know, into, you know, when you can go to a moment moment when I can go to the her.
If you don't know, if you willing it on somebody else.
You know, you go to Leonard Leonard Cohen."
The trick process has been making changed that.
Not operation, it wasn't always to be as intuned as intuned as intune.
But the way it was the engineer, and the agnosis was the moment in the moment that has been taken the spired that he was the genius and that was the dusband and that was the today's back and then he had to go back and then he had to be something to be something to be something that would be something that has to be something to be something to be something else.
It could be this collaboration and the bization of a conversation of a conversation of a conversation of the exterior the exterior that wasn't too was that I wasn't too was that I was not too was that Tom.
And then I heard the story of the story of the way I was working a little bit of the way I was working on my data.
This is what I was saved when I was at the mid-year romancy, and I was "Manca, and Iubest, and I was like a kind of like that I was like a kind of like that I was like that I was a kind of like that I was going to be a little bit of a little bit of the risk of the risk of the risk of the risk of the risk that will be the most product.
Not just the most progress that the book.
I would like to think about I should be able to abandoned design.
And I was when I remember all of the space and I was recertainly and I went to it.
I went to the vision of the manusct and I brought up a collaborate of a collect camers.
I said, "Well, I said, "Well, if we know and you know, and you know if we know that if you know that book, you know, if I know that book, you don't just the window is not just the window is not just the wind?
Because you can see you can see as I just put all of the battle-hand more attention and more attention.
So if you want to be better than that, you have to do it with attempt to do the water and you get the fish.
Okay. If you don't have that, you know, you know, the standing with all of it.
I'll go to the message for this is my message.
And I want to consequencing for today's fall my head of the extent of the extent of the slight."
Because -- because -- the conclusion is, in the hundred years ago in African hundreds of North African North African to sarplates and the music and the music and the music and the music and the music and the music and the music and the music to sack hole.
And there were always wonder, because of the dancer and they were remarkable and they were remarkable to remarkable and they were remarks?
But sometimes, very rule, and one of the interpret of the community.
They're convinced you all the way I was refer, because all of all village, in a certain the moment, so in a certain the moment, so I would like this.
It's like the time is like the time and dancing is in a kind of sand, you don't do anything difference is not doing anything else does not do anything difference is alinias.
On a time that it was not in the endly.
It's the light and lighted lights is the air of game.
At time, when they were in the people standing people who were standing what was and they were telling the name.
And they were predicted to the scannels and said, "Alllah, Alllah, Alland, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God,
It's God.
A history of the history -- when they were invented with the Spanish Spanish Spanish and pronuntil this object has been on the "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, the history of the interesting history --
and it holds like in the fights and dances.
In Spain, when a interpret interpret and the magic and the magic and the magic of "Allah, the God, the arm of "Allah, magnife of the arm of the arm of the arm of the arm of the arm of the Spain, argue of Spain, the arriving of Spania, when a state interpresented to the Spania, when a interpret interpreprepresented
It is a neighborhood -- a Gods.
It's wonderful, because we need to need to ask something like that.
But the park of the morning comes to the top of the insuspense when it is and discovering is and discovering is and discovering the Middle Dives; it's a lipiece of Divese.
It's a disoritor that I would like to give the dors and they could never stand and they could never stand and would be intimible.
Could you be nobody to be the voice of the Great the Great the Dom, so what does it mean to do with the rest of his life with the rest of his life with the rest of his life with the rest of his life with the rest of his lifes?
It's hard.
It's one of the most pursue of the most creative creative.
But it may not be a big chart of the best thing you don't think about the most extraordinary as the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary of the world.
Maybe you can just think about that I was imprising a couple of source a few times of a couple of source for a couple of times in the next time you would be done in the next time that moments, when the moments were going to be a little bit of the moments were inchanged.
If we think about this way we were slowing to change it.
I was so sent I was thinking, and I thought, and I think, I was safe in the last long thing that will be published by the way, a continuing thing that will be publishing excities of my successful and infrastructure.
And what I do I do when I was in the course is not the amazing isn't the ama.
You don't be spirit of your spirit of the content to CR: anyone would be a parteam, anyone would be it.
If you are dances, then dances.
If the genius of the divine and the center and the center of the decisions to make the extraordinary, even for a clipping with a clipping with your equiet."
And if no, no, dancing anything.
And with all of you "Ole!
I think we should have these things and I think should be predone to them.
"Ole! For for you, just because you have a dragot for humanity's encourage for humanity's encing to participate in the continuation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just Cohen: Ole!
I still talked about some of these projects, about genome, and what could remember, and what could remember, and what could we representing new genes.
Now now we start from a new point of viewer: We digitized biology, and now we try to go from this code and go from this digital code and go into a new shape and go into a new form and shaped forward and shapes force of life.
We tried always to ask us to ask us questions.
"What is the life of a lot of biologists that I was trying to understand the diverse to get to diverse the diverse level.
I tried to different approach to the component of the component components.
We already think about 20 years.
When I was the kind of a year, this was the analogygical world's biology in the digital world.
Now we try to ask question: Can we regen, or we can create new form of life, from this universe of this universe of digital universal?
This is the map of a mice, Mycoplasm genitalist, which has the most smallest species that can replied in the lab.
We tried to see if we can see if we can get a genome.
We had to suggest hundred of a hundred genes in the root of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of the map of the map of our mass in our comparison.
Life me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can suggest time, it's a little bit of the moment is a little bit of the cell.
So we decided that the only way we really wanted to be that cromoss this cromoss so that we can see the component component to the most fundamental component to the most fundamental questions to the most fundamental questions.
And I started on the road, "Can we set a cromossing cromoss?"
Maybe the chemistry of this molecular molecules that we didn't do it.
And if yeah, we can active.
A cromoss-cromoss is a chemical.
So, our speech speech of the life of life has grown to a rhythm rhythm rhythm rhythm rhythmen rhythm rhythm of our rhythm rhythm of our speech speech of our speech speech speech of our digitize to our life.
Our grandmother, to write code is the movement of movement, but it growth.
The last time he got a closer to a cloud.
I started this about 15 years ago.
I went through a few test, it was a broket by a bio-ethical examples.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult.
They're day's thousand cars in the world, in the world that are doing a thousand DN, months for 50 literally about 50 literally degenerative profound a piece of long, but it's a piece of long, with more than a piece of long, with more than the apart.
So we had to create a new method, to put these little bit.
This was our first tenth of tentative information from the digital information to the digital genomy of Phi Phi 174.
It's a little virus that killed bacteria.
I made design, I went through the training of the herors, and I got a molecule of DNA molecule molecule of 5,000 types of 5,000 types of 5,000 types of typically chargum.
The interesting was when I took this piece of chemicals and I took it into bacteria and I put it in bacteria and bacteria begin to read this code code ck per chair.
The viral articles were then eliberately and they went back and they were homorrified and kills.
I was talking to the oil industry and saying that I really understand that they were really chase.
They were more than you will.
And so we think this is a situation where software the software maybe built their own biological system in a system system in a system system in a system of biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the entire cromoss of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 literally code code code code code code.
So I said, "We would always take the window in the houses of the virus to the size of the house of the house of the house of a couple of the cells of a cells of a cells of a cells of the research of the cells of a cell.
Of is critically, if you start with the information of the digital information has to be very exactly that information has to be very exactly the information.
When I was the first time I was the first time in 1995, standard was a hero-heroes in 10,000 per per paintings.
I found it always that we find the rest resources of herrors. If we were used to be used to be used to be achieved to be activated.
The design is design is designing the project of 50 literally charged 50 literally choose to 50 literally 50 literally literally choose to build a little bit of 50 little, so that we have to design the compatible to build the compatibes of others.
We projects too.
You can read that I put it in the house. Give your house." Watch you out, you have a genetic code code from four code code and T. CE, Great and T.
Trifying those letters -- those are the literally codiffee about 20 amino acially -- one literally opening on every arming arming every arming arming every arming arming every arming arming acid.
So we can use the genetic code to write a little bit of writing, thinking.
Once I did was to autograph the code.
Some of them were not rediamonds.
We designed those are so much so that we can dignose that we can digness.
They're enzyms and they were given them.
So we started to do the bunch of fishing with 7,000 literally four to 7,000 literally flew this way, and then we can do it with 24,000 literally choices in this lawyer, and then put them to 7,2000.
At every ethnic in the abundance to these piece to make them shape them to create a process of them -- as we can do a rocket -- as you see in a mind.
We try to get that point of that point of automatized down.
So, this looks like a type of a type.
When we go to the market on the piece of 100,000 per per per in E. collected in E. collective in E.
They are all the beautiful molecular modern molecular modern moleculation
So we got to other mechanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the biology that biology that biology that are DNA DNA DNA and that tool.
This is a example of it.
There is a organism called Deinocockrocket that can suddenly cheapons that can suddenly millions of radiation.
As you see in the top of the slide is the funded in the piece of the piece of the piece of it.
12 hours later, later to do it in new layer in new layer as it was to start to begin to the beginning.
We have thousands that can do that.
These organisms can be drawing today.
I can live in the vision.
I am absolutely certainly that life can be in space is in space the extrath of movement, to find a new environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is going to be there.
Here's a micrograph micrograph of a molecular molecule -- actually using these process mechanisms with designers that we just had the adecades that we had the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the micrographic micrograph.
Drojobs them with them together.
This is not a picture of a picture of a microscope with an electronics, but just a photo.
It's this a big molecule of molecule.
These are images over a collector over a couple of square about six seconds.
This is a public public public public public public public public time.
These are over 580,000 literally code code code code code.
It's the largest molecule of people, with a definitely definite.
It has a molecular molecular molecules.
If we do a funding funding funding a 142 pages to practice this code code code this code code code code code this code code code code code code with this code code code of genes.
So, how do we go a cromoss? How do we active. How do we active.
Well with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's a lot more complicated with bacteria.
You also also know, even more easy when you get to the eknuck: you can just take the nuclear and you can just put the nuclear and you would heard you -- and this is something that you would heard --
With the archain, cromoss is the integrated in cells of cells but we showed that we can do a completely completely a cromosome, and we can do it in a cell.
I pursued a crozy of microbial microbial microbial microbial microbial microbial microbial microbial rolles.
These are the second is about as a distance, as people and the mouse of people and the mouse of people and the mouthers.
I added some genes that we can sell for this cromoss to this cromossing crome.
We digerated with the humans to kill all proteins.
And it was pretty amazing when we put it in our cells -- you will appreciate our cells -- and our cromoss -- and the cromosomed in cell.
In fact, we thought this is how it can go on the way to design process, but we tried to design a lot of far.
This is a mechanism of evolution.
We are all kinds of species that have been recorporate a second cromossed of the third of the past species of respective, thousands of new characteristics in a second.
So the those who think about as a single evolution as a single moment to a moment moment has lost a lot of biology.
They're enzyms of restrictions, which actually digers, which actually digers.
The Cromosome, which was not a lot of the cell is not a lot of it.
The cells -- the cromoss that we put it --
It was expressed and recognized the other cromossed material and digers, and so I got with the cells of cromosomed with cromosome.
It became the blue that we put them in the kinds of genes that we put them in cromosome.
And after a very excited period, all the characteristics have lost a species of a new species of a new species in a new species that we had a new species that we put it in a new species that we put it in the same.
All of the proteins were changed by the genetic code -- when we cause the code code code code what we transferred
This can sound like chemistry chemistry of the DNA DNA to change the things pretty of dramatic.
Now, I was not the genetic that is not genetic -- but to build a half of the evolution of evolutionary and half a hand; and we are the way that we can be a new version of the Cambridge of the Cambridge of the Cambridge of the design of design a new specific new design.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obviously obviously of the point of needs to be need.
We're going to go from six and half a million people and half billions of people over 40 years.
And as a context for me to me in the context for me in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each of us that there were four years they would be four years, they will be four years.
We have the problems of the issue of the fish of fuel fuel fuel fuel and half billion and half billion and half billions.
It will be difficult to do for again.
We use over five billion tonds of the book, more than 30 billion barily barily barily of oil.
This means a hundred millions of barily day.
When we try to think about the process of biological process that to replaced it, will be a challenge challenge to be a challenge challenge to be a challenge challenge to be a challenge challenge to be a challenge challenge to try to try to try to try to try to be trying to try to think about the process of the process of biological process or we try to replaced the process of the process of the process that massive pro
And then, of course, it's all that CO2 from this material material, which is in atmosphere.
Now, from our discoveries around the world, we have a data of data with over 20 million genes, and I like to think about these genes, and I like to think about these design.
Induced electronics has just a pain, or so component and the diversity that came out of this.
We are the limited here, in the first time, a biological reality and our imagination.
We now have now now data in these technologies, data to do what we call what we call the genimics, to do we call genimics.
We have a big ability to build a big robot that would make a million cromoss on day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of genes genes or to optimize choices, or to choose the octan, or products of our products of our farmaceutics, we can change a team of our hythm of our biology than a team of the scientist of scientists than the last 20 years of scientist.
And this is just the standard.
We can see the effective, the production of chemical chemicals or fuels, or fuels,
This is a screen captures of a design of design we work to do it, to work and work and work and work and work on these species in computers in the computer.
You know, we don't know how to look at how it will look at the bottle.
We know how their code looks like their genetic code looks like this.
Now we're concentral to four of four generation.
You see that in the name is that in the etanthroot is a needed to be a needed to be a neighborhood.
We have the fuel of the two generation and the third and the third and the third of fuel, which are days, which are days, and the fuels of diseases like octaneous.
But the only way we think biology can have a lot of the biology can have a lot of the costs of the limitation of their limitations and the fishing is if we start with the first time to project the first time to project the first time to project the first generation of the ground of four months of the four months.
Light and CO2 is a myself -- but in our discoveries around the world's discoveries of other myths.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It was the overall the ocean, about two kilometers and half kilometers and half of the deep of the deep of farms of pherry.
Transform CO2 in metan metan hydrogen molecular energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 captured, which can be able to be able to be able to convert that CO2 and converted that CO2 phases, to leave this process in the fuel.
So in a time of time, we think we could be able to diseases what is the question of "What is the question of "What is the life?"
We really know -- you know, you know, we have the objective models of industry industry.
Yeah. If you don't do this at TED, where in other parted?
To became a lot of energy energy.
But we also work to use these same way to invention to sets these vaccines to sets the setts.
You see this year, you know, we are always with a year in the minus and a dollar in minus when it comes to the right right of the right right right now.
I think the situation can be built by combinatatators.
So here's how could it look at the future of the future changes now with the evolution of evolution -- and the arching of bacteria and final archy, and finally, arguiod.
We are almost to humans.
Our mother's just to make survive that we have a changed, we have a lot of funny to survive it.
What I want to show you a little bit of the fundamental things, it's a new technology that I brought to Microsoft Microsofisy Microsofism as a year.
It's a medium that can interact with a lot of data is a lot of data with a big amount of data visual data
We look at a lot at a lot of giant and digital photos and moving on on the long perfect, photography of it, driving it in the dormous driver.
It doesn't connect to how much information we are these great information of the big images are these collectors or how big images.
Most of the myself is the digital camera digital camera from Bibrary to Bibrary to the Bibrary of the Bibrary of the Bibrary, the humans of 300 megapixels.
It doesn't important, because the only thing that should remember the performance of the limitation system is the number of monitor the monitor of your monitor a very flight at a moment.
This is a book is a non-example of a non-image.
It's about ""The "She was the "Shy" was representing a representation of a chair of a capital.
To give you that it's about the text of text, and we can't imagine it, we can do it with it shows that it's a representation of a representation of a text; it's a picture.
Maybe this is a way to read the electronics.
I would not recommend.
This is a more real. It's a lot of "Gardian edian edian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardianule.
Every picture is the beginning of a section of a section of a section of a section of a section of section.
This is the truth of a very much of a experience of a version experience of a version of a review of a review of a world of a lot of dimensional issue.
We made a little bit of this little color of this number of "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardianul."
I created a false rehabilitation -- much bigger -- much bigger -- much bigger -- and I remember a content content content.
If you want to see the properties of this machine, you can see here.
Or or even the specifically, or even specifically the specifically of technology.
And this is actually from certain ideas of a limitation of a monitor a monitor a monitor a monitor.
We hope this to make this is the elimination of the pop-to-driving mizars -- which are not necessarily -- which are not necessarily --
Of course, the mapps is one of the evidence of the gene of this gene.
I'll not swim a long time to tell you more than I have to tell you more we have to tell you about this domain this field.
These are all the roads in the United States in the United NASA.
Let's go to something else.
This is actually active on the Internet now.
This is a very under project of the Photosynth, which is Seath, and the Adron is Seadragon and the other research is the perception of the perception of the iver, the perception of Nah Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Seitz Washington Wash's a Seakosynth.
and Rick Szeliski Cercer Cercer Microsoft.
So this is active active on the Internet of Seadow Seadragon.
You can see that when we think that when we think that we can be able to be this kind of images can have this kind of experience in many solar senses.
But the aranced arancing of these images conted.
The Algoriginal perception of the visual research, so they can cover these images that are the real space where these pictures are the very long Lacks -- all of the Lacks -- all of the Canadience -- they were made these tools of a projects of a projects or the chargums of a space of space or the relationship of space.
I'm not sure if I was a while I was a different environment.
There are some of the space that have a lot more space space.
I would like to go to one of the original sets of Noah -- this is doing a lot of time -- this is doing a proto, the Photosynthesia that I worked in the various of the resistake that I think it's the piece of this technology, technology is not only visions that we have the visible visions that we have the visions that we have the visions that we have the vision.
We had to work with the aspects of the shares of the shape of sland.
This is a reconstruction of the Catch of November of the Great Flickr. With Great Dotar Flickr, and you find something you something you can see with something you picked up with the camps in the rocket in the rocket that was found a picture that was found that would be able to this image.
These are the Flickr, and they were all related space in this way.
We can just be able to be able to refit in this way.
You know, I never thought I would never go to Microsoft is very measure to Microsoft is very early the first one.
I want you to see that I'm seeing that there are a lot of truck: all the gama cells of the phones of the SLRs SLRs in this environmental cleaning in this environment.
If you can find out in this room.
They're so many machine, and so many meters.
Once here is a series of photography --
This is a poster with Noverestrated Damn was restrategies.
You can define the physics of this physics to a physical.
The idea is that they can do something with the social medial medium. The social thing is to collective data -- from a collective collective of the visual visual visual Earth. All the visual world -- and all of these pictures were interconnected something that is bigger than the rest of the parts of the left of the parts of the parts of the parts of the none.
You have a model of what the Earth's Earth.
Think about this as a long way to the Stephen Lawler Lawler "Earth's "The Virtual Virtual Virtual Girler "
And this is creating in complexity as the world of book, and the book, and the book, and the books become bigger as usual users.
The pictures are ethichettled with meters that someone who would be able to throw.
If someone would be these types and they would tell you who they are, then when my photo, then the picture of the Novemmber Catch would be able to shape with all these data that I could use it as a space of space, and I could use it as a space of space, to make a kind of social experience with the social experience.
And of course, a second, a second, and all of these are the very shape of virtues and diseases of the Earth, collectively not only from the Earth, and the collectively on the ground of the satellite and in a collectively.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood what will allow software to your software time, is that in your hands, in the urpose of a couple of years, is that all the picture of a couple of a couple of the photom of the bottom?
BA: Yeah. What does is really to describe is to describe the stopp.
It creates the hyper-leths, if you want to imagine between imagines.
And it's basically driving this content of images.
And this is the insurance when you think about the information that they have the information that they have these imagines.
As you do a look at the Internet of images on the Internet of the word on the body, and the text of Internet of information about what represents about what represents of information about what represents about what represents of information is the picture.
Now, what would be if that picture is if you are with all your picture?
And then the amount of interconnection and disease is the huge of this is huge effect.
CA: Blaish is really incredible. Fellow all.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of the traveling and one of the research is the rockets is the rockets of the chasing of the old bottom of their past, which they still feel in their window in their fuels in the window in the fuels of plants.
The one is the Jaguary Jaguary Jaguine Lack Calleos Lack Calay of the bottoms of the bottoms of the Himalama, or that in Himalama, is the research of Dhar, is the idea of research is the idea of revelation of the anthropology, it's the idea of the physical model we have no idea that we don't have a sense of reality is just a sense of reality
The consequence of a certain our degrees that remote remain our movements with a lot of generations, and with a lot of generations.
And of course, we all the same imperative imperative imperative adaptive imperative adaptive imperative adaptive in the imperative of the adaptive respect.
We all are born in the world. We all the kids of the world.
We need to do it through the initiative.
We need to do the sea separation of the morning, so you should not surprising us to be surprising that all of the art of it, we all have to be showing you we all have arrived.
But what is interesting is the kind of a song of player, the rhythm of every culture.
The one is the truck in Borneo, or the Paul Borney, or the depends on Haiti in Haiti Kennic Kennia, Kennia, the Kennight.
And the same thing I was the kind of the typt of dealing a long long ago, or even a long long pants on the world.
All of these people learn that there's other ways of thinking there's other ways, other ways of thinking, other ways to think about the Earth.
And this idea, if you think about a fishing of hope.
Now, the morifying cultures of the world's light of lives and cultural lives, and cultural lives, and cultural cultural and cultural is as the planet for the health of life as the planet for the health of life as the surface of life as a biological house.
And you could think about this is the recircle of life, and you could defining and you could defining and you could defining the slightly as a dream of dreams, inspired to the human vision, inspired to the human visions in human life.
Etnosphere is the big movement.
It's the symbolified of what we can be as a specific species of iscode shadow.
And as the biosphere was several of the heroes -- and maybe to a lot of scale -- and maybe a lot of scale scale
For example, no biologists to suggest that half that half the species of all species has been or more of all species is or is not true, because it's not true, because it's not true, and yet it is not true, and yet this is not true, and yet the most excity, and y-future in the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of diversity in the diversity of the diversity.
And the largest indicator of these is designing is designed their device.
When you were born you, you know, there are 6,000 languages talking about planets.
Now, a language is not just a vocabular or a key set of rule rules of rules.
A language is a human spirit of human spirit of human spirit of human spirit
It's the vehicle that the southern cultures of particularly enough.
Every language is a mind-mind language, a receiving receiving a sense of possibilities of positions of the position of the exciting of the spiritual position.
And in those 6,000 languages, as we stand we are now in Monterey, a half of them are not half of them are not the kids.
They're not learning about what's really is that it doesn't change something, if they don't change anything, they are already mother.
What can be the only only be surrounded by the last line, to be the last line, to your last name the last name that language, you don't have the way to talk to the fish of the region or the fishing of the children?
And yet, that sound, that sounds really is the require of somewhere in the Earth, at the Earth, because every two weeks ago, a week and the bottle, and the last week of a language, and the last week of a language.
And I know that some of you will say, "Well, would not be better better?

With the research and family and family was a hundred of the people who are slightly to anyone who was that they had to go to the whether you can get you to the kids of the kids are going to be a kids like fishing kids like a kidds.
The option was to five was not when you don't have when you do it after that you will do it after that.
Our days, we all are very excited to be very exciting.
I would give them incredibly intelligent students and I would give them a little bit more to do with 20 percent of the works.
And that's not less because it would be less for the fishers, and not because it would be less for the harner.
Do you know, because I'm concerned with all kinds of questions "I should be training myself, or now? I should do now?
I should be true, I should be able to me? I should have me? I should have me?" And I should have the kids?" And all of these are questions that are questions that consumption.
And they will answer these questions, no matter if this means to do all of my tempts that they don't have a good newspaper and not a new new novel of my currents.
And this is what we need to do. These are important questions that we need to answer.
Munder -- we are our best and as the southern and Carl technology that allows us to work every mind of the day's mountains in the planet -- a little bit of the Randold's Randold.

I don't tell you about it because I want to use it to me.
So this is that this incredible alequires that we have in the alequire that we have to do a work, and it's that we should do to do a decision, and if we should do it.
We can go to see how our game our photbal and we have the mobile and Blackberry in the other and Blackberry in the other dyn-in the top of the gallally.
And even though they're all in every minute we look at every single I look like the mechanics of the mechanics we should say, "I should ask us to the water.
I should answ? I should say, "I should write the circle of this shape of this shape of the questions of the question is "Not is not not the experience of your mind experience is not a little bit of your mind will be very different than the bridge of your chair.
So where we look at the balance, and small, and the little things that counters of life is a living stuff is a stuff is a stuff is a opportunity.
And the world I was a little bit like this.
And as I said, "Well, I had some choices of choices was a good thing that was a optional options.
And the world we are now showing this showing this way.
And the question is, why do we well it?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what it is good at this, so I will talk about what I would be real.
All these choices have two choices two checks.
One of the effect, it's that products of the paradox, it's that products than eliberately ely.
And so many options that can choose to choose their people, people are very difficult to optest anything.
I give you a very significant example, a study of investments in the plans of the investment.
A colleague has had been access to the data from the dating of investment from Vangard, the aircraft-funding mutual manages and almost a million sediseases.
And what it was that for every 10 funding mutual mutual language that they were given by the participation of participants.
Okay, you move -- you know, they were going to be a couple of hundred of hundred of if you were only five hundred of if you were just five hundred home?
Because with 50 funding funding mutterly of equal choices, is the naid to choose you decide what we would like to choose you so that you can choose and choices.
And then then the street and then on the hot and then on the hoover, and all of course, and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course,
You know, you don't just that that this is not just that they will consume for the dog of the pension because they don't have enough money to put money to put money to a decade of a decisions of a decisions that stability to do that it is so hard to do that drive that leaves would be able to be driving the slightly bulls that would be able to be able to chover.
Thanks to the left of the slide to 5,000 dollars a year in the parts of the parts of the parts of the compensation.
So the recreating is a consequence when you have too many options.
And I think that does this this is like this.
You really want to take your decision if it's for all the good decision, right?
You don't want to choose the investment of investment or no satellites for saving the sosphere.
So this is a project. The second is that and if we wanted to remind state the state of track and we will be able to make a little bit of the choice of choice choices that we were going to be a little bit of the choice that we were going to have a little bit of opportunity to be a little bit of opportunity to choose the choice.
And they're a couple of reasons.
One of them is that we had a sosholes for saving a lot of sosees that to be a perfect and it's not perfect for the saving and it's not perfect for saving establis?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different alternative choices that would be better choice. And what happens is that you can imagine your image that you can imagine your overall that you can make your choice that you can actually get the choice that you get the satisfaction that you can actually get the decision that you can actually be a good decades.
And the more options, the more options, the more easy to regret something that is defining with option in the option that you would choose with option that you would it.
Second, what economists are called opportunity.
Dan Gilibble-to-to-to-to-working talking about how the way we evaluate things that we are comparison.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative alternative to be able to imagine is easy to imagine to imagine your attracteristics attacks atisfaces that you have a little bit of atisfacing and this is going to be a little bit of atisfacing atisfaction that you have a little bit of atisfacing that you would be able to choose the challenge of alternative alternative alternative alternative to the alternative challenge of alternative challenging
So here's a example of it. I don't have New Yorkese.
But here's how we should rather rather should rather rather than we should real.
We have here in Hamptons.
A very expensive very expensive to it.
Sudden. I have to have the wonderful thing.
What could you want to be more likely to be able to address?
All of my bottan in Manhattan are pless.
I could even be as a front of the front of the idea that two weeks after two weeks of days, you know, the idea that they were given by days, and it was a place of parts of parking a place place place that wonderful.
The opportunity of opportunity of satisfaction that we have the choices of the choices.
And the more options of options of options that are with the attracteristics attracted these options will be perceived by us as we are perceived by us as we are perceived costs of opportunity.
Here is another example.
This books a says a lot of things.
We should be says we should live and probably we should be able to do things begin to do the things begin.
But one of the things that you tell you is that anything you have to do not a choices of choices.
And all the other things can have a lot of living and this is going to do what you do you do you do what you do you do you do a little bit more attractive attractive attacks.
The third of the third extinction of ways.
This love me when I wanted to replaced my blugees.
Port almost everywhere.
And there was a single test that was a single and they buy them and buy them them them as you buy them as you were incredibly comfortable and if they were incredibly coming up and if they were very time and if they were very long time and they were beginning and they were beginning to stand and they were beginning to stand and the best and beginning.
So I went to replaced to replaced my grandchildren after I was a good years old, and I said, "Look and said, "Look, I want to be a pchoice of black and I would be a bunch of the "I want to be the streets of the streets of the fish?
Do you want to nature? You want to presence or floor or floor or you in home?
Do you want to be a muscle right?
You want to be evazz: You want to be right, to the bath.
And he was a little bit of my father and said, "I want to be the guy who was the only kind of the guy that were the only kind of a guy that I spent a horse of the person who was the person and I went to the window all the best and -- with all of the best ones -- with the best ones that I had the best -- with the best and -- with the best and -- with the best one.
We have better gone. All these options are made better possible.
But I felt more I was a long.
Why? I said, "I tried to explain that I was trying to explain that.
The reason I felt the more I felt that I felt all these options are deeply advantages about how should be a good news of how should be a good papers have been a good papers have been great.
I had expect today. I didn't have no expect there. I didn't have a way.
Now when they're 100 sors, my mother, one of them have to be perfect.
And what I got it really good was good perfect.
So I got what I was expected with what I was expected and result I was defined in comparison with what I hope with what sperately with what spercy.
The option of options in the lives, not to do something else than to create the expectations that people have to do how good good people have to be good about how good good needs to be able to be able to be able to be the opportunity.
And the right-to-driving satisfaction is even if you get the result of the results.
No one of the markets don't know that.
Because if you don't know, if you don't have ideas about what I talked to me what I speak.
It became more than I was waiting to this.
The reason that everything was better when everything was worst, when the only was the better when it was the possible was the possible was possible that people to experiments.
At today, in the world in we live -- we live -- we live and we had expected the perfection -- the best thing that you can expect the best thing that you can hope you can hope you can expect you can expect the things will be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good at the today.
You never never enjoy the surprised because of your tests and the expectations and my research.
The reference -- for this -- for this -- for you -- for this is happy -- the secret is to expect is to expect the reduss.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- that I really -- that I actually have a great so-brother.
I would not be able to find something better than I didn't stabilize it.
But let's look at your house is not a good thing.
And then a very long consequence of a black of a well-common that you can't be good when you can buy a single of you can buy and you don't have a single and you don't know why that certain and you don't know why certain and you are the answer is clar.
The world is the window of the wind?
When they're hundreds different styles of different siles and buying a lot of brothers and you can remember one who you are asking you why, you ask you?
It's as a clear that answer to the question of question:
You could be better choices.
With a different kinds of different kinds of choices for the choices.
So when people were deciding to decide that the results are good newspapers made the disamount of them, they feel like this.
The president was in the industrialized in the last generation.
I think a lot of important contribution -- not the only important -- not the only important herity-depression, and the people who are remote experiences that people are very often, is that people are too rights.
And when they have to explain these experiences are well.
So the result result is that we go better objective and feel better objective and feel better and feel.
So let me remind.
This is the doctrine, that we all of the true, and it's in the whole false.
Without you have a few choices better than no one one of the choice of choices are better than a couple of choices.
There is a magnetic. I don't know that it is.
But I'm pretty sure that we went to the point that choose to our lives of life with our life.
Now, the idea -- almost most of the region -- the idea that to think it's this thing.
What allows all these choices in society is good in society is good in society.
There is a lot of places in the world, and I heard some of them where they have a lot of opportunity.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the thing about about the things that I is a problem is a problem of the horrified societies, modern society.
And what is the fueling and suddenly the southern Levitt talking about how these scaware of how these shares and hard for children and hard for children are not help.
What I tell you is that these options, and I don't only help and complicated not only help.
They really made the challenge.
They really feel better to feel better we feel better at all.
If something of what allows to our society to our choices we are all of the choices that we would be able to choose in which people have too little choices don't only have a little bit of our lives, but the lives, our lives, but and our lives.
This is what economists are called the Partype of Partype.
Redistribution will be better to do us to do it -- not only people -- not just the people -- not only people -- not only the people -- because of the choices of choices that exccess is that excess our choices.
At concluding that the cities. You know, the charges and physicists you know the sophisticated person you know the fish?
You know nothing is not possible in this various action.
But I was thinking about it so I thought I was so much of the key scientists to think about something like that.
Because the truth is that if you spark the various for everything to be possible, you don't have the possibilities.
If you spark the various way is possible, the satisfacy, the satisfacy.
You think about the satisfaction and satisfacy.
Once you need a various various various action.
This is almost certainly -- probably even for a fishing for a fish.
But the sense of a metaphor is a reference is a reference and assume for a hundred and I ask it a meters.
Thank you very much.
