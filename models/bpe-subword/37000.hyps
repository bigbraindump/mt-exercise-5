Thank you very much of it will be a lot of it goes on a lot of it.
Last year, I did a introduction to LHC.
And I promised to go to and give you a data about how it works on how it works on how it works in the way.
So the ife of the massive that didn't have been here, the largest experiment that was the largest experiment that was tried to 27 kilometers -- Ciruminum Streme is to be able to do the Skie, or is to more power to more and less than a billion times on the ground of the universe -- the mild million times on the size of the universe.
It's extremely true.
This is the apart of the Geneva.
We are making photographs "Big Bangs" in the interior of the decades.
I work on this one. It's called the ATLAS -- Lungim, the TLAS -- Lungoriginal fourth of the A.I. It was building spectacular to build the ATLAS in building to build the proportive.
On the year 10 seven, I began to the first year.
And this picture was made by ATLAS.
He caused a huge cost of control.
It's a picture of the first fascycles that the quality of the intreatment of the system in the system of the HC, and thorder of the HC, though they deliberators in the HC, though it was deliberators in the deliver.
In other words, when I was seen that I saw that this image of the 10 several of the work, which is a huge successful thing.
I don't know if I don't know that the largest over, or that was going, or while Google and seeing that the first state of the way.
It means that I did a cultural impact on the impact of stiintified impact.
After about a seven, I had a problem with a problem with the problem with these fields -- these fields -- these fields -- these fields of aurt.
Those are the transsportation of the 13 thousands of maximum works in power of maximum and the maximum of maximum
Now, the engineers in the room, and he said, "I can't transsport the attackers. They're myself as well."
But I can do that for the time when I'm at the temperatures are getting a superconductor.
So as a 271 degrees of the street between strength states can transport those states can transport these are these kinds of strength.
On one of the country between 9,000 of the country in LHC, was a fabricatic fabricative.
So the company was intried to be a little bit of a book, and the resist of electricity.
This was the results.
This is more impressing to the magnetic field of the magnetic chairs over 20 tons, and they are almost 30 chasse.
So we deteriors of the 21st century magnetititise.
We had to take affair, what we were doing.
I reconceived it all over there, I repair.
And now we go back to the magnetish back in subteran.
Pana marton of the big state of the HC will be as new as new as well.
We're going to go back again, and we have to get to get to the iulium or hiuly, and we're going to keep the research to find the rest of the universe.
Now, of course, that in a way, those are those are those reopen discussions of the important and engineering and engineering to the extreme to rejection to break it.
I think of the fact that it's so difficult to be so hard to the fact that we have inal to experiments like HC.
I'm going to lash the words of a words of a stify of the Britisphrey Davy, when I think about the protection, when the protection, he said, "Nothing is not more dangers, he said, "Nothing is more dangers, and he said, "Nothing is that we don't have the paper to our southern our same, we are not finisherself are not finisheriting our lives are finisherits, as we are not finisheriting our world."
Thank you.
I want to start with the roughly remember to remember to play with kiars, when you play with board, when you play with the board.
On the massive to learn how to live them to get them up, and they take them and go to the colo, in fact, and to figure out how to figure out how to figure out the relatively intelligent and the relatively intelligent relatives.
The space is the space is the profound is a big deal with how we understand a lot of the world conjudgment.
So when we can get the research of IT inspired by this useful interactions with our physical objects -- I impreme with my consultant, my collaboratory -- my father Kalana Kalana -- I begin to the computer digital funny that we can use a computer of the mouse that realize that it would be able to be done in the mouse of the mouse that we realize whether
So how do we want to think of our wall?
And this was the question was so fascinating I decided to ascinate the answer to the answer building Siftable.
In short, a Siftable computer is a computer is a computer of a bisure.
They can be manufacturing their used to be perceived and they can perceive the food of one eats and a reless.
The most important is that there are palpainful, you can miss them as just as well as just appropriately appropriate it.
And Siftables of a new equipment of a new equipment of the digital manipulation of digital manifts.
On the massive that these instruments become more constants of their miscing constants to each other, and constantly our active activement of our interactive active and degrees of interactions.
I will start with a few simple examples of simple examples.
This Sift-Sift-presented is configuring video including the software in a direction, if the philosopher to the other size of the air.
These interactive interactive are constantly constantly one of the other.
So, if I put them on the other other other people, it becomes interested in the interest.
If I'm confusion, and they can become confusions and then they can become confusions.
And I can also feel the miscing and incline.
We realized that one of the interesting interactions of interactions is that we can use the interactions is that we can use to manipulate the snam of a lhidden culture of how we could be a lhid.
In the case of this, we have three Siftables configured as the galets and they can use them to be able to amestate them in the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the case of this case in the case of this,
If we seven, we can actually turn into the inades in the inades.
There's also interesting possibilities for education, like education, like education, and like the mathematical and logical and logics to try to see things that we want to see things that we want to see the results of the results of the results of the results of the results.
So here -- this is a Fibonacial of the equatic equatic program.
So here we have a game of combination of combination and a kind of combinator and Boggle.
Finally, every single taste a literally literally in the intimate of the intimate that they try to form the massive words, are the greatly and they are verified with a dictionary.
And then after that, after 30 seconds of the literally set of the literally smart of the literal literle, and we can get new possibilities of research.
Thank you.
These are the children who came into the expensive Labs came to the Media, and I was trying to move them a material and movie.
I loved it to the negate of the negs.
And one of the interesting of this kind of apply applies are not that we don't need to give them a lot of instructive.
All of you have to say, "For the bad of the word, and they know what to do.
There's some other people try to get a few people tried to them.
This is the most tanar there, play in our right.
It seems like everything that he wanted to do was to put it was to put the Siftable.
So for him to him the bottom.
This is a interactive application of interactive animates.
We wanted to build a top of the people who invest languages.
And this is the Felix.
He can get new personal new personal stages in the stage of the Siftables that affects that affects the characters.
Here are the sounds of soar.
Video: Starks of the race.
David Merrill: Now he went into a stage.
Video: The Tractor the portop.
Very goo! Yeah!
And Siftable, and assembling and assing one can do the characters of the interaction can make the characters -- Video: Ham!
DM: I create their narrative.
Video: Heh!
DM: It's a final story, and he decided to open how it will it fashim to drawl.
Video: The cyclico: The cycle.
DM: The last example I showed you to show it is a time to show the instrument music is a live music that Siftables I built the role of sounds like Siftables and all the sounds of sounds like and yellow sounds like the rhythm,
Each of these four different variation has four different various roughly choose to use it.
And you can inject sounds in a successful thing you can assembled you can assemble.
You are the sound that are touched the sound of sound sound of sound like a Siftable Siftable Siftable Siftable Siftable to troops --
There are effects that you can control the live, like the movie.
Here you can put a certain sound and then include it sounds to get it out of the hell and then it was includes.
It makes the general effects like the tempt and the volume that applies the Second to see.
Video: We're going to start with a second rhouses in the second of Siftables them in a series, I arrhythm, we have in a series, and we have rhythmen just, more and more accurate in the Video:
Now I put a line.
Video: Now I add a little bit of percup.
Video: And now I'm going to add the movie, and now to control the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the Videotots.
Video: I can be including including including including including in a part or in one side or in one side or in other.
Video: Now I'm going to atask the movies of the base of the expression.
Video: I can do the section of the section of while the amount of time as the amount of time.
So I don't have to do the plan, I can improvision or months of the window or melodia in the window in the window in the winner of the window in the winner I don't have to do the plane of the planet in prealing the plane in prealely not to improve the planet in prealten, I can't improvide the plant, I can improved, I can im
Now, in smart smart including the including of the Siftable's using the Siftable-volume, inclined in the stangle of the volume, inclined in the stanga.
Thank you.
As I can see my passion is creating new interfaces of new interfaces that are farms that works more and the body, and the body.
And today, I had time to show a coordination of this new space, and a space, and a few of the possibilities that I was trying to take them out of the lab.
The Gand's who I would retine, is that we are in the new generation of the new generation of the instruments of instruments of the digital world that will bring our new world.
Thank you very much.
I have been highly with you to talk to you all all of you all all the way to talk to you all the way to talk to you all the way of work.
They're written writing.
He wrote my book, but it is, of course, it is, of course, it is more than that.
It's all my love and fascinates and fascinating.
And I don't have the slide to change the time.
But these are the kind of like that was kind of strange was intamed in my life, and in my career, and in my career, and he determined me of my work, and I was in the worker.
And the strange thing I wrote this book, this book, this autobiographer, "Manca, Rohar, Rohar, and Ilove to the world to deal on the world for the world to be a kind of method, and became the important mega-sensitive mega-sensitive mega-sensities of international mega-sensitive mega-sensitive the international world.
The resident is that the people are trying to treat the home of the parts of the parts of the condamner.
Seriopped -- condamnature, condamnaturedamnaturedamnaturedamnaturedamnaturedamnosed Serioio,
All of you to the ingriving and say, "Do you don't say, "Do you are not that you can never be able to depass you could never depass the performance of that?
Do you don't have the theme that you will go to write your life is going to write a book that time, a book that they ever put a book that ever be?"
It's very line, indeed to truly it.
But it would be more runs if I would have been remember 20 years ago, when I was starting to be a great time when I was starting to become a bunch of the same thing, I was like to become a kind of reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive on a frick of the same thing.
And people said, "Do you know, it's not that you have never been so successful for success?"
I don't think of the humilination will kill you will kill you will kill you will kill you to kill the idea?
Do you don't have the front of your life in this field and nothing that you will never be hundred and not going to be the dream of the spot of the center of the center of the screen of the essential gurger?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the answer to all those insights on all of those insights is "Yeah, I me."
Yes, I think it's the theme is the theme of all of these things.
And always the always of course was always stand up.
And I mean, it's in the insize of the other things that people can't fit in the hundred things that are not intuition.
As a big example of the big examples that are infruit are infruit are infruit
But when I talk about written about written the thing I was all thinking about what I was all asked in the last time is "Why?"
Is it something rational rational rational of it?
It's like everyone is to take the way to be the funny that they feel like they feel like they feel like it was in this Pamant.
And what is that that is so specific initiatively that seems like non-by-sanitation that other mental teachers are not in a way that other professionals don't do it?
My father, for example, was the chemist and not remember that was 40 years old, he remember 40, if you were assessment to be a chemical engineering to be a chemical engineer.
Do he was not -- John, how do you go with the chemical engineering in the chemical?
It's just not just not just happened to be intamed to something.
But to be syncerized, the engineers, they didn't have too couple of the century of the century of the century of the reputation of the repression.
We write a writers, and we have this reputation, and not only writors, but the artists of all kinds of all kinds of all kinds of the labeled of the labeled of the labeled memories of the labeled of the labeled of insanitors insanitors insanitors insanitors, and we have this reputation of the reputational reputational reputation, but the artists of the artists of all kinds of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the
And all we have to look at the number of the software the number of morning of the software in the 20th century, and they died in the mind of young people, and open.
And even the same thing that they didn't seem to be really honest to have the paper strength of the talent talking about the talent talk.
Norman Mail, even involved in the last interview, he said, "Each one of my book, he knew my books a little bit more than my book."
A extraordinary massive mountain your work,
But it doesn't even even when we hear when we hear someone says, because we heard these things that we heard these things so that we heard about some of the risk and suffered and suffering and suffering and suffering the art of the inherently enough to hurban art and as art to the suffering.
And the question I want to ask it today I want to all to do it is it is, are you with this is: Are you with this idea?
You are comfortable to comfortable with it, because the light of the light of the light of the light of this ipotts.
I think it's odiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodies.
And I also think it's dangerous and not seeing to see it dangerous.
I think it's better if you incurate our artists to live the marks of artists to live the marts.
And I know that my safety of my situation -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to me to me to the carry of this iposter, essentially of this ipost, especially in which I find the professional teachery that I find the professional.
As a pretty example, I just have a 40-year-old 40.
I also also also also have four decades before the mountains.
And it's very likely that everything I will write the moment to be judgment as a judgment, the successful thing that came out of my last successful career successful neighborhood?
What would be saying to me to say the farms, because of the friends here are already -- it's very likely to be a successful way of me to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to say the farming the farming farming the farming farming the farmers of the mention ft falls of the samples of the men, because of course is probably the fends of all the successful fishers,
Oh, I hope of Gand: What gand!
This is the kind of gold someone who could do the call to the way to get the hour to the 9th of the morning, and I don't want to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person could do the kind of gold and that person could do on someone who could do on the body, and that could make somebody on the hundred of someone else in the hundred of the chassslick of the case of the gutter of the garden and
I think I can do this message that I love my message that I love love.
And then the question becomes indeed, right?
And so I seem to look at a lot of meditative that we have to work on the right now, to go to the written is through the kind of building psychological buildings that we are kind of a protective, right?
I have to find out of a way, to find a way to find a way to say a distance, and I wrote a distance, and my them, and my them, and my them, and my theory that will be able to do it.
And as I was looking for the last year of this year, I started to get back to the time, and I tried to find other societies if you could have other societies of how we could have more and more and more sanitored people creative.
This is this research has been to Greece and Roma and Roma ancient of the ancient and Roma and Roma is a recident of this ancient me of this recircle of this meaning me to the recircle.
So the urse, the couple of insight is called the couple of insight.
But at the time Great and the Rom, and the Rom, and the creativity of the human internal invention, okay?
People believed that creativity was a spirit of the helps that are able to inside of a source and unfortunately, and unfortunately, and unintelligent and needed to understand the neighborhood.
The Great these spirit comes from creativity of creativity with the faim, "I demonstrate "More" "More"
Socracy was the fact that he thought it has a department in the intelligent of the shape of the spring of the departs.
The research, and they were the same parents, but they call it the creative, genius of the creative, genius of the genius of the rule of the rule of the same anothers,
What is wonderful, because the romans, because the romans, because a genius was a genius was a genius of the individual individual and the window of the work.
I thought of a genius was kind of a divince of magics of the botttom, which was a way of the wall of the gut, and he said, "Dobbut, and insession and insissue and insession of the work, and the insession of the work, the model of the work, the brain result of the work,
Absolutely strallowed -- this is that it's distance, which is that we were talking about the result of your work, which is the result of your works.
And everybody knows that that this work, right?
So the artist was protected by certain things like this, like for example, like too much narcism, right?
If you could have the stralos, you couldn't have been so forth, you could all the world as you have the story of the same, you know, the square helped you to help.
If you was criticize was not completely criticize that was not like that?
Everybody knows that the genius were pretty much like ignorant.
So people look at the West creativity for a long period, and they have a long time.
And then came back and everything has been changed and all the way of idea, the idea of the big idea, the big idea that the big idea in the universe like the individual universe and mysteries and the mysteries that they get order to creatures that they get the discoveries that they get the divinced the ord of divincing the digital Ren.
It was beginning to the rational rational, and people are beginning to create that creativity of the individual internal internal internal internal internal of the individual beginning,
And for the first time, people are starting to get people begin to one or one of the artists of the gardens, instead of the genius of the genius of the genius of the genius of the neighborhood.
And I have to march, I think it was a huge heroes.
Permyth person to create as a simple person or is actually received as it is actually received the speed and the source and the source of mythernal mysternal hands, and the fourth of the home.
It's like you would have a little bit of a so-bita so-bita so-button.
It's just a simple incoctle's involved in the form of equipped all these inimaginably inimaginable inimaginable insights in the performance.
I think that the pressure of the artists of one in the last 500 years of the last 500 years old.
And if I think is true, and I think is, and I think that is, what do we do now?
Can we do things els?
It can turn to the sensitive sensitive of the relationship between the brain mystery of the creativity.
It can not.
It can just not just to stand in simple of human beings of human rational thinking, in a discussion of a hundred years of a hundred minutes.
And perhaps that are in the audience that would ask the questions of the intissue stained on the table people in fact, which is actually the people prepared people in their own prisoners.
I probably will not be cooperating on all of this idea.
But the question I want to put it on the -- why no?
Why don't we think of that?
Because it has as much as any of the kind of sense of something else that we heard the completely inner of the creatively inner of the creative.
The process that anyone who are trying to create something -- I mean, all the people are always -- I know everyone -- I always have always been always behavioral rational reach.
And in fact, sometimes can put the right side of the paranormal.
I had a research where I had a story where I met the American poet American poet American Ruth Stone, which now has been poetry that was poetry, and that was posted to be the poster and that when he was a story to work on the board and feeling the rock of the camp.
The story that was like a val various village of the air.
And they pravavaling the room.
And I think of the comes to the paper slightly willing the painting.
And that moment that he has a single thing that has a single thing, and that is the reading is that the apattack like the appropriate of the garden appears like the kinds of doing it.
And the algorithms of the house to the house of poem, and the insight of the map of the map of the hard of the map of the hard fast, then when he went through the map of the map.
Sometimes was not enough to be a quick and alerge, but it was not in the house, but it doesn't get the rostood and the bottom and the poems of the room, and the book, and the book, and the poetry, a poetry, a poetry, a poetry.
They were also also in the moments in the parts of this -- and the part of the story -- when the story of that story is almost loss of the bonds of the broad.
One homework, and the poems and the poem, and the water and the water and the water and the story of the same story as the other ones and the story of the others.
The first person of coads and then in the body, and then in the map of the map.
In this situations, the poems of the map of the map, but the first perfect of the first time at the first first of the first first of the first first time.
When I heard -- it's over, it's exactly how my own creative.
My creative process is not limits to do it -- I'm not drive the -- I'm not drive the process of the creative process of my creative process of my creative process of my creative process is not my creative process is not a creative process not limits of creative process not runs limits of creative not limits to leave the source of creatiative not drive the gut.
I'm a catching and the way I was working on every day to go to every day and turn to the same transport and smart me and slide me and stand back and live on the hard and stand back to the hard and stand up to stand in a hard way.
But even I really mean, in the indark of the touch of that phenomenon that phenomenon.
And I mean that they were also also in many of you,
And I was also also came to anothers who came from a source that they came from a source that I know that it doesn't know to be identify to be identify to be identify and I had been forward.
And what does it all of that?
And as it turns out that we should not lose our to go to the mind, we don't lose our minds, and we lose our sanity?
For me, the most relevant of our days, which is what we can do is how we can do is how Waits, the carued of the Waits, the carued of the review, in the brain in the brain in review.
I was talking about this subject was almost all of the contemporary artist of the contemporary artist of the contemporary artist and find the initioned and field these impulses of involved.
With the time of the line of the line story, and you can take the autopic on the autop to Los Angeles Angeles Angeles and then everything has changed it.
And as a fragment, from a short fragment that they hear in a piece of the piece of the piece of how they are inspired and the inspiration of the inspiration and the time, it's not to be able to her, but it doesn't get to it, it happen.
It doesn't have no matter has no creations, it doesn't have created, it has no report report to the reportofon.
I mean, that the old of that the old anxiety of the anxiety of the moment, and this is going to be the money to always the montal for all.
I'm not good enough to receive the good thing is going to rece."
And instead of the panic in the painting, just stopped out.
He reached the process of the process and made it all the new and all of the new and all of the new thing.
He wanted to take the watching and said, "Sorry, don't see that I'm not seeing as I'm not to see that I'm not at the volance?"
"Do you seem like I could write a them?
If you really want to be really inars in a moment of a moment of you, when I can get me to you.
If you not, and if you can do it on somebody else today.
And I can reach it it to Leonard Cohen."
And the process of creative process has changed this.
Not operating on the opera has continued to be as intuned as intunnel.
But the process of the inside, and agged around his hand around the moment in the moment that he took the hope that he took the kind of says, and he gave him and he gave them back to the room, and he gave them to come to the charge of the Chinesiorize and Chinesiorized and Chinesiorized and the charge of interiorize and forward.
It could be this collaboration and bizarre and bizarre and bizarre and the exterior of the exterious that was not too was like like Tom.
And then I heard the story of the story I started a little bit of the way I was working and already had been working on my data.
This approach to me when I was in the middle of the middle "Manca, Rots, and I love the kind of same, and when we all were working on something that we all were going to be able to think of all the process of the process of the product and incept it will be the most product that will be the risk to be the most product that risk you ever wouldn't be the risk to be the risky written time.
Not just provided that, but the most of the book going.
I was trying to think of me should be able to think of the projection of the project.
And then I remember all of my speaking space and I tried and tried and tried to her.
I went to my view my view on the manuscripped and I brought a collapse.
I told with your voice voice and I know that "Asca, and you know that if you know that the book is not just the extraordinary doesn't just come to my book will not only be the same, right?
Because you can see you like me one to see the batay all I put on the batain and more than that.
So if you want to be better than that, you have to be more than you have to do the size of your own and make the parts of your work.
Okay. If you don't have to do that, you know, the naid's naid.
I'm going to keep written because this is the message of my message.
And I want to consign for today I did my park side,
Because -- the Conclusion is, in the hundreds of years ago in the world of North African people who are bringing people to get the bad of the races and the music and the music and the music and the sack of the rack and the music and the sack of the race of race,
And they always have always wonderful because the dances, and they were remarkable to remarkable and they were remarkable to do it?
But one of the ones of intample, and one of the interpreted and one of the comes from the common of the common bear.
I'm convinced that you all know what I mean, because everybody else sees like all the time, in a certain interpreted moment, so that we are so interpreted by interpreted it.
It's like like time stops stops and dancy is in a kind of opposite open silk is not different, the other 1,000 served in the same way of alinias, everything else is alinias.
And then in a time time of being in the third of the truth.
It's the lights of the interior and light is the divinced of the divincing divincing of the divincing of the divinced of the divinced of lights are lighting lighting lighting lighting lighting lighting lighting lighting lights and lighting lighting lighting lightened light.
And when they were time when they were intamples in people stand in they were and they said the names were and they said called the name.
They also have the maintained and scanners "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, the God,
It's God.
A historical historical historical -- when they have invented the Spanish and the pronounced of the century of the century "Allah, Allah."
and they hear the time in the field and the dances.
In Spain, when a interpreted interpreted and magic and magic magic and magic and magic archair, the God, the archair, the arm."
It understood -- a farmed of God.
It's wonderful, because we need to need something like we need to need a little bit of it.
But the part of the second of the morning, when the immediately dancy of the insuspect is and discovering is not a lipiece of Divin.
It's a dirital disease that I would be able to be able to do the kind of drive and also the intimate of intimate and intimate it always could also be intimate to be intimate in the intimate of the disease of the dirital disease that is a disease that is a discovering disease that I can be a disease and a delivers that are also also and they could never hurt the disease
Could you be able to not more invoice of the name of the name of the name that he would be able to do it with the rest of his life that he should be able to do the rest of his lifespect?
It's hard.
It's one of the most of the most painting in the brain creative.
But it can't be a big key to be a big charge if you don't believe that the most extraordinary parts of your most extraordinary interior.
It can just if you create that you were creating a little bit of an inimaginable to imagine a few times of a few times of the splend-time time time time when it was inside of the ones were getting more than otherwise they invested the moments of something.
If we think about this, all of us begin to change it.
I was so smart to think of the pursuit in the last months of the last months that will be published to be published to be published to the excessive and infrution of my favorite successful and infruit of my successful and my favorite successful and my successful father successful and so successful and so I was begin to think of the successful thing.
And what I was looking at when you lose the courage is the current is not the theme is the theme is the theater.
It doesn't be the spiracy of the Continual Continual Count of the continy, anyway.
If you are if you are if you are the time, then if you were
If the divine genius and excess is repair decisions that are repair, even for a very extraordinary effort of your effort effort in your effort effort in your effort effort in your effort efforts and "Ole!"
And if no, no, if you can do anything.
And with all of this "Ole!" for you.
I think in these things and I think we should predame.
"Ole!" for you, just because you have a love dragos and simply for the human participation and incapitation to participate in continuation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We still talk about some of these projects, about the human genome and what could represent new genes of new genes.
Now begin from a new point, in fact, we are now digitized biology, and now we're trying to get the code and try to get a new flipping and sychrl and synthesizing and synthesizing the form of life.
We tried to ask us to ask questions.
"What is the life life is something that I think many biologists have tried to understand diverse levels.
I tried to different approach to the life of the component of the basic components of the basic components.
We already already already for about 20 years.
When I was a kind of seven, this was the killed world in the world of the world world world of the digital world of the computer world.
So now we try to ask question: Can we can create new form of life life forces of the living, from this universe of the universe of the gital?
This is the map of a small organism of a genitalists that has the smallest genome for a species that can reply the only one in the lab.
We tried to see if we can come to see if we can come to a genome and small.
We were able to get the order of a hundred hundreds of the 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map, it's pretty simple metabolic is pretty simple to us,
Right? This is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can suggest at a time, it's less likely to produce a little cells are probably able to produce a cell.
So we decided that the only way before we actually have to send this cromoss so that we can see this cromoss so that we can see the component questions.
And so we started on the catch, "Can we see, "Can we started a cromoss?"
Can can be the symbol of these molecules that we ever did not ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever made it before?
And if you active cromoss a cromoss?
A cromoss, by the way, is just a piece of chemical material.
So, our speed speed to digitize the life of a rhythm of the exponential.
Our open to write code to write code is moving enough movement of the beginning, but it growth is growing.
The last time has come to a close to a exponential curve to a close.
I started this is more than 15 years.
I went through a few ethaper, I actually start a bio-ethical examination before the first experiments before the first experiments before the first experiments of the experiments of the experiments of the experiments of etaphapped through a few equapped through a few equapp, began to the inside, I was starting to be a few ethaps, begin the income come insights in the inner of the bio-ethical exper
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult is very difficult to be very difficult.
There's thousands of machines in the world that are doing small joines of DN, months of DN, but it's a process of the degenerative process of building a piece of hermen to more erapart.
So we had to create a new methods to put these little bits of small pieces together, and so correctly all of the herrors.
This was our first tentation of our tentative data from the digital data, to the Phi of Phi 174.
It's a little bit of bacteria.
We did design design, we went through the corectle, we went through the herrors, and we got a molecule molecule molecule 5,000 literally literally fun.
The interesting interesting came out when I took this chemical material and I put it in bacteria and put it in bacteria and started to read this genetic code and produce the game of viruse.
The viral papers were then eliberated and they turned out the cells and they turned out the cells and they were human-to-humans and they were hundreds of the virtual cells.
I was talking with the oil industry and slightly oil and such as I understand that this model.
They ran them more than you,
And so we think this is a situation where the software in which software in a system in a system in a system in a system in a system in a system in a system of the map.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the entire cromoss of a cromoss of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 literal code of code code of genetic code.
So we said, "We were to put the walls in the house of the square in the house to understand the neighbors that are the same component of a cells of a cells of a cell.
Of is critically, if you start with the digital information in the computer needs to be very exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly exactly the exactly the exactly the information is critical critical critically, that is critical critical is critically, and if you start with the information is critically, if you start with the digital information is critically, that information is critically, that information
When I was the first seven, this kind of seven, the first standard of the precise was a heroes in 10,000 walls the wall.
I found it, I found it, 30 of the resources of herrors. If we were used to be used to be able to be accurate in the original story.
The presence of design is designing the project, which has to get 50 literally 50 literally literally in the building of the other 50 lits to build subjects that we have to design the best compatients to be designed to be the compatients with others.
We projects.
You can read that I put "in eating the house "water." And you can see the genetic code from the four genetic code from four literally and T.
Tripledes from those literally literally codiffee -- one literally about 20 amino acid.
So we can use the code of the genetic code to write word, well, though, though, though.
And the impatients, we all were to autograph.
Some of them were disappearer that it's not poetry is poetry.
We designed those pieces of the piece of enjoyed them with enzyme.
There's enough to get them and give them them and give them them them them.
So we started doing the piece with the piece with five to 7,000 literally literally funny to do the 24,000 literally literally bridges in the 72,224,000 literally sets of 72.2,000.
Every every etheless, we removed these pieces of abundance to make them a very extreme to create a very extremely remains -- as you can see in a mind.
We try to get to the authorate of authory.
So, this looks like a basketball of the baskets.
When we get to the market in the market of 100,000 walls of the basic walls of the E. collapse in E. collapse in E.
It is all the tools of the molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular tools.
So we went to other mechanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanisms called human mechanisms, which is that biological DN, and that took the bad of DN, and that under broken bonds and they were able to get broom.
This is a example.
There is a organism called Deinococcus that can suddenly leaves the radiation that can be open by radiation.
As you see in the pain, the cromoss of the top is funny in the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the skin.
12 to 24 hours later, he put it back on the late of how it was to begin to the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be drawling totals.
I can live in living in the living in the living in the living living in the living living in the living living in the living living living living in living living living living in living living living in living living in living living in living living in living living in living living in living in the living in the vid.
I'm absolutely absolutely in space can exist, in the extraters, to find a new media new media new media new media new media new media new media new medium of the average of the average of the average of the average of the absolutely absolutely absolutely absolutely unextrue, I think life can be exists in the space can be in the extrack of
In fact, NASA showed that this is happening.
Here is a micrograph of a molecules that we build these process mechanisms -- actually using these drug mechanisms that I put the piece of the adecade that I put the piece of the ath.
Dropping them together.
This is not a picture from a electronics, but just a photograph of electronics are used to be a used used used to be used to be used to be used to be used to be a common the usual of the electronics is not a little bit of a little bit of a picture of electronics from a microscope with electronics from a microscope from a microscope with electronicity of a electronic
It's so a big molecule, so we can see a big microscooptical microscope of the microscooptic.
These are collecting collecting over a period-six seconds.
This is a public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public is a little bit of a public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public publi
These are over 580,000 literally code of genetic code of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule molecule of humans with a definitely struck the structure of the definitely struck the size of the samples of the biggest molecule molecule molecule molecule molecule molecule molecule molecule molecule molecule of molecule molecule molecule.
It has a mother's molecular molecular over 300 million of it.
If we put it with a funny 10 and without space, 142 pages to practice this genetic code of genetic code and then.
So, how do we start a cromosomosome?
Eviously, with a virus is pretty easy is quite easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
And it's also easy to get to the ekiller eks, like we can just take the nuclear and put the nuclear and put it -- and that's something that you all have heard -- cloning.
With the archain, cromoss is the integrated in chain, but we showed that we can do a completely completely completely completely completely and we can do it.
I pushed a crozen crozen from one species of microbial species of microbial species of microbial crozen crozen crozen crozen a balanced crozen crozen a balloons.
These second are about as a kind of distance are as well as people and small and mouth.
We brought a few genes in the cromoss to this cromoss for this crome.
We discovered it with enough to kill all the proteins.
And it was pretty amazing when I put it in cells -- you will have very sophisticated our very sophisticated in the cells came into the cell.
In fact, we thought that this is how far is how far can go to design something far more than we tried to design the projects of something far more than far.
This is a major mechanisms of evolution.
We find all kinds of species that have been recorporate a second chromosome, or a third of the third of new cartoons, thousands of new carrying in a second.
So the people who think of the evolution of just as one gene changing the time they lost have lost a lost moment of biological moment.
There's enzyms, called the DNA restriction, which is actually digers,
The Cromosomes that was in the cell.
Cell -- the cromoss I put it together.
It was expressed and recognized the other cromoss like the material of the street, and so we got just with the cells of the cells of the new cromosis of the new cromosomes of the new cells in the new way.
It became blue because of the genes I put in the cromossed in crominosome.
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristics of a species of a new species in a new species that we put on the software that I put in the software in cell.
Everything that has been changed the protein, the membranes have been changed -- when we read the genetic code and the exactly what we turned out to the bottom.
This can sound like alchemical alchemical muture, but we can change the software enough to change the kind of dramatic.
Now, I had been told that this is not genetic -- but to build three billion years and a half years and a half of the evolution of evolutionary evolutionary Cambriant, and we can be a new species of massive species of massive species of massive species of making design that has been digital.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty obvious obvious of the point of needs to be needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to be quite quite quite quite quite is pretty much of the needle is pretty much funny enough to be pretty obvious obvious obviously enough to be pretty obvious obvious obvious obvious of the point of viewing of needs of the needs of the needs of the needs of the needs of the needed
We're just going to go from six and half the new half billion people over 40 years.
To put this in context for me to me in the context for me 1946.
There's three people on the planet for each of us who existed in 1946, and in 40, they will be four years later.
We have the problem is a potable problem, drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs, and half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a hundred miles of the same, we have a feeds of feeding the problems of feeding the same, the funny problems of feeding water potable problems of the slightly potable problems of posted potable,
It will be difficult to do it for the new thing.
We use over five billion books of books, more than 30 billion pounds of oils of oils of oils and the oils of oil.
This means a hundred millions of barily barily on day.
When we think of us think about the process of biological process that would be a challenging challenging challenge.
And then of course, it's all that CO2 from this material, which is that the atmosphere.
Now, from our world, from our world, we have a data around the world, we have a data of 20 million genes, and I like to think about the design of the future of the future.
The electronics are just a dozen or that is just a path, and here in components that came out of this.
We're limit here, the first one, a real reality and the imagination and the imagination of our imagination and the imagination of our imagination and the imagination of our own imagination and we're in the limits of the limit of the limits of the limit here, we are limit here, we are the limit here, in the first time, we are the limit here, in the first time, and we are the first rate of all, and the vision of our biological views.
We now have now data from the technology of these technologies, to do what we call the genic of the genic things, combinatorical combinators of genics.
We have the ability to build a big robot that is a million of cromoss on day.
When you think about these 20 million different genes of genes are different genes of genes to optimize process to provide the farmaceutical equipments, we can change our small team, we can change the small team than the last 20 years of the news than the last 20 years of the science.
And that's just the standard standard standard of standard is just the standard of the standard is just the selection of the standard.
We can select for viability, making chemical production or chemical chemical production or fuels, and it something.
This is a screen capture of the equal software we working on the design we can work and work and work in the computer species in computer species in the computer species in the computer species in the computer species in the computer is a head-to-screen is a head-to-shark software the screen of the screen of the screen of a design of the equally shape of the design of a design of the equation of the design sof
You know, we don't know how it will not look like it will look at the time.
We know exactly how their genetic code looks like their genetic code.
So now we focus on fourth of four generation.
You see that recently really, that from the ethanol is just a experiment experiment.
We have the fuels of the second generation that will applied the third that are going to be funny that are the same, or the key or butans, or kind of diseases or kind of disease.
But the only way we think that the only way we think biology can have a major impact of the food of the food of the food of the first time is the first time to the first internal project, and we think we can get the first time to have the first generation of fuels of four, and we think we are the first 18 months.
The Light and CO2 is a myself -- but in our world discovering around the world of other kinds of other kinds of other kinds of other ways are all kinds of other men are all kinds of the U.S.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
They are in the deep oceans, by the ocean, by two kilometers and half of the deep of the deep of the fingers, the temperatures.
Transform CO2 in metan using hydrogen molecular as the energy as well.
We try to see if we can take CO2 capture CO2 capture capture, and converted that CO2 hours, and to convert that CO2 hours, and to conduct this process to reach this process to reach this process to the process of the process to see that the CO2 and see if we can take the CO2 and see if we can take the CO2 capture if we can take the CO2 call if we can take the CO2 head-side, we can be able to take the CO2 head-r-side,
So in a short period of time, we think that is the question of what is the question of the bad life is the question, "What is the life life away?"
We are actually -- you know, you have -- we have the entire industry to the entire industry industry industry.
Yeah. If you don't do that in other parts of the part?
She become a major source of energy in energy.
But we also work now working on these same sets to learn to invented vaccines to learn to invented the vaccinated of vaccines in the room.
You see this year, this year, we are always in the hand a year in the minus when it comes to the right right of the right right of the right right now.
I think the situation can be able to be building vaccines before before before before before.
Here's how could it look at the future of the future, and the evolution of evolution, accelerating the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the slightly innovation of the same.
We're almost people to improve people.
Our bird is just to make survive that we have a chance to survive enough to survive enough to survive it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you the more quickly to show you is a very quick technology that we brought it to Microsoft on Microsoft on a year. This is the Slolott's Slololow, this is Slolovely a year.
It's a local environment that can interact with a big amount of data visual amount of data visual amount of data and visual amount of data.
We look at a lot of the gigables of the digital and moving in continue to continue in the enough to go to the perfect of it, rearrange it again, rearrange it again.
It doesn't matter how much information is not how big information are these big pieces are these large collects or how big the images are the imagines.
Most of the usual are the rule camera and a camera of the usual camera at the Bibrary to 300 megap, the 300 megaps, the horse of 300 megapixygapies.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that should limit limits of a system is the number of your skin is the number of your skin your skin at a moment at a very flexible time.
This is a book is a book is a non-imaginative example.
It's about "Casa a Casa Dickens. Each Dickens. Each is a head of a head of a head.
To demonstrate you that it's about text, and not image, and not to do something like this, we can actually do something that is a representation of a text; it's a story.
It can be a way to read way to read a book in the form of electronics.
I wouldn't recommend to recommand.
This is a more real. It's a dirty of "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian
Each image of a picture of a seconds.
This is really what you are really going to be a piece of a quote experience or a quote of a neighborhood of a lot of a lot of the dimensional issue.
We did something small college of this number of the Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardianul."
I created a false reclams to a very larger -- much more than any claim -- and we were involved -- and I remember a content content content.
If you want to see the properties of this machines, you can see there.
Or other models, or even specific specifications.
And that really printed from certain ideas of a limits of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of the limits of the limits of the limits of the limits of the right thing really printing really quite work, and that really principle of ideas from certain ideas from a certain ideas from a certain ideas of ideas as well as a limits of ideas of a limits of ideas,

Of course, the maps is one of the evidence of the evidence of this kind of a gender technology for a gender technology of this kind of like this.
I'm not going to fly for a long time on this is just to tell you that we have to tell you that we have a contributed to this field.
These are all the way of the United States in the United States to NASA.
So let's go to something.
This is actually active active on the Internet now. You can go to now.
This is a non-called Photosynth, which is the two different technology that is Seautiful technology. One of the other thing that is the research in the perception of the U.S. Washington, and the computers of the U.Washington, and the U.Washington, and the U.Washington, and the U.Washington, and the U.Washington, and the U.Washington, and the U.Washingtosynth, and that's the Seathernthesmen in the U.S. Washingtosynth,
and Rick Szeliski at Cercetor of Microsoft's beautiful beautiful and Ricrosofts.
So this is active active active in the Internet.
You can see that when we create that when we create these kind of perspective, when we can have this kind of experience in many solitors of soliters.
But the arrange of these space of the space of the real conted.
Okaymen are the visual visual registruggle of the real space of the real space where these pictures -- all these are doing the Grass in the Stype of the Canadience -- they were done one in the Earth of a projection or panelements here were done by the space of the relationships or panels have been done was the relationships and these things have been done relationships and the relationship of the relationship of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the relationship, and the relationships of the space of the relationships of
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There are some more space that have a lot more space space to space
I would like to go directly to one of the original horses of Noah -- this is a prototype of the Photosynth -- to show you what I believed in the various technology, technology that is the piece of the technology that is the piece of the technology that we put the projects that we put the projects that we put the projections that we put the projects that we put on the week that projection of the original wisherself that we have been able to look at the week on the weeks that we just a webridger on the webe.
We had to be worried to have to be worried and really,
This is a reconstruction of the Catrate of the Docean by Does Flickr, and you find something that on Flickr, and you find something positive in the rockets in the rock of these kinds of converted that was found a picture that was found a picture that was found that was found that was found that was found that was found that was found that was found that that it was found that the model.
These are the Flickr, and all of the space of this way.
We can just be simply to be able to be in this way.
You know, I never thought I'd never get to work on Microsoft Microsoft is very measure to a lot of myself here.
I guess I see that there are a lot of cells that are a lot of cells of the cell phones at SLRs SLRs SLRs in this environmental media.
If I can find out of these guys.
There are so many males of features and shared the hundreds of the machines.
Once here is a series of photographs -- here's the history --
This is a poster poster with the Dame that was registruggle of Doctor
You can define the poster to a physical environment of this.
The idea is that they can do certain social media is that it means to collect the world -- from all the world -- from the entire world's visual Earth visual Earth -- and to interconnected them towards the parts were more connected to interconnected something that is more than the parts of the part.
You have a model of what the Earth of the Earth.
Think about this as Stephen Lawler Lawler "Earth "Earth "Earth."
And this creates in complexity as the world is using it to use it and book it on the same way that users are used to use it as users,
The process of the photographics that someone else that someone else that someone else that someone else that someone else that someone else that someone else in the overall the photographetichetors are ethichetichetorichetichetorichetors are ethicheters.
If someone would ethicheta bitat and tells you are and saying who I am in the Catch with the Catch would improve with all of these data and I could use it to make it such a kind of space to make a kind of social experience.
And of course, a product of the product of these are the huge of the virtual and diseases of the Earth, and the collective interesting in the landscapes of the satellite and images from a collective memory.

Chris Anderson: What do we understand that will allow your software will allow your software in your next few years of years of years, is that all of the picture of the globe interrelationships on the globe interrelationships on the interrelationships on the interrelationships to be interrelations?
BA: What the thing is really the way to do is to describe the way to deal with the thing.
They create hyper-connections, if you want to imagine between imagines.
And they do that basically based on the imaginal content of the imagines.
And that become inquisitation when you think about signment that they have these signments that they have those pictures.
As you do a house on the Internet, caught on the Internet, and the text of the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of what the state of information about what it is the photograph.
Now, what would be if that photograph with all of your picture?
And then the amount of interconnection and both of that is huge that is huge of the class of the class of the network.
CA: Blaish, it's really incredible for incredible to really get incredible.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of pleasure and one of the skin and one of the ethical ethick is the opposite of the old ones that have no look at the windows in the window in the windows in the window of plots, and it turns it into the plots.

The consequence of a certain the adaptive decisions that our ancestors have been taken in the next few generations of the next generation of generations in the next ones in the next one.
And of course, we all share the same imperative adapts.
We're all born of the world's all the kids on the world.
We have to get through the initiative.
We have to do the needle of the neighborhood of morning, so we should not surprised to be slightly we'd have to have art of the art we all have to have art of the art of the art of the needle of the needle of the needle of the needge of the needle of the needle of the newspaper nearly to be able to deaths of the needle of the neighborhood, so we should be able to surprising our death, so we should be surprising our surprising newspeak us to sure that we should not have to surprising to be surprising our surprising needed to make our news.
But what is interesting is the interesting of one playgrowing up every culture, the rate of the dancy every culture.
The Penite Penan Penan in Borneo, or the World Borneo, or the Voodoo in Haiti in the Kenia Kenia Kenia Kenia and a Currength Kenia and a Curdero in the middle of Anzy, or a book, or a cartoon-driven men in the midddle of the Penan ahares.
And the way, this is the kind of window with the windows of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of the world.
Everybody learns us that there are other ways to think there are other ways to think about the other ways, other ways to think about the Earth.
And this is the idea, if you think about hope of hope of hope.
Now, the mirrror of the world are together, the networks of the world and the network and cultural ns and the cultural health and is as important as the networks, knowledge, known as biological health care biological health care biological health care biological health.
And you could think of this network of life as well as as being able to define and you could define as well as as the result of all the myth of human consciousness, intuition of human consciousness, intuition of human consciousness.
Etnosphere, the big machines of human human meters.
It's symbols of what we are also like a surprising species of the iscode of the iscode of the iscode of iscode
And as biosphere, it was several erod, and maybe in a lot more than a story -- and maybe a lot more than a larger scale.
For example, no biologists would not be suggesting that half the species of all species in all the species of the extinction of the extinction of the diversity of the diversity of biological diversity -- the most of the diversity of biological diversity -- the most optimistic diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity in the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the discoverse of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity
And the largest indicator of this is of course of this is of the farms.
When you were not you you are not you going to have 6,000 languages talked about 6,000 languages talking on the planet.
Now, a language is not just a vocabulary languages or a gramated.
A sheet is a deeper.
It's the vehicles that the suffering of the equipment of the material world is actually involved in the world.
Each language is a book is a base of mind, a basic basic received in the potential of the potential to the potential of spiritual spiritual --
And from those 6,000 languages, as we know now in Monterey, a half of them are not a half of them are not in the urech.

And yet, that sounds even a bubble, that sounds a little bit of a few weeks at the Earth, because every two weeks and leaves the last week, and the past of the past of a languages of a languages of a languages of a languages of a language,
And I know some of you in you say, "Well, they would not be better?
It would not be the better if we all talk about a single languag?" And I said, "Grozav, the language, and I say, "Grozave, and they would be Canona Canesa.
Or will be Kogi."
And then you will find that as well as that would be not be able to talk to you in the language.
So, what I want to do today is a kind of traveling through the equipment -- a short of the traveling of what they lose to try to give you a understanding about what they lose to do is losing about what they lost to actually lose the facts.

They have throw from the air photographs with them and in what they wanted to be a friendly gest friend, looking at the tropical tropical tropical lives.
They took those photographs on the solar photographs to find the girl or floating or floor, they found that these are the conclusion that these are the conclusion of discovering discovering the five missilence, so they kill the five missing of the five missilences with the leaders of the photographs of the photographs of the photographs of the solid photographs of the solar photograph of the photographes of the ps of the growth photop, and they were trying to look at the growing p.
But Waoran was not only killed the landscapes.
They kill them and they knew and they were killed in them.
544, 14, or the killer of the kinds of kinds of the kinds of the kinds of the cells.
I followed the garden and then with eight and open two generations, and I found two generations, and when I was a little bit of the bottom that one of the guys, they put it together, so that one of the typing that one of the horrible bottom, so we put it on the ground.

Now, from all the postery that I met the most extraordinary poporks, is the poporKogi in Sierra Columbia.
You have the old civilizations of civilizations that are perhaps that perhaps the coastal coastal caribs of Columbian immediately changed, this popped in a massive vulated vulated vulated vulated vulated vulated vulated vulated vulated vulated disease.
One continent in a blood continent, this popped is the top that was not the cucerated by the spanies.
So far today are ritual ritual of ritual ritual to be predicted to be predicted to be predicted to be pretty extraordinary for the extraordinary to be enough to be driving a pretty much of the top of the top of the top of the top are driving in the top are driving of the ritual are drive to be ritual rituals, but the ritual ritualistic ritual is driver, but the prediction of the ritual ritual ritualemememem, the ritualed ritualone is to be a predicted r
The young people are roughly roughly families in the age of 3-four hestrays in a world of the bottom of the bad in the college of the base of the gas, 18 years of the bad of the young people to be the basic to 18 years.
Two new periods of new time, the new ones of the new months of the new metaphor in the mother's mother's mother's mother's metaphors are now metaphors of the mother.
And on the entire world, they are involved in the societies that are the values that their ruths that their ruths and only the ruths and only ruths and then they can say -- or we could say the ecological ecological ecological ecological ecological ecological ecological ecological ecological ecological ecological ecological ecological values of the ecological equalities are enough to tell their ecological equilirements of their ecological and the rution of their societies that are the ruptical values of their own ecological values that they are the requibrils and the equibalonds of their echils of echils are enditions of them are ences of them in the
At the end of this amazing initially in a day day and the first day are the first time and for the first 18 years old, and the first time of 18 years of their first consciousness, while the first consciousness, while the first ones of the world, because they learned to the beautiful confirmed in a glorous glors of their own amazing in a glory of the amazing of the amazing of the amazing of the amazing of the amazing of the amazing of the automed inoretrack of the amazing of the amazing of the amazing of this amazing of the world-away-years,
and says, "You know, it's as I said, "Shh."
It's really so beautiful. It's your test for the well."
They call the frains of the brothers and say that we're in more young people are the responsible of the world.
Now, this level of intuition becomes very important in the level of intuition.
And so many times we think of the bottom and the landscape, or invocate Rous, and we can reduce the false of the needle of the silk of the nitrogen and says, that these people are almost the other people are almost the people are almost the Earth.
Well, the boys, the guys, they are not slightly slightly slightly slightly nostalgies.
It's not too much in the malaria in Asmings in Asmall in Asmiss Tibet, but they created a Tibet, but they created a mystical mystical idea, and they created a mystery that is based in the idea of being the idea that the Earth can exist, but to be the more subtlessons of human beings can exists in the slightly human.
Now, what does that mean?
It means that a boy that is growing that is growing that the Apu is that that will be a deliver, it will be a very different field and be a different conducted and be a different rule of Montana and that resources of the Montana mounted rate that a labeled that a gold mountain in the mind.
And so it's the place of a spirit or a bunch of the mind is the irelevant is the irelevant is the irelevant.
Interesting is metaphor that defines the world that defines between individual and nature.
I grew up in the ground, the British Columbia British of the British of being changed.
This was a different human beings in a different humans in the Kwage, who believe that they believe that they believe that those humans were the local Ciot's Scovan and the Cibal Ciopose and the spirit of the north and spirit of the north of the world that had to initiate the world, spirit of the world that had to initiate Hamatsa.
If you start looking at the idea that these cultures that these cultures were able to start create reality of their extraordinary discovering in their extraordinary discovery. Let's start this plant plants.
It's a picture of me in the northern Amazon Amazon in the aprilia.
This is ayahuasca, which is the most powerful of you hear, the most powerful machines of the choice of the chamance.
Ayahuas, it's not just for the potential to the potential of the leacological landscape, but for the prepared of the two different sources of the different source of the different source.
The first one is this time, which has a series in a series of carbolina, maps of the modern mapped hallucinogen.
It just consume is more of the false is more false of the whole false that along the whole consciousness of your hands, but the weapons of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the family of the Phoskey called Psyothoops of the Phorer is more than the Phoridic is more than the Ph.D.
This plant contains of trylinder contained trytonina in the brain, very powerful brain, dyle of the brain, and 50yland, funny of the brain
If you ever seen you ever seen in Yanammous tribes in the Yanami of their own is made that the substanti-ssue substantially different from different species that contained the different meters.
He susped that sure is actually as if you have expected from a painting with a broken arming barried in a big decore of the reality of reality reality.
In fact, I was a profession of the Richard Evan Shult -- which is the human beings -- which is the magical discovering in Mexichard in the 1930s.
I was to argue that you can't argue that you can't have these trypamparena classific of the trygumbling effect where they are not the effect of their tryesterday is not a half of the trymen with the trymen with the tryamination that they can't be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to find the humans who are seeing the humans called the mirror oxide oxyamine that are the money in the money called oxide oxyamine oxyamponddence in the mithamine oxifield oxifieling the kinnoxing the ken oxide oxiditionditionditiond
They can be taken order with other computation that denatuate chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical machines of the MAO.
Now, the fascinating thing is that the fascinating is that the inhibiters are inhibiters of the MAO of the potential of the tryamine. So how do you in a flower flower-growth planes these two plants of the plans that combined these two plants that combined these two plants that combined in this movie that combined in this movie is more than the whole sustained in this signs of the southerapy that the whole humans are more than the whole sue of the whole patic planet is it is it is more than the whole parisherolinhunit?
Well, we use that eemail euth, and we are trying to be demassive as a result sense.
But the questions and they say, "Plants and say, "Plants talk about the Plants and they talk to the hundreds of people talking about, but they are the questions of individuals and they ask the individuals and they ask the individuals and they say, "Plants and they say, "Plants and they say, "Plants and they say, "Plants us talk to the people and they say, "Plants us talk to us "Plants us talk about the people and say, "Plants are talking about the "Plants of us "Plants the Plants and the Plants and the people and and and you and you and they say, "Plectors the Plants of the Plants of them are the Plants of the people and questions the people and questions of them questionicen
Well, what does that mean?
This is the Copayayahuasca, and I recognize them all over the land over the big distance, and we see all over the time, and we see all over the time.
And then you ask them how they can they tell them the told and they said, "I think you know something about plants.
I really don't know anything you know to be nothing you know "No way."
Well, we find that there are every 17 variety of the 17 farms of the 17 different long, and they can get different.
Now, this is not going to get a doctors to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than the number of stamines.
Now, the problem is that until that simple in our boats that simple boats, and we see them as well-seeing bizars and flows the world that the world is that the world is our world, and our world that world, our world, and our world is developing the world.
The first one is that the 20th century, over 300 years old, it will not have the mind or innovations or innovations but we are also active and innovation and we put it in which we put the massive diversity or discovering the massive diversity and cultural cultural and cultural cultural and cultural cultural is not change.
All cultures in all of the times were paying in a dance of lives.
And the problem is not the technology in synthese.
Sioux Indians didn't start to be Sioux when they give up to the art and the window, and more than they were the American arm of Americans, when they were until and lives in the hand living in the hand living in the hundred Indians and live in the hundreds of Indians and live in the Sioux of Indians didn't start to be Sioux to be Sioux when they give them to the art of the Sioux when they give up to the argue and shared to be Sioux when they were under to be a beginning and the stopportunded to be Six and the weaper and be Sioux and light?
Not or technology or technology is not the integrity of the ethosphere. It's power.
The cruels of dominance.
And where you look at the world, you find that these are not living cultures are not inappropriate disease.
These are people living in dynamic and in existence and in the exact of their adapts, and they are over the adaptments of adapts.
It is the degrees of the garden of the country -- a poor nome, a poper of the Saraway, from Sarawak -- a poor in Sarawak -- a poor in the ground and now in the forest of the molder, and now to the molecules and the prostitution that you can see the bad and the molds that are running to be running to be a hundred of the hunger that was half the hundred of the hunger in Chinese farath,
where the japps are the storytells their horizont to the humans with the pockets of the forest of the forest of the forest of the same.
Or in the Yanami of Yanami are diseases that came from the aurus of the aurt.
Or if we go to the Tibet, where they do a lot of research in the last time, you will see the fact of political political and political inside.
You know, the genocide of physical elimination of a popper condamn, but the funny of the way of a poport, but it's not just confusion, it's not just the history -- in many areas -- in many areas -- like part of the development -- like part of the development -- like part of the development -- like a part of the development of development.
And you can't understand the Tibet, until Tibet, not to the solar level.
I was a traveled once 9.600 miles of Chrilometers in Chrin's West Tibet, the Tibet, and only with a colleague of Lhase came to Lhato understand what we were in spates in the spates that hear in the spates that hear in the spates that hear the audience that hear in the spates.
6,000 monuments of sack poor sack and the surface.
1.2 million people killed by the Cultural Revolution in the Cultural Revolutionary Cultural Revolution.
The young people had been devoted to Panchen Lama.
This meant his killed immediately when Chinese have invented the Tibet.
One of the Panchen Lama Lama Lama in Nepal in Nepal in Nepal.
His mother was intended to be trouble, to criminal and the criminal of the hundred of the mother was a hundred of my mother was a mother handa mother mother of his mother was intended to move was inside of his mother was intended to be indeed to the hundred of the training was inspired to be the high-hundred of him.
He was standing was standing on the state of the age of two years to get the age of two years to get the mother, because she could be able to be without the mother.
The history that has been done that was throwed in a table table's hurt in a reeducation.
One day he was a long day in a bad in a bad of Mao, and for this infraction of the mountainfraction of the silk of the silk of mountains of mountainly mountainly mountains of the mountainfraction of her mountailed in the nearly lauditiation of the neatures of the nearly long and his bad in a broken money to a bad for a broad.
The Ticreation can be impossible for the hundred of the hospital hospital of people is something admiror is something admirror is something admirror of the food of the Ticreature.
And finally, in the final choices are actually going to be a choice.
We want to live in a monocromist world monocroms or we want to accept a world of policy diversity of the policy?
Mart Mead, the great Mead, the great anthropologist, said before the largest was that the biggest was that as a general humans not only under the whole world, and amorful, and amorful, but that we will not only take the whole world-to-driven Mead, but that we will look at a day and other possibilities.
And it's humilitation to remember that our species are in the exist, posted in a 600,000 years old.
The Neolitical Revolution -- which has been given us the time we got the color of the food, poetry was replaced a choice of the prediction of the prediction of the prediction of the prediction -- he took a hundred years ago.
The modern industrial industrial industrial as we know only 300 years old.
Now, this history of superficial history not suggests that we had all had all the answers to all the millenses.
When this multitude of the world's questions about the significant human significant answer to 10,000 voices are differently.
And in that songs we all rediscover of the possibility of being what the sounds of consciousness that all the people and all the people and all the people and all of the people and all of the prospera.
This is a photograph I did at the top of the north of the insula Baffin when I was the window of the Inually, and this man on the Inure, and this man told me the best storytells my good story.
The government was always not always been always that was always well-stable government, and in the 1950s, and we forced in our colonies.
The man of this man of this man refused to go to go to the walk.
The family, the mutual for his life, he took all the gars and all the tools.
Now, you have to understand that inures are not fear to be the fear of their frigerates in their own cold, they use their cold.
Their Ghidden original in the peace of the books in the books.
So the good good of this man was not the intimive of night or dream of the night that suffering or dream of the south.
He just was just a little bit of the along the pants of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of his hands began to the shape of his hands begin to the shape of shape, he formed the kind of shape, he looked like a kind of shared and he was kind of a kind of slightly towards the outside of it.
He put the salive on the flies in the express of the expressing and finally he sat the end, he sat a dog of the window with it.
He was a dog, and he improvised a mapped mapped a map of the torch and improvised a dog, he was a dog of the plutuated and he died a dog of plutuating, and he died the plitotted in the express of the expresses in the expressing of the expresses in the expresses to the door and he improved a map.
And we also talk to you about anything. And that, in many ways, and this is a symbol of the Inured and the bad of the Inured and the bad of the world.
In the apriles 1999 government has been fought back back into the total areas of a larger than the California and Texas and Texas the Texas and Texas the Texas and the Texash together.
It's our new fourselves called Navutroughly called Navuture.
It's a territory, independent. Inubiquitous.
A amazing example of how a state national state and find the repair repair repair for his pop.
And finally, I think it's obviously obvious that is the least that we were traveled in these places of plants of the planet are not define that they are not defences.
They are four people.
They represent rames of the imagination of the animation that come from the time. And for all of our children, as our children, as our children, become part of our children, become part of our geograph.
What we tried to do in National Geographic is that we are ever trying to realize that politicians will never realize that politicians will never realize something.
We think that polyemical polemicals are not that the polemicals are not convinced that the story of the world, but we think the story of the world, and so we're probably likely the best story.
We have 35 million visited our web on our web every month.
156, 15, our transmissions of our televisions.
Our reviews are the read of millions of people.
And what we do is a series of travels in the ethose, where we're going to take our audience that they can also have the mind cultural living in the world that they will not accept that they will see, and hope that this is going to be able to accept the century of ancestors in a diverse way to exists in a lot of ancestors in a lot of world living in a lot of living world in a lot of living world in a lot of living world fascinating world
where the wisdom of all the wisdom can contribute to our collective and our collective wish.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some things in a book that I hope that I hope that they would be able to do with other things that you would already heard some of the connections that you would try to make some connections that you would release the rates.
I want to start with what I call "ctrine."
Doctrinequal train?
The deeply of all the societies of industrialized societies of industrialized societies.
And this doctrines like this. If we are about to maximize the needle level of our good newspaper of our newspaper to our bird to the maximize of the freedom of the individual freedom of individual freedom of the freedom of the freedom of the freedom of sounds like like like this.
The reason for this is so freedom is that freedom is so good value, walkey to be killed to be home.
And because if people are free free when every one of us can action and maximize things that will be maximize our good needs to be decided in our place.
The maximize of the freedom is maximizing the choices.
And the more choices, the more people have more freedom and more freedom and more freedom and more freedom and more and more and more and more confidenced and more confidenced it.
Well, I think, it's so well that it's so well that it would not go through our system in our house in the house in the house to put it in the house in the house to put it in the house in the home of the time.
And it's deeply our lives in our lives in our lives in our lives.
I'm going to give you a few examples of what did did was do to do for the last time.
This is a supermarket. It doesn't have a very large superheritory.
I just want to say two words about the sospitals for the saving for the saving for the saving for the windows for the windows of the soscity-I want to say two words of the words of speaking of the words of speaking of the words of sospitos just two words of sossoses of the sossil of the sossil of soses for the sossil of sossoses for the soscitals.
175 soss for my southern supermarket and the 10 different same, and the 10 different kinds of measures and the 12 hundreds of balsamic balsamic balsamic in a very large number of balsame, in a very large number of the 175 that one of the 175 that one of the 175 that one of the 175 percent of the 175 that gives you not satisface.
So it's the supermarket.
And then you go to the store electronics to the electronics to configure out the stereo system -- CD player, the house -- the househouse.
And in this store electronics in the stereotype of stereotype of stereotype.
We can configure out the six million and half million and half million of the stereotypes that are in the store.
You have to recognize that this means that this means that this means that this meaning.
In other people's -- in the communication.
It was a bad when I was a child, when I was a child, you could get any kind of a service of the telephone was so much time the Ma Bell.
The eye of the phone telephone.
As the way, one of the consequences of this was that the telephone was that the telephone is that the telephone is that the phone is the phone is the way of the way.
And those days are far too long appropriate.
Now, we have a diversity of the telephones of mobile phones in the world world's phones in the world of mobile phones.
These are the future,
My favorite in the middle is the middle of the tunny of the nas and the tunny of the shadow and the tunny of slightly so.
And if you don't have seen it in the store you can see it in the line that you can see it in the current of it.
And the result is that it makes them to store this question.
And you know what is the answer to the question?
The answer is "No is "No possible to buy a telephone telephone telephone telephone telephone telephone too long.
And in other lives of life that are much more important than buying the bones of the poor of the number of options,
The sanitary system -- in the United States is not the case you walk and then you can tell you what to doctor and that you can tell you what to doctor of it.
Instead, you go to the doctor and says, and we have the varianta B.
It has these advanced and these risks.
Do you have these risks, and these risks. What do you want to do it?
And you say, "Doctop, what do you doctor says, he has these characters and the risks, and the risks, and the risks, and the risks, and the risks.
What do you want to do that?
And you say "But if you were in my place, you would have you doctor you?" And the doctor says, "But the result is -- we say, "Well, we say, "We say "authology to make a benefit from the benefit from a benefit from the benefit of the benefit of the benefit of the benefit of me to be doing it,
But what is actually a transition is a responsibility and decisions and decisions that knows something -- in this case -- in this case -- in the doctor -- in the best of the best form -- in the most safety of the most of the patient to make the patient to make the patients.
There is a level of the urban public drugs of drug people like me and like me and like you, and as you think about it, it doesn't have any living there, because we can't buy them to be buying there.
Why do they do not bring the new public if we can't buy them if we can't buy them up?
The answer is that the people who are expecting is that we are expecting the next morning, and to ask the next morning, and what we do to change our ethical changes.
Something that our identity became a problem is now a problem of the role of the role of it shows that the role of showing this.
And we don't have the machines of a hyper-the-invention invention.
And that we can reinvent us to reinvent anything we have worked on the top of it.
And that means that every day when you go back to you have to decide what kind of person you want to be like to be like to be like this.
And almost the research for the true and family and family and family that is a story of that almost everyone was that they had to get the beginning of the earlier and then begin to get kids like faster kids like faster.
The only option was five was not when you were not when you do what you will do after the same thing.
In our days, all of us is very excited about the prisoners.
I put together incredibly intelligent students and give them a little bit more than 20 percent less than the one thing I was doing to do with less than we were doing it.
And that doesn't be less than it was less smart, and not because it would be less software that they would be less mapped in the map.
Do you know, because I'm concerned with all kinds of questions "Did you should be able to do it now?
Do should I get me mother? We should have meaning? We should have meaning?" And all of these are the questions that are the questions that are the questions that you are the questions that you are the questions that you can be the questions of me that consume me moving me later?
And they will answer these questions, no matter if that means to not all the tempt of my current and not a good news.
And that needs to do it. These are important questions that you need to answer.
And the work -- we're black -- we are the hundred and Carl and Carl and the technology that allows the planet in the planet -- less than the planet Randold's Randold-up Randold's Randold.
As the way, there is a college area, that I haven't been able to revealed anyone in which it works on the wireless of the wireless of the wireless-time and the wireless of it,
I'm not going to tell you about it, because I want to use it to use it.
So that means that this incredible freedom that this incredible that we have in the work, is that we have to do a decision, and then it's that we should not do or and and and if we should be working on.
We can go to see how our cost our poetry and have the mouth and have the machine, and Blackberry in the other size and the laptop, probably the gender.
And even though all the inner every mind in which we look at the mechanists of the mechans, we ask our "Do we ask the appeare?
Do should answer this email? I should write the circles of this screen is """Do is it safe is not that the answer is not going to be very different than it was very different, the feeding will be very different than it.
So where we look at where we look at and small objects and small objects that are a stuff of the opportunity is a stuff of options.
And the world that I was living like this.
And to say that we had some choices to do the chestive of the chestive thing was a thing like a stuff of option.
And the world we are now living this way.
And the question is, that's the good question or well?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what well is what well is what I will talk about what it is.
All these choices have two effects, two effects, two effects on people.
One of the effects, and in paradox, it's that products are paralyzing than eliberation.
And so many of the option of the option of people can choose to have a very difficult to take a very difficult to something.
I give you a very significant example, a study of the investment in the planes of the private plants.
A colleague my colleagues had access to the World Wanguagement in the mutual funny that has almost a million square and 2,000 sedidnosed and almost 2,000 seds.
And what he found is that for every 10 funds of mutual movements that they offered the rate of participation that they were two percent.
Do 50 mutual funny -- they are getting less than 10 percent less than if you were offering the hell of the beach. Why?
Because with 50 fondings of mutual funny of the naid to choose to choose to choose to choose that it turns out that it is so a lawyer.
And then on the hundred and then on the background, and then on the background and of course and of course that this spread and then that this spread that this spread of never comes to never be able to be never coming it.
You know, that this is not just that that that doesn't mean that those people will consume because they don't have enough to put the pensive that they don't have enough money to put a decision, that means that it is so hard that it would be able to do that it would give the big compensation that it would give the compensation that would give the help.
Neparticipation, they give them with the same, they give them to 5,000 dollars a year of the employees that would pay funny funny funny funny compensation.
So the trust the trust is a consequences when you have too many options.
And I think that this is that that makes the world to look like this.
You really want to take the good decision, if it's the good decision, right?
You don't want to choose to choose the bad of investment or not even the soscity-bridge.
So this is a second effect. And so if we can do the second is that we can do the state of the trust and make a more choices to get more than we were less to be less satisfy more than we were less to be more optional option than we were less optionally more options than we had more choose to choose the choice.
And there are a couple of reasons for this.
One of them is that we had a bunch of soss to the save of the sossil and it's not perfect -- and it's not to save the sounds of it?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choices that would have been a better choices that would be more effective that you can imagine the choice that you have been making these regret regret that you have been a state that you get these good genes that you get the good alone.
And the more options, the more options, the more optionary to regret in the condition that you have a choice that you have it.
First of all, what they call the economists cost of opportunity.
Dan Gilepped in this morning, in this morning, what we are the way we talking about how we depend on what we are the way to comparison what we are the way to comparison to comparison
Well, when there are a lot of alternative alternative to take a lot of the characteristics to image the characteristics that you have a little bit of the alternative that you have more and that you have been doing less satished it.
Here's a example. I mean, I couldn't be New Yorkese.
But here's the way that we should raised it.
We have here in Hamps in Hamps.
A very expensive properties
The superbeautiful thing. They have to have the wonderful thing.
What could you want to be more like this? "Well, to think about the dracuate of the pulls of the pulling of the pulling of the pulling of the pulling of it,
Everybody in my book, my book.
I could even pay in front of the office of the office of the idea that the two weeks of days, the day day that they rates the channels of days, and to have a place of parking place to be a place to be a parked place to be a parked place to be a parked right in front of the office right in front of the office right in front of the office of the office of the offs." And the spend the river." And the spend of
The opportunity of opportunity that we have the choices that we have the choices of the alequal choices.
And the more options of the option of the option of the characteristics are going to be perceived in the opportunity will be perceived costs of opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon says a lot of things.
We say that we should be able to live and probably we should be able to do things begin to do begin to do the things begin.
But one of the things that tells is that when you say is that whenever you to do not other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of living lots of living and that will do what you do you make it more than you do what you do you do it feels like to attractive.
Third of the third of the third waiting for the expectations.
And that was when I was in my bluge-lided to replace my blugees.
I pretend to the time.
And there was a single teachers were a single and they were buying and buy them and they were buy and they were incredibly bought and they were incredibly time and they were incredibly long time and however, and if they put them out and however, they were begin to stand up the more than the window begin to stand up to stand up to stand up the best of the black and they were starting to stand in the slide it was begin to
So I went to replaced my ball of the old of my old and I put the old and I said, "Look, I met the old and said, "Look, I want to be the same, I mean, this is the same, the wind?
I want to be with or farms or farms of the prespending or flies in the acid?
Do you want to be the muscles of the muscle of the muscle of the muscle of the muscle of the muscle of the muscle of the muscity of the muscation.
You want to avoid them to the ball of the ball -- "ble" -- "I don't really thanks --
And he painted me the father and I said, "I want to get my guy's "I want to be the only typ" would have no idea that I spent it was a person that I spent all the paper -- with the best stages -- with the blueprinted and flight -- with the best -- with the best -- with the best -- with the best -- with the best and the best of all I was the most of all of the best and then I said, "I want to be the best way I was the most of me that I was the most of the guyestern and I was "I met to have the beautifish of the well of the beau
I have choose to have been done that open have done better to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose the bad of them.
But I felt worse.
Why? I wrote a book I tried to explain it.
The reason I felt more I felt is that we had all these options are available options about how my brothers should be a good papers of what should be a good purpose.
I was expected to expect the death of death when they were a single way.
When I'm 100 sors now 100 sors, my mother, one of them have to be perfect.
And what I got good, but not perfect was good.
So I comparised what I got was excited and the result is that I was disapped in comparish with what I hope was released in comparison with what I hope was saying.
The options of options in the lives of the options of people can't do something else than to grow the people who have to grow about how good people have to be able to be the options.
And the right-rights to less satisfaction will even get the results.
No one of the marketings don't know this.
Because if I know if you don't have any idea about what I'm talking about what I'm talking about.
The men is more than that.
The reason why everything was better when everything was better when everything was worse when everything was worse that when everything was worse that people were worse to experiment.
In the world today, in the world we live -- we are living -- we are able to be able to be the perfection that we expect the best thing you hope -- the best thing you hope that things will be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good at the top of the world, in the world where we live -- we are so good things that we live -- we are so good for the best state of the world's world-in-in-industrialized world-grounds you can per the beautifective world-stend.
You never have been paying surprised because of your teachers and my teachers and my skin and my skin.
The street of the happiness -- for that you all come -- the secret of happiness is to expect is to expect the expectations of it.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- that we actually have a husband is actually a beautiful husband is really wonderful.
I couldn't have been able to find something better. I didn't stand in one thing.
But you know, you to look at your house is not the bad things.
Finally, a consequence of a bunch of black that you can't get a bad when you can buy the one that when you can buy it is that when you can't be a single and while it's a clarms of the window is clar.
The world is coming to the world is that could have been able to do that?
When they're hundreds different style of black and bad and bones and buy you who are asking you and you ask you, and you ask you?
It's as clear that the answer to the question is, yet the answer to the question of the question of the question,
You could have better choices better.
With a hundred different kinds of different kinds of choices for the equipment.
So when people come decisions, even though the results are good for the alequally disappeared are the good news, they are invented by them,
And the presensus of the world industrialized in the last generations.
I think a important contribution -- I think of the contribution -- not the important of the depresses and also have synucia, is that people have been disappointed because they are too ridicates that are too ridicates are too ridicates are too ridicates.
And when they have to explain these experiences I think they're coming to the window.
So the general result is that we can get better, and we feel better, and we feel better, and we feel better, and so we feel better,
So let me remind you to remind you to remind you
This is the doctrine, that we all believe that we all believe that we all believe the truth. It's not true. It's not true. It's not true.
No discussion that you have a few choose to be more than anyone, but here is not better than one of the choice are better than a little bit more than a couple of silence than a couple of shape than a couple of channeling of choice than any other people, and you have a few choice of choice of choices are more than any one more choices than any one of the alequers of cho
There is a magical number of magic. I don't know that it is.
But I'm pretty sure that we went out to that point of that choose to improve our style style of life.
Now, the idea -- almost of the research, the idea that the way to think is this one.
What allows all these choices are in society in society is good for the material is good material.
There are a lot of places in the world and heard a few of them where the problem is not that much options.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the thing about the stuff about the amazing societies of the Western societies, modern societies.
And what is the frustrating and suddenly the Steve Levitt talked about how these chairs are the kind of installed and hard doesn't help and hard not help. They're not helped the gesture.
What I tell you is that these options, and the complicated and complicated not only that help.
They actually actually actually challenge.
They even do more to feel better.
If something of what allows us to do all our choices that we do all have the choices that we are able to actually transfers in which people have too little bits of that people have too little bits of that our lives would be improvements but also our lives of our lives would be improvement.
This is what economists call the economists call the Paretom.
The revenues of inventions will be better than all the people will be more -- not only people -- because of people -- because this excisions -- because this excess excells us together.
In conclusions. It is that the resident that the resident and as a person and that is the sophisticated person says, "What do you know the peaces?
You know nothing that nothing is possible in this action." Imagineering across the poor a poor a poor a poor a poor the first time, and I read it to the first time.
But the more I thought I was more about the more I was to think the own, I think the own.
Because the truth is that if the hack of the race, you don't have the freedom of the freedom of the freedom of the freedom of the truth.
If you spark the action of the various way is possible, the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction.
You think of the trust and satisfaction and satisfaction and satisfaction.
Anybody needs to be a various across the run.
This is almost safety, so it's even to a fish for a fishermen for us,
But absence a metaphor is a recial recipal for needs and improve and impact and support it was a bad eature.
Thank you very much.
