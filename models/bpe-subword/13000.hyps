And the first one I asked these two typical researcher to the best of the police of the world's line that was the same mythesial for the last 40 million years ago with the six of the shape of 40 percent of the case of the cells of the cell.
But this including these problems of problems that problems is not the same thing is not the best story.
The police of policy policy, the including the process system that has the planet.
It is exactly the same thing and reducing the character.
The second thing that you can see you have a story will be a requirement.
Good is a little bit with the mouse with the mouth.
So you see it the exactly the balance of the artist.
This is the massive to the bottom of the cell.
And they go to the story.
The number called the cosmital architect, with a few years or more than five years or more than the car or more than the case of a couple of hospital in a couple of a couple of hospital.
In 25 years ago to this year,
This is a problem because the problem of the process of the oceans.
But it is a sample is a bone-laptop to the bone, is the computer, it's a complete settled in a little bone.
The best way to the police of the police of the world's global engineering in the middle of the paster could be able to do this in the past.
So the one in a couple of silk in the Shyle, but in the hospital purppose is to the shape of the slim.
The Calform Kalk's best in the United States was a refugee with a cycle.
You're a Go! I say: Everyone is the question is we can see our question.
And a very simple thing that the word "The wish is Genendles."
This is a little that there are all the time.
But the best is more than anything like anything.
This is the Kenylens in the wishing of Genendlane.
If you want you to do you get the case of the case of the car of the best story.
These are very faster very faster.
And the other cells of the brain the middle of the best fuel of the planet.
one of the paster people have been faster as the inside of the endark is the end-balancy is going to be able to the artists of the best story.
This is the engineering with the case of the case of the cycle, like Gendland.
In House Hakay: the case of the car as a new task of the top of the top of the top of the top of the long-term less.
40 percent of the world's popular world's light in the middle of the paper in these hythese.
In the Earth, this is to get to this is the remarkable to do it.
The bones have created it.
But when they go to the streaming and fish.
In the engineering was a 40 to 40 to the fish of the shape in Starget.
This is the amazing of the slim.
And the presence of the automatically are the top of it.
And the global world's global impact on a samples of a reinnovation.
And the fuel of the world's global labor the planet and the extremely required and the including and the including and the including and the including and the including and the independent
For four more than the last 30 years ago, the last five years.
This is a massive process to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
If you want to read in conversation in the environmental story.
In the last three years ago, we digital million dollars a million dollars of the 21, a million dollars in every 15 million dollars.
So you have to do with the stories of the Pixiety of the world, and every single of the world, and every single of the U.S.
The most most most of the best inside of the world's global environmental paper to the shape of the shape of the computer.
The cosis a big problem, and the best problems.
The United States is one of the car of the cosaura China.
And it was building a lot of time that we build more than the good for the best for your body.
But we do a new change.
This is the people who have a little bone-dimensional for the same environmental improvement.
Everybody has a story, there in our own own own own and our own own
And the industry of the pollen and the cosophy of a billion dollars a billion dollars a billion dollars a billion dollars.
When you get a good good story, it's a bone.
This is the image of the story.
In the first time in Central Titake a billion dollars a billion dollars of the best story.
You can see the best story.
This is the same thing that the car cycle of the samples in the '90, he was a research.
One of the industrial industry in the world, and the wildness of Cippping in the Cipper was this.
Yeah, now: ♫ ♫ ♫ The machine, is a good bone, and it is a bunch and the story.
He is the same thing in America, and help us create the economic economic economic economy.
For the cloth, the cloth, and it became more than what it is going to be in more than what it is.
He is the measurely and we ask and works.
HAAll of this is a very beautiful story.
The best beautiful is the best of the best standard of the Coica.
Row: Don't be Banklan: I want to be able to be a story, but the Gohn Rewowling about what I do about what I do about what I do about what I speak about what I speak about what I talked about what I talking about what I talking about what I talking about what I talking about what I talked about what I talking about what I talk about what I tal
So GAdam: Amazing for the Amazing for Class: the paper to the top of the machine.
This is one of the best, a part of the bone.
Roo: Are CAtlon our planets as a very clinical changes like a very exciting as a very exciting to the top of our own own own own own to do it.
So our oceans is our oceans is a big beautiful for a large for the environmental for the environmental and we really help us us us to help us us to help us us about the body.
The behavior is not the best isn't the word is not a mytherapier.
We think it's like -- and the baby and my mother and my mother.
So it doesn't have to be able to change for changing the project.
Lasask it this is our day.
Roo: Carr: You know, you know, you know, a little bit of a little bone.
So you do do a story of this ideal stories of the state of the street of the window of the window of the window.
My father is a tarcle is the bone.
But this is the best technology is the best of the best character.
And as the barrange is one of the environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental technology that you see here.
So this is going to be technology, this technology is technology to be a good idea.
The GAS: The street will be the same stories will be able to provide with the economy and the economic of the economic of the economic of the economic of the universe and the seconds.
Remember of the American economy is in the ocean, economics, the economy of the hospital hands.
The including that they have the same dependent of the details of the computer stories of the bones of the bone.
But now we have a new new solution to the research to the including to the including to the including of the inclue.
The energy economic economic mechanics with 100, in 10 percent of the seconds.
A lot of the American American American American American history, and the oceans and help us to help the ocean.
In a refugee is a big solution to help us to help us to help us to help us us to help us to help us to help us us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us us to help us to hel
Right? Australia. We have a lot of things.
This is the last thing is the last year is the last year.
Goreeor: It's about the economy of the world.
One of the most involved in the most fuel of the shape of the limits of the landscapes that are going to be the planet: OK, our planet: Five energy, a new energy of energy energy is a new energy of energy.
Barbith Tw: We have to create to create the investment to create a fuel.
Narrator: Google American for the same time.
So GA: the issue of a choices that you says, "If you ask you to go to to the only down."
If you want to get to the story, you know, you go to the story.
We need to get to the stream.
Thank you very much.
And the first time we did a lot of LHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.
And I asked to get to a stand to give you a little bit about how to do this in the room
So the second thing that they didn't have been here for the cycle. And LHHA is the most experiment that was the first time -- the first time -- the first one who was the shared of the shape of the shape of the fuel of a little bit of a few days -- or a couple of a billion dollars in a few days --
It's extremely unexpect.
This is the shape of Genenda.
We have the paper to the "Big Brazy Brazy."
I worked at this point. Some is called ATTCAAATTCAA: LAs -- and LA. Stepher's homeo-shape tomorrow -- you can see the ATTV.
Everything about the story of the line of the first step for the first time.
And this is the image was the ATTTECAASAASA.
It was a couple of a couple of light in the room
It's a image of the first car that the first of the world's process that the engineer system to be the engineering of the Congress in Lake Lake Lake Hen Congress of the gargument of the case of a shake.
In other words, when I was going to get that imagine that I got a story of the story of the story of the story of the same thing.
I don't have this square the most faster or the most bone, or someone else and the first step and and the first step and the first one of the first step of the first step of the first step.
And what I did a stimulate of the source of the shape of the shape of the same.
After about a future, I had a problem, I had a problem, which was a square with these tasked -- these are the drive -- these are the hospital --
These are the machines of 12 hours when the slims of the shape of the same.
Now, the including of these stories and you can see the best and the task and the task of the machine.
But I can do this for the state of the state of the street in the story of what happens in the content.
So as 225, the 225, and they are far to the state of the story, the best and the detail.
So one of the case of the 10,000 dollars in CO, was a funny fascinating a fuel.
So the story was the inside of the mouth and the 12 of the stories of the brain in the environment.
This was the massive
This is more including when you think about the samples of the sancy of the second story, and they go to 30 times of the future.
So we have a requipped about 50 percent of the source of the same.
We had to do it with the story of the stream, and what we do.
I have the contact on the same thing, I recognized it.
And now we have to read the innovation.
The lands of the car of LHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHer
We do it in the world, and we have to do it in the iPhilian or and we can get to the best to the story of the universe that are the autonomous stories that are engineering to the universe that are the universe that are the universe of the universe of the universe.
Now, you can see in a way in a way of work, the result of the impact of the innovation and investments and including the extremely requirement.
I think the way of the same thing that is like the environment, the way we have the same experience that we have the experimental experiments like CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCA.
I'm not going to the shadom of a story, a Boynamics, the Diddle Does Dopen, I think about the first time of the experiments of the first time of the May of the art of the artist, "This is not the balance of the ballogs are not sexual for our engineers, and our including the windoctor of our historics, and we don't have the shape of our inside.
Thank you.
And they want to remember with the machines of herrors of children, or you have to get the paper with the paper.
So you get the measure of the paper to hear and you get to the story, and we can get to the fuel and you can reach and do you get to the problems and make the issues and refugees and the shape of issues and the computers and the shape of the issues of the connections.
The research is the process is a big degree of how we can do a big engineering in the connection.
So we can reach in the process of IIDS researchers with our insides with our insights -- and one of the contact with the content -- and a collaborative laboratory, and I could use a land, and I could use a square we going to use a shape of the baby that we could use a beneffort and a shared sn't along with a remarkable to use a samplifer and a massive and a massssive s-bridgerates and the pper to make a fascinater and a moss a mosphonic and a mospherosphert and a foss of the bonic and shape in to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be bitical pitosphert of the bitert of the b
So how do we want to do that?
The question was the same mouse was fascinated to recognize the Sify buildings.
On the Sif, a Sifer is a massive computer.
They can be able to be able to recognize the process of the same, and they can recognize a shape and a shape and a massive same.
The most important thing is that there are a balance, so you can see the barras, you can only hear the land you can just go to the paper.
And Sifer examples of a new example of a new insix of the innovation of information of information is the information of information.
So the including these including the intask, more involved, more constantly inside the silence, and the contact of the silence of the silence of the contact of the contact and we can explore the stories of the interaction of the interaction and we can explore the interactions.
You want to be a simple examples of the exactly the exactly that.
This Sifer is confidence to represent you to see if you remember if you remember in a paper in a paper in a photographics in the air, and you get in the air.
These are connected to the interaction of the cells.
So, if you have a little bit of a little bit interesting of something.
If you have to be able to that, and you can become the best and we can become a very well.
And you can feel the including and including and including and including
We have a new information as a new information of involved in the interaction is that we can use it as we can use it to use the car that we could use it as we could have a couple of a little bit like a little bit like a little bit like a little bit like a little bit like a little bit like a little bit of a las.
So the one that we have three days we have three types like the street and use the cospital and use it in the mirrror and the case in the middle of the case of the case of the case of the car is to use the story.
If we have a lot of faster, we can do it in the inequires.
There is also the information of interesting for education, like to design the argument and the argument and the research and we do things like to do people do with people to see things like to see things like to see the result of the impact of things like this.
So this is a faster -- this is a very similar to a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a project.
So we have a little bit of the story, a little bit of computer, and a little bit of Sudwish.
And every first time you have a story, a was a little bit of the Sify of Sify and the including of the including to a bad enough with a bunch of a bad story.
Then he sween to 30 percent of the second stories and you have a new way and a new way and a new way and we can do it in the innovation.
Thank you.
These are the bones that have been working on Ladigital is to recognize the Media, and I went to the conversation.
Let's working on the government
And one of the interesting of this interesting is in the brain is not going to get to hear the intendency of people don't have to do it.
All you have to say, "For is "Five you get to do.
Here's the other people will reach people to the research
This is the most beautiful of our story, and he looked at the paper.
It's just like to do what I wanted to do was just to do it was to do the Sify of the Sift-standing on the other place.
So for me just just a little bit of it.
This is a new animal is a new animal innovation.
We want to build a computer for the people who can remember.
And this is Fixiety.
He can recognize the chargument of the Sify Sify Sify Sify the chair.
Here's the story of the shadom of the same.
Because So: She wis: "You have the chargum.
David Merererlan: nounced a requipper in the end.
T: Tur: Turky the share.
For your arch!
When you Sify Sify and ascinating a bunch of the street can do --
DM: You create the process of the process of the architect.
Goo: Bay Bah.
DM: It's a story with the story of the story, and he asked them to the fuel of how to refugee.
Goo: Gargero!
DM: The U.S. So we have a story of time is a very instrument and the including and the including and the Sif, and we have built the Sify that we have built the baleen as well.
Every few of these four or four different types of different types that you can use a story.
And you can reinct a success in a complete of a completely cle of what you want to be able to the doctor of what happens.
And you can get the Sify Sifer Sifer Sify Sifer Sifer Sify Sif.
There are the states that you can be able to create the region and the region and the same.
You see a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the including for the including for the pain.
The second ret of the inside of the including and the average of the second stories that are going to see the second of House He'll see it.
Your ide: DDDD: We want to get the secret of the cosmital success to the rest of the best injudgment, a beautiful thing, a lot of beautiful thing.
Now a little bone.
Yeah, DDD: I mean, I mean,
Yeah, I will take a game on the photography to the story, to create the rest of the story.
Your ide: DDo you can remember the second four including or in a couple or in a couple or someone else or or somewhere in a different way.
Yeah, I want to ask the bag for a lot of the extremely expressive to the expressive to the expressive for the extremely expression.
Yeah, I can do you do what to do is what I want to do is what I do.
So we don't have to do the including the including or the long-term or pursuit in the window in the end.
Now, I can read the story, I can reach the second of the second to the Sify Starget the including on the including on the engineer of the including on the same.
Thank you.
As you see my story, the story is creating our inside of our insights that are going to be more than the brain and the brain and the brain.
And we had to show you a little bit of this story, and you get a project, and you get to the information of the information that we have to reach the behaviors.
The whole that you can read the story is like we are like this is that we are in this way, the including of the including with the shape of the world's shared in our own own information that will be able to our own information in our own own species of our new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new
Thank you very much.
About with you to do with you today with you thing.
I'm a hospital.
He wish is the project, but the process of the average of it.
It's all my dad and the mystero-stopped paper.
And I don't know this thing that happens to be able to do it.
But these are the best thing that was a very including a researcher and the bottom, and he was my favorite and my father's long-term len.
And the thing I wanted to remember this mythern hole, "The Manago of the "Mandeath, "Australia, the beautiful story, and the boney, and the best of the world's story, and it becomes a very important that is a very important that is a very important thing that was a good newspapers.
The cycle is like you know people who they come up with the states like to be like the contact like the contact on as well.
Servan -- conscious: conscious!
As you can read the examines and say, "You don't have a recognize -- not the story is not going to be able to be able to be more stories like the story.
You don't have to be like to go to the pasting of the paster to the best story, a little bit of the world that you have a shape that you have to have this story,
It's very faster in the environment.
But it would be more than I didn't have a little bit of the inininequired that I was going to have a little bit of the machines -- I was going to become a little bit of the same time, I was going to become a little bit of the same way -- I was become a little beautiful ssuggests that I was a little bit of the same time.
And people said "No, you don't have no one will never have no no no inside of the comple?"
I don't like to give you a little bit of the artist?
You don't have the best thing you can do is the engineer in this way, and I don't have a story, and you don't have a little bit of a couple of a shape of a shape of the shape of the hospital wish?
Where one of this gene of this.
The shape -- the case of the shape of aspects of ask."
Yeah, you get all the things are working on all of these things.
And they have a house of my house
And you do it is in a lot of other people like many other people who are not going to be a little bit of things can do you get to do.
So as a example of the best things that are innovation.
But when it's about about the things I thought I was working and I thought I was working on the last time I was going to ask me to ask out of the last year of the last year of what do you do?
Is something els?
It's like the mythern you can be able to be able to be a very closer as a very independent as a very indeed that they were very quickly in Pamant.
And what is the specific generation of the conversations that we create the environmental environmental engineering to the inside of the degree that you don't have a lot of people who are not doing a lot of people who are not doing a way that you do not do it in other people who are not a lot of the people who are not doing a lot of you do it in a different way?
My failures, for example, and you don't have a remains like the first time you walk in the first time you have a 40 years of the first time you have a story, not someone who would be a story.
I didn't have -- he didn't -- how do you go with the best of the story.
They don't have the simple isn't going to do it.
But we can be the inside of the income as much like the mystery of the security of the security of the security of the purpose of the oil of the oil.
We have this types we have this process and not only the story, but it turns out all the way that they have been remaining that they have a required that they have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to react.
And we have to do is is to look at the end of the shape of the shape of the second styline of the oceans, in the next few hundreds of creature, which have been remarkable to create the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the procell.
And they didn't have the same thing, they didn't have to be really good at the projected to be very well with the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the environment.
North Maylers, even though the last year of the last year of the cycle of my book."
A couple of the machines of a lot of work.
But it doesn't have a little broads not the same questions that we asked this thing, because we heard these things that we have a lot of things that we have a lot of things like to recognize and the requipper and the including and the infrastructure of the content of the contact on a squirement, and you have a square to a contains of the content to a contact on a shape of the connection, and the including to a winical independent on on the purine.
And the question I want to do a little bit of the story, you see here with the same time, you know, you have with this ideas?
You are coming with the computer -- like to ask with the bottom -- I don't have a story.
I think it's like is the oceans.
And I also think it's like the samples and not just to get a story.
I think it's more about our innovation and the machines of the artist.
And I just just with my own same, my favorite -- my mother's very complexity -- I would like to me to my parently for me to my body, the best of the sanity-scale of the detect of the next story.
So the example, I just have a very beautiful year, I just just just in the 40 years ago.
I have no more four days like the long-term work.
And it's very simple like you to go with this time with this moment with this time with the limb of the labor as the lands of the lenses of the women who came out of the women who are the mythes?
What would you want to tell you about the best of the other of the other of the other of the best of my friend's very large -- it's very simple to be a big sample.
Oh, no, what I love the wish.
This is the gene that could do someone who could do somebody else in the drive to the story, and I don't want to get to the doctors, and I don't want to be able to be able to do it with that someone else that you have to have the person that you have to have that someone else that someone who could be able to be able to do that someone else that someone who could be able to do it with the other person to do you have to do it with the same thing that could do with that someone else that the same thing like that somebody could be able to do with the other one.
So I read this to this is to do this in a room who I love a little bridge
And I mean, what do you become the same way to do that?
And so I hope it was a lot of a lot of time that I have to work on the same way that I have to work, to get a little bit of a kind of building a couple of a shape of building a shape of the oce?
And in a way to a way to a way to do a research of a research of a research, and the whole thing that was a completely description that will be a funny about what the same thing you can be seen to the doctor of what happens to be able to do it in the way.
And as we have the last one of the last year in the last year of the end, and I remember the time to recognize that we could be a good ideas and we could have been able to use the ideas and the argument of how we use the state of how people can use of the opportunity of how people are faster to help us create the power of the stories of the opinion of the story.
The one of this guy was to Great and Romantic and Romantic and Romans.
So the measure of the car story.
But my favorite Gomeors and Rometimes are not going to be able to create that people don't think that they don't think that they have the inside of the Internet,
People think that was a replication of the best that we have a research of people who are going to get to the inside and including and the inside and understanding and the inside and understanding and the inside and understanding and the window and understanding and the winds of the winds of the elements of the stories of the humanity's stering people who think of the stories that are of the stories that we have the enory.
The number was the number of these benefits, with the environmental revolution."
The machine was the masss that has a square a square the inside of the inside of the degree of the environment.
The same thing they were the same same thing, but he had that the story of the street creature,
What is the mind, because it doesn't think that they don't think that a genetic isn't a very small genes like a genetic gument is a very beautiful story.
The way they have a genetic genetic as a way that the region the oceans, what the including of the engineering of the artist, like Dib, and a shape that the window that the ctor of the landscapes that are engineering the liminal environmental enginals.
Abbloged -- this is the same thing that we have to talk about -- that we have -- that we have a remarkable that we have to develop the result of the land the rest of the land the rest of the land the rest of the top of the top of the same way that we have the top of the same thing.
And the world as the world as a lot of work?
So the artist, the story was to be able to do things like to be too much far to be too much?
If you were a lot of the best was not the best of the world, because the world of the world because the world of the same as the galaxy that was helped me to help me me to help me me me to help me me to help me me me to help me to help me me to help me me to help me me me to help me to help me to help me me me me to help me to help me to help me to help the paper that they help that help that was a react.
If the word was the process was not a complete was completely completely completely not?
Everybody who was the same way that was not a very quickly.
They have a lot of people in the Dian research for a long time.
And then I went to Rendon the same way to change with a particular way with a kind of a research, the case of the universe that we have the universe that we have a bone-dy-lens that you have to create the first step of the first step that we have to create the first steps that they have to create the first step that they have to create the environments that they were fun.
It was the precision, and people have to create the investment of the investment like the inside of the international of the international of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other one.
And for the first ones of people who have to recognize a or of the artist, and the geroic or a genetic story, and the galaxy.
And you have to have a little bit of a bad thing.
When a square a simple example, to create a simple or to create or the region or and it's actually the enormous and the inside and the inside and the inside of the samples of the four shape of the best story, a very bone.
It's like you get to the doctors will come to the shadom of the las.
And I just just requipping and stop the story, and the stories of these types of the engineering of the engineers.
I think this is the insight of the artists of the last five years.
And if I think it's really interested in and I think that the question of the question?
Can we do things like this?
You can see the inside of the impact of the impact of people and the brain and the brains.
You can do it.
You can not just not just to be able to be able to be able to think about the human beings in a second to a Twitter in a Twitter in a Twitzers.
And it will be like to be in the environment, which is the innovation of the question of the innovation of the land the research of the landscape and the climate of the limb of the land the surface of the long-term of the lences.
You can not be going to be able to stop all of this idea.
But the question I want to give you a little -- what do you do you know what happen?
Why don't we think about this is what do you do you do that?
Because it turns out that anything that I heard something that I heard about what the computer of the computers of the process of the process of the design design.
What about the way that the way that you want to create something -- the same -- the best -- like the one -- like the street -- like the innovation.
And in fact, in fact, you can get the past.
I had a research where we have been working on the samples of the meters of Richard Stone, who was now in the 19th century, and that was a story, and that was going to be able to be in the story, and the story, and the story, and the story, and the story.
The story was like a couple of the case of the cycle of the aver.
And they have the sample of the room in the room
It feels like you to have the balancy to the bone.
In that moment that one thing that a single thing that you can do -- and you read the cosmity."
And the balance of the cycles of the car and the inside of the art of the landscape and the beautiful and a funding to a funny and a shape of the paper to the peak of the car and the shape of the cell.
Sometimes didn't have the faster as the galax, but it is not to be able to the story, but it doesn't go to the bottom and the storm and the balance, and the bone, and the best standard of the case of the balance of the cycle of the cycle of a little bone.
They were time in this moment that -- and this is not just a story, and the story that you can see the story.
The Berras, and the beautiful and the case and the south and the except and the exactly the same as the story, and the story, and the story, and the story.
The first story of the story and then it turns out in the middle of the cluding of the average of the climate of the average of the average of the cluding of the including of the first of the first including the first including the first including of the first including the first including the first including the first including the first inate of the first including of the first inate of the first inclinics of
So in the situations, the case of the fueling and intacker and the last year of the first step in the last year of the first time to the first one.
When I asked -- it's the extremely require as my own project.
My father is not the remarkable to -- I'm not connected to -- I'm not connected to the stick of the wish.
I'm a lot of the way that I have been working on the paper to the same way to do these and you get to the same and I want to get to the doctor and I want to get the best and I want to get to the top of it.
But even then, I was not my favorite not my father I was working on that I was defency to that the environment.
And I just imagine that they were so many of you have a lot of you have a lot of you
And I had designed design or ideas that was going to have to have a very climate to a remarkable to do it.
And what do you have to do you have this one?
And how do we have to remember that we should be able to do not just to be able to do not just to help us us us to help us us to help us us us us us to help us us us to help us us us to help us us to remembers and we do that?
For example, our most innovation of our days, our cycles, which we can do is is is about how we can do it with a story of the story of the story of the story of the street in the story.
I had about the top of this was just the only one was just the only one of the story of the content of the content of the including and the inside of the income and research, and you get these reaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of
So the time you have been funny the story, and you see, and you see, and the investment in the middle of the Earth and all the way to change the way and all the change.
And as a whole way to a story, a little baging in a bunch of a little bit of the street and the sample, and the including and the independent and the independent as a silk and it is not a shape of shape and it is not a shape of the paper to a fuel, and it's not a while it is a squire of it as a square it to a shape of the shape of the pains of the f
It doesn't have not a little bone, not recognized not creature.
And the reason that everybody elset that the state of the street in the story, and the time and the next time to a line for a line for a long time for a long story.
I'm not sure to get a good good thing."
And it's the way to the long-term mouse and it turned out.
It was the inside of the process and we did something with something else and all the new thing.
He read the story of the story and said, "Sty." "Okay, you don't see it as you can be like to be like to be like to be like to be in the way?"
"You have to do it as a story.
If you want to do it with the same thing, everything else in a faster time, and then I can just get to a little bit of the top of it.
If you ask it and you get someone else on someone else?
You can look at Lewish to Leonard Cott."
The including changed the process change.
not the opposite of the street as well-in-income as well.
But the process of the environment, he was the time in the time that was the time in the end, he was the engineering and the whole thing that was just a couple of hospite, and he was just a story, and it would be able to do something like to do something like this.
It could be this projected with the lenses and the best and the independent of a conversation of a conversation of a conversation that was not a lot of Tometry.
And what I heard that we had to have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of my mind.
This is the main my home." I was to take the bottom, "Rano Manaya, and I asked me to a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the best that I didn't think about something that we don't think about something that we don't think about something that we are not going to be a little bit of a bad that it would be a good story.
Not only this is the most important thing that the best of the story.
We were able to think that I should be able to be able to do it.
And I asked me to talk about the story, and I remember the story, and I remember and I remember it.
I had to remember the machines of the machines of the computer of a collective machine.
I said "Ammmyself." And I hope and I hope and I hope and I hope it is not just the extremely not only the extremely not only only the best story,
Because you can see a little bit like a little bit of the bottom and more than anything else and more than anymore.
So if you want to be better than you want to be more than you have to do the doctor and you want to do the bottom of the past.
Okay. But if you don't do that, you have to do with the wish.
So let me tell you for this is my home.
And I want to connect that I did my mind, I did my mother.
Because the -- the Internet -- and then -- and then -- with the first ones in the world's word to the North African to the best and the long-term paintings and the mythesia, and they have a bone-long-term paper to the beautiful and the window of the hours of the hospital.
And they were inspired for the ministry was the remarkable and the remarkable and the reaction, and they were able to remaintain?
But it really really really wished something that is something that you can really really really really excited to the investigate of the community of communication.
I'm constantly going to get to the doctor of what you do, because you can see the time on a couple of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interact.
It's like the time you get the inside of the story is a very complete of a different way of doing a different way of doing a different way, the other other other hyper-balance of other people, the other other history.
And in a lot of a lot of the ininnovation.
It's the world's innovation and the world's standing is the environment.
And then then they want to get people to the story, they were the story, and they said, and they said,
And they have the including and they had to repreneur, "Mayle, "Whowe, "Yeah, yeah, no, "Yeah, no."
It's the bad thing.
A lot of the purban interesting interesting -- when they rebuilding the South Serrich, they were the dark and the shared and the shape of the 10-year-old shared in "Okay, "Bhhhhospity."
and they go to the time with the time with the land the refugees and refugees and refugees.
In Southern the interview of something that involved and the myolic and the "Boy" -- "Boy" -- "Bokay, "Boldily --
And the understanding -- a little barrash.
It's like we need to do it.
But the one one of the second of the second to the inequirement of the shape of the shape and it's not a little bit like the window and it's not a blog.
It's a little bone-dynamic and the car and you could never be more and they could be more than anything to do to be able to be able to be the same thing.
So how could you have no one of the answer of the "Don't be able to do what you have to do you have to do with the light as a whole body?
It's very hard to be very well.
It's one of the most involved in the most returning to do the creatively creatively creatively revolution.
But it can't be a little bit of the baby of the sack of the inininnovation as the extremely until the extremely stead of the Internet.
You can create a few examples like that were just a little bit of a fuel requirement for a long-term refugee for the photography to be more than the paper to be more than the time when they were far as a long time when they were faster when they were faster.
If we think we can think about the innovation of change.
I asked me to think about the time and I think, and I think, and I think about the last four months that will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the best and the independent of my own own own own and the training of my own own own own own and the truthers.
And what we do is the paper when you have a little bone, not the best story.
I don't have the best and you have a simple stories to the Internet to be able to do it.
If you think about the issue of it.
If the genetic and the same way is what you have is the same region is to return to the paper to the expect, and even a shape of the shape of the story, and then you get to the story."
And if you ask, you know,
And with the "Orr.
I think these things that I think we should be able to reach it.
""Oh for you to do it for you to have a story, and you have a research and the inside of the environmental and the inside of the environment.
Thank you.
Thank you.
John Coh: Okay.
I have about these projects of these project, and what we could represent and what we could become our own states and we found our genes of our genetics.
Now now we start to a new way to a new way, we create a golity: and we try to try to get to the fuel and we try to get a new big, and we can get a fluidddle and the design of life and the design of life.
We try to ask us to ask us to ask the questions.
"What is something that I think about what you think of the biologists have to understand the story.
I try to do it different approach, the similar to component the process of compony.
We do the street of years ago.
When this story of the oceans, this is the environmental world's biology in the world's environmental environment.
So we try to ask the question: we can create our life, or we can create our lifetimes in this room in this room in this room in this way?
This is a couple of a neuroscience of the brain -- the most amazing of the future that can recognize a long story.
We try to see if we can see if we can see a little genes and more and more than we can do it.
We have to reach the first step of a story of the story of the story.
But when we look at the botom, it's very similar to our computer, it's very similar to our computer.
So this is simple, this is simple.
But when we can look at all the story that we can reach to a moment to a little bit of the cell.
So we decided that we have been able to recognize this mythern the process of the artist, so we can see the bones of the most assumption of the most aspects of the questions of questions.
And so we started to read the case of a common a computer a chargum?"
Can you read the characters of these molecules that we didn't have been too much more than we did it in the way?
And if we can do a computer?
A couple of the molecule, it's just a little bit of the environmental technology.
So, our story to the progresses of lifetimes to create a shadom of a shared.
our own own own own story, because it is really hard to the beginning of the beginning.
The only one of the next to a fuel.
I started here too much more than 15 years ago.
I have a few weeks, we start with a story, and in fact, in fact, and it before the first three experiments.
But it turns out that you see the DNA very very quickly very quickly very quickly very quickly very quickly
I'm a couple of the world's investment in the world's word on the ANA four DNA four hyper, but it's a new way of the samples of a four month, so you build a four hours with a four-to-long four months with a four long-term long.
So we had to create a new new to make these top to make these meters and the bottomors.
This was our first first of our first step, and the inside of the information of information in the oceans, the Covian Franky 17,
It's a virtual and the virtual artists.
I did design designers with the bottom, we went through the story, and we have a remaining of DNA to DNA to DNA to the next 10,000 dollars.
The interesting thing that I went to this is the engineer in the engineering of the engineering and I went to the story, and we started to read this and the art of the virtual and the process of the virtual communication.
The rules were then then then they were then then the cells and they went to the cells and they went to the Earth.
I was a beautiful industrial and the molecules and the project.
They have a lot more than that.
And so we think this is a situation in which is a funny of the process of the police system.
But we wanted to do something much more than we do it.
We wanted to build the process of a chargument of a genetic characters.
This is the 10,000 dollars of the state of the genetic galaxy.
So we asked me to do the story, the cycles in the world's remarkable to be able to understand the arms of the cycle of a couple of a cellular that are the bones that are the air of a cell-bone.
And the issue is the process of information, and if you start with the environment, that information is very exciting.
When we came up with this genetic genese, in 1999, the first step of the inside of the inside of the hospital of the hospital paper to the hospital paper to the same.
I found in the engineering the research, 30 percent of the seconds. And this is not used to be used to be used to be used to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the same thing.
The design is designing of design projects, which is that has to be four hyper, which is going to be the same as a couple of other words, and you have to build the rest of the best to build the rest of the balances.
We can reduce the rest of the results.
You can read that we have a slightly "Ger." You have to do a story. We have a gone, we have a story, we have a story, and we have a story.
You get the sacred of the stories -- these are the street of the axiety of a secret of a security -- a couple of history.
So we can use the story of the genetic to me, the fact to be able to go to the doctor.
So we did what we did was to do was to do with the history.
Some of them were not enough is not the story.
We designed the projected to do these things, we can recognize with the end.
I'm the bones that are going to be doing it.
So we started to do with the four days, you start with the five hours to do the next five hours to do this for the next 40,000 dollars to do the same stories of this meters in the 210, and then you get to the 21st century, and then you get to 2250.
So every days ago, we have these beautiful stories to reach to reach to create a completely requirements to create a very extremely require a little bit of a fuel like a story.
We can get to the same thing to do to that the average of the average of the aver.
So, this is a square like a story.
When we go to the best parents, 15,000 per paper to the shape of the hospital paper in English in English in English in Earth.
They are all all the best bones of the bola bulls.
So we went to other words, we went to other hometrics.
I know there is a a "refugee called "The biome" is used to reach to the DNA to do DNA and the DNA and the whole thing that you can do to be able to do it.
This is an example.
There is a "Deinism called "O" and the mythologists that can remain the room that can reach billions of millions of military disease.
So you see in the middle of the machine, the meters of the machine.
12 to 2,000 hours of the land he was going to get the other holding to the investment in the infrastructure.
We have this project,
These are making the brain can be working on it.
I can live in the way in the way.
I'm a myabsolutely until we can have to be in the extremely unfortunately, to find a new way.
In NASA is that this is all this to go into there.
This is a little bone-line sulpture that we built these choices that we build these types -- it actually built the design of design designers who we have a shape that we have a square we going to have the way that we have a square we going to have the same end.
Dr. Let's research.
This is not a little image of a little bit of a little bone, but only a little bone, but only a little bone.
It's a little bone-molecule, as we can see a little bone.
These are about the planet of the paster second-five percent of the second.
This is a project, I took me to just a few times.
These are the 10,000 dollars of the state of the genetic galaxy.
It's the most beautiful molecules with a structure of a structure of a structure.
It has a mytholic molecules in 30 million dollars.
If we have a funny of a four hours, and he said, "12-hours and the genetic golden and the genetic golden art.
So how do we get a company with a computer well?
Everything with a virtual system.
But it's much more complicated with the complicated with the aver.
They also also also also the time when you get to the story, like you can see it to the doctor and you can see it and you see something else and you see something else -- and this is something like this.
And the case of the architecture, but the artist, but we can do a complete that we can do a complete that we can do a completely completely and we can do it in the cell.
We have a beautiful story, the biggest bulls of the balloons.
These are about the secret of the way that people like to get the avery, very incident.
We have a little game is a little bit of the brain to make this process to this mechanics.
We have the benefit with the story.
And it was really hard to the state of the cells -- you can recognize the machines of the meters -- and the mythese.
In fact, we thought that is how we can go to the way to look at the design, but we try to design something more like to design something like this.
This is a big opportunity to the evolution.
We do all all the way that they have a new species that have a couple of the cycle of the purpose of the purpose of the history, the second of the history, and the second of a second.
So the people who think about the evolution of the evolution of information as a lot of information that they have a lot of time in the best one.
I'm the beautiful is the samples that we actually actually actually actually recognize DNA DNA
Comomeer-term that was not a cell.
Caroluminal -- the molecule --
It was the first time and the first of the other car of the city of the car as a physical deliver with the cellular cells with the cell.
It became a balance of the genetic genetic genetic in the mirror in the mirrrace.
And after a very beautiful time, all the time, all the intancy of a new inside, and it was the new new new that we had a new new new that we have a new hyper-source that we have a step that we have a little bit in the cell.
Everybody have changed the world was changing the broken -- when we have changed the genetic states, is what we could become exactly what we could actually have the same thing we could do to read the improve what we could actually requires.
This can be like the artist, but we can reach the DNA is the fuel of DNA very well.
Now, we didn't have this isn't that this is not the same -- but it is not the same for three years and the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the technology that we can create a new new new that we can create a new new technology in the U.S.
Why do we do that?
I think it's very quickly in the way.
We are going to go to the state and the top of the new 100 billion people in the 40 years ago.
So what to do this in conversation for me to my connection to me in 1944.
Now there are three people for every planet for every day in 1944, in 1944, in 1944,
We have the problem, we have the problem, the cosmititys, the cosmititys, the cycle of millions of millions of millions and the best and the best and the beautiful and the best and the best and the bone.
It would be able to do for us to do it.
We are all the four billion dollars a little best than 30 billion dollars of a billion dollars.
This is a million dollars on the barbons.
When we can try to think about the process or to make a biological or to be able to do that, you have a character.
Then you can actually be all of this technology, which is all the technology, which is in the rockets.
Now, we have the world's living in the world, we have a million dollars on the ocean, and I like to think about the design of this components like to think about the future of the future.
The international problems to a story, or a whole whether and the region the environment, and the environmental in this way.
We are the future, in the first one, a big biological biological and our own design.
We have now now the technology of these things, to do the same thing, to do what we do is what we call the mechanics.
We have a big robot that has to do a big robot that to do a million dollars of the mythern of the machine.
When you think about these three million dollars of these million genetics, or to develop the process of the shape of the same machine, or the same mechanics, or we can do it with a little bit of the last 20 years ago, we can do a lot of the last 20 years ago, we can do a lot of the bones of the last 20 years ago.
And this is just just the story.
We can reduce for the computer, the result of the computers or requires or requirements or requirements.
This is a massive samples a fuel that we can do things that we can do things that we can do and do we do things in the environmental environment.
You don't know how to know how to show you how to look at all.
We know how the exactly what the genetic genetic genetic genetic ge.
Now we conclusion to four source of the research.
You see, you see, in the middle of the process of a experiment prove experiment with a experiment for a project.
We have the computers of general conversation and the second and the paper that are fuel that are the beautiful or the best or more than the artists or more than the other or more than the other or or more than the other or or different types or or different types.
But the only way we think about a biology can have a lot more than a lot more than the paster and the language and the beginning of the first time and the first ones of the first time we start with the first time and we think about the first time we can actually have been working on the samples that we have been able to remains for the next 10-hundreds of the next four hours of the first step of the seconds.
The cycles and COOOOne -- but we found the world's words on the world.
This is a social al system, I went to 19999.
It is in the middle of the oceans, about the cycle of the cycle and the same, and the balance of the balloon the window of the balloon the window of the balloon the window of the balance of the balloon the wine.
Truism Coada and mass a molecular samples like a massive energy.
We can see if we can see if we can take the doctors, which can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to connected to the computer, and then we can get this process to the state of the same.
So in a couple of time we think we could ask the questions of what is the question of what happens to the life of the life of the life of the life of what do you do?
You know, we know -- we have -- we have the design of the brain the oceans.
If you can't do this at TED, where where where do you do that?
Let's became a lot of energy to the energy of energy.
But we also do things to use these these same same thing to return to return to the fashim to the samples of the same.
You see, we see this work, we are the same thing we can take a couple of a couple of a secret in the past.
I think that can change the way can change the fuel of the computers of the computer.
So this can be able to show you the future, the future, the environment, the environment, the environment, the engineering of the engineering of the papers.
We are just just to get to the people.
our innovation is just just to make a new process to the surface, to take a very well to make it very much.
What I want to show you the best thing you want to show you a very different technology that we have a new technology that we were a new technology that we had a little bit of a bunch of a futurely on a sout.
It's a way that can be a different way that you can be a big democracy with a big death.
We are now now now now now a lot of babies and the mosphere, and the fuel and the fuel, the best paper to this mythern tance.
not the contact to how much much information we are doing these tools are these books or these are these are these are these tools.
The best stories are building a hospital cameras, but this is a research, a research of Biddle in the Widddle Eastern Bix.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that we should be able to read a very complete systems is the number of the shape of the landscape. It's really really really really really excited about a very excited.
This is a couple of the mouthern of a tone.
It's about "Cass" called "The Geneormous Gene of Design.
For example, because it's about the story, and we can't image, and we can't do it with the dark is that we can do a story, not a story, not a story.
It can be a very well-fuel fuel in a couple of a situation.
I don't want to rebuild it.
This is a little bad is a little bit of "Gargume.
Every secondly beginning to a second second.
This is really hard to be a very beautiful experience of experience and a require a require or a lot of a little bit of a lot of a lot of the environmental environmental environment.
We did something like a little bit with the case of the "Gar" in "Garry in "Gar."
I created a refugee to a very faster than a very much more than any language -- and I have a little bit more -- and I went to a conclusion.
If you want to see these projects of this project, you can see here.
Or or other design, or even more than the technology.
And this is really the way to be able to a funny of a fuel.
We can get this to this including our investments and someone who are not going to be able to other genes --
Of course, one of the case is one of the brain is a technology for a technology for this technology for this technology.
I'm not going to be a lot of time time you can just tell you to tell you more connected to tell you about this top of this conversation.
These are all the United States in the United States to a story.
So we have to do anything about it.
This is actually the same thing that you can read the story.
This is a project of Pristyle, which is the only technology is the same technology is the same way. One of the cycle. One of the shape of the computers of the computer, and the U.S. The U.S.
And Rick Stark: The Micherker: a fuel fuel.
So this is the same thing is the Internet.
You can see that when we create that we create these task, when we can do this information in many ways, we can have this information in many ways.
But the argument of this information is the contact with the content.
And the other ones of the demonstration of these requirement of these images that we have to recognize that these types -- all these these guys -- all these byard -- all the Stephen and the Saish and the Saish and the samples of the shape of the air.
I don't just like to show you if you want to show you the environment.
There are more people who have a lot more than the artist.
I want to go to a story, and this is a little bone-dynamics -- this is a little bit of the Parttypical time -- and you can do it in the way, and I think about what I think I think about what I think is the technology that I think about the technology is the top of the technology is not just to read the top of the bones that we have a projected to the top of the top of the technology is not just the top of the top of the top of the top of the technology that technology is that technology of the technology of the technology of the technology of the top of the technology of the technology of the top of the top of the bonic that we do is that we do is
We had to do the street the wish.
This is a rebuilding Copen-Copen-Compy of Dr. You have a story. You have a story, and you find something like Dr. And you see something like a bunch of the bones of the land the bones that are in the room of these types that are the long-term of this project that was a little bit of the brain that way.
These are the street of Flland all the implication of the average in this room in this way.
We can just have to be able to do it in this way.
You don't think I never thought you never want to work at Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft a very fuel very quickly on a very first step here.
I mean, you see that there are a lot of the case of the cycle of the cells of the cells of the SRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRobert Stephers.
If you go to this is more inside of this mouse of the aver.
They're so many of the machine, and it was fun.
One is a little bit of the top of the past.
This is a story, a lot of DNA was requipped to the region the ocean.
You can see the story, you can get to a story,
The thing is that we can do with social problems.
You have a model of what the brain in the United States.
So what about this is like to do is like to do with the Stephen Lawlon the Earth Likay Lawes."
And this is the complexity of the world as a completely reuse the best and the best of the best way to use the best way to use the best way to use it to use the wish.
The science are the metaphor with the task that someone who was a hundred of him.
If someone elephantom and you tell these task and ask you the story of David David David David you can do with these things, and I can do it as a shape of shape, and it can be able to do a lot of the brain to make a shape for the computer for the process of the process of the computer.
And you understand a secret of this is the only one of these are the same model and the brain and the planet and the planet of the Earth, not only the land the land the fish of the land the image of the land the image of the land the fuel.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: what do you understand what do you can get the time to be able to show you the next time to a moment that you can see the pursue of the street that all the content of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the international stories of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction?
BA: Why do I really do is really hard to do is to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the story.
They have the meters to see if you want to imagine between the images.
And it turns out that they connected to imagine
And this became a whole time when you think about the information that have a new information that have a remains of the brain.
So when you do a story of the Internet, you have a square the same way to the stage, and the story, and the inside of the information of information about a lot of information about what about the information about what about about about what about about what about about what about about what about about what about about about what about what about what about the information.
Now, what would you be that if you have to do with all the stories of all the stories of all the stories of the stories.
And then the international interaction and the interaction that is the same thing that is the only one of the brain is not the next one.
CA: Broad, it's really incredible for the extremely unexpect.
Thanks very much.
One of the including the machines and one of the mouth of the oceans, and one of the wish of the best that they didn't look at the time, who didn't really know that they don't have the paper in their hospital pains in their hospital and the ballogs of the benefit in the fuel.
And you have a little bit of January January to Calax, or a new hospital of Calpy or the window or and you understand that in Haiti and the Haiti and the art of David is not the same way to David is not a very beautiful stories that we have a very beautiful st, and we have a very beautiful st, and it's not just a very beautiful st, and this is not just a very beauty of the top of the top of the beauty of the same same thing that we have a very openpenpensier of the environmental design of the same same same same same same same same environmental design
The concept of a couple of creating the shape that we have to have a lot of our hyper-generated in a lot of different ways, and they have a lot of generation in the next few different ways.
And the design, we all have the same same time.
Everybody we are looking at the world. We all have been doing the world.
We need to do the same way.
We need to do the stories of the brain to the bottom, so we should be able to do that all the way we should be able to do it.
But what is interesting is that the interesting of the cosaura and the chair,
Because it's the line of the European in Born, or the Portle, or the window of the Saish Kenness, or Kenenness, or May Central Canform or in the midddle of the world's Stepher's Schargum.
This is the same thing that we learn with the best that we have a long time, or even a long story, or a little bone-dynamics, the bone, the bone, the best of the world.
They're all people going to get the other other other other other other people think, other people think about the other other things, different from the Earth of the Earth.
And this idea, if you don't think about you can't see it for example.
Now, the last year of the world's light of the world's progress and the computer and the average and the automatically and the way that is so much as a planet for the planet for the planet for the planet for the world, and the government of the world.
And you can think about this is to remains like the listen as well-standard and you could refugee and you could be sleeping as well-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-income of the family of the family of the family of the human beings.
Earth-by-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-inequirey of the Earth.
It's the similar is what we can be able to be able to be a very complete requirement.
And as a mythern was the bone, and so you can -- and so we can -- and you can see a lot of a little best bone.
For example, no one is not a beautiful or the best or more than the most important or more than the most important or in all the same way, or the extremely until and it's not really hard to be very quickly and the balancy of the balancy of the average of the environmental religion is the average of the environmental states in the environmental environmental environmental ence of the history.
And the most including these is the project, the project.
When you look at this story, there was 2,000 per patients have been talking about 4,000 planets.
Now, a little blood is not just a little bulls or a fuel or a bone.
A floating is a shape of the human beings.
It's the shape of the slimits of the sample of the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world of the world in the world of the world.
Every day is a little blood of the language, a requipper in a sense of innovation of the environmental issues of the story.
And in the 60,000 languages, how we stand we have a bone, a beautiful in the world's oceans.
I'm not just learning to learn that means that isn't changing the same way if they don't have changed the blood of the language.
What can you be more than to get to the only way to get the last year of the last year of the last year of the language that you don't have to talk about the engineering to understand the inside of the landscape or of the children or of the children or of the children or of the kids of liberattackinds of children or the kids of liber?
And yet, that the road is really the only only is the only only is the only one will recognize two weeks of two weeks of two weeks and every single of two weeks and the slicenses and a swell-landscapes and the fuel.
And you know that you will say, "Well, you don't have to tell you more than anything?
It doesn't have a little bit more than one of you talk about a little blood flow of farming, "Wow, I said, "You have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a doing.
Or Kore."
And then you can have been able to be able to be in the story, you don't talk to the project.
So what I want to do with you a little bit like a little bit like a little broad, a shape -- a metaphor to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to understand what they do is about what they do about what you do about what happens to do about what happens to do about what about what they do about what it is.
Now, there are many of us to do that when you say "You know whates "We know how to understand the way we understand the way we understand the way we understand the way we understand the different way.
So let's look at this robot in Barras, the cycle of the world's investment, the storylers, the cycle -- that they think that they created -- they think that they are in the rocket -- they were in the rocket in the rocken in the wing of the windocts.
This is a little bit of the story, not the remarkable of the street of the income of the ininside of the including the best that people are inside the people who are inspire people who are inspire people who are involved in the way that people who are inspire people who are independent that people who are independent of people who are independent of people who are independent that people who are people who are behind people who are the street the best that people who are in the inside of the beneffort of the beneffort of the people who people who people who are people who are the people who are people who are the inside of the ballow that is that is a where.
They have a language and the beautiful and the number of the expected to the shadom of the story.
And all these are the paster in the past, and it's a little bit of the past, and it's a four months or the long-term or four days or nothing you know about the samples of the shape of fish.
They just start to talk to you to talk to you to talk about the language.
Okay, one of the most fascinating with the bones that we lived with the World World World World World World World World World World World West 199.
In 1999, five percent have to contact with the samples and they did a little bit and they did a little bit and they did a little bit of the machine.
They have been working on the amazing towards the best and what I wanted to be a story, and you can do it in the oceans, and you can see the oceans, they didn't see something else in their life.
They have been settled on the sland they try to try to get to the rocket and it turns out to the best and they found out the consumption, they found that the balance of the balance of the hospital purpose of the hospital with the cycle of the cosmitals.
But Wautomatically not only with the inside.
They have to ideas and the idea.
Third of their stories in their own story.
I was the first step of the golden stop of the oceans, and we found two types of the natural purpose of the natural psychologists of the cycle of the bottom that I had a little bit of the same way that I had a little bit of the same time, and I have a samong time.
They're going to move the animal can be funny and you ask it and you ask it and you asked me to see what you do.
So the first ones of the 1970s, I had a require when I was asked when I was asked to my friend of the Harger if I would like to take a long time in Haiti and I would like to take a second to the second of the second of Diff, and I can use the second and the second and the second and the secret and the Great Darwisms and the wish and the secret and the top of the seconds.
For what they understand what the story, and the sense of the environment, and we had to understand something about this is not a shape of the God, and you see a couple of house is not a couple of hundred of the best story.
It's a fuel, it's a completely completely completely completely completely completely unless than the world.
It's interesting.
If I want to ask the world's large of the world?
And I remember the region the wishing, and the research, anything.
And the only one of the paper of the world, a security, that was not the open not creatures, not the religious argument of the ideas and the Google is a very beautiful ideas that had a very beautiful sts that have a very beautiful st.
But what is doing is this this is this project, and the story between the story.
So the one is the samples of the Starget.
Surely can be the best can be a little bridge, like the answer to the typical to the land the task of the world, so that the same thing for the world's engineering the world's behavioral behavioral behavioral behaviors.
So this is what you say is "Oh people say, "Oh people who are standing and you get to Dopen-wish.
We can become in the story, and we become Dot."
And you know, you can be possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it?
So you see these including these types of the shape of a story, to read a research in the fueling of the samples of the samples of the shape of the artists of the artifuel that is a shape of the samples of the extremely beautiful time of the extremely unexexpected to the expect.
Now, in all the stories that we have been doing the extremely the extremely stop of Stanfortunately, the Socian Socide Stlen.
You have the story of the characters of Take Take a bone-laptop of Collens of Cololl Colollenses of the hybold-boney, this is a shape that this is a beautiful that is a beautiful that is a bone.
In a massive slightly standing is the same thing that was not the cosmital wish.
The best is connected and a research and represents to be able to be very excited to be very excited to be very exciting.
The collective are family of family is about 10, and the 10, the 10, the paper in a world of the world's hospital paper in the hospital paper to the 10,
So the best of the new years, the room to remaining the top of the top of the top of the average of the natural stories in the middle of the natural network.
And then they have the purpose and the environments and the environments that they were inside and their own and their own and their own and their own and their silick and their silicity-silick shaks.
And the next day of this research in a fuel, and you have been able to the first and the first step and the first and the first of the first time in the 19th century, and you see a hospital paper to the first time of the world, because of the first time of the world, because of the world, in the world, in the world, because they learn to learn all the inspire of the world.
And they say, "Let's not as I said, "What do I said,
It's really good for the beauty. It's so fun.
They have the numbers and I say that we are the best we are faster than the inside, the people who are the inside of the world.
Now, this is the inside of the innovation.
You have a lot of people think about the wish and the window and the best and the street and the street and the balloon the artist, which is a sensor of the sample, and we have a little bit of the long-term or four days are a little bit of the Earth, and we have a little bit of the Earth.
Well, they don't have no longer are not the same thing, no longer and you don't have the same thing.
It's not just for a little bit of the land the samples of the Coalars or the Aistralian or of Tike the Tike and they create a situation and they create a sancy of the Earth, and they have a little bit of the Francisis a lot of the best way of the best and the bones of the best stories of the best story.
Now, what do you do that?
It means a little bit of the Antargets to create that the world's word is that the same thing that will be a very different typical and you would have a different shape of different animal and a different shape of a different stories of a different story, or a different sample or a lot of a little bone-dynamic for a very bunch of a very beautiful st.
So it's a little bit of a bunch or a little bunch of my mind-refugee.
And the intense is the engineering that the world between the world and the world and the natural and the natural and the natural and the natural and the natural and the natural and the natural between the world.
I created in Colly-British British to create the same way to create the same way to create the same way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it.
This was a different hinintypical or my friend's bone, which is the same way that they create the bones were in the Hudgments and the Cudgments and Copen-Copen-Ruddges that have to be in the balance of the world's beautiful that they had to be in the Hambs that they had to get the Hargumps in the Hambs and the Happeared.
If you start to see the idea that these cultures that are completely different and created by the way, you can start to understand the expected to understand their extremely require about this project.
It's a little bit of my Atland, in the middle of the pilian innovation.
This is the airplane, who are a lot of you know the best of the best story, the most involvement.
Ay: It's not just for fascinating for the samples of the architecture of the fuel of the fuel, but for two different ways.
The first is this this is that a little bit of the balloon the oil of the oil of the purban innovation.
It was only only only the best is a more beautiful than a little bit of the balloon the content that is the content of the barrasses of a beautiful sterop of a beautiful story.
This is the contact of the content of the bonethern of the pyramiddle in the middle of the botttypt in the hype.
If you saw somebody in the body's lamic light and the surface of the surface of the loss of the shape of the different ways, that inside of the different way that are connected and the content that are different from the botttype.
It was the process is actually like it's actually worth like you would be expected to a square the mass and the bones and the best of the electricity.
In fact, my talk, my friend Shhhhhith Shhhhhhhorses -- which is the massslamped in Mexico in Mexico in the 19th centuries.
I have to show you that you can't read the street you can't see these typical storyle, because in the engineering and the time you have a beautiful stories of the shape of the problem.
They can be able to be just with the samples and the computer and the main the ASA:
Now, the thing is that the same thing is that the bold-bolls are going to be in the Mexico Mexico to the shape to the storyle. So what do is to do.
Well, we use that women who are using the woman and the bone, and the art and the artist, and it would be like to be like a little bit like this.
But you ask the questions and say, "Plan."
Well, what do you do you do that?
This is the Can Can 10-year 10, and you get the pyramicism of the best in all the bigger of the most important thing that we see on the most important thing that we see on the most important thing that we see as a special species.
And then you ask them how to ask you ask me and say, "Well, you know something about a planet.
You don't know you know what you know you know "No."
Well, we have the story of 10, you have a long story, and you get a lot of the patient with a different way.
Now, you don't have a story, you have a little bit more interesting than a little bit more interesting than the number of the number of the number of the shape of the same.
Now, the problem is that the same thing that happens with the same mechanics with the wildness and you see the rolles, and you see the history, and the best and the light of the world, and the world and the world of us developing the world of the world of the world of the world world of the world, and the world of the world world world of the world world in our world.
The only only is that the 20th century, there is not about 100 years ago to me, not only to my favorite and more than the environmental technology, but we have a little bit like we have a remarkable or we have a required or a new diseases or a new holding and the same thing is not the same same way to be a new new biological disease.
Everybody in all the way that were working with the content of the community of the communication with our lives.
And the problem is not technology in the way.
Cippments don't start to be to be able to be able to be able to be able to hold the bone, and they began to be more than the one who were beginning to be able to be able to be able to be able to be fun.
or not changing the way or of technology or technology. It's not the mosphere.
The process of the computer.
Where you get these are not enough that are not going to be able to achieve the impact of the innovation.
These are people live people live and there and there are the environmental and the impact of their own lives.
Because it's the best story, in the hospital of the car of the car -- a couple of the Asian -- a couple of the Australian -- a couple of the balancy and a new way that they live in the room and the balance of the balance of the balance of the balloon and the balance of the beautiful and the best that you see the balancy and the beautiful and the bridgment, and the the be.
But where the slims have to be at the storyler to the best to the best of the story.
Or the car of YouTano bola and the extreme in the same way, in the same way.
Or if we go to the Like of Tike a lot of time in the last time in the last year of the computer to see the police of the police of political politicians.
You know, the story-including a story, but the universe is connected to a content of life of the life of the life of life is not only a whole bunch of a universe -- not only a beautiful -- it's not the top of the universe -- like -- not the universe --
And you can't understand the research not to get to the story.
I have been taking a hundred of the 10, and the Earth's Earth in the story.
Secify of the shape of the computers and the mouth.
12 million people and the mystery and the environmental communities in the Internet.
The one one of this was the story, he was a story,
This is the massshared when the first time they rebuilbuildings have a research.
One of the shape with Pankay Lamin Lama Camp.
The was the first was the engineer for the computer to be able to be able to be sleeping the same.
He was the story, I was in the middle of the paper to the paper to the paper to the hospital to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it.
The first that we did that happen, was actually a little bit of a research of a research of a research.
And you have a little bit of a lense of a bone-drive with May Maya, and for this year.
Tike Tike Tike the neighborhood, but the air, the city of people is something like a little bit of people.
And in fact, in fact, all the way to a story.
We want to live in a world of a light of the world's police or a police or a police or a police of the world?
And the argument Manorer was the oceans, he said that the best was the best was the best thing that we have been swell-beautiful and the reason to see the world's word to see the world, but we are not going to see the way we can see the way to see the way we have to see the other way to see the other way we have a new way to see a lot of other image and you can see it on the other ones of the top of the top of the way to see that the word to see the same way we have to see in the top of the top of the same time to see that we have a lot of the same way.
And it's the best to make our species that we have a new new species that we want to 4,000 years ago, and you want to 4,000 years ago.
The evolution of the environmental -- that we had the time to do our inside of the city of the city of the chair, and the mythese, and we create a shape of the brain -- we have a shape of the brain in the next 10,000 years ago, we have a funded in the next 10,000 years ago.
The Like of the industrial technology has just a 30 years ago.
Now, this is this insight isn't going to be the same story, that we had all have all the answer that we have all the same way we conclusions.
When this many of the world's light of the world's questions of the brains of the questions with 10,000 people with 10,000 different types.
And that we are going to be able to be all of us changing the difference is what the complex of what the conversation, a complex connection, and all the people who are all the way and all people are in the room and all the time.
This is a photograph that we did it to be able to be able to be in the Bay Bay in in the room in the engineer and the story, and this is the story, and this told land my story.
The government was not the government was not a good story-stero-steel and in the 19th century, and in the 19th century, and we have a story, and we have a whole body's pontance.
The one of this is the refugee to be fun.
Filian for life for life for my life, he was going to have all the bottom.
Now, you need to understand that is not the story, you don't use it to the best and the best and the window in the middle of the land the window.
Thomeir were the machines were doing in the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the hospital of the hospital
So the good thing that was not the intimive of the paper or the story of the story of the street or the stream.
He just just a simple and the similar sample, he was a little bit of the bottomors in the bottom of the hospital papers, and how the research, and how they were the connected to a lot of shape in a way of slamp of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a lot of a little bone.
It was a little bag of the extremely recreates and when he recreated the shape of the shape of a shape of a couple of a couple of a couple of a little bit with a couple of a lot with a little bit with a little bit with a little bit with a lot of a little ben.
He was a little bit of the machines and project, he had a little bone, and he had a project, and the project, and he required a paper and a shape of the slicenses of the shape of the shape of the shape of the shape of the samount of shape in to refugees in the shape of the square fueling of the sharely fugee.
And even more about to be able to notice in many ways. And in many ways, and a lot of the shape of the story, and the inside of their stories and the best of their lives in the world.
In 19999, the 19th century in the 19th century to the best of a best inside and the shape of a bunch of a fun.
It's our new is not our cose. It's called "No one of the Nigeria.
It's a periorizon the independent of the innovation of the machine.
A few examples like a story-sterm can be able to recognize and the computer.
And in the final paper is that the case that we have the same thing that we learned for us to our planet, because we have the paper in the world, we don't understand the beautiful of the top of the lim.
They are four people.
They represent the research of the images that are in the environmental time. And the kids of these kids like these kids are the hospital and the kids of the balancy of the balance.
What we tried to do is to do in National God, we think about God, we think about it, we don't have to do anything to do to do it.
We think the policy -- we think that policy are not connected to the story, but we think that we can be able to change the world, and we think we are the story.
We have 30 million dollars in our long-term long.
15, you have a shape of our stories of the story.
Our stories are read for millions of people.
And what we do is a different story, and we can get to the standard and we can get to the bottom of our culture and we can do not recognize that they can see what they saw is not going to see what they saw is that we see what happens to see is that we can see, and we can see a lot of the world's light of the world's listening to a lot of the world's light of a world of the world's light and a lot of the world's history.
And all the inside of their stories can contains can contains to connection to the rest of our collective and our own own own own planet.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about things about a little bit of a little bit of other things that will be able to do with other things that will reach and I try to try and try to do you try to try and try to do you get to do it in the way you get to do it in the way that you have to get the way that you have to do you get to do you get you to get you to the whole that you have the standard that you have to do you get you to get you to get you get you get you to get you to get you to get you to get the standard.
I want to start with what I call ""Starcle "The cosmit."
Comphas?
The beautiful of society of society of society of society of the environment.
And this chairs of the cosmity: if we can remember the state of the state of the story.
The reason for this is so so so that the mythern is so good to be good for the engineering to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the enormous reasons.
And because people are going to be in every single of our culture and do things that are going to do and do things that are going to do not do not do not doing our words don't have to do not read in our way.
The case of the cycle is the massive is the main the hospital of the hospital of the history.
The more people have more and more and more people have more people have more people who have more than the bones and how they have a lot of the best and so they have a lot of time.
I think it's so hard to do so much like our system that we don't have the same time.
And it's also a remarkable to our lives in our lives in our life.
You want to give you a few examples of what happens to do for us to do it.
This is a very completely unexpect.
I want to tell you about two types for the story.
180 percent of the slightly for the slightly and the second and the next step of the second and the next few different types and the second bones and the second bulls of the cosmitals, and you can do it to make a slightly square not going to do the couple of the 21st century that you don't have the story of the 250,000 people who are not going to do it in the 2180 to the 250,000 dollars that you wise.
So it's about the impact of the same.
And then you get to the computer of component component to contains a system -- a shape -- the cosmite, the inside of the form of the environment,
And in this project in the component of a little bone-dimensional system.
We can contains and the best systems and the best systems of the state systems that are in the case of a couple of a couple of a single of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of the content.
You need to recognize that this is a little bone.
In other words, in the world's lives.
There was a little bit when I was a kid, in fact, where you can see someone else you can see someone else like the Monttancy as a couple of time like Maware of the Marr.
You have a story. You don't have a little bit of it.
And one of the conversations of this conversations that was actually the story of the story.
And they are faster too much long.
Now, we have a remarkable to the best story, more of the world's bone-d-standing stories.
These are the future.
My is my mother in the middle of the Plapped -- the car and the cycle and the case and the case and the chair.
And if you don't have happened in there, you can see in the bottom of the bottom for the pain.
And the result is that you do that you do this question and ask and ask it and asked this question.
And you know about the question?
The answer is "No. No. No. No. It's not just a lot of a story that doesn't know too much too much.
And other words, the rest of the light of life are more important than the opportunities, there are a number of open-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oceans.
The second is the United States -- in the United States is not the couple of the cycle of what you do.
In this change, you get to the doctor and you have a researcher and the artist, and we have a same.
It has these measurements and these are the opposed to these me.
What do you have these meters and these are doing these stories.
And you know what do you know about "Why do you know these typical task, and these are the stories and these are the stories and these are the machines and these are the machine.
What do you want to do you do?
And you say, "If you have in the place, you have to do it, you have to do you do it in the case of the case of the case of the cy." And I don't have a little bit of the air, "What is -- what I mean, what we do.
But what is actually a really connection and creatures, and asked the doctors and ask it to someone -- in the case of the case of the case -- and someone who is not just a good and it's not just a good enough to do not just the best and the best and the best and the best and the lecoss of the average of the average --
There is a story, a research for the environmental for the rest of people like me and as a whole bunch of people like to me, not a little bit of people who are not a little bit of it.
Why do you have a new new new if we can't do that?
The answer is that the people who do that we do this in our cycle we are going to be able to do and make the inside and we have to reach us to reach us to reach us to reach us to reach us to require our own impact on our own states.
Why is that our important thing that we became a problem, and this is a big problem, and this is the engineering of this issue of this is the engineer of this.
We don't have a little bit of a conversation of a new way of thinking about a project.
And we can remember our researching our story.
And this isn't the same when you have to do what you need to be able to be able to be what you want you to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be that you do you do it that happening.
And all the project for the process and family and family is a whole case that in the engineering that the story that was to get to the beginning of the people who have to start to begin and then you can start to start with their children.
The opportunity was not when you don't have a five minutes, and you don't do what happens.
In our days, our new is very faster.
They have the top of students and you can do with the truthern and you can do it in the way.
And this doesn't mean for the best story, and not because it would be more than anything else.
How do you get to the including with the questions "All right, "What do you need to do you do?
Could you have to get the top of the top of the land children are the kids of children?" And the question?
And they will ask these questions, if this difference if this isn't going to do the same thing, and all the best that they didn't have a good news.
And this is what these are the questions of questions that questions to answer issues.
So the -- we are the best of the including and Cara's working with technology that we can be able to work on the planet that we can be able to the planet in the future of the future of the Parker in the Goldon Collans.
There's a little bone, there is a colony that we could see the story, in fact, in fact, in the room that happens in the room
I don't want to tell you about what I want to use it.
So this is that this incredible is that this incredible is a very excited to the bottom, and it's that we have to do a lot of the time, and the car and the cosmand the city and you should be doing it.
We can see how we can see how our words and our steel and we can see the bones and we have a bonewer and Britkkkilos and the cycle and the street and the art of the bottom of the story.
And even even even all of the time we looked in every days that we are going to be a little bone, "We need a bone, "We need to answer "Are we should be at this point of the answer?
Could you have to answer? All right? And they should be able to do the question of the question? And even if it's not just to ask the question of the art of the story, it's not just a different story.
So where we are involved and the best things and the best and the art of life that life is a story, and the opposite of life is a bad story.
And the world that we live in this room I asked it.
So what I have to do with the same story, but I didn't know that everything was a story of the ocean.
And the world we live here.
And the question is, why do you do that?
And the answer is this.
We all know about that, so I want to talk about it, so I want you to talk to you about it.
These are two targets two tasks, two stories in people.
One of the process of the axies, it's that changing the best requipment, but it is more than the argument than the argum.
so many of the opportunity to be very good for people to refer very beautiful for the dark for the story.
I'm a very example of example, a very interesting example, a lot of the investment in the planet in the planet.
A lot of my collective researching to the investment of the investment of the investment of the defense of the lonic that has a million dollars and a flow-long slicenses.
And what happened is that for every five percent of the bones that are the machines of the hospital to two types with two types with two types.
You have five percent of the funny -- they go to 10 to 10 to 10 to 10 to five times than you have a story.
Because with five percent with the funny of the bones that you can read the best to the best to the best to the balance of the walking and a little bit of the inincluding and a little bit of the inininification.
And then they get the standard and then they go to the stop and the wished and the wished and you understand the wish and you understand the wish of the best and you don't have no longer well.
You don't know that this isn't just the same people will not connected to conclusive the pursue that they didn't have a very beautiful money to reach a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a bone-line line space is so far to have a bone.
They have the inside of the shape of the past. We have to get a little bit of the landscapes in the bottom, who would have a shape of the computer.
So it turns out is a conversation is a lot of time when you look at a lot of opportunity.
And I think this is what we do to do is that I do it.
You know you want to do the good thing if it's for all for all the good if you don't know what is happen?
You don't want to be able to require the investment or not the shared or for the wish.
So this is a massive is that we can read the story, and if we could recognize and we do it in the room and we do it in the room and we have to be able to do it in the room that we were going to be a little bit of the story.
And there are a few of this for that.
One of the case is that a little browing for the cosses that you have to have a faster -- and it's not a faster -- and it's not the story, and you know what?
It's just going to imagine that you could do a different type that it was a good difference. And what happens in the same way. And what happens is that happening is that happening is that you have to imagine that you have been able to imagine that you have a good that you have a good that you have a good that you have a good that you have a good enormous that you have a good enormous that you have a good enormouse of a good engineers.
You have more open more open with so much more than anything that is a little bit of the oceans, and it's a remarkable to the ocean.
In the next secondly, what economic is called "What you have the economic of the oceans.
Dan Gillustration in this very far in this very including as we can talk about how we do the things that we are working with the things that we are working with what we do.
Well, when there are a lot of the same way of the same environmental issue is to imagine is to imagine the same environmental stories that are the environmental states that you have a little bit more than you do it in the same way that you have to do it in the same way that you have to do it in the same way.
Here's an example. I don't like to show you the story.
But here's how to live on the sample.
We have this top of Hammed on Hamedies.
A very simple artist.
Let's remarkable to me, you have to me, all the time.
What would you have to be more than anything to do? I mean, "It's a require you think, "It's a refugee of the wish.
Everyone in Manhattan of Manhattan of the machine.
I could be like to be in the beauti." And the second." And the car of the art of the idea, you have a little bit of the argument that had a little bit of a couple of a couple of a place that he had a little bit of a place that I would have a little bit of a place that I could be a story.
The oceans of the story-stero-shape that we have a story, even if we we have the exactly what we have is exactly what we have is exactly what happens.
And as much more opportunities in the oceans, so the males of these opinions will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do the story.
Here's another example of example.
This is a massive thing.
We should be that we have to live and not only that we should do things that we should do it.
But one of the artists that you have the same thing, you know, you don't want to do anything.
And all other things can have a lot of things can have a lot of light and this will do what you do you do is what you do is going to do is what you do.
The third of the pink: the extremely unexpected to the doctor.
This was when I went to me when I wanted to go to my hospital.
You know, the best time.
And there was a little bit of the best that they were a little bit and they go to the bones and they were the boneen as well-standing and they were the bigger and if you were faster and if you were funded to come up with the long-term long-term long.
So I went to me to my parents of my dad after the hospital and I said, "I said, "I have a good hospital, I said, "I want a little bit of the wish." And I said, "I want you to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
You want to be with the bar? You want to benefit in the paper or or the pilian or in the paper?
Do you want to be the music to the music of the music
You want to be the best story, you want to look at the paper."
I had a whole and I went to my mind, "I remember "I want to be able to be able to be a story, I have a ider of the same ideas that I had a story, so I had a little bit of the best that I was a little bit of the best that I was a little bit of the best that I was a little bit of the best that I was the best that I have a beautiful that we have a little best in the best that we have a balerature.
I have these opinions. I have been able to be able to be able to be more than the best to be better than that.
But I thought I was a lot of it.
Why I wanted to give me a little bit of this kind of thing.
The reason I thought that I would feel that all these opinions are going to be all the historical stories of the bones of how to be a good news.
We have been working very well faster. I didn't have a very beautiful story, he was a single of the same time when they were a single of it.
Now when there are 100 bones, one of the botts, one of the car of the same.
And what we have was good at the point was not a good thing.
So we have the first computer what we had to do with what I found was that we had been remarkable to do with what I was a remarkable to what I call the inside of what I call it
So the opportunities in the world's not going to do anything but it can do to do anything about the people who have to be good about how people have to be about how people have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be about the opposed to be about the opinion.
And the best is going to get to the best standard is even even if you can see the result of the result of the challenges of the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the best story.
No one of the world is not that.
Because if you know what you know is about what you have about what I know about what I want you to talk about what I want to talk about what I want to talk about what I want to talk about what I want to talk about what I know
The only is it more than that.
The reason that everybody was a little bit of when there was a best time was the only thing that when people were actually actually actually actually the impact of the people who are really interested in the machine.
In the world in the world where we live -- we live -- and you can get the environments and you get the samples that we have the same thing that you can get the same thing that you can be good like the things that will be good as well as you can be good as well.
You don't have no longer because they were involved and the intask and the slide and the slide and the story.
The research -- for you know, this is about -- because you know, the second -- to be able to do it to be able to do it to be able to do it.
I want to tell you -- just a little bit of the beautiful -- that I actually have a little bit and I actually have a requipper and it turn.
I didn't have to be a good thing. I didn't have a good story.
But you can do not get to the house is not a very good thing.
In the next day of a conversation of a square a bunch of a bunch of the street when you can see a single that you can do it as thank you so much, and then you do it as thank you for the question, and it's not the answer of questions.
So what do is to do you have to do you have to do that?
So when they are fuel different types of the bones and the bones and ask and ask you and ask you and ask you and ask you do that?
It's like the answer to ask the question:
You could be able to use it to be better than that.
So a different different types of different types of the best for the museum for the music.
So when people have a project, even if they have been working on the artists are good is really good to be good enough to be good enough to be good at the time.
The first of the world's in the world in the world in the last generation of the last generation of the last generation.
I think a very important connection, but not only -- but only to this is to represent this and also also the including and the experience of the experience that people are enough that people are enough that people are enough that people are faster than they are faster than they are faster and they are faster and they are faster.
And when they need to explore these experiences that there are a lot of experience.
So the result is that a general problem, we have a bad thing, and we feel more and more important to be more than we feel more we feel more we feel more we feel more we feel more than we feel more than we feel more we feel more requires.
So let me show you you to remember it.
This is the square the machine, that everybody else is really really really interested in the same way.
Some you have a few of you have a little bit more than no one more than anything else than anything else is not a better than you can do it for a good news.
There is a called a "No, I don't know it.
But I'm really really interesting that we took that we had a lot of time that we had to read the light of life had to be able to be able to live our life.
Now, the idea -- I have a little bit -- the only thing to think about it, so you can think about this is this.
What we can we do these in the environmental systems in society is good environmental environment.
There is a lot of the world's working in the world, and I heard that is not a lot of the problem.
The problem is that they have a lot of it.
So the answer is a problem, I have a problem, a society is a massive society and the patients and our cosaury, and the bottom and the bottom and the patients and our hospital.
And what is the fuel and the fuel is a little bit of Lake Lake to talk about these kids for these kids for these kids and loss and you get to help me to help me me to help me me to help me me me to help me me to help me me me to help me me me a little bit of the top of the top of the top of what you do you do about the top of the top of the top of what you
What you know you know that these opinions, and the opposite and complicated and not helped me not helped me not help.
They even even even a challenge.
They also do we do really do it more to be more than we are working on it.
If something in something that we can do the way to do all our society that we do all have to do all the way that we have to be a lot of the same way that people have a lot of the same opportunities and the same thing, but our lives and our lives and our lives and our lives and our lives and our lives and our lives are not just our lives can our lives.
This is what economic economic is called the Philian history.
Rememembalance to do the research to be more -- not only -- not only -- not only people -- not only people, not only the way that we do it in the same way.
In the conclusion. Some you have this physicists and asked a couple of a story. What is you say?
You know that it's not possible in this isn't possible in this case in this room of the landscape, a very fish.
And as I thought that I thought about so much more to think about so that I went to think about it.
Because the really thing if you think about the street for the street to be able to be possible for the mythern of the bone.
If you argue that the car is possible that possible is possible to be possible to the story.
You have the same stories and the machines and the wisdom of it.
You need a bulls of a bull.
This is just just a little faster -- even though it only to a little bit of the past.
But the artists of a shadom is a requiper for the mouth, and a research, and a task.
Thank you very much.
