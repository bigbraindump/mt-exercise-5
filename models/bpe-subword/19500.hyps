We have to get to refected the deparates.
Thank you very much.
And the third of the TED I did a cross-driven inside LHC.
And I remember a lot of time and get a data on the ground of what it works works.
So the amazing of the ball. And for those who were here is the most experiment is the most experiment that was the most experimentent -- Ciriririrgineering -- Ciririrbymlogs or is a far samples of the press of the press of the press of the press of the press of the seconds.
It's extremely under the ambities.
This is the water of the Genealing of the Geneenza.
We put the photographs "Big Bangle."
I work at this time. It's called the ATLATLATLAs -- Lunger -- the diameter of 22 meternal detectors here in the detectors here in building here to the detectors here to be able to project.
As the third of the year, I started the whole thing for the first time.
And this image was doing the ATLAS.
He had a couple of control for control of control for can.
It's a picture of the first fish of the farms that computer in the system, the system to the system to LHC, the inched in LHC, depending on the detector.
As the other words, when I was looking at that point that image that the image of the word of working on the work, which is a successful successful success of the success of the success of the success of the success of it.
I don't know if that if that was the first one of the biggest or that, or when someone else and when he was working on the first time of the first way.
It means that I did a culture of cultural culture on the stinitially stories.
After about a saptam, I had a saptard, which actually had a character, which actually had to do with these physics -- these physics.
These physics of 13 thousands of the bottom of the power to the power to the power market.
Now, the engineers in the winds of the wall, "I can't translate attact.
But I can do that for when they are at the temperature's superatures.
So as a 271 degree in the physics of the stories, those are the space of these physics can transmit so that they can transmit so that they can transme.
At one of the various of the 9,000 degree in LHC, was a was a fabricatic define --
So the common was a little bit of the bridge of the bridge of electrics have initially retains of electrics.
This was the result.
That's more predictable to all of those respect of those tons, and they have 30 percent of the stone, and they deployed 30 percent.
So I determine we determine about 50 deximate 50 feet red.
We had to have to take affair, what I was looking for it.
I reconditioned on the top of the today.
And now we have intentially innovations.
Lan's Lander's site a lot of the LHC will be as a lot of thing.
We will go back and go back and see it today, we have to get to the tools, or we have to go to the tools of the universe to the tools of the universe to the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe we can go to the top of the new enout.
Now, of course, in a way of accident, those accidents are all about the recognizing and inevitable to extremely reject.
I think that the fact that is that the fact is that the fact that we have a little bit of the fact that we have a very important experience as LH.
I'm going to be as a whole thing that is a bridge of the stintaneously, Humping Davy, I think that I think that I think that I think of the protection of the protection of the protection of the protection of the protection of the conductor of our senses of insic degree of our own statement and making our sensition of our senses are not as a best and the benefits of our ins."
Thank you.
I would come with the rate with the rate of kidney to remember that will play with the hospital hands.
As you invented to invented to the water and him, and to get them and to get them and to get them and attention to the beginning, and to return and resisting and shared and advantages and deliver and manipulate and manipulate the relatives.
The space is the deep of the space is a big deal of how we understand a lot of the world conconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconnected to the world connected.
So that is in the common IT inspired by this inspired by this interaction with the objects -- impressulating -- I have a consultaneously -- I started with my friends, and collaboratory -- I would be able to use a computer, and we can use a computer, and we can use a little bit of the common that fishing a mouse of a mouse of the digital data and if we can use a mouse to use a mouse of the product that we can be a massive of the condition to make a measurviving.
So what do we want to do we want to do?
The question was the asked to fit from fascinating the beginning of the building Siftable.
As a Sift-term Sift-bising computers.
They can be manufacturing the recireproduction of the reproduction of one other people can perceive and a ran and a ran and a relationships.
The most important is that the palphasing farms like the game, you can just sit as well.
And Sift-example, a new example of a new instruments of a manipulation of digital information of digital information.
As the measure that these instruments because, more constantly constantly constantly of the other constants of our actises of our innovation of our innovation of the interactive and we can begin and we can begin to explore and new connected to interact.
I'm going to start with some examples.
This is confidented to predict is to predict to predict ints, and the include in a condition of the various connections, the rule of the parks, the rule of the including inath.
These interactive interactive are constantly constants.
So, if you put them on the other side of them today, it becomes a whole thing.
If they're connected to be inconfted and this, and I can become a confusion.
I can feel the mission and including and including and including and include
We realized that one of the interests of interactive interactions is that we can use the gestablished to be able to use the culture, how we would have to be a cultural culture how we could be a same.
In this case, we have three Sift-balance configured as and they can use to use and him, where they can use to be, where they will be able to use it in the center where they will die.
If we can get too much too much of the power of the power of the cous.
There are also also interestingly interesting for education, as they would be game, the mathematical and logical connections and the other possibilities of possibilities of possibilities to see the result of the results of the immediately immediately research.
So here I -- this is a Fibonacibonacibonacy.
This is a game, we have a combination of combination and a kind of combination and Bogging and Bogging and Bogging and Bogging and Bogger.
Afghanists in every single Sift-term gone on every Sift-form that innovation, are the bigger of the words are very, very interesting with a bridge of the bridge of a bridge.
And then I have 30 seconds of seconds of seconds and you have a new set of choice and we have a new shared and we possible.
Thank you.
These are non-kids who came to the Sedia, and I read the Media, and I read to convince them to the convinced and the movie and the movie and the film of the material.
He loved to bring them to him.
And one of the interesting of this kind of applications of this kind of applications is that we don't have to give them a lot of instructure.
All right, "Well is "For and they know what to do.
Here are some people who are incatives with them.
This is the most tant, our tester in the right right in the right right place.
It turns out all of the way he wanted to do it was to make Siftable.
So he was just working together.
This is a various applicators of animating.
We wanted to build a instrument for those who instrument languages.
And this is Felix.
He can get new personal and innovation in the state of Sift of Sift-Sift-in-term who are person.
This is the sound of the sound of it.
Video: So:
David Merrill: Now it turns out a state such a traction.
Video: The Trace.
Good well! Yeah!
Miss Siftable, and asking them to a language of the language -- Video: Ham!
DM: I believe and production and production.
Video: OK.
DM: It's a story with the final story of how it will it will be wrong.
Video: Your hands!
DM: The Ultimtime, I showed is a bridge of created and interprecious and interpreted and interpreciated with the music and interpreted to the Sifables that we built the role and the role and blood it would be rhythms and ball.
There's four various various various various types that you want to use it.
And you can inject the injects that you can ask you can ask you can ask what you want to do you to the type of the kinds of things.
You have the chooses of Sift Sift-term settable of successful successful for successful to successful to success.
There are the effective that you can control the reverse and the movie and the movie and the moves.
Is it it to a certain a certain and then include it for the air.
It is the effect of effects like the temporal and the farms of the speech of sequences of sequences to see it.
Video: DN: I have a ritting with a riter's two of the success of the success of a completely under expected hospital, a extinct, a more more more more more more more more more more more more and more more more more and more more and more and more and more and more more and more and more more and more and more and more more more and more more and more resources.
Now a little bit of a bridge line.
Video: Now I add a little bit of a little bit of perhaps.
Video: And now I'm going to add the movies of the philosphere to control the lives.
Video: Maybe M: Maybe the second including in a front of the second or in a part or in a part or in a part or in a part of or in a part of or in a part of or in a part of Video:
Video: Now I'm going to attack for more than a little bit of the baby.
Video: I can do re-re-re-sequence in while a while a while a while a while I was a whole thing.
So I don't have to do the planet, I can improvise, maybe the babies of him.
Now, in the sfarmed intuitive intrends of second, the second Sift Sift the fish of volunteers.
Thank you.
As you see my passion is the brain is creating the interfaction that they are going to be more of the brain that works with the way that our brain works.
And today, I had a time to show a cotttomorrow of this design, and a few of the possibilities that we had to put them in the labs.
The one that the various that are the reddle is as a granitation of instruments of interactive and the digital digital digital digital digital requires of our world to re-instruments.
Thank you very much.
Asteps with you to talk to you with you with you today.
I'm writing.
He writes is my teachers, but -- but -- --
It's all my mother and fascinating.
And I don't move this is that to do it.
But these are the hot of hopefully as a way to the bridge and both in the vision and in my book, which was my father's working with the connection of work.
And the thing I wrote is that I written this book, this book, "Manca, Rosia, Ro-Iubububer." Abagain to deal with the horrible of the hormous sense of my own sense of my mindsells in the world for the reason is to become a very important thing that is the most important thing that is the important sensitive.
The first is that the origins are working on the states of parts as as it was condamn.
Serids -- connamed -- condamnes!
For example, and you know, and you say, "Do you don't have the teama is not the horra -- you can't be more description to you can actually be able to deal with thermost?
Do you have a streamed that you to write a lot of the vision of the vil of the best that you have a book that to the world that would be a stat?"
It's very very linked inside the line.
But it was more races if they don't move to not move to the 20 years, when I started to have a big street when I was a great time -- I was a little bit of the same way -- I was like to be writing -- I was so far as a frict of the farming of reaction in a friction of the far.
And people said "Not that you have no one of the success of success?"
I don't like mean me as well-de-rejected ideas?
You don't have a front of the things that you have in this physicists and no opportunity to be there, and not to deal with a characters here and I would have a characters with the center of the network with the network?"
Health of this.
The slide -- the racy of the question of those questions is "Yeah, I said, "Yeah, I walk."
Yeah, you know, it's all of those things.
And always he always stop.
And you know, it's all funding in the plus of the things that people who can't intuition.
As a big example of the bridge things that are infrustrategy.
But when I talk about written about written about the last and I think, "What's the last time I was in the last time I asked to what "What's going to do you know what "What?"
Is it something els?
It's a lightening that anybody to be able to be able to be a very hard to do it that they were pretty much to do this Pamant.
And what is the specific initiatives that the initiatives that the nelinists of the attention of the attention of the attention of the attention of the teacher?
My attacker for example, was not immediately and not improve in the 40 years of you have the ineration of the ineration of ineration is not a question of the isn't going to be a chemisperal issue is not a change-inched inch.
It didn't have intampled -- John, how do it with the block?
It just simply not intamamples of something.
But we can also be able to be a chemispheres have too much of the secret of the secret of the centuries of the centuries of the oil of the oil of the oil of the oil of the oil of the oil of the depression.
We are writers of insects and we have this remarkable and writers, but artists are seeing that they are the power to be powerful as to be powerful to be powerful to be powerful powerful to be powerful to be powerful to be powerful.
And all of the way we look at the bottom of the dead of the dead restrated by the way, in the mind of the mind of the minds' region and died myself and died and died and death of production and deal with the product.
And even the same thing that didn't expect to be a bridge of the products of the changed.
Norman Mail, even though the last few days of the interview, he said "Each books a little bit more of my bottom."
A great extraordinary extraordinary of working on the work.
But it would be as a while we don't have a while we have someone days because we heard so that we heard of things that we heard of the ideas and completely unexpected and accept that creative idea, and it will be able to create and impressed as well-creative conducted to the target to the top of a suffering and defining it to a barras.
And the question I want to add this is a touch of the top of the things that you all of the ideas with this ide?
You are comfortable to comfortable with the eye of what you see with the eye -- I didn't like this -- I didn't like this with this street.
I think it's odied.
And I think it's dangerous and I don't like to be a period and not like to see the future.
I think it's better if you get to the artists of artists to traditions.
And I know that in the case of my case -- in the house -- in the situation -- it would be very period to me to start to start this streets of this streets of this streets in the fact that I know the teaching of the teaching of the teachers.
As for example, I'm pretty much in the four years.
I have probably like four decades of works.
And it's very probably going to write all of the moment to be judging to be judged as the mountained of my own successful stream of my own streets of my own stre?
What would be a very small research, because of a little bit of the friends of the friends of friends -- it's very similar to be intampled to be intamed to be intamampled to be intamed to be intampled to be intamatoring to be a big laugh.
Oh, Oh, Does Do!
This is the gene of the gene that could do somebody to get to the bridge of the non-ineats, and I don't want to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person could do that person to make it about the gene.
I want to do this message that message that I love it that a love that a loop.
And I asked the question: Do it becomes like this: right?
And so I put it in a lot of my favorite line in which I have to work right now, to write a little bit of the building to write a way to make a kind of creating a way that we build a way that we build a cook?
In a way, in a way to get a way to get a way to the farm of my finger, and the home, and the games that writers, and the natural characters of what it will be able to what it is going to written a reactive resactive that will write.
And as I was in the last year in this sense, I started this sense, I started to get the time to get the time, and I researched to see other society would be ideas to be ideas to be ideas to be more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more than we can help people create the opportunity of the emotional issue of emotional emotional issue of the emotional issue of the emotional issue of the exciting of the exciting of the exciting of the risen ins.
The Cerror was in Greece and Romantic and Romantic Romantic Romantic Romantic Romantic Romantic Romantic Romantic Romanantic to me and Romanantic to me of this thermostly reet this reetness to this recircle of this streetness to this recipe that he was a recide of this recivilization of this recivilization of this recidence was a state of this holding was in my failure.
So the urpose, the couple, the case of the prison.
But in the Great and Romi Romers are not doing that people don't believe that people don't believe that people don't believe that people in the interior of the interior of the dirty of the interior of the disease,
People believes that creativity was a spirit of the people who can be able to enjoy the street and the needs and understanding and needs and intelligence.
Good were called these spiring are helping creativity, "demonstrate "demonths with the "demonth."
Scrats was the name for that it has a demand that it turns out of the intelligence.
The advanced were the same paper, but they call that spirit creativity, yet gerial attention,
What is the nounced because romans, because they don't believe that a genius was a genius was a very quickly.
They depend as a genius was a kind of a divinced of the divince of artists of artists, and the Dobby, the Seeusal insession and insession and insession and insession and insession and the sector of the workers of working on the word of the word of the word working on the works.
Absolutely -- this is that -- this is that the farmed -- that is that we talked about the results that we can protect the results of the results of the results of the work.
And everything that the world as a word work?
So the artistic has been protected by a lot of things, as a lot of thing, much narcism, right?
If you were the street was not the street of the street for the street for the street that the genius that the travel.
If the word was criticized was not completely completely completely unfort?
The world as the genius that was the city was the city of the city of the northers.
So they looked at the Valley creativity,
And then came to Rast, and all of the change is changed by a certain a certain a mammakers of the universe as individual diseases and the universe of the universe of the first time for creates and discover the first time to create the first time to create the first time they were going to create the first time to create the first disorry that they were going to discover the first discover that they were going to discover the first of the first discovering of the work.
It was a human beginning, and people start creative beginning, and people started creative with all of the interior of the interior of the individual of individual individual of individual individual of individual act.
And for the first one of the first people started to refer in one or the other artists of artists as a genies, in the genius of the genies.
And I have to have a little bit of a huge of a huge of a huge of a huge of a little bit of it.
Permite, a simple person, a simple person, to create that it is actually received the receptable and the extra and excited and excited and excited to the conditions, creative issue, four time, four time, four time, four time.
It's like how you can get a few few of the hitches of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound.
And just like the inner and deforming and deforming all these today and genetic environmental images of the time.
I think that the president has been a artists of the last 500 years.
And if I think about is true, and I think that is, what do we do it?
Can we do things differently?
Maybe we intook the senses of relationships of the relationship of the brains of the brain.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't just stering 500 years of ideas of human ideas of human ideas of a rational talk.
And it can be as a public that would be the public of the question of the question of the questions of the stintypical typical speech and the surprising of the speech and so on.
It may not be a will not be a little bit on this idea.
But the question I want to put a is -- what about it?
Why don't we think about this thing?
Because it is as much as a sense of something else as any other things, what we heard of the prosthetic creativity.
It designed about what anybody else to create something -- deep to create something -- the street -- the street --
And in fact, sometimes can put the right deal with the paranalyze.
I had a research where I knew where I knew the American Canyla Canyan Ruth Stone, which now has been in the way to be in the way that he was storing to the story and that he was a story to the story and that he felt the story of the story of the story and it feels and it feel a little streamed and it was a simple and a little streets in the streaming and time.
The story was like a various various various various various of air.
And it turns out the roads.
Heeats, because you get the galazalephalary.
In that moment that moment that it has a single thing that I read and read that the water as well."
And alerging as to the book in the house of poem, and the intuition was to get a broom and a creating and a creature's faster and when the southern and to get to the bridge of a bridge and swimming and shared to a mass.
Sometimes not enough to be sufficient as and alerging and alerging and alerging it in the house and the stem and the story of the rostate and the poems of the camps, and the story of the camps, a story of the camera in a story of "All right.
They were and they -- and they were the moment that -- and the moment -- moment -- moment in which times in that time.
Although the house and the case and the case and the case and the water when the exact of the exact when it comes to the story as it turns out to the other way to the other way to the other way to the other way to the other.
The first car is the cock and settle, and then in the mass of the mass of the mass of the mass of the mass.
So in the situation, the main the map of the water and intacial and intacial of the first first time at the first time at the first first of the first time at the first time to the first time of the first year at the first of the first year of the first time.
When I heard -- it's sustainable as it works in the process of the product.
My creative creative creative is not to conduct this -- I'm not conducted to this -- I'm not run to the run!
I'm a way to working on that working on the way to go to the same way, and to translate and to transmit and to travel and to travel and to travel and to track and such a hard to stand to track.
But even though it was in my innature, even though I was attention to some of that phenomen.
And I just like to have been so many of you were so many of you walk
And I had designed and ideas that I came from a sure that my ideas that I didn't know that I don't know that it doesn't know it to be a challenge to be a tifire.
And what do you all this?
And how do it as we should have to report us to get to the point of us to help us us us not to help us us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help our sanks?
For example, for example, the most relevant of our days, which is what we can do is the Mitchoosing of the With the revibration to the revivistate of the revist.
I was about the sum of this was almost all of the artists of the contemporary contemporary contemporary contemporary to control and connected to control and control these impact and to control and control these impact of interiorize and connected to create these improving interiors.
And the time of the line line, and it was the line, and you get the story as a role in the autopic of Los Angeles and then all of the new change.
As a time in a fragmental time in a fragt of a brown in a mind of the mind of the hospital and depends on the splates of the space, and it's not as well as well, it's not what it is to be a whole seven as a whole thing to do to be able to be as well.
It doesn't have no longer has no creature, not created, not reported the report.
And the thing that is all the vector the deep of the teacher "I want to be a street to the moment, and cancer, and cancer.
I'm not sufficient to receive a good thing."
And in the line in the line would be a little bit of the landscape.
He recognized the process and made something with all of the new and all of the new thing.
He was a little bit of the whole thing and said, "Science I don't see that I'm not going to be like I'm not going to be like I'm on the volcance?"
"Do you have a cancer that could write a cance?
If you really want to be to be into, intoday, into, when a moment when you get to me to go to the home.
If you don't have and writing and comes on the other things.
Duel and deliver it on Leonard Cohen."
The process of the production of creative creative change.
Not surrounded by the way, it as intunately,
But the process of the agnostic and the pagricultural in to the moment in the moment in that he says, and he says, and he saw it in the humans and he had to go back and he realized it to where he came back to where he realized it to the interiorize and he realized it doesn't have to be something that we don't have to be something that we don't have to be something that they don't have to interiorize and insects.
It could be this collaboration and bized and bized by a conversation of a conversation of the exterior and the exterior exterior exterior that was not as Tom.
After I heard the story of the story that I started a little bit of the way I worked a little bit of the way I was working on my data.
This is what he saw me when I was in the romancy "Manca, Ro-Manca, Ragilian innovation of a barrassed that we don't have a dead that we don't have a detool that we don't really get to a very bad that it will be a very hard to be a pretty much more than I would not be the streets that will be the streets of the bottom to be the best product.
Not just the process of the book of the bottom of the rise of time.
We have to think about I should remember that I should just like to abandoned the projects.
And then I remember the space I talked about the space and I researched and I researched and I researched and I was researched and I was researched and I was received and I was asked me and I was then,
I was writing on the left and I brought a common and I brought a collaborative school.
I told with your voice and "Asculp," and I stop that if we stand I stand I stand I stand not just the word is not just a few of the word is not just my constantly will be just convinced to be just a standing of the being?
Because you can see you like to be a street to be a long to hear it to hear not even more attempt to be not easily.
So if you want to be better at the time, you have to do the water and you have to do the streets of the third of the third of the third of the third of the third of the third of the therapy.
Okay. And you don't want to do that, you know, at the bottom of all of the time.
I will write for me to write for this is message.
And I want to consumer as I did my books like me in my third of my third."
Because -- the conclusion -- the conclusive -- with hundreds of North Africans to reach to the North innovation to deal with the long-term and music to the long-term and music to the long-term rar.
And they always had always been wonderful for the dancer and they were remarkable to remarkable and they were remarkable to remarkable to hear it?
But sometimes something like a very rule, and one of the interpret of the community of communication.
I'm convinced that all of the things that I referenced, because all of the village of all the time, in a certain a certain a certain a certain a certain a certainly interpreciated by interconvinced.
It's like as time the time is the street and the death is the way to do nothing differently, not doing nothing differently than the other 1,000 series of the other side.
In a time that it doesn't seem to be in intuition.
It's the world in the interior and the world is the games of diceived the divincing of divinces.
As ago, when they were intamples what was and they were and they said that it was and they said to the numbers called it.
I have the impress and incept to make a reddance "Alllah, Alllah, Doh, Doh, Does Do."
It's God.
A lot of interesting -- when the story -- when they invented the Spanish Spanish and they went to the Spanish and he had been able to turn to the "Allam!
and it turns out to the time with the funny and slightly sweet school.
In Spain, when a interpret of received something impossible and the magic and the broad, Allam, Alla, Alla, Alla, the arm."
And the intelligence -- a farms.
It's a mind, because we need to need something like this.
But the parts of the two days of the heart of the heart of the insusion is and discovering is and discovering is and discovery, very is a broadcast.
It's a muriting murden and that if you were and they would never have to be able to be always to be always to be always to be always to be alone.
Could it be nobody to be a little bit of the Domnone of the Domn, so that when they have to do with the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the beings could be nothing to be nothing to be nobody to be nothing to do to be as any
It's hard.
It's one of the most replaced in the most received in the vision of creative creativity.
But maybe it would not be a big chance if you don't believe you don't believe you don't believe that the most extraordinary of the most interesting of the various interiors.
Maybe if you have been able to create that time, they were imprising a surprising surprising for a few times of the moment in the vision of the point of the point of the time, when the time it turned out to be depended in the streamed to the top of the top of the top of the top of the time.
If we think about it, all of us beginning, all of the beginning.
I started to think about it, and I started thinking about in the last months in the last months of the long-term working in the attacked attempting to the bridge of my success and infrastructures, and infrastructure.
And what I did is repeated, you know, when you get the cross: you don't have the herr.
You don't speak. You just have a lot of you and you have the content to be able to be done.
If you get dances, then you dances,
If the genius of the divent and excess is repartially repartially to make sense of the extraordinary to a clips in the form of form in the form of the form of it."
And if no, no, no, no, no.
And with all of the "Ole."
I think of these things and I think we should predict them to predict them to predict them.
"Ole" for you, for you, just like you to have a dragot for the change-environmental and incentive.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just Cohen: Ole!
I speaking about some of these designs, about the genome, and what it could be able to represent and what it might be able to represent new channels.
Now begin in from a new point of a new point of the point of biology, and now we tried to this code and now to go to this code and try to get a new model of life and despering and expecting form and extended form and exciting form and exciting for.
I tried all the time, we tried to ask us questions.
"What is the life that I think many many biologists have tried to understand the diverse to understand the diver.
I tried to do the different approach, a simple component to component the component to component the component to component
We described along the way.
When I was the genomome, this was the genome, this was the role of the digital world's digital world.
Now we try to ask how we can regene that we can create new form of life, or in this universal environmental environmental enth?
This is a mice, Mycom of a mice, Mycom of the gene that it can reply the most of the most of the one specifically in the only one species.
We tried to see if we can see if we can come with a gene and smaller and small.
We did the first thing we did to have a suddenly 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of the math, it's pretty simple to our comparison to our comparison to our comparison.
The determine, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can suggest that we can suggest that to make a person to produced a person to the bad of the violence.
So we decided that the only way that we actually want to be to expect this crossed this cross-des to see the component to address to the most of the most associated question.
And so I started on the road, "Can we have a cross-cross?"
Maybe the chemical shares these molecules that we didn't have been doing a very large that we didn't have ever done more of this?
And if we can active. If we can active.
A crososs, about the cromos, is just a little bit of stuff.
So, our speech of digitize to create the ritems of the exponential.
Our grandmother to writer code is the mountaining of beginning, but it growing up.
The next time it was going to get a exponential exponential exponential dependon.
I started this talking about 15 years.
I went through a few weeks ago, in fact, began to do the first time before they do the first experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult to the DNA very difficult.
They're a thousands of machines in the world that are making a thousand a thousand years, but it's a 30 to 50 letters, but it's a more degeneration, so that what you build a more degree of the water degree of the water of the water of the water of the water of the water of the water of the water of the water of the water of the machines of meters.
So we had to create a new new to create these little bites to make these little bits.
This was our first tenth of the tenth of information from the digital information to the genome, to the genome.
It's a virus that disease that disease.
I did design design, I went through school, I went through school, and I got a molecule of DNA molecules of DNA only 5,000 genemes.
The interesting is when I got the bridge of the stuff of stuff, and I got to read this cognition to read this cognition to read this cognize of viruses of viruses of viruses of viruse.
The viral diseases were when the bottom of the cells and they came and they came and they did.
I was working with the oil of the plant and the speed and zero that we understand that the model.
They have laughter more than you do.
And so we believe that this is a situation where the software in a system in a system in a system in a system in a system in a system system.
But I wanted to do something more greater than we do something more than we do.
We wanted to build the cromoss of a cross-bacteria.
This is about 50,000 genetics of genetics.
So we said, we have to put the top of the challenges of the house of the virus to the home, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, the resonal of a cells of a relationships.
The critical is is critically, if you start with information of the digital information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly the information
When I got the first sequence in 1995, the standard of the precious standard was a bridge of 10,000 per well.
I found in the resources, 30 times of this: If we were used to be used by the original stories to be able to be able to be accounts.
The design is designing of a little bit of a little bit of the long-term 50 letters that we have to all the other characters to build a little bit of the subjection to build a little bit of the challenges of the other other challenges to be compatients with the challenges of the other other other other than the other other people.
We can projects.
Maybe I put it in "hamermarkets.
Triges from those chooses -- those characters of the code of the amount of the amount of the amino choosing every amino choice.
So we can use the genetic code to write the bottom of the words of things.
Is all of the whole thing I did was to hear the code of the code of the code of it.
Some were deadly not already is not the poetry.
We designed those little bites so that we can dignose.
I'm a lized that they are all of them.
So we started doing the blood with the blood with five days, the right way to do it at this point to do it for 24,000 genes, and then we put it on this landscape of this landscape, and then he put it to 70.
At every time, we went to these little bites to be these little bathlee, and we tried to create a process of the extreme -- as you see it in a mind.
We containing to get to that point that point of automatiatic point.
So, this looks like a deren teredness.
When we go to a very large numbers of per shares in the world don't create in Ecollected in Ecycle in English.
It takes all the biology of biology of the molecular molecular molecules
So we went to other mechanisms.
We knew that there is a mechanism called the recombination of the DNA that are using the DNA to return to the DNA and that will be able to make a benefits.
This is a example.
There is a Deinos called Deinoply ramists that can suggest millions of run miles of range race.
As you see in the line of the sample of shared in the bottom of the bottom in the bottom of it.
12 to 24 hours later, he put it in the long-term long as I was to inced the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be open today.
I can live in the vision of lives.
I'm absolutely absolutely to be in the extrath of extrath to find a new environmental environmental environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is the streets.
This is a microphone microphysical molecules that we build these process process -- actually using the mechanisms with the design of design process that we put it in the decades that we put it in the decades.
Drodia and shared by their automatically automatically.
This is not a little bit of a microscope with a microphone, but just a little bit of a microphysical microphysics.
It's so a molecules as we can see a microscode with a microscode with a microscope of microroscope of the microscope of horrib.
These are the images of collecting of the collection of the six.
This is a public published that I had a little bit of time.
These are over 50,000 genetics of genetics.
It's the biggest molecules of people with a whole structure.
It's a molecules of the molecules of 300 million million million million.
If we have a funding with a funnels, 142 pages to practice this code of the genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic code this code code this code code of the genetic delic code with a very very very very until we have a deal with a very couples of a funneling deterroring with a funneling a funneling deterring with a funneling ded.
So, how do we go a cromoss? How do I active?
Audience, with a very easily.
But it's much more complicated with the bacteria.
They also also easy to be when you get to the barrier to be just to take the nois: you can just get to something, and this is something that you all the time, and this is something that you all the heart --
And the bacterial archains, the cross-term is interested in the cells, but we showed that we can make a completely transplant to a completely completely completely and we can do it.
I put a crowing crows,
These are the second is as a way to as people and the machines and the bridge of people and the bridge of people and the humans and the hands.
I added a few genes of genes that we can see to this cross-chair.
I discovered with the enzing to make all the proteins.
And it was pretty much when I put it in the cells -- you will have the recidental -- you will have very very sophisticated -- and crossed in the cell.
In fact, we thought that this is how it can be working on the projects of something more degree to design something more degree of something more degree of something more degree of something more degree of something more degree of something more degree of something more degree to actually be able to actually worked on the face, we actually believe that we were actually thinking about that is in fact, we have the fact that this is what we thought that this is that this is that this is how we discovereed that this is how we discover that this is how we
This is a major religion of evolution.
We are all kinds of species that have a cyclopedic ccross of the cross, or a third of our species, as a second, as a second.
So those who are thinking about the evolution of evolution changing as a new way, they lost a lot of time.
I'm a name is called the restrict of restrictions that actually digers,
Cromosomoscial that was in the cell.
Cula -- the cromoss I put it --
It was express and recognized the cells of crossed as the street, he digers, and so I got to just with the cromossed with the cell.
It became albought that we put in the cross that we put in crossed in cross.
And after a very dependent on a very bad period of a book have a little bit of a special species of a specific species, and it has always a new species, the new species that I put it in a new species.
All rights were changed by the membrand-changed -- when the genetic code what we transferring is what we transferd.
This can be like the genomics, but we could be able to change the software very very quite things that we change things very quite things that we change things that we change things like this.
Now, I had been told that this is not the genetic -- but he built three billion years and a half billion years and a half of the evolution of the Cambridge of Cambridge exploiting a new new new species of the main a new specific instead of the main the digital design.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty much of the street of the streets of the needs of the needs of the needs of the needs of the needs of the needs of the needs of the needs of the needs of the point is a pretty much of the best of the street is pretty much of the best of the object is pretty good at the point is pretty inside the street is pretty wellell-time is: I think it's pretty good newspappeakers.
We are on the cells to go from six and half billion people over 40 years.
As it to me to me to me to me in 1946.
Now I'm three people on the planet for every one of the world in 1940s, in 1940 years, they will be four years.
We have the issue issues, the various issues, the drug of six billion and six billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half the problem.
It will be difficult to do a fosse.
We are over five billion books of the books of the barily of barrasses.
This means a million barily million barily day.
When we try to think about the process of the biological process that to every process that will be a challenge challenge to be a challenge challenge of challenge.
And then, of course, it's all that CO2 in this material material, which is in atmosphere in atmosphere in atmosphere in atmosphere in the atmosphere is that the chosen of the material of the things that are all of the way to then, of course,
Now, in our discovery of our discovering lives with the data and we have a brown with the 20 million genes, and I love to think about this component as a component of design.
The electronics has just a little bit of a component that wheelchair, and that was diversity of that came from this.
We are the limited here, in the first time of a real biological reality and imagine our images.
We now have now data now that data is the data of these types of such a very quickly what we call the genomic characters.
We have a big ability to build a large robot that to make a large number of cross-day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of these 20 million genes of genes or to build the product of products to produce the product of products of products, or process to change the team of the vaccine, we can change a little bit more than a little bit of the time,
And this is just the standard.
We can also also project, production for the substanti-chemical chemical chemical chemical products,
This is a capture of a ran of a software of a software to work and working and working and working on these species in computers.
You don't know what it is notice will show you how it will will show you how it will show you how it will show it.
We know how they show the code of their genetics.
Now we now concentrated by four cultures to four generations.
You see that in the patient that in the patient is just a reneneeded a connected experiment.
We have the fuel of the two generations and the third of the second, which will be pretty much more value, which are the bigger than the Ourururban or faster or the other kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of butility.
But the only way we believe that biology can have a major or or more costs and the slide and the limitation of the limitation of the CO2 as we start with the projects of the first projects and working for this stream and we believe that we have the first stream of the fourth generation of the four generation of the four years.
Like the CO2 is a and CO2 is a discovering of our world's discovering all the way.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It takes a couple of the oceans, about two kilometers and half a military, and half of the barrasses of physics.
Transwer CO2 in using meterology as well.
We trust to see if we can see if we can be easily translated in the country, and to convert that CO2 and conducted that CO2 in-CO2 process process to conduct this product.
So in a period of time we could be mean that we could mean what is the question of what is the light?
We really know -- you know, we have objects -- we have the entire industrial industry of the whole industry.
Yeah. If you don't do this at TED, where in the other way?
Let's become a major energy.
But we also work now to use these same way to make these vaccine invention to invent vaccines to invention.
You see this year, we are always to see a year in the minus in the minus when he was talking about the vaccine.
I think the situation can be changed by the vaccines of all the vaccines.
Here's how it could be able to show the future of changing the future of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the extra character, and finally indeed, and finally excited about the silence.
We are almost to contains people.
Our is just to make sure is just to survive that we have a very long way to survive to survive it. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you a lot of fast, very quickly is a very quickly new technology, a new technology that I brought to Microsoft in a year, this is a year. This is a year. This is a year.
It's a which can interaction that can interaction with a big deal with a big deal with a huge of visual data
We look at many times now a lot of broken and digital digital and men in the place, line time, rearratic with this one, rearratic in this rearming in this rearming horizon.
Not contedly contedition of how much of the collective or how the birds are these collected are the images.
Most of the potential with a camera of the winn, but this is a street of Bibrary to Bibring the Congrest Congress of the Congrest of the 300 feet of the connected of the window.
It doesn't really important, because the only thing that should limitation that we should have the performance a pixeline is the number of monitor a very fabulous point of the streets of the architecture.
This is a book is a book for a non-imagine example.
It's about "As a little state of Charles Dickens. Tens. Five the represent of the capital.
For example, and it's not about the text, and we can't do something about it, and not a representation with something that is a representation of a represent representation of a text; it's not a text; it's not a street step.
Maybe this is a way to read a book in a book in a book in the form of electronics.
I didn't want to recomman.
This is a better real. It's a network of "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian
Each images a represent begins to a second.
This is really a little bit of a experience of a experience of a experience of a suddenly revide or a revide or a lot of the slide or a lot of the environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental ways.
We did something small, and we did with the "Gardian of "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "
I created a reclamed a very large -- much more than anymore-clamed -- and I was a lot of the research -- and I was a connected connected connected to a connected connected to a connected connected to a connected connected to the connected to be a connected to a connected to a reclamed a required rely revolution on a farmed reclamed a required reclaimed a reclamed re-clamed require recline a reclusion.
If you can see the products of this machines, you can see here.
Or or even specifically or even specifically to the technology.
And this is actually the idea of a lot of ideas of a monitor a limited monitors.
We feel that to be able to test the pop-testing mizarre and other genes and other genes of the gene of genes.
Of course, the mapps is one of the affects for a gene.
I'm not going to be a lot of time on this eight time, but just to tell you that we have a more contribute to this phenomenon.
These are all all the roads in the United States on a picture of NASA.
Let's third to something else.
This is actually active activist; you can do the history.
This is a mathematics of Photosynthosynthesis the Spragons. One of the other of the content of the perception of the computer of the computer of the relationship of Ston Steve Saddon Steve Saddon Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Stephone in Washington the U.S.
and Rick Szelish Cercetor Microsoft-house collaboration of beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful thing.
So this is actiful, this is active in the Internet.
You can see that when we create these perspective, when we can have this kind of perspective, when we can have this kind of experience in many solar experience.
But architecture of these images contedly contesting with true.
Algoritarian of perception of the perception of the images of the images of the space of the space of the space of the Canadience of Canadience -- all of the Canadience -- they were realized these stability to be all of these sets -- they were realized these spaces here are all of these space or the labs of the space.
I'm not sure if I have a while I was going to show you other environment.
There are some more space that they have a lot of space space space
I would like to go to one of the stories of the stories of the Greh -- this is doing part of the Photosynosycosycosycosycle I worked in the way, to show you what I believe that I think it's a piece of the technology, the technology of this technology, the technology of the design of the vision of the vision of the vision of this design that we have a projected to the project that we have a projournals.
We had to have to be working on the shares of the shares of the wall.
This is a rebuilding Cats Cats in the Doms of the culture of the images of the images of the Docaught Flicklys, and you find something that you can see something that you can see something that you can find a lot of the conductor of these conducts. And every conducted that was found a picture that was found a picture of this model.
These are the streets on Flickr, and all of the space space in this moon.
We can just be able to be able to be in this more.
You never thought I would never be able to work to work at Microsoft is very very excited to work here.
I mean, I have a lot of you are a lot of the camera of the camera of the camera at SLRRRLRRRLRRs SLRRRs is very very small cells in this environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental no.
If I can find it in this circle of this chase.
They're so many machine, and it was a shared him.
One is a series of the photographs --
This is a poster with the Domes that was registrated by the cost.
You can get the poster to ster the environmental environment.
Is it that can do things with the social stuff. This is to collected from all the collective students -- from a collective collective stuff, and to interconnected the state of the potential connected to interconnected to interconnected to the street is more than they are connected than they are the connected than they were the working on the stresses.
You have a model of what the Earth.
Think of this as a long time to school, the long-term "Earth's "Earth's "The Virty."
And this creates in complexity as the world is used to use the benefits, and the benefits as users, and it as users.
The people are the poor is with metapheter's heter-hetorses that someone else that someone else in the hand
If someone would have all these sentence and tell you what they were the street is that I tell you what I was going to be able to do with all of these data would be able to use all of these data and I could use all of these data and I could use all of the space to be used to use it to be as a way to make a company to be as a compating.
And of course, a profound produced produces and both both of the virtual models of the Earth's tered and the collection of the Earth, the collective and the image of the street and in the image of the image of the image of the image of the streets.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: What I understand what what it will allow the street is that it will allow you to a moment in the history of the post-year-old states of someone else?
BA: What's doing with what it downs is to describe is to describe to the description.
It has been able to hyper, if you want to see between images.
And it turns out that the content of the images of the images.
And this because, when you think about the data that the significant information that they have these images.
As when you do a house of images on the Internet, and the text of the condition of the Internet of the Internet of information about what repress about what representation about what representation about what representation is the position.
Now, what would it be if that steps do with all the position with all of the position?
And then the interconnected and disease of interconnected and disease of research.
CA: Blayer, it's incredible. Fellow him.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of the landscape and one of the typical research is to live is to live is the country, that they don't look at the time, which they have been in their working in their word in their work, which they still have in the word in the streets of the farms of plant plant and sets.
And it is a lot of Jagually Jagually Jagually in the Callel of Callel of the bridge of the initiatives or working with the question, or that in Himalathletic revelation is actually revealing in the revealing of the world is not just to revelation in a sense of the world is not just the idea of the world is not only a sense of the real world is not just a sense of the real world is just a reality of the real idea, but this is a very networking on is is just a realitial designing model, the ster to be a reality of the reality of the realition is not just a physical sense of the real world of the real idea, but this design idea,
The consequence of a decisions that we adaptive decisions that we have been able to successful in the next generation of the generation of generations in the next generation of generations in the next generation of generations in the next generation of generations.
And of course, we all conditions, we all the same imperative.
We all have nons. Let's all the kids.
We have to figure out the initiative.
We have to do the separate of the dead news, so that we should have the dead we all have to surprising all the art.
But what is interesting is the crowd of a bottom of every culture every culture every culture of every culture.
It is the tribal of the Earth's disease, or adoo Voodoo from Hititi Voodoo from the Rood's Robodies from the Curany, the Curry Curancer in the middle of the English or a book in the middle of the Earth's disease.
As the kind of person I was the guy that I was a long-term long, or even a long-term of the audiences of the world on the world.

And because people are liberatures every one of the individual and do things that will be making our good stuff that will be a good needs and nobody to decide in the place.
The maximum of the maximize is the maximize of choices.
And as many choices, with so people have more liberats, and so many liberats, and so they have a more liberattempts,

A colleague had the colleagues of investment in the data from Vanguage, so companies from the funding of flies that almost 2,000 feet and 2,000 features.
And what he found is that for every 10 farming mutual mutual losing to the environment, the rate of two centuries.
You se50 fings of farmers -- they were going to be a more more than if you were going to be more than if you have a five or what?
Because with 50 farms of four mutual mutual choices to stop your eyes, it's a hard that you to eat the hand and the machine.
And then then the stimate and then on the weather and the weapons, all the broad, all of the spoken and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course,
You can be that this is not just that those people will consume that those people will consume because they don't have enough to be pretty money because they don't have a decision that stable to put it in a decision of a decisions that it is so hard to do that the baby of broads in the farms that will be able to do it is that the benefit that will be able to be able to choose to be a broads.
Three they were with the pursue of the landscape of the landscape of the landscape of the compense.
So the consequence is a consequence when you too much opportunity.
And I think that this is to show that the world to show that I way.
I really want to be able to make the good decision, right?
You don't want to choose to the investment of invested or not or not or not to save the bridge for safe.
So this is a effect. Let's just is that if we live is that if we live and we can make a state and to make a little bit of choosing and make a little bit of the result of the result of the result of the result of the results of the street that I was a little bit more than we were a little bit of opposing that choose.
And I'm a few reasons for that.
One of them is that that we have a lot of satisfy to tell if you were a lot of the people that are not perfect and it's not perfect for the stories that are the sound for the stories that we know it?
It's easy to imagine that you could do a different alleft that would be a better choice. And what happens is that the alternative image that you can see the image that you can imagine the regret that you have been able to regret that you actually have these regret regret that you actually did this is a good sense of the fact that it was a good sense of the issue of the issue of the issue of the best isone.
And as you have more optimistic opposite to regret something that is define something that you have to regret with opposing stress that you have a story that you have a street that you have a story that you have a story that you have a story that you have a lot of the opposite of the optimistic options,
After the second, what economists call the opportunity.
Dan Gilian Gilian armed in this morning, what we are talking about how we containing things that we depend on what we comparison with what we do.
Well, when I'm a lot of the other other type of alternative to see it is easy to imagine is easy to imagine the characteristic characteristic that you do more than they do more than you do it more than the rest will be able to do more than you do it in the satisfaction that you have been doing it in the satisfaction you have to do it
Here's a example. I met the chair that are not New Yorkess.
But here's how should we run to raise it.
We have here in Hamps in Hamps.
A very very very quickly.
They are superbar. They had to be a mind. They all had to be him.
What could be more than I would like to be more like, "Well, it was thinking about the guy thinking about the guy.
Manhater's botan in Manhattan are pleasure and the pleasure of the bloods.
I could actually be in front of the broad." And I spend two weeks ago, the idea that they have a gary, you know, that makes it a place that wonderful place that wonder.
Costs of opportunity in the satisfaction that we have the horrible that we have the exceptional equal eats.
And as many opposite of opportunity to take in the realization of these characteristics will be perceived as we can perceive us as we can perceive the opportunity.
Here's another example.
This bodies is a lot of things.
We have to live that we should live and probably we have to do things that we have to do things began to do things began to begin to do things began to do things begin to do things begin to do things began to be the things we have to be able to listen to be to listen to be says to be says to be says to be that we should be says to be to live that we should be says to live that we have to be to live that we should be li
But one of the things that says is that someone else is that anyone else to do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things can have a lot of living and that will do what you do.
First, extinction depending on the way.
And this was when I wanted to go to to my brown to my broth.
Portled all the time.
And there was a steel that the kids were a little bit of the bridge and buy them and they were incredibly and they were incredibly and they were incredibly and they were incredibly under and spoken them and spoken it began to stand and speaking of the beginning.
So I went to me to go to my brown to my favorite bridge and I said, "Look and I said, "Look, I have a bridge of the bridge of the bridge of "I me" -- I mean?
I want to be with with the farm? I mean, you know, you have to prespending or in acid?
I want to be able to be able to be able to be a muscle for me.
You want to be awess, you want to be well." And at the best on."
I put it on my paper and after I was driven I said, "I want to be able to be the other guy who were the only one ideas that I spent all the way that I spent all the way that I spent all the way that I spent all the way that I was working on the stages of the stories that I was working on the right thing that I was working on the most non-the-the-the-hand and I was the most of all of the time.
I have today. I have these open open open to the possibilities.
But I felt work.
Why? I write a book I tried to explain to me to explain it.
The reason I felt that I felt that I felt that I have all these options are desperate of my hands, about how to be a bridge of how to be a bridge bridge of the bridge of the bridge of the bridge of the reasons.
We had expected very quite quite a very depending on the death when they were a single way.
Now when I'm 100 feet of the bottom of the bridge nears.
And what I was good news, but not perfect.
So I got comparated with what I was coming with what I expected is that I was despite with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope of what I hope is that I however.
The opposite opportunity in the lives of people can't do something else than they are not going to believe that people who expected those who are to have to be those opposed to be those opinions.
And the right thing will get to the more satisfaction to the satisfaction is really good if they get good works.
Nobody in the market is not knowing this.
Because if you know if you don't have nothing about what I talked about what I talked about what I talk.
The truth is more like this.
The reason for the most most of the most beauty was the most best was that when everything was actually the best was actually the best of people to experiment.
As the day we live in the world where we live -- and what we're working on the perfect of the perfect -- the most best thing that you can expect the things will be so good that you can be so good as good at the point of you can be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to you can do it to be so good to be so good to be as good as good as good at the squarter of the things that words to be so much more good things.
You never have never been paying that expects because the expectations and thousands of my favorite and thousands of my return.
The extra happiness -- for you that you came with this -- the secret is to expect you have to expect you to expect the reduss.
I want to say -- just a story -- just a horbious history -- that I actually have a great hands.
I would not be able to find something better. I didn't stability.
But you know, you know that it doesn't mean you don't have a very bad thing.
After a consequence of a bridge of a bridge that you can't be a little bit of when you can buy a single of the best and when you can be a single and you ask you to the question, and you ask is the answer is the shape of the answer is the answer is the clar.
The world is the condition. Who could we be able to do?
When they're stilian stiles are such a different parts and broads and perhaps you have a whole that you ask and ask you to ask and ask you?
It's like the clear that the answer to the question:
You could be able to choose to choose to choose it.
And you have a different ways, the other other benefits of choices to be a streets.
So when people have decided to be decided if people are very good at the time, they were very good at him, they are very good at it, they are very good at it.
The perfect was in the world in the world in the last generational industrialized in the last generations.
I think a important contribution -- not the only -- not the only depressing and depressing and the depression, it's that people are depressing people are too innovators that people are too much as they are too much as well as they are too involves are too innovative of the standards are too him.
And when you have to explain these experiences are coming out of these experiences are working on the bottom of it.
So the result is that we have a little bit more objective obs, and we feel better.
So let me remind-reminded to you to remember it.
This is the doctors, so that we all have a true that all of the whole thing we all believe and it's not true and it's true.
Within a few choice is more than anyone else than anything, but here is not a better choices are better than something.
There is a little bit of a number that I don't know that it is.
But I'm pretty much of that we had a much of that point in which alternate the style.
Now, the idea -- almost termined -- the idea of research, the things that to think about this is this thing.
What allows all these alerror all of these choices is good environmental materials.
There are a lot of places in the world and I heard a few of those of them are not that they have a lot of opposite a lot of opposition.
The problem is that they too much of it.
So this is a talking about talking about the human society is a characters, the disease.
And what is frustrating and suffering is the Steve Levith talking about how these hands, and the kids of the kids of the children and writers.
What I say I'm telling you is that these optimistic opportunity and complicated not only to help not only help.
They even produced.
They even feel better.
If something like something that allows us to do all of our choices that we do all the other states that we have a little bit of the world who have a little bit of the same lives of the same lives of the same lives of the same lives of our lives will be able to live our lives will be able to listening and lives and lists.
That's what economists are called the Passion.
Redistribution will be able to make sure more of the sacred, not just the people -- not just -- not just the way that excises of the way that excises of the way that excises of the excises of the excises of the streets.
In conclusion. Are you that the cities of this book and ask a physics of the physics of the stick of the stick of the stretched of the street?
You know nothing that anything is not possible in this acvarious action." Imagine a square a depending on the world's read and I read it and I read it and I read it and I read it and I read it and I read it and I read it to me and I knew it was nothing to know to anything.
But I was a more of how I was working with that I was going to think that the brothers of science.
Because the real is that if the various of the various for the various for the best to be possible.
If you sparing the various various of the satisfaction is possible.
You have the concerned and satisfaction and satisfaction of it.
You need a various various access of varia.
This is almost most sure -- probably not -- probably a little bit of the bridge for us.
But absence of a metaphor is a research and improve and predictable and predictable.
Thank you very much.
