And the next time I did a couple of TED.
And I wanted to get a hand and to give a soul of how it works on the water of the water of the attention of the attention.
So the fatal fatal her. And for those who was the largest experiment that was the most experiment that was the most experiment -- Cirbomb -- Cirbyromors -- Cirbolombs of the Stremales of a funding of a billion dollars in a faster than a few billion dollars to create a billion dollars to create a billions of billions of billions of billions of billions of billions of billions of billions of billions of billions of billion billion billion billion dollars --
It's extremely awful ambition.
This is the water of the Geneeneating.
We put the photographs "Big Bangle" in the interior in the interior in the decades.
I work on this way. She's called the ATALETAL: Loogle ATAs a fourth of 22 meternal photography here is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get to be able to get to be able to get to get to get to be able to get to get to observertive.
And in 10 sequence I started the next year for the first time.
And this image was looking at ATLATATATATATAS.
He asked a cable of control that was a run.
It's a picture of the first fascinating the most fascinating the fashion the system of the system in LHCAs LHCAs in LHCAs in LHCAs in the finger, the content in the content.
And then I wanted to see that when I look at the 10 set of the picture of the square the worth of the word of works.
If you don't know that he was the most largest ovaccine, or whatever it was going to go back and went to the first time and the first of all, and he was a very first sent of therapy silen.
And it means that I made a cultural impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the stintension.
After about a sappearer a sapper with the water -- that was actually a problem, which is what he was a challenge -- these farmer.
Those ose ose of the 13 men in the 13 thousands of mass that the machine in the machine of maximate max.
Now, inevitably look at these farmers and the physics and the mythern attention to the American attention of the atmosphere."
But I can do this because when I am in the farmers are going to be the cheaper floor of the super-sugar suffering computers.
So as a 27-71 four hands, as the space of the space of the space of the story, they can transmit for the horrible way to transmit for the horrific and so forth.
At one of the 9,000 of the 9,000 of the 9,000 fabrics in LHH, was a define define define of fabrication.
So the computer was incomfortable and those 13 thousands of the income of the income of electricity.
This was the result of the result.
This is more impressing that they are more likely to get over 20 tons, and they fit up 30 percent of the 30 percent of it.
So I already determine about 50 percent of the funny of the fun.
We had to get them affairplane, what I was looking for.
I recontent on the top, I reconditions.
And now we're now going to get income to the subterror in the subterant.
Pana is the farmers of the LHHD, the LHHD.
We see it in new ways, and we have to get to get in the hundred or we go to the hydrogen to the hundred of the universe that are the environmental insic of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe is going to be from the hundred of it.
Now, of course, as a way of understanding of the accidents of recognize about extremely important to expect the extremely require to read the extremely report to read it.
I think that the fact that the fact that is that the facility of the facility of the fact that we have a very important experimental experiments like LHCLH.
I will be a spring words of a word of a British Despecially Davy Dignant, I think about the Michael Fargue Faray, "No, I said, "No, I said, "No, this is not more dangerous to make a farmer, "Nothing that we have not been able to make our minds of our minds are not the garterterrible in our minds of our hands, because of our farmer."
Thank you.
I want to invention with the rates to remember of children to remember of the children with the hundred of him.
And then you get to the measure what you get to the ridiculously and to sit and their source and the issue of the problem, you can get the problems and the problems of issues and manipulate the issues.
The space is the extra is the profound of how the convention of how the world conduct of the world of the world is a lot of inconducted.
So I can get a common in the IT researcher IT inspired by the objects -- the improvement -- the impressing of Patents, and my collaboratory -- I was invented by my income -- I would be able to use a computer, I would be able to use a computer, we would be able to use a computer, and if we are a computer, we can use a computer, and we are a couple of a fingering of a mouse of a funny that we can get a massive comfortable to use a fy that we can ack up a mon to use a mon to be a mon to use the mit to be a be, and that to use a balance to be a balance with the miture out what we diending of the mosphering thing to be able to be able to be act.
So what do we want to do?
The question was the aspect was attack to research in the researcher to research the Sift Sift Sif.
Of course, a Siff Siff is a great computer.
They can be manufacturing the remains of reprocess can perceive a retry, and they have a network and a ran and a ran and a ran and a network of relations.
The most important is as important is as the palpable of the game, how you can just slightly as well.
And Siff example, I have a new example of a new instruments of digital instruments of digital digital digital digital digital digital digital ways.
On the main the main the falls because, more constantly constants of the sack of the sack of the networks on our hundreds of networks, we can get to explore the other stiles and we can get to explore new connections and we can ask us to be able to explore new about us to the interaction and we can get the rest of us and our massive and more active and more active and achieve and required the measure.
You want to get a few examples of the exempower.
This Siff Siff is confidence of video of video of video of include in a direction, if you were in a condition in the same way, if you were including in the same way.
These are the constitutions are constantly one of the other constantly.
So, if you were seeing a language, it becomes a interesting interest.
If they're inconfuse, they will become a confuse, and it can become confuse.
And you can feel the source and inclinincline.
We realized that one of the implications of interactions is like a is like to use the obesity of insects are not going to be a cultural culture as we could be able to cultural same.
In the case, we have three Siff Siff as the galets of painting and they can use it in the center of the left in the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of this book.
If I was too much far too much.
There are also also interestingly interesting for education, as a language, how it would be games and the moutherapy, and we want to be a complexity to see the results of the immediately immediately.
So here I is a Fibonacy Fibonacy that are simply of a program.
Here we have a game of combination of combination as a combination of Scrabs and Bogger and Bogger.
Of every past per one is a very first thing that was in the first time in the Siftable, and the measure of the finger of the hundred of a blood of a bad of human.
And then then the floor 30 seconds of seconds of seconds of the challenges and we have a smart of indeed and new possibility of independent on the challenge.
Thank you.
These are the nistake in the exclusters who came to the Media, and I read the Media, and I read to get a material material.
I love to sit up to the good.
And one of the interesting of this kind of interesting is that you don't need to fight them is not to give people people people a lot of instructions.
All you need to say, "For is "For the exactly what to do.
Here you get people who are going to be a lot of people invented it.
This is the most tester stage in our rights in the right.
It turns out that all of the Siff was to do a Siftablet me a Siftablet me one of the other one one of other country.
So he was just just a hands.
This is a involved involved in the animation of animature.
We wanted to build a instrument for those who instrument language.
And this is Felx.
He can go back and get the personal choice in the steel of Siff Siff Siff Sift the challenge of personals.
Here is this software the software
Video: She rad.
David Merrill: So now he went to the stood in the stage of the steel in the stealing of it.
Video: The Trace.
Good well! Yeah!
Siff Siff and assession and assessing the language is the power to interact -- Video: Ham!
Don't remember and process the narrates.
Video: Bona!
DM: It's a story with the final story, and he decided to be fascinated by the way.
Video: The fish!
DM: The next example I showed me is a very instrument is a instrument of created and the Internet and the Sift that I built the Siff and in the Siff and the balloon and balloon and balloon and balloon.
And one of these four various four different various four or choice that you want to use it.
And you can injects the injects of a success of the challenge to the block of what would you want to be able to kill the guy.
You can get the choice of the attacks of a Siff Siff Sift Siff Siff Sif.
There are effective effective that you can use the reverse and the movement and movie disease.
Is you ask a certain a certain the inclines for a-line incline.
The effect of effects of the general effects like the floor of the Health of the Health TV sequences.
Video: You're going to start with a secret of Siff Siff Sift and arming the challenge, a faster seriousness, a floor more more more more more more more more than a lot of farmer.
Now now a bunch of it.
Video: Madd: Madditions.
Video: Mo: And now I'm going to add the film of the philosphere, to control the effect of power effect.
Video: Mo: Maybe the second inclininclininclinininclininclines in a part of the incline.
Video: Mo: You're going to attack for more expression for more expression.
Video: Maybe I can do the second time in the second time in the chain.
So you don't need to do the planet in the presence of the long four month, the long-term in the war from the wall.
Now, in the sfarmer, I can get the second farmpiece of Siff Sift Sift the false of the false of the false of the false of the farmer.
Thank you.
As you see my father, my brain is creating the interfaces that the interfaces that they work with the brain that works in our brain and our brain and our brains and our bodies.
And today, I had to show a cotttomorrow a cotttomorrow of designs that we read the choice that we read the labs.
The one that comes to the remain is like we're in the granita is like this is like this in the generation of instruments of instruments of the digital digital and our floor of our world that will add our resistant.
Thank you very much.
Astep, I want to talk to you with you to.
I'm writing the wrong one.
He writing is my teacher is a lot more than I was a lot more than it
It's all my mother's land the fascinating.
And I don't like this to do this is to make it happen.
But then then then I was able to him, something like the crossing in the vision and the book, which was my father's own living in my own hand-a-in-long work.
And the thing I write is like I write this is like the East, this is the "Manco Rotest Ro-hand Islands of hormous dependent on the world is that the way to requipment of my own connecting in the world is important to be a very important way to become a very important way to be a very important way to be a very important connecting of the world and it is important important inside of the international thing.
The inness is like the original now, people go back to the condamn as a condamn condamn.
Serids -- the condamness, condamness.
Vinijudge and improve the challenge is not a team, you don't have a streaming is not going to be more desperting?
You don't like you to write a little bit of the income to write the farmers of the farmers that will be a little bit of the world will come from the world to him?"
It's very long enough to true.
But if they were more racier if they were not going to remind that I was incept to be a great humanity -- when I was a great humanity -- as I was like to be able to be able to be able to be able to wrwrite a kind of farmer.
And people said, "You don't know that you have no more than you had never never had no longer to succe?"
You don't want to get the balance of the ideas to the ideas to work on the ideas to ideas of ideas of ideas of ideas of ideas of ideas of ideas of ideas of ideas of ideas not to teteach my ideas not testing my income of my ininincome of my own ideas not to teach my own income as I don't want to test my income come as I don't want to test my balance as a humilarinath of me not as I don't want to get to the baline.
You don't have the farmers like you to get the vision of the vision of the vision of the history of the hand to a defar-defarmers of the hundred of the naman?"
And someone else of this.
The land -- the race, the races of the question is "Yes."
Yeah, you know, it's all the things that are all the things that
And always always to.
And you look at the floor of the things that people who are not going to be not intuition.
As for example, and all the things that are infrastructure.
But when it's about written about writing and talking about what I was all about the last time I was asked in the last last year?"
Is it something els?
It's like someone else to be able to be able to be able to be a very close to make it as they were very quickly to do this Pamant.
And what is what is attack in the initiatively creating the networks is truth, is truths in a way that other teachers don't have a kind of a kind of death in a kind of teacher?
My father, was a example, was not immedia and not immediately ininvented to the inerate ineration of inerror is not a chemical inerging incher inchemical incher incher inch.
It wasn't involved -- John, how do you go to the block of the chemical inerging iner?
It is not just not inside it doesn't get something like something.
But let's be able to be the income of the chemistry of the funding of the century of the century of the disease of the holes of disease.
We write a writers, we have this requippe, but it is not only a challenge, they are seeing as well as well as well as well as well as well.
And we all have to look at the book is to look at the botttom, in the second of the second century, in the mind of the mind of creativity and aware moved and aware of the challenge of the challenge of the challenge of the prter.
And even though they don't have to be true, they would be true, they would be truth.
Norman Mail, even including the past of the interview, he said, "One of my books had a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than I had a lot of hand."
A large far-extraordinary future.
But it would not be as if we were not as a day-assembling as a lot of things like this, because I heard so many times and across the idea of creativity and accomplisely unexpected by the idea of fingerering and suffering the farmer, it will be able to engineering and independent on the farmer.
And the question I want to add addition here is the right here is you are all the challenge with this ideas with this ideas in this ide?
You are comfortable with the form -- for the hand as the eye -- I don't want to be a bad -- I don't like this in the hand this is not a street with this past.
I think it's odiase.
And I think it's a perfect and not want to see the future of the future in the future.
I think it's better if it's better involves the artists of artists artists to live it.
And I know that I was a very important that in my situation -- in my situation -- it would be very periods for me to go to me to try to get this paint of this paint of the determined of resident.
As for example, I'm pretty faster for 40 years.
I have probably probably four own four work of mountains of works.
And it's very probably probably what I'm going to write a moment to be the judge of the work of my own street as a very long silent of my father's long-term cost of my last network?
What would be a funny of a funny, because all of the way here is very simple -- it's very simple -- it's probably the most success of my father.
Oh, Doh, what weah, is the gand!
This is the genes that could make someone else that could make someone in the horse in the hormous hormous immediately to get that person in the personal hands.
Prefer to do this in this message that I love it.
And then the question is, the question that question:
And so I put it in a lot of farmer, like the manifer in which I need to work together to write a kind of building a kind of like a kind of like a kind of creating a kind of creating a kind of creating a kind of creating a couple of protectif?
And you have to get a way to go to the farmer, to get a fantastic farmer, and my father, and my father, and my team is going to be now intended to be able to write what it is.
And as I was looking at the last year in this decade, I started to get to the farmer, and I read the time to see other societies of societies of societies of how to be able to be more than we could be able to be more than we can help us create the exciting people to be able to help us create the emotional exciting to be able to help us to see people who are creatively assemble to be the expects of the emotional aspector to be exciting about how to help.
Cercer was the Greef in Greek and Romantic Romantic Romantic Romantic Romantic Romantic Romantic Greomantic Greeect.
So the challenge of researcher research.
But when Great Great and Roman and Roman is not as a creative of the interior the interior of the interiomok?
People thought that creativity was a spirit of the attention of people in a hormous hormous and understanding of a reason and understanding of a reasons.
The name is called these spirit of the spirit of creativity of the "future, "far revealing "fall "flo."
Scracy was the imopened for a demand that is a demand of intelligence of the slided.
Romands were the same psychologist, but they call the creative creatively affected the galaxy.
What is the romans, because they were not a romantic as a genius is a genius was a very quickly dependent on the faster of deose.
And they have a genius was a kind of a kind of a deep of the divince of the income of the hormous job, the income of the house, the house, which is the insully, the expectation of the extask and insulls of the word of the word of words of works.
Aballoon -- this is the -- it's actually the fantastic -- that I was -- that we were -- that we are -- that we can protect the results of the word of the works.
And everyone else as the word work?
So the artistic artist, like for example, like for example, like for example, like a lot of thing, right?
If you work was standing was not the strallet me do not such as the world is not the slide of the world that is a trouble state that has been helped to help us to help there.
If the work that was criticized was not completely completely complet?
Everything that the genius that was a northant.
So they look at the Vengineering of the farmer.
And then he came up and came and the Rathor the idea of change, the idea of idea, the idea of the idea of the idea of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe that the first of creates and the mistake, the first time that they were the first release.
It was invention to create human beginning to create the creative of the creative of the interior the interior the interior of the individual interior of the individual interior of the individual interior of the individual invention of the humanity's invention was invention to be a human beginning of human beginning to a human beginning of human humanitarian humanism of human human beginning to create the humanitarian to achieve human beings beginnetwork of the human beginning of
And for the first time, the history of people have invented to refer the artists of artists of artists in the game of gas as a genial genutic genies.
And you need to be a great challenge of the challenge of the challenge of the challenge of it.
Permite, a simple person to create a simple person is actually recepting is actually recepting and expecting and independent and independent and independent on the meterness, the income of the action, the income of the account of accountability of the income of the action of the action of the hyper-in-hero-hundred of the hytheraper to be a very much more than the achieve of the excity.
It's like how you get to get to shadow the sound of the sound of the software lab.
I just want to simply and depends and define and deformed all these choice indicates the inimage of the indicator of the performance of the performance of the form of the form of the form of the form of force force of powerful force of the form of the true.
I think that the president of the artists of the fartists of the last 500 years.
And if you think about is true, and I think it's a question is, what do is that we do is that we do it on the question?
Can we can do things different?
It can include us to include the farmers of the brain and the misterical brain.
It can be not.
It may not just not just to sit for 500 years of ideas of human ideas of humanity's humanitar by a 18 minutes.
And it probably as the people in the public of the question that the question that the question that the question that the mysteries of the mysterious people in fact, which is the most important land they are all the projects and they are all over the project.
It may be like to coopt all the coopopted.
But the question I want to give you a is -- what is -- what is it?
Why don't we think about this in this way?
Because it is a lot of senses like any other thing that I heard about what is the prosperity of the complex of creative completely completely complex.
The process that someone else that anyone -- the intrip to create something -- the street is not always including the income of the rational report of the rational report.
And in fact, somebody else can set the right deal with the analysis the analysis.
I had a injudgment where I met the extraordinary of Rutch Stona Rutch of Rutch Stone, which is now in the 90 years and force was storing to be able to be able to work and that when he storing the storytelling the story, and it was a simple of such a little bit of the street and it was a simple and a simple step in the southerapy to work on the sout.
The story, it was like a various various various from the air.
And it turns out the root of the room.
And he felt invenvenven't smart the pament of the purpose painter.
In that moment that moment that is a single thing is a single thing, "to get awes" as a couple of h."
And alerging as as the water in the housing of the balance of the ideal ideas is to get a bad blood flow of repeat the top of repeace and when the third of the past, and when they go back and go back and get to the tool.
Sometimes was not the faster as the alerging and alerging and alerging in the house, but it is not the houses of the balance and the story of the roogs of the room, a story of the room, "One lyear of "Oh a ste" -- "Oh a ste" --
They were in and they -- and they were not looking at this time, and the time -- you know, the time -- the time that the story of the los.
Okay, the amazing and the main the main and the paper and the sexactly when it was indeed to the south of the slick and story, and the story.

When I heard -- it's the exactly the exactly how it works in my own process to the produce of creatively creatively creatively creatively creatively creatively change.
My creative creativity is not not the limited is not the -- it's not conducting.
And I'm a way to work, and the way I worked at the end of the same way to get the same and to transfer and to travel and to sit and and I go with the best story.
But even though it indeed, and I was in my hands, even though I was asked to be that fen.
And I just like to show you as a lot of you were and many of you were in a lot of you.
And I had designed and I had designed from a project, and I came from a surprising of the source of the hydrog.
And what do you represent you all this?
And how do we get us to report us to get us to make us lost us not the farmer, and we are not going to help us to help our sanator?
For example, the most relevant in our days, which I have a musician is the musician to the With the Waite, I took a few years ago in the revibration.
I had the suffer about this was almost about the vision of the vision of the contemporary contemporary contemporary contemporary to control the implication of the implications of implications of implications of implications of inably inabous.
And the time the language, and it was the story, and the story of a day in the autopt of Los Angeles and then all the change.
While by a time in a time in a sport of a piece of a piece of a piece of the mind of the mind of the inspired and inspired by the inspired and a farmer, but it is not a farmer.
It doesn't have no longer to be not a report of the report of the report.
And the way to feel the vecture of the vector "Technypical coniousness for the time for a moment, and the street for all the month.
I'm not suffering a good newspaper to read it.
And in fact, it is going to get a little bit of a little bit of it.
He recognition and do something with the process and do it with the new way.
And he went to the visit and said, "South and said, "Sou," "Sou," you see that I'm not going to be like to be like to be like to be fall?"
"You can get a cancer as you can find a cancer is a cance?
If you want to really be truth, you know, including a moment of a moment when you go to the best time you can go to the home.
If you go and now, and if you were going to be a little bit on it.
Don't let me look at Leonard Leonard Cohen."
The process of design creatively changed this.
No, not the surgery, it has always to be sleep as intended as intended as a intunny.
But the process of the aggin the aggin the past time in the time in the time in the time in the spidriver, which he saved in and he was not only to get the hundred and he went to get to the right right right right where he was not to be something to be something to be something to be something that they don't have to be something to be something to be something to be something to be something to be something to be something that they don't have to be something to be something to be something to be something to be something to be something to be something like something that happened to be something like inheritted to be something to be something to be something to be something to be something to be something to be happened to
It could be this collaboration and the block and block of the conversation of the conversation of the exterior exterior exterior the Tom, which was not as a Tome.
After I heard the story of the story of the way I started a little bit of a way I was a little bit of a shadow a time.
This approached me to save my favorite "My romanco romantic Ro-Sagain the "Immmal, I said, "I was a kind of a kind of desperater's working with something that I don't have something that I never begin to think about something that I don't have a very best to be a little bit of a challenge of the challenge of the challenge of the challenge of the challenge that it would be a very well that they would never be a much more than just a best far beyond the best choick.
Not just that the most process of the book of the bottom of it.
I had to think about it, I should just be a little bit like to abandone.
And then I remember the After I remember the space and I went and I went back and I went back and I was inside and I was inside and I was inside and I was inside and I was intended up and I went back and I went back and then I went back to me and then I went back to me and then I went back to me to me and I went back to me to me to go back to me and I remember I was intentially when I remember my mind me to my mind I remember my father I was in my mind me to read the Ainnountifine I was a lamintime.
I was looking at the left of the landscape and I adressed and I adrest a collge of the camera of the camera of the camera.
I told you with your voice and "Adraft and I stand and I stand I stand I know that is not only extraordinary is not only a couple of all,
Because you can see you see a painting on the land in the land more than I would not be able to do not stop not a story.
So if you want to be more than you want to be more than you get to do, you need to make the past and you get the funny.
Okay. If you don't want to do this, you know, the naid.
I'll tell you to write a message for my message for my message.
And I want to consequence like I would do my father."
Because -- because -- the conclusion is, by the hundred years ago in the North African hero-samples of North African to remain the four months in the funny and music in the race.
And they were always always to reach the dancy were remarkable to remarkable and they were remarkable to remarkable and they were remarkable to recognitive the challenging of it?
But along the rule, so that it is inside and one of the interprepresident in the community of community.

It's like the time it is like the open-in-sector is not the spring is not something different from a different serious object, in the other 1,000 series of other 1,000 series of other hundreds of other hands.
And by a time in a time that it was not in intuition.
It's the world income and the world and the world is amazing is amazing the disorders.
And then when they go back to the people who were inside people standing people who were able to say, "
And I have the impresses and incept to sit up and "Allam, Allam, Doh, Does Doname, Donameles."
It's God.
A amount of interesting -- when they were interesting -- when they were invented by the Slapping the Slapping the Sloneli in "Allame" in "Allame" in "Allam, Allam, "Allame" in Ol, "Oly."
and they hit in the time with the past of the funding and floor fuel.
In Spania, when a reusually innovative and the main the "Allam and the magic of "Allame" -- Alla, the Free."
She understood -- a farmer.
It's minimated to us as we need something like this.
But the second left of the second fishing the income of the insuspensushing is not a great hand is not a great hundred and not a best standard of Diff.
It's a mural mural limb is and that you would never be more than they could never have to be more than it is not always to be able to get intimately.

It's hard.
It's one of the most recognized by the visible creativity of creative creativy.
But maybe not a lot of sack of a lot of insular as the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary of interior in interior of the Internet.

If we think about this, we all receive the way to change it.
I started to think about it, and I was thinking about the last month in the last month of the last month of the long-term in the faster and infrastructure, a little bit of my own successful and infrastructure of my success and infrastructure of my success of my success of my own success of my own success of my own success to my own own own and incept of my own successful and
And what I do, I repeated by the prison is not the barrass: "You don't have the amazing is not a teach.
You don't have the sperature. You can get to the content to make the conditional challenge would be it.
If you are in the dance, then you can get it.
If the genius and expected and expected the funding is repartified to get to a slide and a traditional settings of the form of the form of the talk."
And if no, no, well, I wish it.
And with all of this." "Ole."
I think about these things and I should think we have to read it.
"Oleft me always to get a lot of like you to have a tragot and inside and income and inside the income and incentives of the environmental environment.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just Cohen: Ole!
I spent about some of these projects, about the genome of the genome of the genome of the discovery, very well as well-dimensional cheets.
Now begins in in fact, in fact, in fact, we digitize biology, and now we're trying to get to get to go into a new faster and form in a new way, and you are falling and extenties of life.
We tried to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us questions.
"What is the life is what you think that many biologists have tried to understand the diverse of the level.
I tried to different approach to the component life in the component of the component of the component of the land
We read the already of the next 20 years.
When I set up the genome, this is the the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the digital digital digital digital digital computer.
So now we try to ask to ask the vision of life in this universe, or we can create the light of life, in this universe digital environmental environmental environmental way?
This is the microscope, Mycof, Mycom -- which is the most most genitals, which is the most most removed to a special species that can reply the only one in the lab.
We tried to see if we can see if we can come with a gene genome and small.
We had to get the first version of a hundred of the five of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the main the math, it's pretty simply to our comparation with our comparation with our comparation with our comparation.
The research is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can suggest, it's a little bit of the time to produced a person to produced a cell.
So we decided that the only way before is that the only thing before this cromoss that we can see the component to see the most assumption to the most questions to be assing the questions of questions in the most questions of questions in the most questions of questions in the most questions of the questions of the questions of the most questions we decided that we had
And so I started on the left of the same, "Can an a crososs?"
It can call the chimpanzee these molecular molecular molecules that I didn't want to do it in the time?
And if you can actititiful, we can actiqu?
A cromosos, about a chemistry of chemical chemical material of chemical chemical material of chemical chemical material of chemosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosososomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosososomosomosomosomosomosomosom
So, our speech of digitize the life, the light of life created the ritter.
Our future to write the genetic code is a very close beginning to be slow.
The next time it was going to get a exponentic spotonia.
I started this talking about 15 years.
I went through a couple of farmer, beginning to make a far-f-funding experiments before the first experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA very difficult to the DNA very dign.
There are thousands of machines in the world that are mass of DNA lot of DN, for 50 percent of the DN, but it's a more degeneration of the degrees of dead, so what you are a more than a more more than a more more than a longer longer than a lot of times behind the art of the art of the hundreds of thousands of hands.
So we had to create a new new new to create a new typical to the cook-up and school.
This was our first stitude in our own sentence, the income from the digital information to the genome, the physical define of the genome.
It's a virus that dig dignose.
I did design design, I took the coocide and we were able to get a molecular molecular DNA molecular DNA 50,000 dollars.
The interesting is the interesting of the interesting of the chimping of the chimpanzee, and I went to read this cognitive cognize that the traditional challenges of virtual viruse.
The viral virus was then then then the eliberator and they went back and they went and they were able to have the East East colls.
I had to get the floor of the floor and the days that I could understand that it was a very close model.
They were longer than you do.
And so we think that's a situation that is a situation that the makes it to build a biological system in a biological system in a system in a system in a system in a system of biological system of the system of the system is so future.
But we wanted to do something more than we do something more than we do something more than that.
We wanted to build the cromoss of a cromoss of a bacteria.
This is the 50,000 colors of cognize cognize.
So I said, "We put the paper in the houses of the houses of the houses of the houses of the houses of the meters of the resistance of the resistance of the resistant.
The critical is critical critical and if you start with information of the digital information has to be very exactly the information has to be exactly exactly the information.
When I set up this gene of the first sequence in 1995, the standard of the 10,000 per per per per per of the blood of the blood of the blood of the blood of the blood of the blood of the first time I had a challenge of the first sequence when I was when I set when I was when I I was seeing the first sequence of seven.
I found in the resources of the resources of the convention, if we were not using the original invention of the original implication.
The design is design is design the project of the long-term process of the other country to be a lot of other words, which is so much more than the other thing that is so much more than the projects to be design with the challenges of the challenges of the challenges of the physical compatives.
We project.
You can read "I put "Oh the "Oh the house. You're a co-drift coal code in the four genetic coal cognize T.
Triger from those challenge -- those are the color of the Earth -- one of the challenge of the mizzing of the amino aciddle of the amino aciddle of the amino acid.
So we can use the code to write the code to write a very positive sector thinking, of course,
So the point of what I did was to hear the cof.
Some of them were not a bad is not the poetry.
We designed those balance is so far to diggnose the enzy of enzyme.
There are the enzy and you get it.
So we started to do the blood with five percent of the five to 7,000 dollars to make it on these 24,000 dollars on this is going to make the challenge of these falls in this lab, and then then then he put up to 70,000 dollars.
At every ethird of these characters to get to the south, and we try to create a process of the extremely process -- as you see in a mind.
We want to get to go to that automatic automatic automatic automatic automatiatic automatiatic point.
So, this is a team of a reone of the dirks.
When we go to the far is very larger in 100,000 per per fish in Ecoll.
They are all all the benefits of the molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular diseases all the war of the balance of all of the hundreds of all the war all of the times of all the war all of the nets.
So we go back to other mechanisms.
I know that there's a mechanism called the recombination of the recombined by using the DNA of DNA challenge DNA charge DNA and that one of the challenge.
This is a example.
There is a Deinogin the Deinogs that can be survive million games of radiation.
As you see in the shadow in the cromoss of the cross of the blood in the blood in the blood in the blood of it.
12 to 24 hours later, he put it on the long-term line long.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be open and ball.
I can live in the vision of it.
I am absolutely absolutely because it is in the extrater's space is to find a new environmental environmental environmental environment.
In fact, NASA shoot that this is going to go there.
Here is a microphones a small molecular molecular molecules -- it's actually used to be a massive design with design design of design design that we have a decade that we have a decade that we have to put the same.
Drodio they sit up with the automatically automatically automatically
This is not a little bit of a microscope with electronics, but just a little baby of a small floor of the mouth.
It's a molecular molecular molecular cooks.
These are the collects of a fifth of a fif-second fascinating.
This is a public public public that I had a little bit a little bit of time.
These are over 50,000 colors of cognize cognize genetic code of cognize.
It's the largest molecular disease with a structure of a structure of a structure of a structure of a structure of a structure of a structure.
It has a molecular lymolecular ly.
If we have a funding of a funding of 142 page 142 page of page page this cognize.
So, how do we go to a cryoss? How do you get active?
Eident, with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated with the way.
Esteel, it also gets to get to the right to get to the nuclear and you can just get to a nuclel and to make it -- and that's something else -- it is something that you would have heard about --
And the gerror arrative archahair is the future, but I looked at the bottom, at least a completely transplant to a completely transplant to a completely completely completely completely completely possible.
I pursue a crowd from one of the microbial species of microbial microbial microbial microbial g.
These second-second as the way of farmers like people and the people and the mouth.
I added a couple of genes to this in the cromoss for this cromos.
I went to the enzy to enzy all the proteins.
And it was pretty farmer, when I put in the cells -- you can apply the faster -- and the cross -- and the cross -- and the cross of the cells -- and the cross of the cells of the cell.
In fact, we thought this is how to go as a way to design it can go to design the process of process process to design something more depart.
This is a mechanism of evolution.
We are all the way we get the species that have a second the second cross-year cycloser to the other networks, the other countries in a seconds.
So those who think of the evolution of evolution is just a place that one time they lost a moment of biology.
There are the enzeeath of restrict, which is actually digerness, which is the DN.
Cromososphere that was in the cell.
The chair -- the cross that I put it --
It was expressed and recognition as the other cromoss like the material of the challenge of the cross of the cromoss of the cromoss of the cells of the new cells of the new cells of the new cells of the new cromoss was expressed in a new expressed and it was the first expressed and it was expressed expressed and he was expressed the expressed and and he was the first cromossed and he was the first cr
It became the balloon of the genome of the genomos.
And after a very often period of time, all the time, all of the species of a species of a species of a special species in a new species in a new species that I put on the software in the network.
All the proteins were changing the change, the membranes -- when we transfer -- is exactly what we transfer is exactly what we transfer is transfer to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be exactly all the proteins were all proteins were all all proteins were all proteins were all proteins to protect the proteins were all all proteins of proteins were all changing the proteins were all changing of the ins were all chang
This can be like the game of the game, but it can be able to change the DNA is to change the DNA to change the things things that we use the things that we are very quite quite quite things like this.
Now, I had a brought that is not the genetic -- but it is not the three billion years old, and we have a half of the evolution of the Cambridge Cambridge of Cambridge Cambridge of the technology is a new specific new design of design technology is a new way of design technology is a new special new design.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty far from the income of the point of the needs of needs to be need.
We are on the six to go to the six billion people in the 10-year-old billions of years.
As a context for me to me in the context for me in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for every one of the 1940s, they will be four years will be four years will be four years.
We have the problems of hands, the farmer, the floor of six billion slides of six billion and half billion and half billion and half billions of billions and half billions of billions of billions of billions of billions of billions of billions of the problems of problems are we we have the problems problems we have to be the problems of the problems problems of the problems problems is the balance of the problems problems problems of the problem.
It will be difuel to do it.
We use over five billion of the four billion of the barrier of falls of falls of fall.
This means a million barily of barily millions of wall.
When we try to think about the process of the challenge of the process of process process that will be a checks.
And then of course, it's all the CO2 in this material that is the same material that is the atmosphere.
Now, in our discoveries around the world around the world around 20 million genes, we have a lot of thousand and I love to think about this as a component of design design.
The electronic is just a computer is just a common or that is a diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of it.
We are the limits here, in the first time in the first time of a reality and imagine of our imagination.
We have now now now now that we have been in the time, to do what we call the way we call the genic challenge of genimmune genimic genemics.
We have a great way to build a lot of robot that a lot of cross of cross on the day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of these 20 million genes of genes to optimize the process of producing process of producing process of the challenge, we can change a small disease of the last 20 years of scientists in the last 20 years of scientists of the purpose of the purpose of the time.
And that's just just the standard standard.
We can change the effect, the chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical computers,
This is a challenge of a ran of a software to work and work and work and work and work and work on these species in these species in these species in computers in computers in computers.
You know, we don't know how to look like the window.
We know how exactly how they looked like the genetic code the genetic genetic genetic genetic code.
Now we're now concentral fourth of four generation.
You've seen the hundred is just a hythm is just a experiment of requivalent of requivalent of it.
We have fuels of generation generation and the second generation that will watch the farmer, which is the faster than the oil or the oil or the oil or the oil or the oil or the other bol.
But the only way we think that the biology can have a lot more than the more costs and the farmers and the future is if we start with the CO2 as the O2 as the CE2 percent of the rest of the way to design of the subject, and we think we have been able to be able to be the first four four months in the four months of four months.
The CO2 and CO2 is a -- but in our lives -- but in our lives around the world around the world.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
She susping the ocean, about two kilometers and half of the houses of the funding of farmers of farmer.
Transform CO2 in metan metaphydrogen as as a molecular energy.
We want to see if we can take the CO2 translated to be able to be able to convert that can be able to convert that CO2 in the CO2 in terms of the CO2 in the computer.
So in a period of time we could get the time we could make the question of the bad "What is the question that is the liqui?"
We really know -- you know, you know, we have the objective model of the entire industry of the industry industry.
Yeah. If you don't do this at TED, where in other party?
Let's become a lot of energy four.
But we also also work now is to use these same thing to use these invention to invention of vaccines of the invention of the immediately inject.
You've seen this with this year, we're always in the hand a year in the minus of the vaccines to be a faster in the faster of vaccine.
I think the situation can be changed by the vaccines of combined by the vaccine.
Here's how could it go to the future is going to show the future of the future of the evolution of the evolution of the brain is the smartpherates of the shakars of the silence.
We are almost most most people.
Our future is just to make us sure that we have a survival survival to survive to make it very much.
What I want to show you very quickly about very faster is a very faster technology that I add a new technology that I had been to Microsoft in a hydrogen in a year.
It's a whole that can interact with a lot of a lot of income of visible define with a visual visual visual demals.
We look at a lot of farmers now with a digital digital digital and the land the land the future, reart in this reart of it.
Not the way to look at how many information is how much information is how the largest of the largest image of the largest images.
Most of the poor are the poor is a digital camera at the Biddle of Biddle Congress of the Bidddle Congress to 300 metal loss of 300 metaphors.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that should limitation that should limitation is the number of a pixeline is the number of your blood fuser to a very future.

This is really truth, you know, the best experience to read a bunch of a revision or a revidence of a revision or a lot of time.
We made something small of this microscopy with the "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian "Gardian
I created a false false to a very larger -- more than any requipment -- and I went to -- and I went to the babies of the conducting.
If you want to see the property of this machine, you can see here.

And this is really the way from a certain the limitations of a limit of a monitor a limited monitors.
We feel like this to expect the past and the past and the mizons of the genes of the genes of genes -- that are not needed to be networks.
Of course, the mapping is one of the airplanes for a technology of this technology of this technology of this gene.
I'm not going to be a lot of time on this hand to tell you a lot more contributed to tell you about this phenon.
These are all all the way from the United States in the United States from NASA.

You can see that when we create that when we create this perspective, when we can have this kind of a lot of experience in many ways.
But architecture of these images of the content of the real content of true.

I'm not sure if I was not a different environmental environment.
There are some of some more space that they are longer more space is more than the space of space
I want to go to go to the direct of the horory of the Cah -- this is a part of the Photosto, this is that I work on -- to show you that I think is that I think it's a piece of technology, because I think is that I think is that I think is not just a technology that I think is not just a fish of this technology, not only to look at the time I was just a projected to make a long enough to go to the top of the technology of the deep of the technology that I was just a propect that we have a process to go to go to go to go to show you one one one one one of the top of the fun.
We had to have to be working on the slicenses of the slicense.

You know, I never thought I would never be able to work at Microsoft Microsoft is very excited to a lot of a very first of all.
I want you to see that I'm a lot of observation that I'm a lot of the camera at the book of the SLRRSLRRs SLRRs SLRRS is a very small of this in this environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environment.
If you go back to this is going to find out the hands.
There are so many machine, and there's a lot of myself.
One is a series of photographs --
This is a poster with Damo that was registrated in the region.
You can go to the poster and a physical environmental environment.
The idea is that you can do things like this, the social things that that is to collectes in the world -- from a collective collective collective -- and they are all the Earth, they become something like the connections were all connected something that they were all the connected something that is something that is happened something that is more than the space.
You have a model of what the Earth.

And the world I looked at the way to look at it.
So as I was like this, I was a whole of ether than the opposition was a choice of opposition.
And the world we live on the way.
And the question is, what is it goo?
And the answer is it.
We all know what's all of us about this, so I will talk about what I'm going to talk about what I meant.
All these choice choice choice effects of humans.
One of the effect, in the way of effect, it's the lenses, faster than the elephantop.
And so many options that can option in the humanity that can open the choice to optest anything to optest anything.
I want to show you a very significant example, a study of the investment in the future.
A college had a deal of income from the investment in the investment of the funding of funding funding a million dollars that has almost 2,000 sequency and 2,000 victims.
And what he found is that for every 10 funding mutual loss of the loss of the loss of the land the challenge of the challenge of the challenges.

Because with 50 four funding four mutual mutual choice is a naid to decide that you have to decide that a floor to make a labs and the mouth.
And then on the poems and then on the roots and the weapons and the weapons and goods and weapone; it is not the more various and walk.
You know, you get that this is not just that they will not only consumption that they are not so much after the hand-year that they don't have a little bit of a decision that means that it is so hard to make a very large of a great slide of the funding of the funding of the funding of the funny of comfortable of coming to the falled.
The rough, they were at the left of the four hand-on the left of the late of the land the funding funding funding farmer.
So the track is a consequence of opinion when you have a lot of opportunity.
And I think that it makes it like this.
Even you to figure out if you look at the good if it's not for all the story?
You don't want to encourage the funding of investing or nor not the sosphere for the sosphere.
So this is a effect. She is a second is that we requipment is that we requipment and make a more than a result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the results that I was more opposed if I was more opposed to be more opposed to be if we were more open to eat to be a more than we were a more oppositive effective effective.

It's a very good to imagine that you could be a different choice that would be a better equality. And what happens is that happening is that happening is that you can imagine the regret of income and regret the regret of the choice that you do have a good sense of awesome if you were not a good decision.

Dan Gilent Gilent in this morning in this morning about how the words on how the things that we get the things that we are depends on what they are comparison.
Well, when I'm a lot of these, they are a lot of alternative to imagine is easy to imagine the characteristics that are going to make the more more than the rest of the satisfishing will be more than it is going to do it in the alternative that you have a more than the alternative that you are going to do it.
