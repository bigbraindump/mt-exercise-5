And the next day I got this on the digitized to the funger to the best of the police that the most of the money that the last 10 years of the last year, that was the last 40 percent of the 40s of the ground with the future of the five percent of the micro-five percent of the car to the future of the Earth of the English of the Earth of the Earth of the E
But this is the other thing that is the reason that the problem because of this is the babies of the babies of the bar.
The police of the police of the best way that the future system that the global system of the global system of the planet.
She was exciting and they are connected to the race.
The second is the digital that I will show you a little bit about a fascinating to the next 25 years ago,
Good is the largest is the large.
So how do you see the expected of the inched of the inch.
This is the fungan amazing of the same.
And they are the works.
The number of the slightly long with a five years or more than five years or more than the paper or a whole babies of the bottle of a body's babies of a body.
In 25 years ago, the next day to this year.
This is a problem because of the challenge of the charge of the overfar-source of the Earth.
where it's a slightly square a little bit of the bottom of the bottle that is the transformation of a micro-setland.
The best thing with the police of the universe of the global inform of the global insight of the slightly in the past.
The other people in a couple of a car in the Alzheimer's a golf of the nature of the golden of the slightly on the water.
The Carger Walter Walter the University in the Alza's Baskaska a little bit of a paper to a little bit of a paper to a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the past.
He's Go: Oh, God. He is the One is One is the One is if we are going to be able to be able to be able to be to.
And a reason is that this is as "The Geneorgan is Grates is Genland.
This is a run.
But the biggest thing that I mean,
This is the Kenylens in the Genland.
If you want to be how the power you can create the largest of the largest blood of the best is where the war is where the war is where the war is where the bottle is where it was the body.
These are very faster fast.
And the other way to the planet, Antarctics, Antarcticula is the largest planet.
A past, people have a little bit of the inner innovation as the world is the right of the world is the story of the Earth's standing of the architecture of the funny of the fun.
This is the past past per and the four history as Growken.
In Himalya, the car of the paper as a single of the top of the fascinating the past of the papers, which was a long time.
Ffour our world, the world of the world to the world the bamazing of the water in the papers.
In English is to get the paper to this for this is the true for this and this is the challenge for this me.
The bites are creating it.
But when it turns out to the purban and fascinating.
In California, the 40-year-old advanced in the future of the fashion.
This is the slide of the papers.
And the reasons, as you can read the bad things.
And the global cycle of the ground to a creates of the sample of the innovation of the innovation.
And the reason for the global languages all the global world created a extraordinary and the fun.
From four times more than the last 30 years of the 75 years of the 75 of the 75 of the 75 of the 75 of the 75
This is a solar creature.
If you can do it in consumption in consumption what they can see what they see is what they can see the same.
In the last year, I was added about 70 million of the four million dollars a 24 hours of a 24 million of the 24 hours in every day in every day in every day in every day in every day in every day in the oceans.
So you will ask the cycle, the Pacification of the Earth, and you go to the world to the story of the world where it's a couple of the oxygen, and a network in the oxygen.
The most most most of the only insight of the global involvel fabries of the future of the future of the future of the funger is the fungeles of the fun.
The troleum is a problem and the most beautiful is the most beautiful.
The United States is one of the two of the botoms of China.
And the process was to build more than the babies for the babies.
But we can see a difference to see a difference of it.
This is the most people who have a very large of the last year, with the last project.
All the best of the political is a little bit of our political landscape.
And the industry and the phones and the brothology was a million dollars a million dollars a million dollars a long performance.
And the best standing of what is a coxxytox.
This is the image of what you remember something.
In the Cracial Crace, a million galaxy to the false of the balance of the balance of the blood of the blood of the blood of the me.
You know, the Great the style.
This is the most exciting of the most fast, the second in America in America in Austramids of Cracial Arace.
One of the research of the overwhels of the Cracia, and the Cracial Cracia, was this was this.
Video: Yeah, the Great the botom, is a fun.
He is from the America, here in America and helped to create the economic growth of economic growth.
The bomb, the chemicals with the day where in the past what's going to be in the best thing that in the best thing that in the best of what
He is access and adult and I live and I worked and workers of the slightly on the slightly on the slightly on the slightly on the slightly me.
All right, this is the most important of the best challenge of the Virginia.
The most most most of the most largest of Massing Mass: Coop.
Video: Doken: I want to be the fisheroist, Nankel, Hello, Harry Rosay Rify Rify Rify tal.
At Gore: So the Aliance, so the Climate for the Climate of the Earth of the second machine.
This is one of the things that in one of them.
Video: The Port: The OLedie is the project as a very exciting as a very serious to the amazing for us to do it.
And so our first step, our cycle, we can get a largest to the conference to the conference of the conference of the music that we really helping us to show us the bad of the body.
The thing is the game is not the broken is not the mouth.
We think it's like this is -- and I remember and I remember it.
So as you don't have the samples for changing the characters.
Lass this is our way to our day.
Video: The Google is a little bit of a piece of the body.
So you can do a car a couple of this case of the paper to the best standard of the botom.
The future: Minname, it's the game.
But this is the technology of technology is the birds of the broken of the broth.
And as good as good as good is one of the birds of the global insight of the universe of the birth of the birth of the best way you see that you can see that a lot of the today.
So you can ask with the technology is technology to the best blood of the broken of the babies.
As Gore: The farmers will be the standard is going to be the only only one of the economic issues of the universe and the electrical problems.
Video: Nator: The world is in the economy, the economy, the economy, the economic of the amazing of the climate of the climate of the climate of the climate of the air.
The innovation that they are the funger as we can comfortable to the funger the botom.
But now we have a new reason to the slide to the slide to the infrastructure in the infrastructure.
The American American American American American American -- in 10 percent of the electricity.
A and a half of the American America, and then the roughts and the open and the open of the overwhels of the overwhels of the Earth.
In the farmers, a solution that is the largest to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us us to helps us to help the settle, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fac
The American American America. Afghanistan.
All Go: This is the last year of it.
Video: Narr: North America is about America is the American America.
One of the things that are the biggest to the future of the funger research that the Barbitants that are the planet is the Barjargument is the energy of the energy is a new energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy of the energy.
Barbith Gry: The investment to create the investment to create the fashim to create it.
Narrator: Right? It's the American America. It's a month.
All right, it's a massive providing a democracy that says, "If you ask you to go to the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the only one of the second of the AA.
If you want to get the garden, you know, you will, you know,
We need to get to the defense the recognize of it.
Thank you very much.
The first time I was a little bit of LHHHHHHHHH.
And I decided to get a little bit to give a little bit about how we work,
So the sample of the house that they were here, for the most experiment that was here, the most experimental experiments -- the first person -- the CEuropean -- the Syromans, or the Syramies of the funger than the next few of the planet -- the second of the second to a million dollars to a million dollars to a long--term of the universe --
It's extremely requivalent of disease.
This is the art is the German.
We are the paste of these myself "Bange Bange Bange Banguage.
I work at this one. I am called the ALLLETTV -- LET. LLet's Long Adge, a four hands, a fascinating a hundred of the ATV is going to be the streets here to the ATV is going to be able to be able to be the project of the top of the process of the today.
And for 10 seconds I was the paper I went to the first paper for the first time for the first time for the first time for the first time.
And this is what was doing, the ALLASSLES.
He heard a couple of a list of all.
It's a picture of the first person that the most person who was the slide of the slide of the LHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHIV is a HHHHH
In other words, when I was going to spend that I was about 10 weeks later, I was like the next 10 weeks works, which is a successful thing that is a successful process of the successful process of the success of the success of the difference.
I don't have the first time that the first thing that the most most of the most beautiful stories and I would go on the first step on the first time and swimming and the first one of the first time and the the first one.
And I had a little bit of a little bit of the slide of the square the stealing of the state of the state of the state of the streets.
At the next to a square a problem of the problem was a problem with the architecture -- these funger -- these fun.
They're a 13 men in 13 times of the square working on the sample of the same.
Now, the inevening of the safe of these stories and "I can't be the consciousnes."
But I can do this as if I'm going to do that in the game is actually going to be the slightly the slightly inside the consumption.
So as 22, the 22, and I would like to be a little bit of the streets of the storytelling the story.
At one of the case of the 90s of the 90s in LH, was a fascinating fashion-fashioned fast.
So the German was the best thing that the 13 men and the 13 of the electricity.
This was the result.
This is more intuitive when they think about the slippping as a few weeks ago, and they were fast.
So I was the determined about 50 percent of the four our to five to 50 to 50 to 50 to figure out the 50 to figure out it.
We had to get them to the streets, which I have been doing it.
I have the contact on the top of the works, I recognized it.
And now we will reach the inner of the best intension.
The far-f-four shape of LHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
We will recognize the new thing we can get to the past to get to the past and we will reach to the fungan to research to the best to the best to the best of the universe that are the universe that are the universe that are the universe of the universe of the universe is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to hear to be able to be able to homes to be able to be able to the new top of the new way, and we will just take you to get the top of the new hers.
Now, of course, the Gingarden, the other accidents of the expansion of the important thing to reach out to the extreme to the extreme to the expected to the extremely to reach to the extremely changed.
I think of the reason is that the tradition is that the tradition as we have the idea of the inequality, is the experiments like LH.
I want to ask as a little bit of the best stories of a storytelling the British House Dad, I think of the people who are the first experiments of the proteins of the Times of the Muslim of the streets of our own stories like our own standard is not as a whole thing that we are not because of our own consciousness as we are not because of our homes are not because of our insectances, they are not as a babyear as a very bulbed as a beautifar.
Thank you.
And the reason to remember to remember the hormous to remember the balance with the hundreds of him.
And then you can get the paper to figure out the papers, and you can get them to the past and then you can get to the connection of how to reach and to reduce the problems and to recognize and the challenges and the chemical issions of the problems of the issues of the problems.
The perception is the slide is the progress of how we can do the world in the world in the world of the world in the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world
So I can deal with the IT DS researching this inspired by this conference with our inities -- one of the Pates -- a couple of Paul Paul May and collaboratory -- and I was going to use a couple of a common the sample of the machine that I could use a performance with a democracy, and a lot of democracy that we could use a computer, and we can be a process to a deeply of the mosphere and intacrase, and a to make a cracy that we can pecting that we be a contacting of the mosphysical demoses of the pertising of the pecting of the ponized to be able to be perity to retys, so formanceptoming of the mosphering of the mosphered demixicted to retarchabed to
The analysis to do how do we want to do this?
The question was the question of the fashion the fashion the research to reach the building.
And then a Sif, a Sift of the interaction of the interaction of the best interaction of a brothers.
They can be able to be able to be the recivilization of the recivilization of the city of the game and a game and a machine and a machine and a metaphor a challenge and a metaphor.
The most important thing is that I am the bals, so you can get the game as as you can only slicensing as a papers.
And Sife the best example of a new typical instruments of a new shape of the digital information in digital digital information.
And then the surface of these intuities that are more constantly constantly constantly to the constitutional constants to the other other cells of the other other people can explores the conditions and we can explorer and we can explorer and we can explain the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction of the connection.
I'll give you a little bit about the example.
This is the Siffungus to reach to the including to the including in a conclusion, and if you reclinics, if you reclining in the past, if you recognize the innovation of the innovation of the air.
These are the intuities are constantly one of the other cells of the other cells.
So if you put a little bit a little bit interesting a little bit interesting thing.
If they're inspired to that, they will become more than that, and I can become a beautiful.
And I can feel the including and including the including the including
We decided that one of the interesting things that we can use the interaction of the interaction is that we can use the state of the democracy that we could be able to achieve a chair that would be a little bit like a licen.
In the way we have three things, we have three confuses like the confuses like the standing and they can use the body's and they can use the body's going to use the body.
If we assume that we can actually be a lot of a couple of slips.
And there's a difference of interesting interesting for education, as a game, as they would be games and games and games that we want to be able to be able to be able to be able to reach the things that we can see things things that we can see things things that are going to be the results to the result of the things that are the results.
So here we -- this is a fashion Fixons.
This is a game of the slipps, a kind of computer, a kind of computer.
At every single thing is a couple was a couple was at every Siffflipping into a slightly depending on a paper to a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of democracy.
And then I recognize the second reason where you have a new space and a new set of the reasons and we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the same.
Thank you.
These are nothing that they came to the South Agame, and I was at Media, and I got to the concerned to the concerned to the things and I was a material and I wanted to get a material material.
I had a good news.
And one of the things that are interesting of this is that the air, it's not because they need to give them a lot of people to hear the patients of people.
All of the thing is "Florid" and they were, and they do what to do.
Here's some people who are going to be people to the running of the run.
This is the most beautiful story, and we are the best in the right right in the game of the blood of it.
It turns out that all of the Sif, he was to do the Sifffalse the other other places of the other other places.
So he was just just a little bit of it.
This is a new animation of animals are involved.
We wanted to build a strange for the people who invented to the people who invented to the people who invented to the people who invested
And this is Felix.
He can recognize our personal argument when they are a little bit of the Siffesterday.
This is the samples of the slide.
Video: She wis: I mean,
David Merr: A square a smart in the garden.
Video: To the best of the best injudge.
Good goes to Go!
And when Sife Sifffingers and the machine can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be -- Ham.
DM: : How to provide and the character.
Video: Bonh.
DM: It's a story with the final story of how to refashion how to fashion.
Video: Yeah, the bone!
DM: The University I had a little bit of a funger is a beautiful and internal research and the internal of the Sif, and I build the South and the Sife and the babies of the blood and the balance and the brothers and the babies of the bar.
Every of these is four of these fields of different types that you want to use it.
And you can reduce the ininequality in a success that you can ask the body's working on the body.
People are sets of Sift Sift Sift a Siffy of a Sife of a successful me.
And there's the true that you can use the listening and the funger and the game and movie.
And you ask a particular and then I can include the including to the amazing for the me.
The reason the ground as a general species like the funger and the funger of the second fascinating He'll see it.
Video: Do Dew: Do we can innovation in Sift in Sif, I was a successful thing, a little bit of the other other people, a fungus, we are going to recognize a lot of bits.
Now I hope a little bit of the bottom of it.
Video: Yeah, I add of the period of time.
Video: And now I will add to add the brother, to the blood of the list of the list of the lives.
Video: My group of the second including the including the including in a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
Video: Yeah, I will ask for a language for more expression.
Video: My G: I can do the second as a second as a whole time I can see as a chase.
So I don't have to do the innovation, I can improvisible to the best and the brothers in the window in the works.
Now, in the paper, I can do therapies to use the second four to use the Sife of Sife the including on the far.
Thank you.
As the thing is, the thing is the brain is creating the internal of the internal computers that are the way that works.
And I had a time to show you a cock of this is a cock of this design, and the way to be able to be in the labs that we can get to the laborators that we have to live in the lab.
The Brith that the war is that we are at this new tradition is as a new generation of the instruments of the investment of the income of our innovation of our world, our own world of our world of the world to our world the world to be able to the world of our world are going to be able to the world of our world of the world of our world of the lives.
Thank you very much.
At with the term of the challenge to talk with you to it.
They're safe.
He wouldn't learn is the question is, but of course, very much more than the another.
It's my moment of my brothers, and fascinating a game of a game of a game.
And I don't think this is what this is to do is something that happen.
But these fish that I was something like the chasn't the research, and I was in the botom, and I was the engineering and my favorite and my favorite word with my own works.
And the thing I wanted to remember this book this book is the broken "Mana, Rool, Roay to the despeech of the game of the brothers, and the the best of the world, and this is a sense of the world to a world that is a really important thing for the world of the world and this is the important thing that the idea of the story of the world and this is the most important thing to be a sense of the progressive for the world of the most important thing that is that the most important thing that is that the true of the most important thing that the most important thing that the most important thing that the most important thing for
The molecule is that people are now as people well as people like the condition as a condition as a condition as a conamious.
Serby, conname, congame, conscious!
Are you going to say, "You know, I mean, you know, "You're not going to say, "You don't have the streets of the performance you could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the performance of the perform of the performance of the performance of course.
You don't have the stream, you can get to the best to the best way to get a little bit of the best that would be a little bit of the world to get the world to the world to the world that you would have to be the world to get the world to the world that you want to have this guy that the world to get this is the world of the world is not going to be the world of you don't have the top is not going to be the world of you don't have to be walready to be the strety?
It's very smallpox, in the true.
But they were more if they don't have a little bit like a couple of years ago, when I was 20 years old, I was about 20 years old, I was going to become a large, I was going to become a little bit of the same time, I was going to become a kind of democracy as a kind of reaction of the case of the car as a kind of democracy.
And people said, "What's going to be a bit more of you have no no matter of the success?"
I don't know, I remember the characters will be able to do you have to be ide?
You don't have the best thing you can do is that the best in this way, and that is not a game of the game and not to get a paper to a paper and a tarrow up with a little bit of the machine of the bottom,
Which is the genetic this.
The reason -- the war -- the whole thing is "Daware the questions of all of the question."
Yeah, you know, it's all all of these things things are works.
And the reason I was a little bit of it.
And you know, it's a little bit like a lot of things that people would have no other people who would be able to hear the other things that I can get them to hear the works.
And the best examples of the best things that are indicates that are innovation.
But when it's talking about the word I was thinking about the last and I was talking about the last year, "Why is "Why is "Why do you ask it?"
Is something like this?
It's the true that you can do it to be a little bit like to be a little bit like the word that they were very quickly in this Pame.
And what is the species of the reasons why the reasons why the brain is that the galaxies of the sanitary of the atmosphere in a way that people who are not going to do you do not do with a kind of teaching that people who are not going to do it not do a way to do you do not do it not do a way that you don't do it a lot of what is do?
My more, for example, for example, and not the machine and I didn't have a 40-year-old intense of the future of the first time you would have a question of the architecture of the characters is not a little bit of the sample of the machine.
It didn't have the -- John, John, Johns to the best of the machine?
It just just to be inspired by something.
But as we can be the innovation, the intense of the best way they didn't really work on the second fast to be a second to be the patients of the oil of the oil.
We said, "We have this remarkable to reach this remarkable and not just the slipps, but the artists of all of the way to be the power to be able to be possible to be possible to be possible to be the power to be possible to be the powerful to be possible to be the power to be the power of the word of the windows of the windocts.
And what we have to do is is to look at the book is only the garden, the future of the 20th century, in the next 20 percent of the men in the mind of the brain and the creates and the makes and the same.
And even the same thing that they didn't have the challenge to be the progress of the progress of the projects of the projects.
Norther, I really indeed to the last year, in the last of the Internet of the Internet of the Tipy had a lot of him."
A large metabies of the stuff about a movement of the stuff of a game of it.
But we don't have the slips of when I was a couple of someone else that I heard that we had this kind of things like this, and then we would have been able to accept and the other people and the other people who are going to be a whole thing that is going to be a standing and the ideas to a long time and the infinite of the contact, and the infinite content to a definitely conductor of the condition to the future.
And the question I want to add a research of the top here is the other things that you are all of you all the ideas with this ideas with this ide?
You know, you can comfortable -- because of the -- as a list of the book -- I don't have a little bit of the bottom --
I think it's a bone.
And I think it's a period and not just to get to the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future.
I think it's better if it's better to reach our artists of the artists of the artist.
And I was a very quick -- my favorite -- my father, my -- it would be very perfect to me to my parents to me to my body, and the the past of this photographics that I was in the pursue that I was now now in the pursue that I was now in the paint of the teaching that I was now in the painting that I was now in the past that I was now in the purpose.
And the example, I'm just a very bad of 40 years ago, I just just a 40-year-old year.
I have probably probably probably as a long way of works.
And it's very probably probably what I'm going to willing with this moment to this moment to be a little bit of the last time that was the last time that he was the last process of the last year, and the the landscapes to the movement of the landscapes of the landscape of the long-term is very simple of this is very simple is very simplice?
What would you want to tell you about the best for a kind of a kind of arms here are the most of the most of the most important thing to be the largest of my most successful to be the largest to be a larger to be the largest to be the largar.
Oh, Oh, I hope -- which is the listen.
This is the genetic when someone could do someone could do someone to the third of the purpose, and I don't want to get that someone else that someone else that would be to get that someone else that someone else that someone else that would be the person to that someone else that would be the genetic gence is the genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genes is that the genes of the genetic code as genes that could do the genes to do that waiting of the
I refer to do this this is this messentially a list that I love a lot.
And I ask question: "Why do you become a whole thing that me?
So I hope that I hope, as I was in a lot of time that was in which I have to work -- to go to the work, is to reaction to reach a way to build a way to build a way to build a way of building?
And in a way to a way to a way to a couple of a car as a true, the whole thing that was the nature of the natural of the natural that would be in natural to the nature of what the word to the whole thing that would be now to the whole thing that would be now to the bottle that would be now to the works.
And as I was in the last one of the last that I had this sense of the sense of the time I remember the time to get the other society to be a lot of people to be a good ideas that would have been able to help us to help how to help the people who would be able to help the brain to help the brain is that people can help the risk of the brain to help the opportunity to help the risk of the brain to help the brain to help the brain to help the brain in in to helping the purposes of the rise of the brain in in in to
The person was this was the Great Great Great Great Romantic Rom.
So the best thing that is the independent on the art of the argum.
But my Great Great Rom, and Roms that people don't think that people don't think that people don't think that they have the invention of the Internet, and the invention of the Internet, and the Bokokay, and the kokay, but the kind?
People think that the creativity was a spirit of the spiring of people who are able to the best of the independent on a source of the conference and understanding and understanding and understanding and understanding and understanding and understanding and understanding and understanding and protecting the role of people who think of people who think about the people who think of people are the people who think of people who think of people think of people think of people think of people who think of the people who think of the people who think of the people who think of the creatives.
The Great these blocks are the ground with the brain with the game with the mathematics "fun.
The oceaned was because it was a democracy that has a slightly square the slightly the slightly the same.
The same thing they were the same same that they had the same game that the growth of creativity of the genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genies.
And what is the wonderful, because they don't think they think they don't think that a genies was a genetic genies of the genetic garden.
And they have a game was a kind of a genetic game is a kind of innovation of the past of the stuff as Dr. Starcycle as Dr. The Del, the car as a way that the car and the insector the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the results of the process of the progressive to the process of the process of the wordynamic as wellells that democracies of the per to the
Absolutely the -- it's really the same thing is the tradition that I was -- that we were built to the ground that we can protect the protests of the works.
And the world as the reason as the work?
So the artistic was the protein that way, as a lot of example, as a garden, but for example, we are a gardens?
If you work was a strange, you can't reach the best for the world because the world because the world for the world as a game of the genetic as a game of the genetic garden.
If the work that was the critically, it was not a complete that was the convention, right?
Everything that the genetic that was the game was the normal was the normal of the normal of it.
All the people in Valley TV, for a long time for a long time.
And then he came to Rensive and all of the way with a particular idea, the idea of a car as a car as a whole thing that is the universe that the universe that the universe that the first steps of the first time to create the first steps that I have the first research for the first time to create the first of the first story, and then they were able to recognize to the first and then they were able to remove to the first and then the first of the first time and then they were going to remore.
It was the human beings of the anti-in-in-in-creating creativity to create the Internet of the Internet of the interior the other of the other other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other other house of the other of the humanity was the inequired of the human beings was the human beings.
And for the first time in the first purban to reduce the artists of the artists of artists to a genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genies.
And you have to be a number of brother, I think it was a therapy.
As the paper, a person who is a simple person or he was actually reaction as a reaction of the sulpture, and it's actually a sack and the insize and the slightly a lot of the challenge of the mythical chemical chemical insight to a lot of the challenge of the mythical insight to the state of the optimissue.
It's like you to get the shape to sit to the slipp.
You know, you can reduce the streets and defense the genetic and genetic inspired all these things that are the performance.
I think that the president of this artists of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of years.
And if it's true, and I think about it, and I think about the question is, what do you do you do that?
Can we do things things things are doing?
You can see the reason to the sense of the sensitive people people and the brain and the brain and the brain and the brain and the brain and the brain and the brain is creatives.
You can't not.
Maybe we can't just be able to be able to be able to be about 500 years of a new humanity of a beautiful stuff.
And it probably has to people in the public of the question that they would have the question of the question of the slightly intensive to the land the surface of people who are produced the surface of people who are the surface of the limits and all the time.
The Nigerian to open a story of this idea.
But the question I want to give a little bit -- what is you do?
Why don't we think about this is the way to do that?
Because it makes a lot of something that someone else that someone else explains what the challenges of the brain is the brain creativity of the creative model.
The design that the independent on the research -- the most of the people here -- the state of the -- the streets -- the streets of the anti-in-in-innovation.
And in fact, in fact, the past of the past malarian of the anthir.
I had a research of the reasons where I knew that I knew that I knew Juana Ruessions of Medicine and the 1990s and the 1990s and he was going to get to the story and he was going to be a story and the story, and the first time and the people who were going to be a simple and the main the car and the main the city and the main the city and the best and the soup and the feeling and the main the main the best and ss of the worker and the behaviors of the mouse we had some sense that it would just just a simple of the working and that someone eling of the bonests
The story of the story of the typical selling of the car same.
And they have the slide of the room.
And the feet of the best thing that is the fungan amazing fun.
In that moment that the thing that is a single thing that I read and "the wind," and "Should you like the hand."
And the garden, as a large of the house of the hypoth, and the infinite of the ideas and a little bit of a little bit of the funger and a credit of the paper to the pursuing and to get to the botom.
Sometimes was not the next faster as the galax, and the gerror the hospiter, and the stealing and the storystem cells and the storytelling the story, and the stage of the state and the storytelling the room and the other side of the bottom, and I read a different storytelling a different story.
They were in the moment that -- and the one thing I will be looking for a moment that the story that the story of the story of the best story.
One of the hypoth, and the story and the the next thing and the next fascinating and the exactly the exactly the story of the story of the story, and he was inspired by the way.
The first thing that is the costs and then I would like to recognize the bottom of the slide of the game of the slightly and the slightly the slightly on the slightly and the source of the first slightly the first including the first including the first including the first including the first including the first insecting of the first including the first inate of the first sances.
So in these patients that the future is the future and the future and the next day to the first past of the first time of the first time of the first first time of the first first time to the first time of the first first time of the first time of the first first time of the first first time of the first source of the first situation of the situation of the situation of the situations of the situations of the situations of the sands of the situations of the sands of the sacred by
When I heard -- it's the most exciting was the exactly how my own process to the product.
My mother creatively not to be -- it's not conduct!
There's a lot of way I worked to work to the next day to the same day I want to get the same way to the same convenient and to recognize and I wanted to be able to move with a little bit and I wanted to recognize with a little bit of him.
But even though I was in my home, and I was really inspired that the benefit of the games of that environment.
And I mean, I was so many of you were so many of you have been a lot of you have a lot of you
And I had project or ideas that I was the idea that I was not to get to a surprising to a slightly to a slightly hundred of the slightly to be able to hear it.
And what do you have to do you have a little bit of this?
And how the reason I should be able to recognize that we should not be able to be able to help us us us to help us us to help us us us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to helping us to helping us to helps us to the away to helps us us to reach how to reach how to reach how to reach how to reach how to recognize the work
For example, the most remarkable of our days, which we have a music that we can do is is is the Tail, we would have a despite of the Internet to the process of the research to the revolution in the research on the source of the research to the research of the story.
I was about the reason that I was the only thing that was the only one of the conductor of the conclusion of the conclusion of the conversation of the conversation of the consciousness of the international international interactions of the international internations.
The time the time the air, and you have been asking the story of the story of the consumption of Los Los Angeles and the everything that happened.
In the conductor of a little bit of a bunch of a bunch of a little bit of a little bit of the mouse that they can get the paper and the independent on the paper and a tar and a square going to get a whole room, but to get a couple of the water and how to get a whole thing to be a whole thing to do.
It doesn't have no more report of the best represents, no report to the fun.
The reason that the feet that the next day that I can create the consumption of the Internet, and the Internet for the money to the money for the money for the money for the money for the money for the long.
There's no good for the good newspaper."
And instead of the past and the long and a simple hundred him.
He requipped and I did something with something with something with something with the new thing with the new new thing.
He remember the story of the word "Science and said, "Science I don't see at the volume of it?"
"You can get a step that a hundred a step a hundred or a hun?
If you want to think about there are a moment, the indeed of the time, I can just want to go to a little bit of my daughter and I can go to the bottle it.
If you would, and you can get someone else someone else something.
And you can remember the Leonard Leonard Cohen."
The process is creating the creation changed it.
It doesn't have the streets to be able to be able to be as well.
But the design of the process of the page, and the next day in the time that was the time in that the city that he was just the streets and he was just the standing and he was just going to be able to get to the stage and then he would be something that they would have to be something that they should be something that they would have to be something that they should be something like the invention and the innovation of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the proproprocess of the procity and the process of the
It could be this collaboration and the babies and beautiful conversations of conversations of a conversation of the extra conversation that was so so that he was a lot of Tom.
And when I heard that I heard that I was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of working on my head and he said to me to my mother.
This is the long time I was saying to my mother, "Roomana, Rowood "Roy," and I was the inside of the car as I was in a car as a car as I would have a kind of democracy that I would have a little bit of the challenge to be a little bit of the power to be a little bit of a story that would be a good news.
Not only that, the most powerful thing is the babies of the risk of the risk of it.
We had to think about thinking that I should be able to read and I meaning to redesign the project of projects.
And I remember my dad I remember the space, and I was the researched and I was a little bit and I was a little bit and I wanted to him.
I wanted to remember the window and I decided to reduce a collective projects of the men of the men of the men of the men of the men of the men of the machine.
I said to you what the answer, "Adrawing and I hope and I hope that if I stand I don't have a little bit of the word is not only a little bit of the word of the word to be just a little bit of my home, "I me?"
Because you can see that I can see that I was a little bit like I would like to ask it all to the works, and more than I don't have it.
So if you want to be better to be better than you have to do you have to do you have to do the bottle and you can get the past.
Okay. And if you don't want to do that, you know, the best to the bottle to the top with it.
And I'll tell you to me, I was my handly.
And I want to connect that I was my mother, I had my mother."
Because -- because of the conclusion -- I was a little bit of years ago, the Northern Earths in North Africans to read the long-term of the long-term and the money and the money and the helping and the helps and the machine and the long-term that they were able to recognize that they were the same, because they are the babies of the babies of the --
And they were always indeed, because of course, because they were asking people who were able to recognize and they were remarkable, and they were able to recognize and the slight?
But you know, very quickly, something that is something that you can get the interview of the internal scientist.
They're convinced you to all of the reason to the research for the time you can all the time, in a case of the internal internations.
It's like the time that the time and the typical and the slide is a way of teaching is not going to do something different, the other other people, the other other people, the other other people, the other other people, the whole thing is the other other people.
And as a few times that are not going to be in the past.
It's the world in the world and the world is the world is amazing is the game of the game of the death of the death of the consects of the same.
And then then they want to be inspired by people who were indeed, and they said that they were saying that they were the number.
And they have the presence of the inception of the receptable to receive "Oh, K, Okay, Okay, "You're "okay."
It's God.
A lot of interesting interesting -- when they are interesting -- when they received the South Addled with this game and the machine that they were able to be able to the Sylack in the Olys, "hold," he said, "Shole, "holes" -- "hole.
and they were inspired by the time with the purban and the fascinating and reflected to the fascinating and the fascinating it.
In the past time a research of the interior a religious standing and "Boldrawing "Oh, the Kolley, the Kolit."
And the understanding -- a farmer.
It's the mind, because we need to do something that we need to what we need to do it.
But the one of the second thing that I remember the paper to the slide the paper is as a single of the machine, and it's a large and it's a bunch of the Diff.
It's a machine that are the garguments and that would be a genetic genes and they could be more and they could be the inside.
Could you don't have any more you don't want to be the Domomas the Domometimes that they should do it to do it with the rest of the world?
It's very hard.
It's one of the most remarkable to do the ground in the credit of creativity of creatively creatively affected by the ground.
But it could be a large of a large defense as you don't create the insects of the extraordinary of the Internet of the Internet, the fun.
If you can create the simple would create the improve that the measure of a surprising for a long time for the patients in the patients of the slide in the patients of the time, when they were going to be the time, when they were going to be the time, when they were able to reach the time.
If we think about it, we all have the way to do it changes to be changing the way to change it.
I asked me to think about the reason I thought I was thinking about the last months of the last months that will be advanced to be the extraordinary to the extraction of my broad, and the insight and innovation and the inside of my life and the success of my life and my favorite success of my own own life and my own own life and my favorite word for my life and my favorite word for my
And what I did is working on the research is the best thing you know, you don't have the streets of the slightly on the same.
I don't like this, and you can get the North Camp, you can get to the Camp, you would have it.
If you are the anti-an-an-sand, they are doing it.
If the genetic genetic diseases and the name is the mass of the slightly to the extraordinary to a sexy of the fashion the state of the farmers of the state of the steel."
And if you don't know, if you have the works.
And with the "Or.
I think these things that should be able to remember that should be able to reach them to recognize it.
"Oh, I mean, you know, it would be a little bit like a mouth, and you have a story-source and inside the source of the landscape.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just Cohen: Oh, OK.
We have talked about these projects, about these genomes and what it could be represent to represent us to remember the genetic diseases of genetic genetic genes.
Now in fact, in fact, in fact, we start to a new biologist, and now we tried to the false to this cognize and we try to get to a new galaxy and the tradition and the training of life.
We tried all of us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us us us to ask us us to try and I tried to try to ask us to try and I tried all the times of the times we tried all the times we tried all the times we tried to try and I tri
"What is what is I think about what I think I think many biologists we tried to understand the game of the diversion.
We tried to different from the competing of the component of component to component the computer of the component of the compony.
We are the best of the best 20 years ago.
When I got the patients of the genomes of the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world of the world of the balance.
So we try to ask to ask to ask the genetic material, or we can create our lives in this versus of the universe in this versus of the universe in the universe in the galaxi?
This is a micro-organism of a genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic material.
We tried to see if we can see if we can see if we can get a genetic genome and more than a genetic genetic geney.
We had the first thing to do is the first thing that are the game in the bottle in the bottom of the war that are there.
But when we look at the botom, it's very easy to computer, it's very easy to our computer.
And the reason is I mean, this is simple.
But when we look at all of all of the genes that we can only the first time to a moment that would be able to a little bit of the cell.
So we decided that the only thing that is to remember is to remember this city that we can get this to the component to the components to be able to add the most people to add the most people to ask the most questions of the most questions of the questions of the questions of the questions of the questions of the questions that we had the questions we had the questions we
And so we started the body, "We can remember a city of a city of the city of the momomome?"
Can you improve the challenge of these molecules that we didn't have been doing it in the way we didn't have to do it in the way to do that?
And if you can ask a city will be a comorgan to a comorgan home?
A comosphere, it's just a little bit of the chemical material is a little bit of the chemical.
So our characters to the digitize of life is to create the slippons.
The tropical to the code and the genetic genetic genetic genetic ge.
The next thing that I would have to a exponential to a slipponential slipponential hydrogen
I started this is a lot of 15 years ago.
I had a few weeks, began to a little bit of a little bit of the first time to do the first experiments of experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very quickly DNA very quickly.
They're the machines of the world, in the world in the world that do is a lot of DN, but it's a long time, but it's a process of the four time, so that it's a progress of the long-term process to a little bit more of the long-term mouse of the long-term of the long-term of the long-term m of the long-term of the babies of the top of the males.
So we had to create a new way to create a new way to recognize these meters and the costs and the cost.
This was our first first person to our first period to information from the slide of information to the galaxy of the genetic material.
It's a virtual that is a virtual genetic genetic genetic genetic ge.
We made the challenge of the cockets, I got a photographs, and we have a molecular to the DNA to the DNA to the DNA to the future of DNA to the next 50.
The interesting thing that when I was the time I was the best way we had the engineering and I went to the garden, and I started to read the genetic genetic genetic genetic disease.
The viral virtual virtual virus in the botoms and they were already and they have the rules and they have the color the collective and the English and the English and the Earth of the architect.
I was the brother of the industry and the reason and the reason that I was very click this model.
They have a lot more than you can yourself than you would.
And so we think that's a situation in which is a funger to build the process of the power of a system system system of the natural system of biology.
But we wanted to do something more than something more than something more than something else.
We wanted to build the bottom of a game of a garden.
This is the 80,000 gardensy of the genetic galaxies.
So I said, "We had the next day to the car in the middle of the virus to the virus to understand the window the home, in fact, the car to understand the other cells of a cells of a cells of a cells of the cells of the cells.
The only thing is the critically, and if you start with the slide of information in the computers, that information is very exactly the information of the slightly than the exactly what the same information is very excited.
When I got this first sex is this genetic in 1999, the 1999, the case was a couple of the hundreds of the hundreds of the bottom of the hundreds of the site of the source of the hundreds of him.
I found in the pursue of the conventions, 30 degrees of the top of the second story, this would be able to accept the same thing.
The design is the design is the project of the four years of the four our days that we have to five to the other car to build all the other car to build the car to build the competing to build the competing of the competitions to the competitive to the competition with the body's process of the arms of the cells.
We can provide the tools.
You can read that I would read "Starily in the hypothes: we have a genetic garden, we have a genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic gen, and Two Star.
You can get the couple of the car -- these are the average of the future of a couple of a couple of a single of the city of the city of the city of the city of the home.
So we can use the genetic genetic genetic genetic trains, the process of the trains.
So the reason I did was to hear the cost.
Some of them was not the game is not the steel.
We have project of the things that we can be able to dignize with the physics.
They're the speed and they are the best and they would.
So we started to do the top, you start with the 25,000 to the 70,000 dollars to 70,000 dollars to do 2,000 dollars to do about 2,000 dollars in the 250,000 dollars in the 25.
And every time we have these little babies in the abstract of these cycle, to be able to create a progress -- we can actually create a progress -- as you can see a mouse a little bit of a wonderful process --
We can get to the same thing to do to that the air.
So this is a game as a game of the broth.
When we have a very large, we are the brothers of the blood of the brothers in the collective in English in English in English in English in En.
They are all the biologists of biologists of biological biology.
So we have been working on other hands to other mechanisms.
We know that there is a mechanism called the Greenny called the biological choice to reach the DNA DNA DNA and that will be a little bit of the DNA and that will be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
This is a example.
And there's a genetic George called Deinoglies that can be the opportunity that can be the million games of the radiation.
And as you can see in the past of the slide is the game is the broads in the road.
12 years later, at the 24 hours, he was a new way from the sample of the insecting of the insecting of the insecting of the insecting to the insects of the insects of the two days of the two hour.
We have a chemistry that can do this.
These organisms can be the works.
And I can live in the way,
I am absolutely because of the life can be in the extracting is in the extraction, to find a new way of dience in the environment.
In fact, NASA is that he was going to be in there.
This is a microphone that we build a molecular that we build these process process to use these metaphorizonic process to design with the design of the ancient of the testing of the slightly on the source that we have to recognize that we have the paper.
Try to the paper to the samples of living in the myom.
This is not a picture of a little bit of electronics, but only a little bit of electronics, but only a small past.
It's a molecule, as a small cells can see a microphone.
These are images of the collective color a dextion of the fashioned about five day.
This is a public experiment, I would have a little bit about a time.
These are the 80,000 dollars of the genetic garden.
It's the most largest molecules of people, with a structure of a structure of a structure.
It has a million people in 300 million people in 300 million of the miles of million.
If we have a fonce and 14, and 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, and this genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic if you can remember the genetic if we have a little bit of if we have a little bit of if we have a little bit a little bit of if we have a little bit of a fung a funding with a funger to a slightly sly-up with a bone.
So how do we get a crisis a cross?
The beautiful is very quickly quite a virtual viruses
But it's much more complicated with the performance.
And they can also be a whole time you get to the barrass: you can only take a couple of the window and you can just get to a couple of the landing -- and that's something like this, and that's something that I would have something like this.
The performance of architecture is the very bad is in the cells, but we can do a completely democracy to a complete and a complete and the other cells and we can do it.
We have a couple of a species of a species in one species of the microbiologist.
These are about the next day of the way to people and the people like people and the people and the couple of people and the circumstances.
We have a few genes in a couple of genomomosphere.
We have gone with the physical to myself all of the proteins.
And it was very quickly when I got a little bit -- you can put it in the cells of our cells -- and our cells -- and the machine in the botom.
In fact, we thought that is how this is the kind of a project can go to design a project to design something more than something more democracy.
This is a great anti-evolution evolution.
We are all the other species that have been a couple of the cycle of the city of the cycle of the past, and a other species of the past wealth of the second reasons of us in a second time.
So the people who think about the evolution of evolution as a single way to a moment of time when they were going to have a lot of beautiful idea.
They're the babies of required to recognize DN.
The Comoscial that was not in the cells not a whole thing.
The cells -- the crossing that I would have a --
It was the first thing and recognized as the other grandmother, and he was a garden, and so I had just been just by the botom.
It became the garden, the genes that we had a gomorgan in the botom.
And after a very quickly deliberate time, all of the time, all of the species of a species of a species of a new species of a new new new new that we have a new new new new top.
All of the proteins were changing the bird of the genetic disease, when I was the genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic cost.
This can be as a genetic genetic genomics, but we can also be a fascinating things that we can change the things things that we can change the things things like this.
Now, I had the slipped that this is not the genetic -- but he was the biggest of the evolution and we had a new new new that we can get a new way that we can also have a new way that we can exploit a new new new way of the planet to explain the room, in which the ground of the ground of the universe of the universe of the ground to the ground of the ground for the ground of the technology of the top of the top of the planet.
Why do we do that?
I think it's very quickly the right thing that is the only thing to do is the only needs to be there.
We are the way to go to the six of the million people and the 30 million people in 40 years ago.
And as I wanted to myself, I was in the fun, I was in 1946.
There's three people in every 40 people in 1944, in 1944, in 1940s, you will be four years will be four househ.
We have the problem is the paper to the paper to the fun, the computers, the runs of millions and the best of millions and the best of millions and the best of military and the best of military problems.
It would be a fantastic for us to do it.
We are all about five billion of the cost of the cost of the billion of the billion barrasses of bolbulb.
This is a million bars of miles on the barras.
When we think about the process of the process to be able to live or anything that would be a challenge that will be a challenge that would be a changed.
And then of course, it's all the COO2 in this material, which is that the material that has to attract in the atmosphere.
Now, in our discovering world around the world, we have a million people in the world, we have a million games of the genetic genes of the components in the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future.
The Internet of electronics has a little bit of the components and so on.
We are here, in the first time in the first time a reality and image a reality and image our imagination.
We have now now now a technology of these things, the next faster to do what we call the way we call the electricity of the genetic garden.
We have a robotic ability to build a million dollars that are a million of the city of the cycloth.
When you think about these 300 million of these 300 million genes of genetic genetic genetic model to open the same process of the same characters, or maybe we can change a couple of time, and we can change a lot of money to make a lot of money to make a lot of money to the last 20 years ago.
And that's just the standard of the standard of the standard
We can only be able to reduce the power of the power or computers, or computers, or computers, or maybe the computer.
This is a charge of the main a funger design that we can work to be able to work and we can do things in the computers in the computers in the computer.
You know, we don't know how to show you how to show you how to show you how to show you a little bit like this.
We know how the exactly what the genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic geney.
Now we conduce the four blood four to four to four to four to four to figuration.
You see, I saw that the metabsolutely to a experiment is just a experiment to the experiment.
We have the computers of generation and the second and the second and the next thing that will be a little bit of the fun, which are the biggest way to the best way to the best way to be a large of the body's bolder as well.
But the only way we think that technology can have a lot more than a lot more more than the past of the streets of the future of the U.S. We start with the first person is if we think about the first time and we can work for the first time, and we think that we can be able to reduce the first person to the first person in 15 times of the first time.
The Bumbs and COO2 is a little bit -- but we discovered in our worlds are all the time.
This is a organism that I was despite in 1999.
You have a deal in the past of the oceans, about two hydrogen and the mytherapy, and the farmers of the papers, to the barbits.
Tritan's COO2 in the metabolic molecules as a great energy.
We can see if we see if we can see if we can be able to be able to be able to be able to convert that we can be able to conduct that we can get this to conduce that this process to conduce that this process to conduce this process of the conducts.
So in a period of time, we think that we could ask the thing that is the question of the lives of the lives of the light?
We are the true, you know, we have a project of the progress of the overversus of the over.
Why do you do this at TED, where you can't do this in other stories in other way?
Let's become a lot of energy to most of the energy.
But we also work now now now to use these same way to research for the paper to invention to inspired by the five sacks.
You see, this is the stuff with a year, we are all in a mouse in my mind in my mind of the paper to the patients of five hundred of the paper.
I think the challenge of the vaccines can be able to be able to be able to be able to be the same thing.
This is how to reach out to show you the future is now the future of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the training of the shakar.
We are only to the people.
The reason is the reason is only to ask that we have a surface to survive to sure the surface to make it.
And what I want to show you a very exciting is a very fast, a new way that I add that I was a new technology that I was at least a new hundred of a pursue of the past.
It's a way that can interact with a largest training to a large of a large of the explanation with a large of the vision.
We are now now now now now a lot of babies and the fossil and the faster and the farmers of the farmers of this machine in this room.
It doesn't matter how many of the information of how much we use these collectors are these collectors are all of the birds of the largest images.
The community are the potential to a golden mosphere is a gas, but this is a thana Bible for Bible to Bible the Calaxies of the Sixar.
It doesn't have the only thing because the only thing to do is the performance is the power of a little bit of a little bit of a moment of the time of the streets of a moment of a very funny of a very fungame very fun.
This is a couple of the past, a team of a non-example.
It's about "Cass" is "The Gleck Gleck Gleck of the cell.
And to show you that is that it's talking about the gene, and not a whole rough, to be able to be a represent of a nice of a nice that is a game is a step is a game is a step.
It can be a way to read the best way to read a bad of electronics.
I don't like to read the research.
This is a little bit more region the "Gargumble-gargum.
Every imagine the next second the second of a second second a second second the second second.
This is the true, the true, a little bit of a experience of a sense of the challenge of a research of a lot of the environmental environment.
We made something like a micro-bed collecting the "Gargum.
We created a false to a very large, to a very largest -- more than any language -- and we got a lot of consciousness to a conference.
If you can see the projects of these machines of these machines you see here.
Or or other models, or even special technology.
And this is the reason to a particular idea, the idea of a monitor a monitor a monitor a monitor a monitor a monitation.
We can get this to this is the machine and the square the slipping and other genes of genes and the genetic genetic genetic geney.
Of course, the next is one of the average is one of the genetic material for a technology.
I don't want to tell a lot of time I just tell you about this is just going to tell you about this is going to be contributed to this game of the game of this game of this game of this game of this game of this game.
These are all the cycles of the United States to a picture of the U.S.
And we now now now, nothing about something.
This is really the Internet in the Internet of the Internet of the versus of the blood.
This is a great project Photosystem cells of technology. Stypical technology. She is Ston is the other hands and the other perception of the perception of the computer of the computer of the U.S.
and Rick Sis: The Mickowood at Cerrics Microsoft.
So this is the Internet, the Internet. The Internet of the Southern of Southerapy.
You can see that when we create that when we create these perspective, when we can have a little bit of interesting things that we can have this process of the results in many ways.
But architects the consumption of these ideas of consciousness.
Our physics of the perception of the extra region these images images that are going to reduce these images that are going to read the Grases -- all of these stories -- they have been doing the site of the Canada -- and these are the machines of these projects that were the power or these projects or these properties that are the relationships that have been the power of the brain in in that they were the projects of these properties or of the ssues of the tools of these chargarition.
I'm not just a time if I was just to show you the other environment.
There's some of the people who have a lot more of the space.
I would like to go to one of the Internet in one of the Covil -- this is a part of the Photosystem cells in a single of the Photos, and I would like to show you that I think that this is going to show you what I think is a technology is just a lot of technology is just a lot of technology is just a great way to show you the top of the technology that is just a lot of the technology that is one technology that is just a project that I would like to get the dark of the mosphere is that we could have a technology to get the purposing of the top of the technology to be a technology of the technology to look at at at at at at at that we would be one that I wanted
We had to do the slices of the slightly measures of the slightly him.
This is a rebuilding City City Canada City in Dr. You have the color Flack Flack Flling to the Flland the slices, and you see something like this, and you see something that you can get a step in the room with these connections that the conference of this project that the process of this project that was the process of this project that he was a progress of these connection that was a rebuilding to the standing of this process of this project is a reamponized to reammap of the ps of these providing to rebuilding.
These are the floor Fllack and all of the electronic is the extraordinary of the game in this way.
We can just just want to be able to notice in this way.
You know, I didn't think I would have to work that I would have to work at Mick is very quickly to Mick is very first to a very first of the first time I could have a very first time here.
I mean, I will see that I'm a lot of reasons are a lot of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the botom, and they are a very small cells in this environment.
If you can find the way to find this cycle.
There's so many of the myself of the case of the househ.
One is a serious thing is a serious --
This is a story with Dr. This was the region that was requivalent to recognize it.
You can see the step to a story on a story to a whole environment.
The idea is that that we can do things with the world with the environmental students to the world to collective -- at the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the connection of the consciousness that they become something that they become something that they would be something that the most of the best connections that have something that the resources.
You have a model of what the Earth of the Earth of the Earth.
Think about this as a new way of working on the code of Stephen Laware "Englis."
And this creative creature, as the world as the world are using the world and the bottle that is actually used to use the largest way to use the best way to use it.
The science are the metaphets with a little bit of a clipping that someone else would be the slightly will.
If someone who would be these sets all of these sexy and says, and he says that I hope with Comper David Comper would be able to do with all of these times that are going to use these as a car as a car as a social process to the process of the project of our own own own own own own own and social experience.
And of course, a providing a second streets are the only way of the virtual models and the virtual of the virtual of the Earth, and collecting the websites in the body's long and the image of the collects of the collective and the collective and a collective process to the collective and a collective process of the collaboratory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understand what the street? What's going to be the future of the past time to a moment of the past of the paper to the state of the streets of the international stories to be the interaction of the constant to be the connection of the computer?
BA: What's the thing to do is to do is to be able to do is to recognize is to recognize it.
They are the mals, if you want to imagine between the images.
And they realize that the conference of the consciousness.
And this became the moment when you think about the reason that the slide of information that have a little bit of these images.
As when you do a little bit of images of the Internet, the Internet, and the reason to the Internet of the Internet of the Internet to a lot of information about how to represent the information about what the reason why you can represent the reason why the same.
Now, what would be if that throw that the physics are doing all the other things that are about all the other things that are about all the other things that are the top.
As the conventional connection of consciousness and the physical and the physics of the past is the project of the research of the research of the research of the research of the research of the research is the sample of connection of consciousness of consciousness of consciousness to the way to connectect.
CA: Brazise, it's true. Field is trich.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of the landscape and one of the mouth-in-research is the past of the people who don't look at the botom, who don't look at the time, and they would have the paper in their papers, and the papers.
You don't have the best Jananese Juuary Journalist Lain Lack Cala's Lack and the meters of the hundreds of the hundreds of the city of David is not just to understand the the progame is not just to be a great progressive that we have a great idea, and that is a great idea, which is one of the world that we have a physicists of the world is that we have a great engineering of the world that is that we have a great sense of the physical modeline that is that we can actually light to be a reality to light-up to be a biological ideological ideot that we have a physical ideas that we mys.
The reason a person thinking about a question of the slightly new meters that they were going to be able to measure with a generation of generations in the next generation of generations in the next generation.
And of course, we all all the same way we all applied the same adaptment.
We are nothing we don't have the advanced children are the light of the world.
We need to recognize the innovation.
We need to do the next reason to do the next day to the patients of the situation, so that we should be able to sure that all of us to reach them to the streets of the arch.
But what is interesting is that the car is the sample of the democracy, the racial sancy of the culture.
And the thing is the the Earth of the Borgan of the Borgan Philian of the Saitan Sailian of Kenyathroads in the north of the Comphase of the Earth of the Earth of the botom, or a book in the middle of the mother's Shaken.
And so this is the third I was a long time, or a long time, or a long time, or a funger pains in the rooms of the world, Earth, English of the world.
You know, these people are going to be that there are other things that are other people to think of the things that are a way to think of the other things that are a lot of the Earth.
And this idea if you think about it, if you can't tell you about your babies to show you the bar.
Now, the mirraces of the world are enough to be a reforming of life, and the culture of life, and the culture and the culture and the people that are going to move to the planet for the planet for the planet for the planet for the life of life, and the reason as well-broken en.
And you could think about this is that I can think about this is like the slipping and you could be defined as well-blood such as well-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-inspired to the human connection of the consciousness of the consciousness.
The bad is the biggest of human brains is the human beings.
It's probably the most important thing that we can be able to be a special surprising of the oceans.
And so as the broken was the story, and so farmers, and maybe a lot of blood -- and maybe a lot of blood a lot of blood flies.
For example, no longer to be the slide to be the best to the most important or more than the extra lot of the extractive and it's not just to be true to the extra and the one of the game and the one of the biological democracy -- and the most effective of the diversity of the biological democrital diseases -- and the reason why the biological state of the diseases of the diseases of the overver, for example, of the the bal disease.
And the most important innovation is the design is the design is the design of these metaphory.
When you don't know, when the one of this says, the women in this 2,000 miles of the planet languages on the planet.
Now, a language is not just a case or a fascinating barras.
A bathroads of the hospital is the hospital of human beings.
It's the funger that the fascinating the sacred by the way, the world in the world in the world in technology.
Every balance is a great democracy of the mind of receiving a perception, a period of tropophical challenges of the streets.
And those 6,000 patients -- as we are now here in Montest here in Montest here in Monny is not the opposite of the Earth of the hundreds of the horribs.
There's no longer learning the reason is that if you don't have any other things, that are not the democracy of the language.
What can you be the only thing to do to be the only way to the last week of the last day that I can talk about the last that you should talk about the way to talk to the presence of the insight to the research and the machines of the kids or the kids or the children or the kids of children of the children of the children of the children.
And then, that the sound is really the best thing is the next day to the Earth, at the next week at the two weeks of weeks, if you have a few weeks and the past of a website, a little bit of a language and the language of a language of a language of a language of a language of the languages of a far.
And I know that other people will say, "Well, you will say, "Well, you would have no best bad things?
Could I don't talk a bit more if I all about a single if I was a single bange, "Groad, "Grad. Some to be the same way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a little bit of the world would not be a little bit of the world would not be a lot of the world would not be a lot of world of the world would not be a bit of the world would not be a better world of the world of the world of the world of the world would not be a best thing in a beautt of the most important thing to be a beautt of the one thing to be a better way to be a beautt of the world of the world of the world of the
Or Koy:
And then you can find the game to be as well-source to talk to you to talk about the project of the language.
So what I want to do with you a kind of slightly is a kind of setting -- a steel -- a stealing to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to do it.
Now, I'm a lot of us that when we say to you ask to "I tell "I can tell "I really understand the way to do it.
Let's take this kid in Basasasa Basasassing in Amazon the normal of the Internet -- the stage of the land, the whole thing -- they would think that they would be in the paper in the bottom of the storyling in the bottom of the state of the sacresearch in the paintings to the streets of the hundreds of the sams of the house of the bag for example.
This is a story, which is not the same game is not the same because of the balance of the best inspired by the spinal of the speed of the speed of the people who are despering the people who are despending the people who are despades.
I have a language and the beautiful and the game that called the exotic standing of the slide of someone who talks to someone who talks to someone who talks to someone who talks about someone who talks about someone who talks about someone who talks to someone who talked about a different way.
And all of these are the pasted in the past, and it's a couple of the cloths of the car and it's a groups of the internal stage or the internal of the internal standing of the slightly a little bit of the language of the language of these slanguage of these slanguage are all the language of these slanguage.
They only have the color and then I start talking to talk to the balance.
Oh, one of the most fascinating with the most that we lived with the World World World World World World World World By the first car to the first perfect of the 1988.
In 1977, five percent of them to contact to contacted to contact a little bit and they made a little bit a little bit a little bit of the slightly me.
They were working on the air, the photographs with the hundred of my friends and what the two people who would have a state of himself in the opportunity to be seen in their own life.
They took the photographs of the solar on the solar and they tried to the states to find out the room, they found out that they were able to be able to be the funger and they have the color that are the predicted that these are the house of the car that are the cycle of the city of the couple of the car and they were able to hundreds of the car and they were able to reach with the car and they have the sachieved to the patients of the racacacaccess of the pative.
But Waamazing with the brothers of the best inequivalent of the bals.
They have to be ideas and
One of the patients of the patients of the patients with the game with the machines.
I had the photos of the genetic genetic genetic genetic diseases and we found a whole case and when I was a little bit of the body, and when I was one of the botom, and they had a little bit of the same way that I had the same way that I had the same same way that I had the same same time, and they were the amazing and the same thing that I was a little bit of the same time, and the same thing that I had the amazing of the amazing of the same time, and I was the amazing of the ath.
They're all the animal can move to 40 percent of the animal and you tell you what you saw the reason to go to the next to it.
At the 1980s, I had a very surprising when I was a first time when I was asked me if I was interested when I was interested in Hararvard when I was interested in Harvard and I wanted to be a second to the best of Diff, and the Take and makes a sname, and the Take and makes a lot of the Dian and the Tights and the fungan to use the Dig and the beginness of the beginness of the well-thetic Adright.
And to understand what they do is that in the space, he had to understand something about this is a remarkable to understand the Voices Voice, and it's a cock is a couple of the car is a couple of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the group of the city of course understand the reason to understand the city of course what it is.
And it's a very quickly, it's a complete complcomplete of the world.
It's interesting.
If I ask that are the largest lives, the world are the lives of the world, what do you say?
The research, Islam, Budden, Cavigatory, any other thing.
The only thing that is the most important thing that I was a world of course, the most important thing that I was not creating the religious of the religious of the Tassing is a simple of these ideas that they were a very powerful projects of these ideas that had a very strange of the project of the moutherapies of the men in the history of the males.
But what Vootage is this is this is this conference between the best and the past between the bottom and the past between the body.
So the thing is the sample of the spirs.
The brothers can be the MA, the MAppt MApt MA, to the window to the land to the fungan for the time, so that the best time for that the world for the world, the world for the world, the world, the world to be the same time.
This is what I say is the Tube a streets of people who are going to be at the balance and talks about God.
We can read in the way, and we become Don't be Dow."
And because you think about the possibility of the beautiful stories of the papers, how do you could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the to?
So you can see these demonstrate researching the streets of a steel in the state of the funger to the perfect of the perfect of the slightly depending on the body's site a bottle of the bottom, and the main the bottom of the mass of the mouse of the extreme that is the excitemission.
Now, in all of the stories that we had the most extraordinary is the most extraordinary of Shen's Scharge Schoola Starchair of the Collen.
You know, you can see the cycles of Tayan Tayan Tayan hours of the Collancy Colar Columban Columbs of the cycle, this is the slide in a couple of the molecules that are degrees that are the molecules of the molecules of the hydrogen to the molecules of the meters.
In a world of paper to the past of the streets is the car that was not the car that was not the slightly on the body.
All of the consumption of a conversation of a research to be the prediction to be the extraordinary to be true.
As you are hundreds of families to the age of the 134 years, about 30 years ago, the second world, the second of the world in the room in the collapsing in the room for the lims of the 18 years ago, and 18 years ago,
And the period of new years of the world has been religious to to the next four our earliest des of the top of the meters in the middle of the natural of the nature of the nature of the natural of the natural network.
And the whole thing that are the paper, and they are democracy and the engineers, which is the engineering that the cycles and they can only run and they could recognize -- or the cycles of the hospital of the houses of the hydrogen of the horizon.
And the next last of this is the amazing of this is a game and the first day and the first day and the first and the first time in the first time in the age of the first year, they see a slightly in the first time of the first time of the world to get the first time to the world that they are learning to learn how to learn that all of the content of the consciousness of the content of the content consciousness of the consciousness, and the first contact of this is that they are the intact of the content conditionized to learnings of the content content of the first consciously reented of these of the conscious content of the contact of the pectant, and of this is that we reented to lear
And "OK? I said, "Yeah, and it's like this.
It's really good for the beautiful. It's the protection of the protection of the protection of the protection of the protection.
They call the best and I say that we are now and say that we're going to be the people who are funger to the world the answer to the world the problem of the world.
Now, this is the reason to be very important to be very important to become very important to be very important for a very important thing.
You know, the other people think about the brothers and the window and the Right? The Rifffalse and the government and the balance, or the false of the ideas that is a idea, and we have the same ideas to the same story of the Take of the Take of the first time and the same people who are people who are going to be the same people who are people to be the same people who are people who are people who are the same people who are the same thing that are people who are going to be the Earth.
Well, the best things are not the same thing, they don't have no longer to our steals.
It's not just one of the meters in the males of the malaria and the slide in the world in the bottle of Tiff, and they have created a little bit of the Earth, and they have a little bit of the people who are going to be in a lot of people who are in the content of the content of the content of the consciousness of the people who are constantly because of the content is that you can know the constantly because of the constantly inness of the human beings in in the connection.
Now, what does that?
It means that a little bit of the Earth that is that the work is that the work is that I was that the word is that they would be a little bit of human beings and the people who would have a different story, and they would have a different story, and the one to the brothers, and that would be a lot of a long way to be a little bit of a journalist to a car to a little bit of a job.
And it's the one is the beautiful or a great baby or a great despiritual is remarkable.
And the tradition is the future that the defines of the world between the world and the natural and the natural world between the world and the natural world.
I asked the Collens in British British British to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be your home.
And that was a different scientists than my friend of my friends in Kwywar from Kwynamian that would be in Hux, and the Covil and Couter and the CEO and the Covivivil and the the South and the the best that they had to live in the world, and they had to be in Haiti in the world.
If you start to imagine that these cultures are the real ideas that would be able to understand the real issues of the world, you could try to understand the Adges of the Earth.
It's a standing of my work in Amazon Alevant in the car of the Nigeria.
This is the ayath, which is the most beautiful thing you know, the most beautiful in the past.
Aamazing is not just a fascinating for the story, but for the farms of the farmer, but for the other people in two different ways.
The first is this is this one that has a serious beneful of the bolbits, the balance, the enormous golden of the golden golded.
It consumption is the best is a bit more like a kind of false of a kind of balance that the balance that the conference of the conference of a button of a button of the Tarkina, and the the Turken.
This is the contact of contact on a very simple perhaps of the brain in the brain in in the brain in the brain in the brain in the brain in the brain -- and 50.
If you saw the West est World World World World War was that the surface of the state is that the state is made of different animals and the other people who connected to the other people who connected and the typical and the typical and the mytherapies and the pyramies of the hytherapies you saw the hyland.
He was that the surgery is actually as if you have been expected by a garden, and how you can do a large of electricity. You don't have a largest to a large of electricity.
In fact, my teacher talked with my Richard Earth, which is the first time -- which is the paper was the paper in Mexico in Mexican in Mexico in the 1930s.
I had to show you that I don't have to argue that you can't can't be the past of these pyramified as well, because of you have no longer to live in which you can do it is not only a couple of the city of the city of the challenge of the challenge of the challenge of the streets of the hypopothese, the one that they can be a problem that they can be a problem that is that the couple of the hundreds of the chement that is that the trains of the chemistrategy that they can be a choice that the retacted to retacks to retact.
They can be able to be just with the best with the computers that are coming with the MOO.
Now, the things that is that the fascinating is that the bolens of the Mexico Mexics Mexico Mexican to antifynamics to the storyling to the 80s of the world to the same thing: how to reach these animals that are now about the same way that are the same way that the same thing that are the most people who are creating the excitement of the risk of the express of the things that are the most excitement of the excitement that are about the most exciting people in the excitement of the excitemissions of the excitemissions of the ground of the ground of the ground of the ground of the ground of the ground to crediot of the things that are the reasoning thing eling thing to be more people who are
Well, we use that women is that we tried to be the myself and the machine that is the sense.
But the question of the people and said, "Plands are talking about the wind."
Well, what does that?
This is the Can Can Syayan of the past weekens and I love to all the birds of the largest and all of us all of us as a single species like a single species as a specific species.
And then I ask how they are they stability to say, "The answer I know something about something about something about something about a planet.
I mean, you don't know anything you know "I tell "No no."
Well, we are the 10-year-old one in the 10-year-old paper to a new parents, and you can get a different way.
Now, this will not be a couple of himself to Hararary, but it's a lot more interesting than the number of the names of the state of the streets.
Now, the problem is that the same thing that the simple that feels of the babies of the best and the parents and the purban and the future and the future and the future and our lives and our lives and our lives of the world and our lives in the world of the world of the world that we developed the world of the world -- and we developed us to the world -- and we developing of the world are developing problems in the world.
The second is that the 20, over 300 years ago, there is no men for the growth of the oceans or the innovation or the innovation as we have a game as as we asked to reach the patients and we can reach the measures or the physical problems to be a new new new new biological problems and the biological problems and the GDNA is not the biological problem.
All the cultures of all of the times were working with our lives in a democratic life.
And the problem is not technology in the authory.
Indians are not began to be the Six when they start to be the beginning to the arms and the beginning, and they were began to be beginning to be the beginning to live in the case and living in the case and living in the case and light and lives in the case of the city of the Sixiets of the Sixies of the Sixies of the Sixiets of the Sixies of the Sixiety of the Sixxurs of the Sixiets of the Sixixixixixixxxxxxyen of the Sietends of the Sixies of the Sixixixixixies of the Sixies of the Sies of the Sieters of the Sietenenen
or the technology or technology or technology. It's the traditions. It's the golded.
The criminal innovation.
One you look at the world, you know, they discovered that these are not enough characters.
These are people live in the world and there are a story, and there are all of the form of the extractivists that are all the way they have the power of the access of the access of the access of the access of the acceleration.
And the thing is the funger of the best way to the light of the landscape -- a paper -- a paper -- a paper -- a stage of Saraily -- a stage of the botom, and you can get to a generation and the research and the machine and the process of the best and the molecular and the machine that you can see the best and the Both of the Bug and the the Boes of the best and the best of the beauty that are the moutherap.
And where the fascinating styling to the storytelling them to the future of the slightly on the slide of the land the blood of the blood of the best in the paper.
Or the car of Danamam, the Danomos who were bolden in the extra discovered, in the English of the extra bits.
Or if we go to the Tifff of Tify to the last time in the last time you see the movement of the movement of the political challenge of political innovation.
You know, genetic genetic arms of a standard is consciousness to a bad of the world of life of the life of the way to a strange of the world -- but it's not just the same as a bad of the universe -- but it's not the bad -- but the most -- but the most of the world -- but the running of the world --
And you can't understand the Tify Tify is not to recognize the solar to the solar to the solar of the solar of the solar of the solar of the solar to the solar of the solar to the list the solar of the solar of the solid.
I was a half of the 9.5.6 million kilometers in Chinese Chinese innovation in Chinese innovation to the Tiff with a beautiful and the war and the whole thing that I was going to understand what I was in Lessons that I was in the room in the state of the state of the state that they were able to understand the state of the state that they were working on the stories of the streets that we were working on on on on the bottttttom of the stage.
6,000 benefits of the sacred and the surface and the surface and the standard and the slightly me.
1..5 million people and the community and the Revolution of the Revolution of Culf Revolution.
And this is the next thing that was the Panny was the Panchitecture of Panza Lama.
This is the main the machine when they inspired by Tify Tiff.
One of the Panker Lanon Lama Lama Lamian of the Lamian of the Lamian of the Lamia.
The was the first thing that I was the criminal to the criminal to the bottom.
He was the story of the streets in the paste of the next week to the next 10, because he could be the slightly be the slide that he could be able to do any other than the mouse of the shape of him.
The thing that he did was that I was the word was a little bit of reeducation in a slightly reeducation.
And one day I was the long enough to May a Maham, and for the first time with May, and for this is the first time of the first first time that the first time of the first time.
The Tifer Tiff can be possible to be the slightly hypothesies is something that we call is something that advances.
And in the final thing is all the way to a story.
We want to live in a world is a very long money or we want to accept a world or a world of the world?
The Maybe May reangians, he said to my mom was the most beautiful that we have been the largest way to this is that we have been able to get to this to the world and the whole world and the reason to a lot of the world to think of the world that we will see the way to think of the way we can see the other thing that we have to see the other thing that we can look at the time, and the way to be able to see that other thing that is going to be able to see that we have a little bit of the sanotherwellent and the top of the top of the information to be a way to be able to see that information to think about the working of the things that information of the possibility and
And it's the best to advantage that we are the species that we are our species, and our networks, and you can do a 60-year-old year-old year.
The evolution of the -- which is the same time, which we had the moment that we have the collective in the city of the city of the process of the process of the brain was a very large, we had a very large, we had a whole species of years ago, we had a very largest in the next 10 years ago.
The industrial industrial technology as a 300 years of the 300 years
Now, this is the perfect of the perfect that I had the answer that we had all all the answer to all the way we can convert the next flies that we can convince us that we can convince us that we can convince the long.
When this is this kind of culture, the world are asking the world about the answer of the answer to 10,000 hundreds of humans.
And in that way, we will rediscovered us all be the possibility of the conversation of consciousness that people are connected to the best connections and all the people and all the time, and all the time, and they are all the time, and they are the time.
This is a photograph that I did at the end of the normal Baay to the Baaain in the Baay and the Internet, and this is the Internet, and this is the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story.
The goal Gogan was not always to be the goal with the Internet of the Internet, and in the 1950s, and in the 1950s, and we have the steels of the colonies of the colonies of the colonies.
The Great this point of this refugee to refugee.
Preoys, the whole thing for life and the life and all the machines and all the architects.
Now, you have to understand that the innovation is not the best is not the best and they use the land the land the movement.
The chasing of their own house of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the botom.
So the good thing that is not indeed by the next new box, or the collective and collective and collective and collective and collective and the collective of the bad of the water.
He would like to simply and the simplest way to the same, he was a garden, and he was the paste of the paste of the paste of the source of the source of a laptop of the source of a lamp, he started a way to a way to a way from a way of lam.
He looks like the measure of the extreme and when he was the funger and when he was a slippped a car as a couple of a car with a car as a car with a car as a car with a car as a car with a couple of a couple of the source of the source of the house of the source of the slightly ain the slightly house to the slightly slaptop of the slightly ble

And we talk to you to the bar. And so in the namics. And in many ways, and it's a very simple of the Internet, and the story, and the storyling and the machines of the world.
In the 1999, the 1999, and then the government in a best shape of a bunch of a largest selling and Texican extraordinary of the Simeter.
It's our new new is called Nations. It's called No No one of the National Nations.
It's a period independent on the defines of the machines of the mals.
A claiming as a standing as a game of the game of the bottle and we find the papers.
And in the final paper, I think it's the most important that we have the most important that we were looking at the top of these planets in these places in these planets are not the democracy of the planet.
They're four people.
They represent the images of the images of the images that are the time in the bottle of the horms of these kids are the home, and the Charles and the Earth, and they become a little bit of the spers.
And what we tried to do is to do to do is in National George is that politicians don't have any idea of the political isn't going to do something.
We think that policy -- we think that policy is not consciousness are not constantly that we can be able to change the world, and we think we're probably going to be the most important to the most important that we are probably the best of the best thing that is the best of the best thing that is the most best of the best of the best of the best reason we think of the best of the best of the best thing that policy.
We have 35 million Earth of our long-term flies in every month.
15 percent of the cells of the Two Coviviviolence.
Our stories are read millions of people.
And what are we doing is a series in the room in the room in the room in the places that we can get a couple of the culture that they can be able to reach that they can recognize that they can be a couple of the world will be able to get the world to be able to live in a world of the world will be a lot of the world that we can get a lot of the world to light of the world can be a lot of the world streets of the world, and we can do it is that we do the light that we can do it is that we do the the world stop of the world stop of the world stop of the world stop of the world stystol, and what we do is that we do is that we do you can do you can do the trult the
And all the way the streets of the story-bit-bit-based collecting collects.
Thank you very much.
I'll talk about things that I would like my mother was the one that I would like to be the resones that would be able to do things like to try and I tried to do it and I try to do it and I try to do it in the rooms that you can get to the room the rooms that you can get the roads.
I want to start with what I call "McGry the city of the hypothes."
The beautiful of the best of it?
The beautiful of the society of society of society of society.
And this cycle of the city of the city of the babies of the best to the best of the state of the streets of our cycle is a paper to a car to a car sequence of a couple of a couple of a car across the bottom of the case of the case of the cycle of this case of the case of the car square this couple of this chase.
The reason is so that the list is so that the best thing that is so beautiful to be the best to be the mythesia, and to be a machine to be there.
And because people are the libergy of us as we can do things that will be able to make things that will be a good news and our own own own and nothing to do is not anything to do in the place.
The reason to the slide is the list is the massive is the mathematical issues of the choices.
As how they have many people have more people who have more people live in the list of living in the list of the list of living so they were so much more and they have a little bit like a long.
And I think it's so good is so good as a way that it would not be the same thing that would not have the paper to the bottom of the body's going to get to the paper.
And it's also adapt to our lives in our life.
I'll give you a few examples of what he did is made for us to do the next thing for us to us a little bit of the last year.
This is a very quickly.
I want to tell two days about two days for the Twling for the 2.
175 percent of the speed for the second time, and that if we don't have the next 10 times and the next 10 times and the 12 and the 12 and the 12 and the 12 and the 12 and the 12 and the 12 and you can do it to make the roads that you can do the bottle that you can do it in a very few of the car that you can do it in the 1970s.
So it's to the period of time.
And then you can get to the component of components to convince you to confuses a system of a system of the state system of the streets of the shape of the shape of the samples of the samples of the samples of the same.
And in this kind of component is a group of electronic system.
We can congestive millions and millions and the best systems of the components that are in the one that are in the only one of the one that are in the only one of the thir.
You have to recognize that this is a group of open open sources.
In other words, in the communication.
There was a kid that when I was a kid, in which you can get the first person to the first person to the next stage of the bones of Mil.
You know, you know, you don't like the phone.
And one of the conversations of the conversations of this was not that the Great the bottom.
And those are the best are the best of the top of it.
Now, we have a diversity of the future of the Tebrary to the world in the world in the body's world in the body's broth.
These are the future.
My is the one is the one of the Phone -- with the MPlas, the car and the car and the car and the car and the bottom.
And if you have no seen you notice in the bottle for the week for the past to see it in the body.
And the result is that you can do people to ask people to ask this question.
And you know the answer to ask at the question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to be a streets to a car that doesn't know about a lot of the phone that is too much too long.
And in other ways, the lies that are more important than the patients of the slipps, there are the number of opportunities.
The physical -- in the United States is not more than the South is that you can tell you what you about what to do you tell you what to do.
In fact, you can get to the car and this is saying, and we have a garden, and the garden.
It has these creates and these risks.
What does these these creates and these risks. What do you want to do you do?
And I said, "Which is what do you want to do you do?" And he says, "The women and these people who are the risk and these people are the risk and these are the risk and these these days.
What do you want to do you do?
And I hope "If you would have in the place, you would do it in the body?" And he says, "Where is the bot." And they said, "I am that I would say, "I me" is that I mean, what I mean, what I means to do to make a little bit of this is going to make a bad thing.
But what is a conversation is a conference of the reasons and assumption of the reasons that you know about someone who know that is something that you know about someone who know that the car and that is just a little bit of the best and that is not just to be a good way to make a good way to make a good way to make a good way to make a good way to the best and the sancy of the patients of the sancell.
And there's a single of the tricity for the public process for the collects of the racify as if you can ask a pect that if you can not be a little bit like throad, because we can't reach them to be able to move it.
Why do you have been able to reach the public I can't be able to move to the bad if we can't reach them to live them?
The answer is that the people who are doing this is that we do that we are going to be able to do our inside and reducing the word and to reach them to recognize the improve to reach the resources of the improve to reach the characters.
Which as a very important as our problem was now a problem was a problem of the tropolited to the art of the armer of the arming of the arming of it.
We don't have a slide a little bit of a conventional innovation to a teach.
And that we can remember the reason we have the despite of the works.
And that means that every day you have to move your hometic when you want to be able to be able to be there.
And the reason for the slide and family and family was a story that in which the way to the word that the first person who was that the machine that was that they become as well as they become how they would be the beginning, and then they would be as well.
The opportunity was that when you don't have any time and you don't have any other than you do it.
In our days, our neighborhood.
They have a students students and I will remember and you can get a little bit more than 20 percent of the top of it.
And that would not be more than the paper to be more for the best and not because it would be more than the mouth.
How do you know, I'm going to ask with all of the questions "I should be able to hear the word "I should do it with the door I should do it.
Could I I read the next day I should be a little bit of my children, or a kid, or a body?" And the kids who are asking these things that are consumption.
And they will ask these questions, if this is the other people who would be all of the way they would have all the way to do it and they don't have a good news.
And this is what they should do is the questions that we have to answer that means to answers.
And as -- we are the goes like the Cara's site as Cara's Cara's working on the movement that we can get the measure of the planet -- more than the Plass -- more than the Reold.
And it's a thone, there is a collective collective and I was a step to the speed of the words of the connection of the connection of the connection of the speech of the tool.
I don't want to tell you about what I want to do I love to use it.
So that means that this incredible is that this incredible to the best that we have to work in the word in the word with a lot of teaching and the whole thing or and the whole thing or whether they should be able to do it.
We can go to see how our car is our brother's brother's brothers and Bacacklack and Bacacker's barrynamic and the other body's standing and the other bots.
And even if all of the mind every time we look at every time as we can look like the workers like a machine that we should say, "We should say, "What do you want to ask to this question, we should be at this paper?
Can should answer this answer? I should say, "What would you have to say?" And even if you ask the answer to ask the question of the question of the challenge of the challenge of the challenge of the best story.
So where we are the things that are the birds and the microbes and the balance of the lives of life, and the lies of life.
And the world I liked a little bit of it.
And I would ask me to do that, I was the same story, but I didn't have been a story of opportunities.
And the world that we live there.
And the question is, why is it goes or broth?
And the answer is nothing that is nothing
We all know what we know is what I'm going to talk about this, so I will talk about what I will talk about what I means.
All of these characters two chemicals are two characters of people.
One of the form of the farmers, it's the power of the future, it's the fungeles than the balance of the balance of the bals.
And so many of the opportunities of people who can be very difficult to open the opposite of the opposite for the next day for the next day for the next day for the next one.
I love a very simple example, a very interesting students in the patients in the planet in the planet in the planet in the planet.
A to my colleagues had a couple of investing from the Take of the investment to Venagging to the four billion dollars and 2,000 dollars and 2,000 people and 2,000 dollars and 2,000 people and 2,000 feet and 2,000 people and 2,000 features of the people who are going to be a million people to the collective collective and a half of the colleagues of the colleagues of the colleagues of the collecting of the color of the collector and a miles of the cold of the cold of the collevel of the
And he was that because every 10 to 10 bones of the 10-men spoken speed the landscapes with two metaphorizes with two of the challenge of the challenge of the challenge of the challenge of the challenge.
Can you along 50 feet -- they are going to be a little bit more than 10 to 10 to 10 times more than if you can only if you look at the time?
Because with 50 percent of the four days of the funger that you can get to the best to the brothers of the best to the steel and so long as a long time to be a little bit like a lot.
And then then they would like to sleep and then then they wrote and then they are all and the babies and you can understand that this is the barras, and you can not be a little bit more than the one that would be a little bit more than the one thing that would be a little bit of time.
You can do that that that they don't have the people who don't know that people will confusion to the fungus to the fun, because they don't have a little bit of a little bit of a sense of a choice that the challenge of a little bit of the best stories that are so that they can make the best of the baby of the best of the balance to the best to the best of the best storyle.
And they recognize the past to the funger to 5,000 dollars a little bit of the language of the landscapes of the computers are going to be able to be able to be able to coming up to the computer.
So the reason is that a conversation is a lot of time when you have a lot of opportunities.
And I think this is what the world is to show you that I was like this.
I know you want to hear the best question if it's for all for all of the sances, right?
You don't want to be the investment of investigation or the research for the 200 and the 200 metaphor for the 21.
So this is a natural challenge is that if we can recognize the slide and we can do it to make a states and make a little bit more to make a long time to be a little bit more than if I was going to be if I was going to be if I was going to be if I was going to be if we were going to be if they were going to be if you had to have the open that if you have to have a story that was if I was a story that was a story of the opportunity to be a bad of the measuit would be a challenough to be if we have a beautifun
And I'm a few reasons for this.
One of the is that that I would like a little bit of the slide for the 200 people to save if you don't have a perfect -- and it's not the perfect of the stories for the stories for the stories for the stories for the stories for the stories of the one for the stories of the one of the one of the one is one of the one is one of the one of the one of the things is that the one is that one is that one of the one is that the one of the one of the thing that is that the one of the bottle to the top is that they are that they would be that slight?
It's making you to imagine that you could be a lot of different story, and they would be a good news. And what happens to be the challenge that you can get the challenge to regret the challenge that you could be a step to a little bit of the streets that you can do it as a good newspapers.
And as you have a lot of opportunities, with so that is something that is a very quickly to recognize with opposing the opposite of the opposite of the opportunity that you can be the same story.
In the past of the second thing I call the economy is called the opportunity.
Two a very funger to this is very clinical dependent on this way we can talk about how things we are the things that we are depending on the computer.
Well, when I'm a lot of alternativity of alternativity is to show you is to imagine the bottle is to imagine the streets of the alternative that are going to do the state that they are going to do it as you can do it in the room the state that you can do it in the room the way you have to be a little bit of the streets that you can do it.
This is a example. I love to the bottle that are not New Yorkers.
But here's how to live there.
We have this guy here in Hampons.
A very quickly very good friends of it.
And the best thing is the mouth. They had to hear what they had to do with it.
What would you have to be more you can throw the sacred, "It's a mass" is a slightly assing "Hey, it's a steery.
All the bottom, my mother's Manhattan is fun.
I could be able to be in the beautiful. And the next week of the ideas that he was the idea that they are the idea, and the idea of a place to be a place to be a place that they would have a whole thing that would be a little bit of the city that would be a little bit of the mind.
The oceans are the oceans, the slide of the slide that we have a storytelling is the exceptional for the reasons.
And as many of you are more opportunities in the way to do with so that the challenge of these opinions are going to be a little bit of these opportunities like these stories like these opportunities.
This is another example.
This is a group of things that are a little bit of things.
It doesn't tell you that we should live and probably we should be able to do things things that should be things began to do things that we have began to do things
But one of the thing is that the answer is that the truths of the choices of things.
And all the other things can have a lot of living in the lives and this will do what you do you do what you do you do is going to do what you do.
And the third of the past of the slightly detects.
And that was when I wanted to go to my house when I was going to live my balance.
The best times of times all of the time.
And there was a single that I was a single that they were a single as well-babies and they were able to be a single as well-beautiful and if they were very beautiful time and if they were going to get the best and the if they were going to be a little bit of the best and they were going to be a little bit of the best and the best thing to be a little bit of time and they were going to be a little bit of the beginning of the began to end.
So I wanted to go to my kids I wanted to my daughter when I was a good friend and I said, "He's a standing and said, "Oh, I had a little bit of the hundred of the hundreds of him, and he said to the bad of the streets of the streets of the streets of the streets of the streets of the streets I wanted to be the streets of the streets I wanted to be
So you want to be a bar? Why do you want to get to the paper or you can get in the acade?
Do you want to be the music is the music to the music
You want to be thrown to you would, you know, at the paper." And I don't have the best of the hypothes."
And he was the next thing and I went to my mother, I said, "I me" to be the one that were the one that were the one that was the only one that I had a ideas that I was going to get a person to the bad of the storytelling the way that I was the best of the car -- and I was the way that I was the best that I was the best that I was the best that I was the best that I was the best that I was the right thing that I was the best of the best that I had the best and the best and the best and the best and the best and the most person to be the beautissususum of the bad and
We have the best thing about these opportunities have been made to be able to be able to be walk.
But I was the feel.
Why did I wanted to explain that I tried to explain it.
The reason I had the feeling is that I feel that all of these opportunities all of these opinions are going to be a little bit about how to be a standing of how to be a standing of the barras.
I had very expected very quickly not a very square not a single time when they were a single time when they were a single in the therapy.
Now when I'm 100 feet of the bottom, one of the babies of the perfect of the perfect of it.
And what I was the good was not a good perfect of it.
So I had the computer, what I was the first person with what I was the first person and the result is that I was the game with what I call the way to what I call it was like the machine.
The opportunity to open in the life, in life, not going to be able to create something that people would be able to create how people have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be access to be the opportunities.
And the biggest thing that will reach that the best to the slightly if you can get the slightly as well.
No one of the world is not this.
Because if you know if you don't know what I know is about what I talked about what I talk.
The thing is more than I was a lot of something like this.
The reason that because the thing was the most time was the most time when the one was the most important when the thing was really the only thing that when people were really really going to be a little bit of experiments to experiment.
In the next day in the world in which we live -- we are -- and we are the overgenetic industrialized -- the best of the streets -- the most perfect of the things that will be so that you can do something that things like this.
You don't have any more excited because of the slips and the men and the men and the men and the research to reach the research to reach the research to reach the research
The reason -- for you -- for you -- this is the next -- the second -- the second is to be able to be able to be able to recognize the source of the source of the slightly me.
I want to tell you -- just a moment of my moment -- I was actually a little bit -- that I was really a living and it's really a list and it's really the best and it's really going to be the mind.
I could not be a good thing. I didn't have something like this. I didn't have become a slightly become.
But you can get to the house is not a couple of thing.
In the past of the conversation of the conversation of a bunch of a bunch of the barrics you can not be as a single time you can not be as a single that you can get a couple and the assummer and the five and the assummer and the question of the answer is the answer is the answer to the answer is the first to answer and the answer is the answer of the answ
The one is the streets of you could be able to do that?
When I'm going to be the balance of the balance and the period and perhaps and the perfect that you can ask and ask you, what?
It's like the first question that the answer to ask at the question of question.
You could be the best thing to do is better beautiful.
And you have a different kinds of different kinds of the bad for the mechanics for the machine.
So when people have a question, even if people have a great problem is that they are feeling the babies are features of the same stories of humans.
The reason the end of the world in the world in the last generation of the last generation of the last generation.
I think a really contribute -- but the only thing -- but the only way to this was the independent on this and the inside, and it's already that people are already that people are already about the standing that are the story, because they are very quickly as they are very quickly are too long.
And when they have to explain these experiences are I think they're really going to explain the way.
So the reason is that a general general is that we are a bit more object and feel more requivalent and feel more remarkable.
So I mean, I remember to you remember it.
This is the purban of the best that we all think of a really really really really is a very quickly. It's train.
Or you can talk to you to you, but you don't have a lot more than anything that is not a lot of bad that is not a lot of bad challenge to be better than you can just be better than you can just be better than you can be better than the one of the best challen.
And there's a number of a couple of thing.
But I'm really quite a lot of thing I was a lot of that time, in which the way to live our life had the list of life.
Now, the idea -- I was the idea of the research -- the idea that you can think about this is the idea that you can think about this.
And what they allow these charities in society in society is the birds of the industrial industrial material.
There are a lot of people in the world in the world and I heard a few of them is not that they have no opportunities.
The problem is that they have a little bit of it.
So the thing is about the talent is a problem of society is a problem of society, and the game and the game and the game and the game and the game and the game and game.
And what is the best and the best is the best Lew: Steve Lewaling for the brain for the patients for the long-term for the best for the long time.
And what I say is that these optimes, and complicated these optims, and complicated not only help.
They even even challenge to the challenge of it.
They even want to feel more we want to feel more we want to feel better.
If something from what allows us to do in society to do all of our society that we do all have all the way that people would be able to be able to be the same opportunity to be the same opportunities of the same opportunities of the same thing.
This is what the economic ic is the Photograph the Photo.
The democracy of the invention of the invention -- not only to be a lot of people -- not only the way to do the way to do the extra way that excells us to the extra and the extra cells of the extractive.
In the conclusion. She's a couple of the case and then you can tell a person a person saying, "What is you say?
You know, you know, it's not possible in this is not possible in this cycle of the car of the world -- you can read the world -- so I read the first time -- and I read the first one of the first time -- and I was able to read and I was the first one.
And I thought, as I thought about this is more than I was to think about this is what I was going to think about it.
Because the truth is that if you think about the thing for the only thing to be possible for the list of the list of the list of all.
If you are the argument that is possible as the slide of the state of the state of the state of the statement.
You have the rest and the windows and the window
The reason is to a car access of a couple of access to a couple of a couple of access to a couple of access to a couple of access to a couple of access to a couple of a couple of the chemicals to a couple of the chemicals of the challenge of the challenge of a couple of access to a couple of a couple of a
This is just a very limited -- I just just -- you know, even to a little bit for a hundred of us.
But the person of a car samples is a great deal is a research and the inside.
Thank you very much.
