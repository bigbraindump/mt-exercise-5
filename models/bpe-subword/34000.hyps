And I showed these two diaxipped to demonstrate the polar of the polar polar from the most three million years of years of the last three million years of the last three million years of married by 48 percent of the large, it was a little bit of 48 percent of the large, it was a little bit of 48 percent of the baby of the mouse of these two percent of the slightly shootting with the sec
But this morning, because it is the special problem because it doesn't look at the gross of the gross of the gros.
The polar is is in is in a way that the climate system, the heart system.

This affected water resercing water.
And so I predicted how you read it as you read it is serious about.
And the global world has been the way to a growth of the incenter of the incentising.
And the disaster on the world, they grow up with a very extraordinary rabsolutely amazing and the precedented and far far.
Four times more than four years of the last 30 years of the 75 ans.
This is a very unfortunately.
If you look at a context historical context of what it is happening.
In the last five years I add 70 million tones of carbon every 25 million tones 25 million tones in every day every day in the oceans.
The universe with the attention of the Pacific areas from America, and every part of the subcontinent where the subcontinent where the subcontinent where it's a radication of oxygen in oceans.
The largest time of the single of global warming global warming in the 20 percent of it, which is the 20 percent of it, is argue despair.

And the proposition was to build more fabricate more fabrics.
But we start to see a changing change.
Here's the one who have anulated in the last year, with alternative alternative propush.
Everything has a fighting of our politics in our target.
And the carbonighting of the oil and the oil of the oil of billion dollars in the last year of billion dollars in the last year of the last year of the last year of the last year of the last year of the carbonistically.
The promote carbon what is a oxympic oximoron.
This image of the image of something.
In the presence of Cracia, at me in Tennessee, a billion stery-carbon was imprise.
You probably probably see at the stirl.
This is the works, the second street in the second deversary She intampled in the presence Cracia.
One of the baby of the Good of the Great Cracier of the Cracia, was this one.
Video: â™« Frosy, the crazy, is a happy of the ble-flew and vesel.
He's in the abundance here in the America, and helping growing economic growth of economic economic economic economic economic growth.
Frost, the crazy, it becomes more than the day that I can go ahead.
He's access and adorably adorably and workers and workers of the jobs.
Al Gore: This is the most nice of the Goreat Vestery in Vestery of the Vestery of the Vestery of the West.

This is one of them, part of one of them.
Video: ALergy COALergy we see the climate change, as a very serious businesses for businesses.
That's why we are the principly is to spend a big sugar survey for the public efortunately, and we really have to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help our good news about the cartoons.
The thing is that the best is not dirty is dirty not did.
We think it's currently -- and smroots and good.
So it's not going to reach not to choose the climate change.
You know, this is what we do is in our hands.
Video: The Carby: You heard a detect deately despite about him.
So let's make a teacher teaching of this chasing chairs of the carbon the carbs.
Huel! Masinary is a case of the gomots.
But this is the sound of the technology of the crazy.
And as the books is one of the principal principles of the global network of the new technology of the baby of the game,
The unique is that this is the technology of the carbon top of the carbon the currently currently of the current of the curve.
Al Gore: In the sphars' smart of position to the economic challenge of the national problems.

If you want to get to get far, you go back to the well.
We need to get fast, quickly.
Thanks very much.
And the last year, I did a LHC. CC.
And I promised to reach a data and give you a data about how it works that works in this way.
So, here's the right here -- and for the people who didn't have been here, LHC is the largest experiment that was recertain -- Cirumps -- Cirumps -- Cirumps is about 27 kilometers of the present of a billion more than a billion more than 600 billion more than 600 billion times a second-billion to 600 billion times a seconds.
It's extremely ambitious.
This is the art of the Geneva.
We make photographs "Big Bangs" in the decades.
I work on this one. It's called the ALAS is the ALS -- League -- Leag, diameter 22 meters of the AT's detectors here detectors here detectors to build here to proport here in building proportion.
And in the 10 seps of the year, I went back to the first time.
And this image was made by ATLATLAS.
It because it was a huge celebration in the room.
It's a picture of the first fascycle, which is the crossing system, the LHC, the LHC, the LHC, the LHC, though it was deliberately in LHC deliberattacks.
In other words, when I was seeing that image 10 seps 10 several that I shape that it is a huge success.
I don't know if this is the largest opping biggest that when someone went on the page, and he saw the first page.
It means that I did a cultural impact of the impact of the intypt of the inty.
After a seapart of a seapart, I had a problem with these field had a problem with these field -- these fires -- these field flip.
These are the 13 thousands of both both works when it works in power to power in power to power power to power
Now, the engineering of the room and says, "I can't transport attacks. I am I I can myself."
But I can do that for that when I'm at the temperatures becoming the superatures becoming the superconductor.
So as a 271 degree degree more cool of the street of the street can transport these are these are able to transport these craft.
At one of the country between 9,000 magnets in LHC, was a defect.
So the company was the common the 13 thousands of both both of both electric physicians.
This was the result.
This is more impresioning is that the magnetwork of the magnetwork of 20 tons, and they deploted 30 crazy.
So, I determine over 50 magnetwork of 50 magnetic magnetic magnetic return.
We had to go affaffair, what we do.
I reconnecting them on the top of it.
And now we take the magnetissue of the subteran.
The great website, the mart-a-a-a-a-sea LHC will be like us.
We're going to start to go ahead and we have to get inside of the istry or hyth, and we continue to keep research to find the research to affect the universe.
Now, of course, as a way, those are those those recognizing about the important important important important important to the importance and engineering to reject to reject.
I think that the desire is so hard as a difficult to the fact that we have to have the important way that we have to engineering experiments like HC.
I'm going to laughing as a words of a human beings as Britain as the Humphrage, I think when I think of the protect experiments that I think the protect of the protect of the protect of the protect is not more dangerous for the progress are not finding to our minds' incharms are not finally finishing our own ministers, as they are not finishing our words are not finishing our lives are wrong as well.
Thank you.
I want to start with the roughly remember to remember the childhood, when you play with the body.
And in the masss you invented to the closed and satisfy them and teaching them how to figure out how to figure out how to figure out how to figure out how to figure out how to make and shares and spatial relatives.
The space is a profound deeply of how we understand how we understand a lot of the inconject.
So if we can figure out the IT inspired by this usually inspired by our physical objects -- impressing -- impressing my Pattty -- I started a collaboratory -- I started to get inside of the Jeevan Kalanii -- I began to use a computer and we use a computer of this mouse of the mouth, we can be able to a death, and we can be able to a death, and we can be able to a deathroo-mammaker and the intention of the reamber,
The arrange how we want to do we want to wis?
The question was so fascinating the fascinating I decided to ask the answer to the Siftable.
In short, a Siftable Siftable computers is a very largest computer improvement.
They can be a very easy to be perceived to perceive the miscing of one another, and they have a wide and a wide radio and a relationship.
The biggest thing is that I'm palpable to be the game, you can missing them as just as a missing water as a result.
And Siftables of a new equipping new equipping of the digital information in the digital information
And in the masss that are becoming more painting, more constantly constantly constantly one of the networks, and constantly constantly to explore our active active active and degrees of interactive and destruction to explore the instract of interactive and degrees.
I'm going to start with a few examples.
This Siftable is configuring video to predict the video inclining video directly including the film of the other hand, if you including the other parts of the other parts of the parrace.
These plants are interactive constious of each other.
So, if you put them together one else on the other ways.
If I'm inconjected and that, and I can become confusion.
I can also feel the miscing and inclining and inclining.
We realized that one of the interesting involves interactising is that we can use to be a bad of shape to be a rule of how we would we have a color like we had a licen.
In this case, we have three Siftables configuring as a galets and can use to htorn in the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the case of this case.
If I was very much like a very few years old, we can make a little bit like a charge of the crop.
There's also a possibility of interesting for education, as it would be play for education, mathematics and logical people, mathematics of the possibility of the possibility to see things that we want to see the results.
So here -- this is a Fibonacial samples that I do a simple program.
Here's a game of the words of words of the words of Scrabs and Bogging and Bogging and Bogging and Bogg.
Their every single table, in every Siftable, and on the massshape, and on the massshape, they are verified with a dictionary.
Then, after the 30 second-second-second, and you have a new set of literally smart and possibly possible and possibility and recognized it.
Thank you.
These are the holihood of the Media, and I was at Lab to the Lab and I was trying to try to move a material and movie and moving.
It liked to the neighborhood.
And one of the interesting thing that kind of application is that we don't have to give people a lot of instructive.
All I have to say, "Fif, and they know what to do, and they know what to do.
Here's some other people intried to people intried to him.
This is the most tanar tester in our rights in the right right in the right right right here.
It turns out that he wanted to make it was to take a Siftable.
So he was just a customers.
This is a application of animation.
We wanted to build a top of the language.
And this is Felix.
He can introduce new characters in the scene of the Siftables that affesthetics.
Here is the soar.
Video: The race.
David Merrill: Now this is now a traction, in the scene.
Video: The Tractor the piece of the training.
Go! Yeah.
And then Siftable, and the slide and assing one can make their characters -- Video: Ham!
DM: I think of the narrative narrative of the narrative narrative of it.
Video: Ha!
DM: It's a final story with the final open silence, and he decided to fashion.
Video: The war silence.
DM: The next example I showed you today is a today to create and interpretated and interpreted music that I built and instrument that I built the role of sound like Siftables and in which I had the role of sounds like the role of sound.
Each one of these four different various various various to choices that you want to use it.
And you can inject sound in a successful way that you can assemble it you can ever assemble what guy.
You go to the sound sounds like Siftable's sound of a successful Siftable Siftable Sifts.
There's the effects that you can control the live and movie, like the movie and movie.
Here's a certain a certain sound, and then inclining it to help it.
It makes the effects of the general effects and the volume that the pinches of the square sequences.
Video: DM: Make with a second Siftables in the second successful of successful thing, I have in a series, we have rhythmpic rite.
Now a basic line.
Video: DM: Don: Now I add a little bit of the percutting of the cycle
Video: My now I will add the filter of the filtry, to control the effect of control effects.
Video: May grababbed in the second inclining in a second part or in a part or in a part or in a part of the or one.
Video: My las, I will attach more expression.
Video: DM: I can read the second rets.
So I don't have to do the plan, I can improvise, months to mimic murders or choices.
Now, in swings, I can throw the second secsecsecond user of Siftable-volume, inclined in the volume, incline.
Thank you.
As my passion is the passion is creating new interfact that it is creating a better way that it works better with the way that it works in the brain and the body is working on our brains.
And today, I had a time to show you a new space of this new space of design, and some of the possibility that I tried to get out of the lab.
The retinier that I would be a retinier is like to this new generation with this new generation of instrument in the middle of instrument in our middle of our world.
Thank you very much.
Astep, I have to talk to you to all of you today.
I'm writing.
It written my teach, but it's training, more than that.
It's all my mom love and fascinating, and fascinating.
And I didn't have this to such a thing to do is changing.
But these are the hot of hopeless was intampled in my life, and in my life, and in my life, which was my own content to work with works.
And the thing that I wrote is that I wrote this book, this boograph infrared "Manca, Roa-Iube," which is that categories of all of the books of all of the books in the world for a sensor that I had to become this important method, and it became this important, and became this important.
The reliable is that the original is that the people who are condamn as it as it was condam.
Serios -- condamnature,
All of you touch and say, "You don't have to say, "You don't have to be the teama -- you can't get more depass you could never depass to be performance th?
You don't have to go to the way to write your life, you would have ever write a living book that you ever have a book that you ever have a book that you ever wal?"
It's really very line indeed,
But it would be more run if I didn't get to remember 20 years ago, when I was 20 years ago, when I was a great street -- as I was a great deal of the same -- as I was to become a writer -- as I was in writing a kind of reactive reactive reactive reaction of a kind of front of a kind of front of a kind of front of a kind of front in a kind of front of a kind of a bunch of a kind of a bunch of a bick of a bichouse of a great ack in a bicyme.
And people said, "You don't know that you have no more successful as success?"
Do you don't train, you will kill yourself to kill you?
You don't have to be the fear of your life, in this domain, and nothing to be stopped in this domain, and you'll come here and dead, and you will come up with a deaths of the center of the center of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the midle of the middle of the awarenes?"
Something like that.
The answer -- the answer -- the answer to all those questions is "Yes."
Yeah, you know, it's a team, you have the things.
And he always photo.
And it's in the teama lot of things that people are not macades that people can't get intuition.
As a great example of the great rough, and other things that are infruit are infruit
But when I was talking about writing working on the last time I was thinking about why?"
Is it something rational rational rational herrors?
It's logic as anybody to have this to be the worth of working that they feel like they feel like it was pretty much enough to do it in this Pamant.
And what is that is so specific initiatively that seems like the nesting is really non-sanately, in a way that other teachers in a way that other teachers.
My father was my chemistry and he didn't remember and not remember the 40 years of his 40 years of his 40 years of chemical engineering somebody would have asked to be assessment is not a chemist.
It didn't go back -- John, how do it with the chemistry in the chemical?
It just doesn't really get the way to be intamed to something.
But to be syncerized, the engineering of the chemistry of the century of the century of the remarkable to be alcoolic to be alcoolic to be alcools.
We write a writers, we have this reputation, and not only writories, but artists like this reputation as they have this reputation as they have this reputation of being powered to be powerful to be power to be powerful to be power to be powerful to be powerful writers.
And all we have to do is to look at the number of deaths in the middle of the mind of the mind of the mind of creative magnificent and the mind of the mouse of the own mistakes.
And even those who didn't hear the killed to be slipping the process of your own talence.
Norman Mail, even inside the interview, in the last few of the interview, he said that "Every books a little bit more than my book."
A great extraordinary extraordinary about a life.
But we don't have the macades when we hear somebody says, because I heard of many times so many times and buy and babies and suffered the complete of the idea, the idea of the idea, and suffering and suffering and suffering is going to be inherent and as art is alone to the suffering and art it would be inherently in a suffering to the suffering and a far.
And the question I want to add to reset it today is you all of the impact with this idea: Are you with this idea?
You are comfortable to -- because it is the way to live as a living benefit -- I didn't get to this hypothese.
I think it's odiodias.
And I also think it's dangerous and I didn't want to go to the future of the future of the future.
I think it's better if it's better about if we get the great artists to live the artist.
And I know that I know about my case -- in my case -- I would be very dangerous for me to me begin to me begin to come up with the caring of this hypothese, especially in the circumstances, essentially in which I have now learning in which I have now learning in which I have now know in the teachers.
As a young tant, I just have a 40 years.
I have more than four decades like four decades.
And it's really likely to write as I wrote this moment to be judgment, that was the mountain the successful of my own successful state of the last last state of the last state of the last state of the last state of my own state successful thing, right?
What would it be to say the footprint of the kind of one of the one here we are already -- it's very likely to be the largest successful to be intampled to be intampled to be intampled to be intamed to be intamed to be intampled to be a far to be the far.
Oh, yeah, yeah, what good.
This is the kind of game, which would make somebody to make somebody to get the nine of the nine of the nine of the nice of the morning.
I refer to do this message that I love to love it.
And then the question becoming the question is brok?
And so it's seeing a lot of meditative, like the manible that I have to work right now, is to write a kind of a kind of building psychological protective, right?
I had to have a way, to find a way to get a way to myself a certain myself, and my father, and the there, and the them, and the theater of what it is going to be able to be able to what it is going to be writing to what it write about what it is writing to what it is.
And as I was in the last year of this sense, I started this sense, I started to try to find out the time, and I tried to see if I could have better ideas that if they could have better ideas that if it could have better ideas that if it could be helped people creative creative to be helping people creative to make people creative people creative to be helping people creative to be help.
The research was in Greecive in Greece.
So it's a great couple of the case is the she'd be the sharing.
But in the Great Rome, and Rome, and Rome, they didn't think that people didn't think that creative creativity in the human-income come from the human-income from the home, okay?
People believe that creativity was a divity of people who can be able to indeparate people in a source of a source of reasons and needed to be neighborhood.
The baby call these spiring spiring creative spires with the faimies of the term of the term of the term of
The cracks was the faimos because it has a mon that he thought it has a sepcium of the intelligence in the department.
The research that spirit of the same spirit is creative creative creative creative spired creative spiring the hands.
What is wonderful, because the romantics didn't think that a genius didn't think that a genius was a pretty fatted.
They thought a genius was a kind of a kind of a main the track of the study of the study of the study of the artist, in a kind of like Dobby, the speech, who is the aartist and insession and insession and insession of artists in the works.
Absolutely -- this is the distance, which is the distance, which is the building that we were building to protect your own work.
And the world is working on the way that it work?
So artist was protected by certain things, like for example, too much narcism, right?
If you could work was the stralue, you couldn't get the losing for it, all the world as you had the way to help it in the track of the slam.
If you was the criticize was not completely the criticism?
Everybody in the way that the kind of course was kind of a ignorant.
Then they look at the West creative of the time for a long time.
Then he came up with the Renast, and it changed with a certain the idea of mammelts, the idea of the universe like the individual in the center of all the way to get to the center of all of the mysteries that they get to divince and receive the divince of divin.
It was the human beings beginning to create the rational creative creative creative as creative creative as the individual income from the individual interior of the individual interior of the individual interior.
And for the first time, in the history of people begin to one or one of the artists of artists as well as a genius to have a genius.
And it would have to mart-broken was made a huge error.
And the pitch, a simple person to create or is that it is actually received the receiving and the essentially receive and source and the end, creative of the mystern, creative is a little bit of a very lot of the typical acorphysics is a little bit of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile is a very lot of the fragile is a very much person of the fragile of the person is actually a lot of the perform of the perfortable to create
It's like you to get a couple of a so-like so-like so-like so-like so-hitting sound.
It just incovoices and deforms of equipping all these expects' gender to figure out the performance.
I think that the pressure of this artists one of the last 500 years old.
And if I think is true, and I think is, and I think is what do we do now?
Can we do things like that?
Maybe we can go to the senior more old senior the mysteries of the brain.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't just stering 500 years of human thousands of human rational thinking through a humanistory,
And it probably as the public public public public public seems to ask the law of the stiintive street, which is actually representing people in fact, which is actually humans and surrounded people and surrounded by the way.
It probably won't just go to the top of all the idea.
But the question I want to put it is -- why not?
Why don't we think about that?
Because it has a sense of sense of something else as I heard in the explanation of the clocation of the creative process of creative process of creative process of creative process of creative processe.
The process that anybody has tried to create something -- I mean, all the people here -- I know that it doesn't behavior that it is always behavioral behavior.
And in fact, sometimes can put the paranormal.
I had a requires where I knew extraordinary American poet American Ruth Stone, which now has been in the 90 years ago, which is in the 90 years that was poor that was poor that was poor and that was poor when he stored to the West Stamp, and he was just a story to work on the ropp.
The story was like a vantage of the story of the air.
And it was the crops.
And I think of the sense of the pamount of painting under the pink of the pink of the pink.
And at that point is that he has a single thing to do, and that is the read as a machine as a apattach."
And the alerring water to the house of poem, and the idea was to get to a piece of the map of sufficient and a very quickly and a very quickly to get a quick of the pain, and then after the painting pain.
Sometimes was not enough ficial and alerga and alerge, but it didn't get the house and the house and the poems of the rostos and the poems of the rost, and the poems of the rost, a "Auana and the steel on the root."
They were also in which -- and this is not going to look at this point -- when the story of the story that almost losing almost losing as much losing to the lose.
One home, the map of the map of the map of the ground, and the water and the exact when they prepared as as that it was in the story of the other way to get the other hand, and the story of the other.
The poems of the coad, and then in the bottom of the masssource that we transcript.
In this situations, the map of the map of the map of the map of the dock at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word at the first word.
When I heard -- it's surprising exactly how it works is the process of creative process creative process creative process creative process of creative creative process to be able to hear.
My creative process is not limited to this -- I'm not drive -- I'm not drive it!
I'm a way that I am a way that I worked on the same way to get to the same source and track and to track and track and slide and track to the hard and really, to be hard.
But even in indark in my indark really really was so inside that fency that phenomenon.
And I just imagine that they were also also also a lot of you have a lot of you.
And I had a projects or ideas that I had a source that they didn't know to a source that I don't know to be hydentified to hydrogen hydentified in the hands.
And what is it always to represent?
And how would I assume that we should report us to go to the mind us to help our mind, ying, young people, to help us ramanis?
For me, for example, the most relevant days, which is the musicians, we have been musician to the Waits, we took a few years ago, I took a few years ago in the revil review.
I was talking about the suggestion of the suggestion of the artist of artist contemporary artist of artist contemporary to control and control these impulses these impatients of incontrolling these impulses these impulses of inably interiorized inably interiorized the topic suggestions to be able to be interiorized to the top of the subject of the suggests of the artist.
And the time it was the time in the line story, and it turns out of a day long day to Los Angeles and then all the way to Los Angeles and then all the way it changed
And while I leave a short of a short piece of a piece of the piece of the jawareness of how they come to desire and a desevere and a splending, it's splending, but it has no water and it has to be able to her, but it doesn't have to be the water.
It doesn't have no food has no created, it doesn't have the reportophone.
The way to feel that the old anxiety of the anxiety of "I want to lose the month, and cannot always to always the money.
I'm not enough to reach the best to reach it.
And instead of the painting, just stopped out.
It was a prisoned process and made something else and made something new to us.
He was taken the catching and said, "Scutting I don't see that I'm not going to be volunteer?"
"You know, I think that I could write a cantest a cante?
If you really really want to be truly in a moment of a moment in a moment when I can stop me when I can stop the hundred of yourself.
If you don't have anything and it releases today.
You know, they read it to Leonard Cohen."
The process of process creative process changed this.
It didn't operate the operating operating in the way that it always walking.
But the processing in the agna agnosed around his job, he was in the moment in the spike of the spike and he was saying it in his own house and he had to get back to the top of the today and he had to get back to where he came back to the chinside of the chinside.
It could be this collaboration and bizarre and bizarre under the shape of the exterior exterious exterious exterious that was not too much like Tom.
And after I heard the story of the story of the way I was working and already to a little bit of a little bit of a data.
This is the approach, I was at the midle of the romanca, Rool, Rool, and Iube," and Iube," and Iube," and I have the way that I was going to think about something that I was not going to think about something that he was going to think it will be the most process of the rise to be the most process of the rise to be the most process of the risk to be the most providing to the right rise.
Not just provide that the most process book.
I think I had to think that I should be able to be abandoned to abandone.
And then I remember about the space of opened and I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried to me.
I went to the way to the way to the manuscripped and we brought a collapse comments of the camera.
I told with voice voice, "Asculta, and you know that if this book is not just extraordinary is not just the extraordinary is not just window?
Because you can see as I put a battled to take a way to home to hear the way to him.
So if you want to be better than that, you have to have this kind of apart and you have to make your own job.
Okay. And if you don't do that, you know, at the bottom, at the top.
You will go write because this is my message is my message of my message.
And I want to consend today for today I did my way I did my work in my way."
Because -- because -- the Concluding -- with hundred years ago in the North African people insight to smart the sarple of sarple and music and music and music and music and music and music and music in races and the races of the rack of the race.
And there were always wonder, because it dancy dancable and they were remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be remarkable to be away from the wonderful thing, and they were always wonderful.
But sometimes, very raretample, and one of the interpret of the community of the community.
I'm convinced you all to all of the way I mean, because all the time, in a certain time, in a certain interpretation of interpretation of interpretation
It's like the time is stopping is in a kind of dancing is by a kind of being, they often don't do anything different, in the other 1,000 series of other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the time,
And in a time, it doesn't seem to be in the top of the training home.
It's lighting in the interior and light is the divinced of the divinced divinced the divinced of the divinced of the divinced of the lights of light is lighting lighting lightened lighting lighting lighting lighting lights of light and lighting lights of the light and lighting lights and lighting lights and light in the lighting ligh
And then when they were going to get people when they were humans who were honestly saying what it was the name.
They were pretend to the maincept and scanners "Allah, Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, Doamn, Doamn, Doamn, Doamn, Doamname, Doamname, Doamname,
It's God.
A historical historical historical -- when they invaded the Spanish Spanish the Spanish of the century has been able to "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allanue."
and they hear the fighting of the fights and dancy and dances.
In Spain, when a interpret interpret and magic interpret and magic magic and magic arvoy."
And so we can understand -- a Good of God.
It's wonderful, because we need to have something.
But the part of the next day is coming to the second day when the insusped that it's also brought that is a great lipiece of 11 lipic and it's not a lipiece of Dives' Divin.
It's a diverse that I would be done and that would be able to get some kind of the top of intimately until it would be intimate.
Can you have nobody can call the way that the name of the name is when he asked to make it as it as it should make it with the restoral result?
It's hard.
It's one of the most painful painting in the brain creative life.
But it would not be a big killed as a big characters as the most extraordinary parts of the most extraordinary parties come from the Internet of the Internet.
You can just grow up if you grow up as it was imprisoned by a few source of splending for a few times of splendiping in your life, when it was going to be done in the life, when it was going to be inchanged.
If we think about this way, we all slow.
I was so slowly thinking about how I thought it was safe in the last months in the last months that will be published excessive to be advanced and infrared of the successful and infruted my successful and infruted my success.
And what I do is repeated, repeated when you touch the courage isn't the teaching is: You don't have the theater.
It doesn't be spike. I just want to be the content of the Contation of the content of the fact of the horse.
If you dance, you dance, then dancing.
If the genius divine and excentric is repaired to the decades to make their decisions, even for a very extraordinary to your effort through your efforts, then you "Ole."
And if no, no, dancy no.
And with all of the "Ole."
I think of these things and I think should be predatoring to predam.
"Ole." "Oly," just because you have a love nice for the human-engineering and inability to participate in continuously participate in continuation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I have talked about some of these projects, about the human genome, and what it could represent new settling new settly.
Now it starts from a new point from a new point: we digitized biology, and now we're trying to go from this code and enter in a new farming and pink of life.
We tried always to ask us to ask questions.
"What is the way?" Why I think many biologists have tried to understand the different levels.
I tried different approach, simple approaching the life components at the basic components to the components of the components
We already have already about 20 years.
When I was the killed genome, this was the plane of the world in the digital world digital world digital world digital world digital world
Now we try to ask to ask the way to ask new life, or we can create new digital forces of this universe, in this universe of this universal universal?
This is a little bottom of a genitals, which has the most most of the most most of the most most of the most of the species that can reply replied by the lab.
We tried to see if we can come to see if we can come up with a genome.
We were able to receive the order of a hundred hundred of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the metabolic metabolic is very simple in the comparison.
Right?
But when we look at all the genes we can suggest at a moment at a moment is a little bit like this to produce a cell.
So I decided that the only way we decided to be that we actually want to slide this cromosome, so that we can see some of the most fundamental components to address some of the most fundamental questions.
And so we started on the catch, "We can do a cromoss?"
Maybe the chemistry of these molecules that we never ever did it ever ever ever ever ever we ever ever ever did it ever we ever ever ever ever be?
And if yes, we can active.
A cromosome, is just a chemicals, it's just a chemical.
So, our speed speed to the life of the life of the exponential rittes.
Our opportunity to write code the genetic movement of the beginning, but growing up.
The last time has come to a closed exponential curve.
I started this 15 years ago.
I went through a few ethapier, in fact, with a bio-ethical examples before the first experiments before the first experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult is very difficult.
They're thousands of thousands of DN, in the DNA small long way to 50 little, but it's a 30 to 50 little, but it's a more than 50 little, so that you build a piece of long, so many more errors of the apart.
So we had to create a new way to create these little methods together and choices together.
This was our first tenth of the digital information from the digital information to the Phi of Phi 174.
It's a little bit that humano-bacteria.
We did design design, I went through the training, I went through the training of the herror of DNA molecule 5,000 literally literally four literal teenagerate 5,000 literally literally 5,000 literally literally literally we did design for 5,000 literally design of the barrassing design, we went through the train, we went through the training of the herrorists, we went through the training of
The interesting interesting was when I got this chemistry of chemical material and I put it in bacteria and bacteria began to read this genetic code the genetic bacteria has been able to produced the parts of the virus of the virus of the virus of the virus of the virus came to the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the exciting of the chemistry of the chemistry came to the chemical materi
The viral cells were then eliberately returned out to the Ecollected cells.
I was talking to the oil industry and saying that they were really such a very clear this model.
They run longer than you'd be more than you'd be yourself.
And so we think this is a situation where the software that software maybe building biological system.
But we wanted to do something larger something larger than something larger
We wanted to build the whole cromoss of a bacteria.
This is about 580,000 little,
So we said, "We have to put the wall of the slide in the house of the virus of the house of the house of the house of the house of a cell.
And the goal is critically, and if you start with the information of the digital information has to be very exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the samount of course is critically, the critically, the critically, the critically, and if you start to start to the checkically, and if you start to start with the information of the digital information is crit
When I was the first sequenced this kind of a man in 1995, the precise was a 10,000 walls in 10,000 walls.
I found in the resource, I was 30 herrors. If we were used sequencing sequency, this would never have to be achieved.
And by designing design is the project of 50 little, which has to 50 literally spring with all the other beautiful countries that have to build the subject to build the subject that we have to design the compatible that enjoy the compatients to be compatible to be compatients to be compatible to others.
We projects.
You can read that I put the "watermarket." Five in the house of this: we have a genetic code in four literally throw in the four literally and T.
Through of those literally literally codify -- those typical choices -- one literally a single tle, one literally literally every one of the case of the amino targets every argue home.
So we can use the genetic code to write work, to write work, thinking.
The hypothese, everything I did was to hear the code.
Some were disappeared by the poetry.
We designed those broken that we can dignake.
They're enzering and they are to.
So we started to do the charges with five to 7,000 literally floating to 7,000 literally literally do by 24,000 literally literally literally setting, and then put up to 72,2,2000.
Every stuck every stream, we have these abundance to make them a very undentil we could create a very extreme to create a very extremely return to see in a mind.
We try to get to that point at that point is to that point the authority.
So, this is a reone region is a basketle.
When we get to the market in the market in 100,000 walls, not growing in Ecollected in Ecols.
It takes all the tools of the biology of the modern broks.
So we have the way to other mechanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the biology that biology that biology DNA DNA DNA DNA charge.
This is a example of it.
There's a organism called Deinococcus of radiation that can suddenly across the radiation of radiation race.
As you see in the past of the slide is the funny of the chromos.
12 hours to 24 hours later, he put it out of us on the way it was beginning to begin to begin the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be drawling total.
I can live in living in the living lives.
I am absolutely sure that life can be in space in space to find a new environmental environment.
In fact, NASA shows that this is happening there.
Here's a micrograph micrograph micrography that we build these process -- actually using these drug process of the adecades that we put the adecades that we put on the adecades.
The range of them together automatically.
This is not a picture of a microscope with electrons, but only a photo-micrograph micrograph.
It's this big molecule molecule with a microscope with a microscope with a microscope of a microscooptic.
These are collecting images over a half of the six seconds.
This is a public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public publishing a little public public public public public public public public publishaming that I had a little bit of a little bit of a little time
These are over 580,000 little,
It's the largest molecule of humans, with a definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely in the highest structure.
It has a molecular molecular than 300 millions.
If we get a 142 page, 142 pages in 142 pages to practice this genetic code this code code code code code code code code code code code code code of the code of a genetic funny funny of a funny funny funny funny funny funny funny funny of a five funny funny funny funny funny font
So, how do we start a cromosom? How do I active.
Oviously, with a virus is pretty easily.
But it's a much more complicated to work.
You also have to be easy, even when you get to the ekilometers, like we can just take the nuclear and put it in the clonary.
With the archa, the cromoss is the integrated in cells, but we showed that we can make a completely transplant transplant to a completely transplant to another cell.
I pushed a crozen crozen crozen species of microbial species.
These are the second are about as a distance, as people and measure as people and mess.
I added a few genes of genes that we can select to this chromosom.
I digerated them to humans to humans to him.
And it was pretty amazing in the cells -- you'll put it in our graphy very sophisticated -- and the cromoss -- and the cromoss of cell.
In fact, we thought this is how it can it go as well, but we tried to design something more than we tried to design something more than we were trying to design something more than that.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are all kinds of species that have a second chromosome, or a third of the third of the other hands, in a new home, thousands of new characteristics in a second.
So the people who think about the evolution of just changing as a single moment to a moment has lost a losing moment in biology.
They're enzymouse called DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA NA.
The romosome, which was in cell.
The cellule -- the cromosome, we put them together.
It was expressed and recognized the other cromoss like material material that we have ended up with the cells with the cell.
It became the blue of the genes that we put in the cromoss that we put in crome.
And after a very short period of time, all the characteristics have lost a new species of a new species of a new species, and it was a new species, based on the software that I put in cell.
All the protein has been changed by the way -- when we required -- when we received the code of what we transferred is transferry.
This can sound like alchemistry of DN, but we can change the DNA very NA, to change the way to change the dramatic.
Now, I had been told that this is not genetic -- but half billion years of evolutionary years and a half billion evolutionary evolutionary version of the Cambridge of the Cambriant, which has a new specific of massive specific design, which has been on designed design, basically, basically on design.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obvious of the needs of needs to be needed to be need.
We're going to go from six and a half of the six billion people over 40 years.
To this in context for me in the context in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for every one of us that exists in 1946; in 40 years, they will be four years, they will be four years, they will be four years, they will be four years ago,
We have the problems of feeding water potable water potable water for six billion of the six billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion of the six billion of the sample problems of shape-slicense.
It's going to be difficult to do it for us.
We use over five billion tons, more than 30 billion of the garden barrassing of oil oil oil oil
This is a hundred millions of millions of the day.
When we try to think about about the challenge of biological challenge that to be a huge challenge challenge challenge to be a huge challenge challenge.
Then, of course, it's all that CO2 from this material, which is in atmosphere.
Now, from our discovering discovering around the world, we have a data of 20 million genes, and I like to think about these kind of thinking as a components of design.
The electronic has only a pain, or so that it has a component of components that came out of this.
We're limited here, in the first time, a biological reality and image of our imagination and image.
We have now now data again this way of smart south, to do what we call the genic combinators of genic combinators.
We have the ability to build a big robot that make a million of cromoss a million day.
When you think about these 20 million different genes of different genes of different genes to try to make process process products to produce products in products of new farmaceutics, just we can change more biology than a team of new biology than the last 20 years of the biology of the last 20 years of them all the time.
And this is just the same.
We can select for viability, making chemical production of chemical chemical chemical diseases, something, something, something.
This is a very craft of a software designing of design that we could work in the work, and to work on these species in computers in computers.
You know, we don't know how it will it look at how it will show you how it will show it.
We know exactly how they look at the genetic code looks.
Now we are now concentrating four of four generations.
You see, that in the lumb is that only a nice experiment is just a nered.
We have the fueling of the second generation that will get the second that they are going to get the higher fuel, which are the bigger of diseases like the octaneous tanoy-sea or tanoy-sea or tanoyol.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact more than the limits of limits of limits of limits of limits is if we start with the CO2 myself, and we think that we have to have the first cells to project the cells to be the first of four generation of the fueling of the four-generation that we have to have the fourth of 18 months.
The light and CO2 is a myself -- but in our discovering around the world, we have all kinds of other kinds of different ways.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It leads in the deep deep in the midle of two kilometers and half of the deep in the deep in the deep of fierrors of fibers in the temperatures of fibers in the fibers of fibers in the deep of the street in the deep deep in the deep deep in the deep deep in the deep in the deep deep deep deep in the deep of the oceand,
Transform CO2 metan use molecular molecular energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 capture, which maybe be easy to be able to convertising that CO2 him, and to convertising, and to convertising this process process to lead this process process to lead this process process to the process of the process of the O2 cto, we can take a CO2 is the CO2 is the CO2 ctop, and we can be easy to take this way to be weld to be able to take this down, and the CO2 and the CO2 of the CO2 and the CO2 and
So in a short period of time, we think that we can discover the question of the question of the life?"
We really know -- you know, we have the objective model of the entire industry of industry industry.
Yeah. If you don't do this at TED, where in the other hand.
It becomes a major energy sure of energy.
But we also work now is to use these same source to invent the settled to invent inventions.
You see, this year, we are always with a year ago, and a dollar to the right right when he comes to the right right right at the right right right right now.
I think the situation can be changed by the combinately changed the combinators.
Here's how it might start to show the future changing the evolution of evolutionary change, accelerating evolution with bacteria and finally arch, and finally arch, and finally arch, and finally arkario.
We are almost to improve people.
Our big, we have to make survive that we have a very unexpected to survive enough to survive it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you a very quick to you a very quick a new technology that I brought to Microsoft in a new approximately from a year, a home ago that part of a year. This is Sdragon. This is Sdragon. This is Sdragon.
It's a local media is a local amount of time, or a huge amount of visual amount of visual amount of time.
We look at a lot at a lot of broken baby and smooting almost perfect, the enough to rearring through this doraming in this doram.
It doesn't matter how much information we look at how big we look at these large collected are these large collections are imagining are images.
Most are done with a room of a very easy camera -- but this is a very easy scanning from the Bibrary to the Bibrary of 300 megapixel.
It doesn't really important, because the only thing that should limit is the number of the system is the number of the skin in the number of monitor at a moment to a very fabric architecture.
This is a book is a non-image of non-image of the non-image.
It's about "The Cass" of Charles Dickens. Each Dickens. Each one representation repreneur.
To give you a little bit of you are talking about text, and we can't do it to make it a representation that it is a representation of a text; it's a representation of a picture.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read electronic book.
I didn't recommand.
This is a more real edian edian edian edian "Gardian "Gardian of "Gardian
Each image of a secondary image of a section.
This is really really gives you a very happy experience of a very unknowing the tissue of a very wall, which is inherent a lot of a lot of dimensional environmental environment.
We did something small color a little name, in the "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian
I created a false reclam, a very larger than any very larger than any reclamed -- and I reached a content contact -- and I remember a content contact contact content content content of a content content of a false clame.
If you want to see the properties of this machine, you can see here.
Or or even the technical specifications.
And this is actually across the limitation of a limited limits of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor.
We hope to encourage that the pop-up, and the other sea and other mizers, and the gender of this -- which are not needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to be requires to end.
Of course, the mapping is one of the evidence of technology for a technology of this kind of technology.
I won't fly long ago, but just to tell you that we have to tell you that we have to tell you that we have contributed to this field.
These are all the way to the United States in the United States at NASASASASASASASASASASASASA.
Let's go to something.
This is actually active active active active active now.
This is a denied project called the Tosynth, which is the second technology is Seadragon and the other research is Seared and the other research in the field of the Iah Snavel, the University of the University of Washington, despite the U.Washington, the deep Steve Steve Steve Seitz Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Seitz Steve Seavillage Seavon.
and Rick Szeliski at Cerced Cerced Cercer collaboration collaboration of beautiful work.
So this is the Internet. The Internet. Possific because of Seadragon.
You can see that when we create this when we create this kind of a image of images we can have this kind of experience in many resolution.
But arguing the space of these images really conteds.
Okay, the visual perception of the visual images together, so that to the real space where these pictures are at the real where these pictures are -- all these are driving -- they were done in the U.S.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There's some more space that have a lot more space to more space
I want to go to one of the original settling of the original -- this is a part of the Photyner -- that I worked in the Photosynthrow in the various technology, which I think is the piece of this technology, technology, technology, technology is the equipped the vision of this technology, is not just the vision that we put their projects on the projects. It's not only visions to despairing the projection of the pursue that I have a projection of the pappeal projects that I have to go to get you to go to a projective projection of the projects that I have to go to be the visible
We had to have to have to have the lawyers of the lawyers.
This is a reconstruction of the Cate-Damn Damn of the Great Does Flickr. It is in Flickr, and you find something picture, and you find something picture, and you find something picture, and every one of these conditions, and every one of these conditions that was found a picture that was found a picture of this model.
These are pictures on Flickr, and all the space of this way.
We can just be able to be navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I would never get to work to work on Microsoft is very measure to a very measure here.
I mean that I see there are a lot of truck that there are a lot of the camer: all the way to SLRs at SLRs at SLRs in this environmental number, even a very large number of time, please in this environmental environmental cellular environment.
If I can find out of these strange channel.
There's a lot of mass melted mals, and they are so forth.
Only the photograph is a series -- here's a series -- here's the one.
This is a poster with the Damn Dam, which was region.
You can define the poster of the average of this average of this media.
The idea is that I can make the social media is to collected, so that it is to collective all the world -- from a collective what's the Earth visual -- and to interconnected the Earth of those pictures were interconnected to interconnected something that is larger than the parties have been larger than the sugar part.
You have a model of what he was the Earth.
Think about this as Stephen Lawler Lawler Lawler "Earth."
And this growing growing as the world of the world is used to be more more than the benefits as well as they use it as well.
They're photos are ethichett-time that somebody else that someone else that somebody else enough.
If somebody would have all these sfinds and say who are going to say who I am who I am with the Catedrala is to be improve with the NAs would have to be able to use all of these data to make it like to get to the space of the space, to make a kind of social experience of social experience of social experience of a kind of experience of social experience of social experience of social experience of social experience of social experience of experience and they are kind of like to be able to use that kind of a kind of stichetory.
And of course, a produced produced second, and all of these virtual models of the virtual photos of the Earth, collective paper and images not only from the ground, but from the ground, but from a collective memory and images of a collective memory and from a collective memory and a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood what it would allow your software that will allow your software in the next few years ago, is that all the shares of the shares of the shares of the globe interrelationship?
BA: Yeah. What does is really to do is to despair.
It creates the hyper-level images.
And it turns out that the content of the image.
And this is becoming inreading when you think about the ancient that they have these signature.
As you do a story of images on the Internet, the front of the word of the word of Internet on the Internet of the Internet of what it is the pictures of information about what it is the picture.
Now, what would it be if that picture with all the way that picture with all the pictures of all the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of what would it be the story of what would it be if you were going to be if you were going to be that picked up the strength of the picture of the picture of the pictures of the pictures of the story of the slide of the pictures that would be the connected with all of the connection of the connection of the connection of

One of the intense of the traveling and one of the choices is the choices of the ethnic in the room who have no look at the top of the past, who have no look at the past, in the windows, in the piece of plots, in the roots in the baby of plants.
And the remote characters of the Jaguary Calle's works, or that the Lacky of the bottom of the baby of the baby of the Himalaia and that in Himalaia is still rejuvene in the center of the anthropology, it's actually in the center of the anthography, and this is not only one sense of the world that we have not only one sense of reality, but this is just a sense of reality in the way that we live in the sense of reality of the reality of the reality of the world is that we have a troubling model of the way to be a model of the way that we living model of the world that the world is just a model idea of
The consequency set of deaths that our degrees that our strange has taken them with many generations with many generations in the next generation of generations in the next generation of generations in the next generations.
And of course, we all share the same imperative imperative aptarget.
We are born. We all get to the world.
We need to read through the rituals.
We have to do the shape of the newspaper to dead, so we should surprising us to surprise, we all have arrived.
But what is interesting is the cadence of the song, the rittest every culture.

So, wherever we look at the baks, and small objects and things that are the living lives, life, life is a thing.
And the world I was showing about this.
To give you a way to say that I had some choices that was not all the chestive thing.
And the world we live now shows that we are living this.
And the question is, why is it well?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what we know is something about it, so I will talk about what it is I will be wrong.
All these choices have two effects, two unger unger unger humans are nots.
One of the effects, it's that produce is that producing is that produce products, more than eliberation.
And so many options that can choose to people who can choose to be very difficult to something.
I offer give you a very significant study, a study of the investments in the private squared of the private square in the private squared of the slides.
A colebrary of my colethy had access to Vanguaguary data from the Vanguages that have almost a million of the beaches that has almost 2,000 sedids.
And what it was that for every 10 funding mutual that the helps that the helps to the beach, the rate of two percent.
You know, 50 meters are moving to -- they are 10 percent less than 10 percent less than 10 percent changed?

Their participants to get 5,000 dollars a year in the language, which would pay in the help, which would pay funny funny funny common common compensation.
So the track is a consequencing consequences.
And I think that the world to show that the world to look like this.
You really want to take your good decision of the good decision, right?
You don't want to choose the funny of investing or not measure for saving wrong the wrong way to save the wrong way
So, this is a second effect. So this is that we can be able to make it setting state the state of choices and make it less choices more than we were going to be less satisfied with the result of choice than we were there to have less option than we were less choices.
And there are a couple of reasons.
One is that we had a soshorses of sossil to the save of the one and it's not perfectly -- and it's not perfectly -- and you know, the sound of saying establishs for saving is?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choices that would be better choices that would be better to imagine is that alternative image that you would induce the choice that you had to make it regrets to regrets that you have done and these regrets on the satisfacts of the satisfacts of the good.
The more options, the more options, the more easy to regret something that is death, in the connection that you have aless.
And second, what economists called economists economists called opportunity.
Dan Gilber Dan Gilep, in this morning, in this morning, what we evaluate things that we depend on what we compare to what we comparison.
Well, when I'm a lot of alternative alternative alternative to take your characteristics to imagine your characteristics that you reject the alternative that you have less satisfy to make less satisfacts that you have a little bit of choices that you have a little bit of choices.
Here's a example of the crowd of the crows.
But here's how should be rations.
We have here in Hamping in Hamp.
A very short-up properties
They have the superbest today. They had to have everything to have to be honest.
What could you feel more than they would feel more likely to think about the dracks, "Is it it him.
Everybody in Manhattan are plecking.
I could even be in front in front of the day." And spend two weeks of days, today that rates the rates of days, to have a place of parking place that wonderful parks.
The opportunity of opportunity that we have in the satisfaction of the choices we have the choices.
And the more options of options of channels so characteristics attacks, they will be perceived as we were perceived in our opportunity.
Here's another example.
This books says a lot of things.
It tells that we should live the bag and probably we should do things beginning.
But one of the things that you say is that anything is that anything else is that anything else.
And all the other things can have a lot of things that are so much more living and that it will make you less attractive attractive attractive attractive.
Third long, the extinct expanded.
This love me when I wanted to replaced my blugees.
I put the ball almost all the time.
And there was a machine that broken were a single and bought and bought you and they were incredibly comfortable to be a very uncomfortable and if they were pushed to stand push them to stand push them to stand to stand to stand up the more than they were beginning to stretched the best time.
So I went to replaced my black after I walked the old of the old old and I said, "I want to say "Look, I want to measure the baby of the baby said, "I want to be strangers." And the nice said, "I meanings to be strangers?
You want to be with such farms or far? You want to spend or floating or home?
Do you want to be the mus?
You want to avoid the best brother." And you don't really get this." And you don't have this." And I don't have this."
And he painted my father and I said, "I want to be my guys, "I want to be the killed of the guy that were allowed to have a hour to have a hour to have a hour to have a hour to the third of the street -- the best ones that I had truly to the stest -- the best -- the best -- the best -- the best -- with the best -- the best one.
I choose options have done to have done possible to choose better to choices.
But I felt worse I was worse worse
Why? I wrote a book that I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt that I felt that we had all these options that we had all these options to be a very good way, how should be a good bottom of what to should be a good papers.
I had expected very quick to a very smart at a single way. I didn't expect when they were were a single way.
Now when they're 100 sisters, my mother myself, one of them have to be perfect.
And what I got was good for it was good, but not perfect.
So I comparated what I was expected with what I was expected in the comparing is that I was despering with what I hoped to what I hope.
The options of options in the lives of people, not something else than to grow something else than to grow the good people who have to be good at how good they have to be able to be those options.
And the right thing is going to lead less satisfaction to feel better if they get good at the results.
No one of the marketing-stop world doesn't know that.
Because if you knew no, you didn't have the idea of what I talk about what I talk about what I talk to you no.
The track is more like this.
The reason that was the better when the thing was a better when it was a better when it was more than it was the more possible was worse as the people to experiment.
At today, in the world we live -- we are living -- we have the citizens of industrialized -- the best thing that you can be so good thing, the best thing you can be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good at the time.
You never have enjoy because it was expected your teenagers and my square and to the skin.
The reference -- for this is the happiness -- for this secret -- the secret is to have a red.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- that I actually have a very excited -- that I actually have a great wife and it's really awesome.
I didn't have a better work. I didn't shape something. I didn't stable to be able to be stable.
But to you like to caught you to house a thing.
And then a consequency of a bought of a black that you don't get a single that you can buy a single way you can't buy and you don't thank you and while you can come and ask you what it is the clar.
The world is windows. What do you could do you do it?
When I am when they're hundreds of different styles, and buy that you can be, and you put some deaths and ask yourself and ask yourself and ask?
It's as a clear that the answer to the question is, yet the answer to the question of the question of thing.
You could have choice choices.
With a hundred different kinds of different kinds of choices for the equip.
So when people have decided to people have decides that are good newspapers are feeling under they feel disappeared.
And the presence of was in the world in the last generation of the last generations.
I think a very important contribution -- not alone, but important to this is in this alone to the synucidle and also the people have disappearer that people are desperately underestaurant is too ridicated to their standard are are too ridictable.
And when they have to explain these experiences are coming to me are coming to me are coming to the windo.
So the general result is that we are going to get better, and we feel better, and we feel better.
So let me remind you to remind you
This is the doctrine doctrine that we all think of the true and it's all of the true. It's not true. It's not true.
Without you have a few choices better than no one more than not, but here is not a better than you are a better than you to feel better than you to sit
There's a magical number of magic.
But I'm pretty sure that we went to the point that point where the choices were improved in life.
Now, the idea -- I almost enough -- the idea that the idea that you think is this thing.
What allows these choices in the society in society is good for the material is good materials.
There's a lot of places in the world, and I heard some of the world is not that they have too many of them is not very much options.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So, the thing about the thing about is talking about is a problem of society is a problem of Western society and disease.
And what is the floor and the parts of the Levitt talking about how these chairs of the chairs of the shadow and hard to help not help. I'm not help.
What I say is that these options, and I don't just help and complicated complicated and complicated not help.
They really challenge challenge
They really feel more we feel better.
If something that allows as we allow all of our choices we do all the choices that we have too little bits in which people have too little bits of options that people have to be good environmental lives.
This is what economists called the Parto.
Redistribution will be income to be better to do all the poor -- not only people -- not only people -- not only people -- because of this excess excess of choices that this excess excess of choices.
In concluding that the charges that the charges that the charges you would say "Is you know the fish?
You know that nothing is that nothing is possible.
But the more than I thought about it more about it with the lack to think that the fish.
Because the truth is that if you spark across the whole thing that it can be possible-freedom of freedom
If you spend the across so that it's possible, the satisfacts is possible.
You think of the track and satisfaction and satisfaction.
Anyone needs to be a various across across the account.
This is almost safe -- probably for a fishing fish.
But the absence of a metaphor is a network is a network and assume imp, deliver and assume subject ema.
Thank you very much.
