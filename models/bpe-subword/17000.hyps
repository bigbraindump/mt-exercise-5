The next year, I did a state from LHCCCCCCCC.
And I recognize a and to give you a little bit about how this work.
So the amazing of it. And for those who didn't have been here, LHA is the most experiment that was the most experiment that was the most experiment -- Ciririrird of the 227 hilometers, the South is recreating a hyper-century -- the second of a billion dollars -- a second-year-old dollar samples -- a billion dollars -- a billion dollars --
It's extremely unexpected by run.
This is the city of Genge is the Geneen.
We put these photograph of these wonderful "Big Bangle."
I work on this one. I was a name is called the ATV -- Lac -- Lab the ATV meters -- the meternal hours of the ATASTASTASTAs the ATAs the ATAs the ATAs the Dewner to be able to be able to be able to be improve the improvement.
At 10 sequence I was began to the first time I was began to the first time.
And this image was made by ATV was down.
He asked a car cycles in the room in the room
It's a picture of the first person who was the particular that computer democracy that the U.S. The LH, the U.C.
In other words, when I was saying that image that image that the picture of the set of the shape of the attack that is a successful machine.
I don't know that if that was the most most open-o-o-o-hundred or while it was going on on on and the Google and the first one.
The means I did a culture of cultural impact on the state of the state of the state of the street.
After about a sacred by a sacred with a problem with the water that was a problem of the attention -- these are these -- these are these -- these are these -- these are these -- these are these --
These are the philosophy of the amount of art when it works on the power of the power of the power of the machine.
Now, the ineviting of the safe of the physics and said, "Not the machine and the myself, I can't be a myself-machine.
But I can do this for that when they're coming out of the democracy is becoming the supercoming out of what it was common in the state of the supercome.
So as 27-7-7-7-year-old source of the state of the stories of the story, those are the horrible that they can translate the horse.
At one of the people in the 9,000 people in LC, was a City was a fabrich.
So as the computer was incomfort and the two men and the other men have inside of the research of the electricity.
This was the result of the name.
This is more impressantly research as they are like the 20 state of the second state of 20 minutes, and they recognized 30 percent of it.
So I determined we determine about 50 degree to 50 degree.
We had to do it to go away, which I was looking at it.
I recontent on on the top of the top of it.
And now we now get the inside of the comes in in the northerapist.
The long is the swimming the LHC is the SLHC will be like us.
We will go to the new new and we put it in the hundred or we get to get up or and we'll go to the research and we'll get the research to the universe that are the universe that are the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe is going to be the universe of the new new tool of the new new top.
Now, of course, the intelligent of a kind of representation of representation about the reison about the extremely required and inerties the extreme to the extreme to report it.
I think the rest of the fact that is that the attention, the rest of the fact that we have a good news, this is the experiments of the CHH.
I'm not like our inching words of a word of a stink of a stinary stink of the Davy, I think that the Davy, when I think about the experiments of the Cart of the Michael Fart Farty, "Nimpact of our own own own myself, "Nimpact as we don't have the mind of our minds are not the networks, and the beautiful and our minds are not the such a beautiful st, and are not like our minds."
Thank you.
I want to incept with the ramination of kids to read the kids like to read with the kids like to hundreds of children with the hundreds of hundreds of him.
And the main the engineering to go back to the home, and then they put them together and make them a couple of cycle of how to reach and the resolution and the resolution and the issues of the issues of the issues of the issues.
The perception is the space is a big death, the way from how the world is a big part of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the inconnection.
So I can research in the computer IT respired this inspired by our interaction with our objects -- I have a connection -- I was including Mosathana and the Pattance, and we were using a movement of a computer, and we can use a computer, and we can use a machine that we use a machine that we can use a message, and we can be a machine, and we use a machine and a machine that we can do a machine that we make a machine and the research, and we make a measure that a mouse that we use that we can be a machine, the machine, and make a mouse a myself-mashared butues like like like per-making comfortable to be a mer to be call appeart of int of the mmessage, funded re--ter, if we
So what do we want to do we want to do that?
The question was the asked was the fascinating I decided to research the research to research the Siftal building.
On the Sift Sift is a computer computers is a bridge of a bridge of a bissue.
They can be manufacture, they can perceive the reproduction can perceive the city of the deep and a route and a nature, and a name.
The most important is that I'm such a balthough the couple of games, you can only slightly away.
And Sift example, we have a new ageous appeared by a new long enough to be the digital information of the digital information
The mass of the instrument is actually more constants, more constantly constantly the shape of the alconstantly constantly of the almost until we can get the action of our interactions.
I'm going to incept a simple examples.
This Sift is configuring is confident to imagine a video game, and if you include in a front of the movies of the movies of the movies of the air include in the air including the air including the average of the Sifted.
These are the past of the other interactive of the already.
So if you put them on a language, it became interested in the interesting is becoming a language.
If they're incoming out of the observers are going to be able to become confusion.
And I can feel the present and including and including and inclining.
We went back to one of the implications of the implications of the interaction is like to use the windows is that we could use to use a culture of the time, like I was a cultural psychology.
In the case of this year, we have three Sift that configuring as well-standing and use it in the center of the center of the center where they are going to be used to be away.
If we were too much far too long as a trading in the air in in the air inath.
There are also possible to be interesting for education, like the opportunity for education, the machine, the mathematical and logical the way to be people, and the research things like to be the research things that are the researching things, and research.
So here we -- this is a swimming that is a common that we have a little programs.
This is a game, we have a kind of combination of combination to Scrabs and Bob and Bogging and Bob and Bohar.
The first one in every single state of a speed that one of the Sift of Sift and the massive that I think that are the flower of the degree of the farmed with a bunch of the hyper.
And then the past per paper to the next step on the next to the next step to a new speech and a possible and new possible to the improvement.
Thank you.
These are non-nine who came up in the Media in the Media, and I read the Media, and we recognized a material material.
I love to kned.
And one of the aspects of this kind of applications is not that we don't need to be needed to give them a lot of people.
All right? I have to spend the "Free," and they know what to do.
Here are you going to be people who involved.
This is the most tester story of our flower in our right in the right now.
It seems like everything I wanted to do was to do it was to do it was to do the Sift of the other one.
So for me was just a work.
This is a application of animation is a interaction.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people that instrument for the people who invented
And this is Felx.
He can go to the charges in the state of the Sift of Sift the Sift of the Siftables that the personal of the personal characters.
This is the sound of the sounds of lab.
Video: She rad.
David Merrill: Now this is a track in the state in the state in the state of the state of the stend.
Voice: Trunny common the top of the common
God. Yeah! Yeah.
Miss: Affghancy and assessing one can do the language can do the personal of the interaction -- Video!
DM: We create the narrative and process
Video: Bony --
DM: It's a story with the story of how it will it be fashion how it will be fascinating the same.
Video: The mother: Field!
DM: The U.S. So the example that I was a little bit of a shared and interpretation of created and interpretation that we built the Sift that we built the Sifables that we would build the baby and and the baby and and and the baby and and and the kinds of the babies of the MD:
Each one of these are four different various various stage, you know, you want to use it.
And you can inject the meters of a successful that you can ask the shape, you can do it.
The state is the samples of Sift Sift Sift Sift Sift Sift-up successful machine.
There are effective that you can use the light, like the resistance, and movie.
He's aspect a particular kind of a name and then I was a measure.
The machine of the general states like the flower that the degrees that are amazing the He'll see it.
Video: We want to incept in the Sift in the Sift of Sift in a successful thing, a series, a funny expected home.
Now a little bit of it.
Video: Now DM: Now I add a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the degree.
Video: And now I'm going to add the filter of the film in the movement of the light to control the light.
Video: DM: You can reclinical second the second including the including in a part or in a part or in a part or in a part of it.
Video: I want to attract for the movie for more expression.
Video: I can do the second time to do the second time in the city of while I was going to be a minute.
So I don't have to do the plane in the presence of the long or of the long or baloge.
Now, in the sfarmited to be able to use the second second user to use the Sift of Sift the Sift of the common in the state of the common in the state of the shape of the common in the state of the shape, in the step, in the swimp, in the shape, in the sfarmited in the sfarmited in the sfarmit
Thank you.
As a way that my brain is creating new computers is creating the computer that is the more computer that works in our brain and our brain and our body of our brains and our body body and our body body and our body body and our body body and the brain.
And so we had time to show you a cock of this research of this research and a cloud, and the way we wanted to go to the possibilities that we recognize to the laborators that we were in the laboratory.
The Gand's that I think that we are like the farm is that we are like this is like the new generation of the instrument of the interaction of the interaction of the world's digital respect of our world of our world in our world of our world of our world of our world of our world of our world of our world world of our world of our world of our lives.
Thank you very much.
Aststeps with all of you talking to talk to you with yourself.
They're writing
He wrote the chart is a lot of my teacher and it's more attracted to the attracted
It's all my mother was my mother and fascinating a vision of a vision of a vision of a vision of a vision of a vision of a vision.
And I didn't think that this is that that this is what it means to do it.
But this is the physical weapond, something that was intuition and the movement and the book and the book was my own intuition to my own intuition with my own intuition with my own light with my own light.
And the way I wrote is that I wrote this charge of the handle "Manco CManco Rot Cam, Rotypical of the history of the world, the third of the world, and the rest of the world, and the rest of the world, and the reason for a very special sense of the type of the sensition of the world.
The first is that the state is that the people who go back to the attention of the attrack.
Seriids -- I conamong the coname!
I was in examples and improvement and impact is "Where is not you remember is not a streaming that you could never be more to be the performance of the performance of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of the form of examples of the farmers of examples of the examples of examples of examples of the examples of the examples of the top of the top of the examples of the for example.
Do you don't have the story of you wouldn't go to write a lot of the state of the mother of the state of the world that would be a little bit of the world that would be a little bit of the world that would be the world?"
It's very long enough to be the inside of the inside of it.
But it would be more if they don't have a little bit of now, I would have a 20 years, when I was inceived by the number of people -- I was going to be a big time -- I was going to be a little bit of the same myself, I want to be a little bit of reaction of reaction of reaction of reaction of reaction of reaction of reaction of reactive reaction of reaction of reaction of reaction of reaction of reacted if you a little bit of reaction of reacting on on the same way of reaction of reaction of reactive reaction of reaction of reac

Do you don't go like my humans will be a little bit of the ideas will be a little ide?
Do you are not the fragile you are working in this enough, and nothing that is not going to be there, and nothing to do is not going to be a paper with a paper with a machine of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the hy?"
Don't this gene that this gene.
The such such -- the case of the question of the questions of the questions of those ins."
Yes, you know, it's a teaching of all of those things.
And always I always hold me me a step.
And you know, it's a little bit of the things that people who are not going to be a lot of other things that they can be intuition.
As examples of the galazing things that are infrastructure.
But when it's about the word I was talking about the word that I was working on the last question I was "What?
Is something like this?
It's the Brazy that somebody to be able to be a team that I feel like that they were very steping that they were very well to do this on this Pame.
And what is the specific initions of creative creative as we seem like nature, is truths like the window in a way that other people don't do a kind of religion that other people don't do a kind of death?
My failure, for example, was inching and not immediately remember of the 40 years of you have a hundred years of the inery of the inery of the inequally inequally inequired by the inchemistry of the immediately.
It didn't intamed -- John, how do I go with the state in the inery of the eye of the eye of the eye of the eye of the eye of the eye of the eye of the eye of the eye of the eye of the eye of the eye of windoctam.
I just don't have intampled me not intam.
But we just like to be the chemistry as far as a couple of groups of the second of the second of the centuries of the centuries of the oil of the oils of the oil of the oil of the oceans.
We are dependent insult that we have this remarkable and not only reported the other things, but the artists of all of these things, they have this remarkable to be powerful as to be powerful to be powerful to be powerful.
And all of the way we do is is to look at the number of restrict the number of the second of 20, in the 20th century, which have been restricted by the mind of the mind of the mind of the process of the process of the process of the message.
And even the same thing that didn't go to the provide to be truthly to be truth.
Norman Mail, even though it was including my interviews, he said that the "On of my books, he said to me a longer longer more,
A big challenge of the mountain a vision of a vision of a vision of a vision of a vision of a vision of a visual vision.
But it doesn't mack when we didn't like someone sayonce someone says, that we heard so many times that we heard so many times and accept and accept the idea of things like the idea that the idea that the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the funny of the farmers of the farmers of the target, and the definite of the farms of the shape,
And the question I want to address this guy here, you know, you are all the ty: you are all with this idea.
You are comfortable to the comfortable -- because it doesn't work, because I didn't look at the eye -- I didn't look at this photograph.
I think it's odied.
And I also think it's perfectly and not just like to go to the future out the future.
I think it's better if we involved us to report our artists to live to listen to the artist it.
And I stopped with my case in my home -- in my situation -- it would be very perfectly for me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me the history of the teachers that I was now where I was now now where I was now now now that I was now now that I was now now now that I was now now now that I was now now that I was now with the teaching that I was now with the teaching of the top that I was a situation with the hundred of the exciting with the top of the top of the p,
As example, I'm just very clear to 40 years.
I have probably because four as a long way to look at the mountains.
And it's very probably like I would write a whole time I was going to be a judgment, the movement of the movement of the last machine of my own own own own own silence, the last year?
What would would be a little bit of the machine for a kind of like the people here are very simple -- it's very probably the most successful friends -- it's probably the most successful of my most successful to be independent on the most successful to be independent on the most successful thing that would be a big different.
Oh, Does that well.
This is the gene of gas if someone could do someone else in the city of the type of the 99 deeply of the city of the person wouldn't go to that the person to that the person walking that person would.
I refer to do this in the message that I love that a lot.
And I know the question is, the question of it?
And so I hope that I hope a lot of farmy, like the manian that we need to work on the shape to go back to the amazing of a kind of building a kind of building a kind of building a kind of rule that the protection of the protection of the protection of my hy?
I have to get a way to define a way to get a funny of a fantastic smoke, and the whole that was the natural of the natural that would be the natural to the natural that will be now reaction to what I was going to be now to be now to what I was going to be able to reactive what I was going to be reactive to the doctor,
And as I was all in the last year, I was inceived this sense of the brain in and I was inceived the time, and I researched the other societies of how we can help us be more ideas to be more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more emotional to be more about how the brain is to be the brain to be the opportunities of the emotional expecting of the emotional to the brain in the brain in to be re-of-the-the-the--the-o-o-the-the-the-the
Compt this was in Great and Romantic and Romantic and Romantic Romantic Romantic Romantic Romantic Romantic Romantic Great the Greeection of this alternative Certtorial Certttal of this story of this alternative alternative that was the determination of this type of this situation of this type of this such a share's determining that this mitself that was a was a sea level of this was a was a and Romant.
So the opposite of the city of the city of the inch.
But I want to Great Great and Romantic and Romantic and Romoks, the Invention of the interial interial of the interior of the interial interial interial of the interial interial of the interior of the interistry of Great Romowin the Green go, but in the Green Romo's rever, but I was a researching of Greek research and the Great Great the Great Rom.
People believe that creativity was a spirit was a spiring that they are stories in a horrible to a surprising and understanding and our intelligent and understanding and the ability to be the research and our intelligent people and understand the reason for the table.
Good called these are called the diseases of creative creative to the frames of the democracy.
Scott was the nurses for that a demon that is a such democracy.
The rest were the same machine were the same number of creative creative creative creative creative ary, the genial history,
What is wonderful, because the romans, because a genius didn't think that a genius was a genius was a genius of the genies of the genies of the genies of the genies of the genies of the death of what the deeply is the once that is wonderful, which is the nothing that is wonderful, which is that the mindsuch that is wonderful,
I respect like a genius was a kind of a kind of a deeply of the inside of the innovation of the artist, the Dobbe, the inner of Dobbe, which is the Dobbridge and inevitable of the movement of the movement of the movement of the movement of the movement of the mountain the works.
Absolutely the staled -- it's the right thing that is the future, that we were building -- that we have the result that we all have the result of the results of the results of the work.
And everything that was working on the word work?
So the artist of all, the anti-protected things, like for example, like a lot of narrates like this?
If the work that was a stalong was not the strong-term didn't go for the street for the world that the world that you can help that the state of that genius that help that help us to help that help us to help that help.
If the work that was criticisms was not completely uncomfort?
All the world that the genius was the north.
So they look at the Vality of the Vian creative long ago in time.
And then the Rathon and all of Rensian has changed with a particular machine that the idea of the idea of the idea of the universe, the idea of the universe, the U.S. The world of the universe that the first of the universe that the first of the first mistakes, the first person who are the first mistakes.
It was incept the human beings and people incept the people incept that creativity to create the interial of the Cide of the Cide of the individual common in the interial Country of the Cidynamic intuition of the individual innovation was inceptional innovation was inct of human beginning to the human beginning of human human beings.
And for the first one of the story of people incepted to the artists of the artists of artists in the artists of the genius.
And we need to be a chart that I think it was a message.
People house of a simple person, a simple person, to create or is actually received the received, and the shape and the source and the meternal meternal machine, the four percent of the typical machines of the history of the typical myself.
It's like you to get a couple of hita to the sound to the sound to the sound of hite.
She just simply the incode and deforming and the gene and gene all these kinds of these kinds of these kinds of the performance.
I think that the president of this types of one year.
Now, if you think about is true, and I think that the is: what do you do you do that?
Can we do things like this?
Maybe we all inside our sensities of the people and the rest of the people and the messages of people and the message.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't just be a few years ago, we just five years ago, the human research in a 18 minutes of a 18 minutes.
And I probably like the people in the audience that would be absolutely asked us to the question of the questions that the people in fact, which is the people who are in the next few people in the projects of the projects.
I just like to be that I don't want to coot this idea.
But the question I want to give you a phase -- what is no?
Why we don't we think about this in the way?
For as a lot of like something else that every single thing I heard about what we just explicity-couple of the innovation of the process of the processes.
The reason that somebody who was going to create something -- really, that is a little bit of the people here -- the state of the -- the state of the innovation.
Now, in fact, you know, maybe some depending on the descript of the anti-degree.
I was a research where I met a speed where I met the steel of Rutch Stone, which is now in the 90 years ago, which was in the 90 years and the page, which was that the story, and that was a kid to the Stage and the Stage and the Stage and the State and the shape of the state and a simple and a simple and a little bit of a simple and a simple and a simple and a simple and a similar to be a similar and a simple hino innovation of the beautiful,
The story was like a various stop of the air of air.
And it turns out the room on the roots of the roots of the roots of the roots.
And the sense of the independent on the pampic paper peared on the past of the pain.
In that moment that the moment that is a single thing that is read and "Ole," and I read that the water "
And the galgorithm to hold the house of home, and intuition was to go to a little bit of a bunch of the history of the history of the history of the fish.
Sometimes didn't enjoy the fast of the algorithm and algoritha, but not the game, and the couple of homoil and the couple of heroges and the machine and the history of the history of "Once a story of "Onakay, a little step.
They were the moment in which -- and the one that -- and the point -- and the moment that the story -- the moment that the story that the story of the balance.
Algame, the game, and the map of the movement and the city and the south of the exactly when it was indeed by the way, and the story of the allows to the otherwise and the otherwise and the detail.
The first city of cooking and the trage, and then in the body in the book on the main the main the massive of the massive to the massive to the massive the mass?
So in these situation, the story of the main the middle of the farmers and the intype, but the first one, at the first one.
When I heard -- it's immediately the exactly how I work was exactly how I work on my own own production.
My creative creative creative is not the limited -- I'm not run to this -- I'm not run a well.
I'm a way that I work, and so I work on the past that I was working on every day at the same same conspired and and to go back and sleeping and shared to the stretched and sleep.
But even though it was in my hands, even I was intended to be intended to be intended to be intended to that the fish.
And I just imagine that they were like to yourself.
And I was going to project or ideas that I was going to have my own hands-up that I didn't know it wouldn't go to to to it.
And what do you have to do this?
And how do you have to do that we should be reported to us to get out of us not lost us to do our bers, and I would not help us us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to recognitive us to releas?
For example, the most relevant of our days, which we have about how we all have the Maita's Waite, we took a computer in the Waith a few years ago, and he was a few years ago.
I was about the susufficient that was almost everything was almost everything that was almost common the artist of the modern of the modern of the modern of the common and to control these improvements of the improvements.
The time of language, and immediately immediately, and improve from a day day on the Sos of the Schools and everything else change.
While by a time in a fragile of a frager in a fragt of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the mind of the machine and the dependent of the samples of the sample, but it is not a paper and a shared and how to do it to be a whole whole no, but it doesn't have a whole whole whole no.
It doesn't have no longer under the history isn't creating no report report
And the way to feel that the team of the anxiety of creating "Take this is "to go to a barrier for a money for the money for the money for the money for the already.
I'm not sure the good, I am to read it.
And the place to get to a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
He was the intuition and do something that with something that we all all kinds and all of the new new and all the new thing.
He was looking at the shape of the shared and said, "Soud, you don't see that are not going to be in the volatt?"
"Do you have a step to write a cancer for a cancer for a cance?
If you really want to truth, you know, there are inside of a moment when you can go back to a little bit of home, when you can go to the hundred him.
If you were now, and the comes and delivers on something else.
Dudgments and the comes on the Leonard Cohend."
The democracy has changed this changed that this has changed this.
Not the cool of the streets of intunny as a way that I was always like this.
But the way to get the aggressive and the aggam, and it was in the moment, he was the moment that he was the point of the state of what he saw and he saw it and he was just a humans and he would not only be invented to the state of the inneeds to be something like something that we didn't have something to be something like something to be something that we don't have something to be something like something that we don't have something to be something like something to be something to be something to be something to be something to be something like something like something like something like something like something to be something to be something to be something to be something to be something to be something to be something like something to be something to
It could be this collaboration and bize the bization and bize the conversation of a conversation of a conversation that was not too much as the Tom, which wasn't too much like Tom.
After I heard I heard the story of the story that I was working on a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a moment.
This is the approached me when I was at the middle of "Manco Cancy, Rovan Immmmyself, "Mandel Imms that we were working on a kind of a kind of a kind of a little bit of a little bit of a network that it would be a little bit of a little bit of a nice that would be a be, this is going to be a little bit of a common to be a little bit of a nice that is going to be a little bit of a network.
Not just that the most process of the bottom of the news.
We were able to think about that I should be a little bit like to abandoned and simple project.
And I was innovation on the Earth's talking about and I was researched and I was indeed and I was indeed and I was indeed and I was indeed and I was inture."
I was looking at the time on the movement and I decided to move a computer and I brought a collection of a collapse.
I told you with your hand: "Aste," and I was standing and I was not just like this is not just that the case is not just that it doesn't just the name is not only my favorite well?
Because you can see that I just see a long time I was going to go back to the handle in and more than I was not a step.
So if you want to be more than they would be more attracted to do the water and you have to do the stretching the streets of the streets of the hands.
Okay, if you don't want to do that, at least anything else's non-to-driven with it.
So I want to write because this is my message.
And I want to do this for these today's working on my head of my home."
Because -- because -- the CCA, the City -- with the hundreds of years ago, in the North African innovation of North African hours and the months and the months and the months in the hour, and the muscle in the long one.
And there were always always to deal with the teachers were teachers and were remarkable to remarkable and they were remarkable, right?
But although it was very until something intample, and one of the interpresident, and one of the community of community.
I'm convinced that all of the tunning, because everything I do about what all the time, in a particular moment, in a particular moment, so that a moment, so that a moment of interaction,
It's like the time that time is the opens and the sample is a kind of silence, you don't do anything different, you know, in other countries, in other countries, the other history of the other history.
And in a time that it would not be in the past of the game.
It's the world of the world and the world is amazing and the world.
And then when they were intamples when people standing people who were able to say that they were called the named named the number of them.
And it was impressed and incept the "Ole, Allam, Allam, Allam, Donams, Donams, Donams, Dones."
It's God.
A degree of interesting -- when the Street -- when they invented the Street Sail, they went with this object of this century in "Alland, Alland, "Alland, Alland, "Alland, Alland, "Alland, Allane."
and it comes like the time with the purpose and sleeping and depends and depends on the cooks.
In Spania, when a reuse, a nice of reused something impossible and the main "Allammed "Alland, Alland, the Alland, the Alland, the Found."
The intelligent -- a network -- a nurse.
It's mindly, because we need to do something like this.
But the second thing that is the second second the immediately suspended on the insushing that is the sounds of the sushing and not a bunch of Diff, and not just a bunch of Diff.
It's a machine that liminal laptop and that you could never be more than they could never be more than the intimive to be more than the intimalist.
Could you be nothing that the Great at the Domnal Domnal Great at the time that they should do it with the rest of the rest of the rest of the world?
It's hard.
It's one of the most common in the most common in the vision of creative creative creative creative creative awareness.
But maybe it would not a big choice of the attracted to be creating that the most extraordinary inceive as the most extraordinary of the Internet.
Maybe if you have a simple and it was impressed as a measure of a shadow for a long time for a moment to the point of the degrees of the next time that the next time that the next time of the time, when the moment of the moment of the moment of the moment of the moment.
If we think about it, we all kinds of ways, everything else.
I was inceived to think about it, and I thought about the last months in the last months that will be published in the last thing that will be addict that it would be address and infrastructure, and infrastructure, and the infrastructure.
And what we do, the research on the frameword on the state of the is: "You don't have the amazing.
Not the hospe. You know, and you just read the Count of the Count to be able to go to the top of the streets would be it.
If you are the state of the samples of it.
If the genius of the dival and expected the center is removement to get the extraordinary to a decades, even for a smoke, and for a hands."
And if you don't have notice anyone else in the hormous one.
And with these "Once "On" for you."
I think these things and I think that we should read it.
"Once you want to do it, just for you to be a stagot for a story and the capacity to be the incenter of the machine.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just Cohen: Onna: Onna!
We speak about some projects of these projects, and what it could be representing and representation of new discoveries of the genes.
Now in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, we digitized by a biology, and now we tried to this code and we try to go to a new fluid and the future of the form of life, and the form of life.
We tried all the time, we tried to ask us questions.
"What is the life is I think that many people tried to understand the biology of the diverse of the diverse of the diverse of the versus of the versus of the versus of the versus of the world.
We tried to different approach to the component of the component of the computer of the computer of the common
We define dependent on the second of 20 years.
When I was the Comped this year, this was this long agenoges in the world in the world in the world in the world.
So we try to ask question: can we regenerate our own life, or we can create new forms of life, in this universe in this versus of lifely?
This is the map of a microscope, Mycooks, which is the most gene that the most gene that the most species that can recognize the only way to remaining the only one of the most important in the laboratory.
We tried to see if we can see if we can come up with a gene and more small.
We had been able to get the first city of a hundreds of genes in the country that are there.
But when we look at the mass of making a simple metabolic comparison to our comparison to our comparison.
The research is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can suggesting the moment is a little bit of a moment that is a little bit of the cell.
So we decided that the only way that we actually actually actually actually to read this is to read this cross-deep coming to see the component to the most questions to be the most questions of the most questions of questions.
And so we started on the body, "We can read a cross?"
Could you have the chemical chemical molecules that we didn't have too much that we didn't have before we didn't have before we did not have before we did not have before we did not have before.
And if we can active?
A cross-couple of homos, is just a little bit of material material.
So our speed to the digitized by the life of life, he created at a ritself.
Our trading to write a code that is a cool that is a very beginning.
The next time I got to a funny appeared to a fun.
I started this talking about 15 years.
We went through a few paper, the inside of a future, in fact, before you do the first time to do the first experiment.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult.
These are machines of machines in the world, the May that I do a lot of the DNA 30 to 50 percent of the DNA is a process of the degeneration of a long time, so that you build a lot more month, so that you can build a long time.
So we had to create a new new to create a new way to do these little little little and the cooks.
This was our first step, our first step, the computer in the digital information to the detail.
It's a virus that move the gene of the bacteria.
We made the charge of the mountains, I went through the coocies, and we have a molecule of DNA molecule of DNA 50,000 dollars.
The interesting interesting when I was a little bit when I was a chemical chemical material and I went to the bacterial with the genetic material to read this cover of the genetics, and the virtual disease of the viruses of the viruses of the virtual art of the virtual interesting of the deair of the interesting of the interesting interesting of the interesting of the interesting interesting of the interesting of the interesting interesting interesting of the interesting of the
The viral diseases were then in the cells were then and they swimming and they were able to go out and have the cells of Eco.
I was brother's movement with the cooler and the reason and the reason that we understand this model.
They have a lot more than you do.
And so we think that this is a situation where the software that the software to build a system in a system in a biological system in a biological system of biological system.
But we wanted to do something more than that.
We wanted to build the cromoss of a gene of a gene of a game of a bacteria.
This is about 50,000 gardens of cognizing cognizes
So we said to make the U.S. We were in the houses in the houses of the virus of the virus of the machines of a handle of a hydrockets that are component of a network.
The object is critically, and if the information of information in the computer of the computer news, that information has to be very exactly the information of the computer.
When I was the first seven-seen speed in 1995, the standard was in the precious handle in 10,000 per paper in 10,000 ps.
We found in the urppose of allows to be used to use the second onds of along the second story, this was not used to be able to be able to be able to be able to be access to be across the same across that never achieved to be access to be across the urppose of the urpppose of the urppose of the urpppose of the resourceptorright.
The design is designing is designing of the long time, which is the long time, which is that we need to be able to get the other countries to build the other countries to build the other countries to build the other ones of the Diffs with the other hundreds of the Divers.
We are allowed by the way.
Maybe you can read "Oh the house "Greey. We have a cool of the house of the genetic code in four genetic code in four hands: All right, "The T.
Triges from those numbers -- those number ber of 20 amount of 20 amount of 20 amino achievement -- one of the case of the history of the history of the history.
So we can use the genetic genetic code to write a story of the streets of the streets of the poverty.
An the way, all we did all was to hold me that we did the code of the code of the history.
Some of them were not allowed that it's not a good news.
We projected these little little benefits.
These are the enzy that we reduce it.
So we started to do the funny with five to five to the 7,000 dollars to be able to do the next 24,000 dollars to do this for the 24,000 dollars in this way, and then then the other hydrogen to 70.
At every photographed these little baby that is the convention, and we can see, to make a process to create a process of a process of a mind -- as you see a mind -- as you see a mind.
We can go to the point that point that the point of automatic point of automatic point.
So this is a team of a report of the network.
When we go to the top of 100,000 per paintings of the speech of the speech of the Europe.
They are all the beautiful molecules of molecules of molecule.
So we went to the other mechanisms.
We know that there is a mechanism called the recombination called the DNA that are used to read the DNA DNA DNA and that would be able to reach out of the baby.
This is a example.
There are a charity called Deinoges called Deinogan that can survive millions of run millions of run away from the radiation.
So as you see in the past of the silence is the cross-source is district in the way.
12 hours later, he sent hource he led me a laser in the other as.
We have a machine that can do that.
These organisms can be recognize it.
I can live in the vision of the vision of it.
I am absolutely that the life can be in the extract of the extract of the extracted to find a new environmental environment.
In fact, NASA has been death.
This is a microphone that we build a molecule that we built these process process -- actually actually use these mechanisms of design management with design design that we put it on the design of design.
Drodio they put them together automatically automatically.
This is not a little bit of a microscope with electrons, but just a little bit of electronic cooks, but just a little bit of a little bit of the microphrase
It's a molecule, as we can see a microsroscope to see a microscope with a microscooks.
These are the image of a collective homework on a fascinating five second.
This is a common that I was a little bit now a little bit of time.
These are 50,000 dollars of cooking code the genetic cognize of cognized.
It's the biggest molecules were going to be a structure of a structure of a structure of a structure of a structure of the structure.
It's a molecules of 300 million in 300 million miles of million.
If we have a funny of a 142 pages, 142 pages, 142 pages to remember this cognize cockets.
So how do we go to a cross? How do you see?
Abvidly, with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's a lot more complicated with the bacteria.
And I also also although it was more when you get to the new way that we just don't just get to go and get to a little bit and put it on the other hand, and that all of you heard about it, and that all of you heard about it, and that all of you heard about it.
The bacterial archases, the cross-cells, but we argue it is the flower and we arrived that we can do a cross-cross-the-in a cell-cells and we can do it.
We pursue a crowd from one species from one species in the microbial microbial range of microbial microbial microbial range.
These are the second of the second way to do the way that people and the couple and the city and the city and the couple of people and the couple of people and the couple of the hands.
We add a few genes of genes that we can get to the cross-chared for this cross-the-
We diggerates to the enzy to have all proteins.
And it was pretty much when I put it in the cells -- you'll put our future, you will be the software -- and the cross-cells -- and the cross-shaped such as the cell.
In fact, we thought this is how this is that the democracy, but we tried to project something more democracy.
This is a mechanism most of the evolution.
We are all all the way that they were always that they were able to a second the second cross-year cycle of the past of the other history of respect in a secondly.
So the people who think about the evolution of evolution as a single death, and they were long to a lot of the biology.
They're the hundreds of restrict of restrict DNA DNA DN.
The Comoscial that was in the cell.
The cells -- the cross-that we put on --
It was expressed and recognition as the other hands like the land to be driven to the cells of the cells of the cells of the cell.
It became the garden, the gene that we put in the cross-in cross-chair.
And after a very beautiful time, all of the time, all of a species of a species of a species of a new species of a new species of a new species that we put on the software that we put on the software that we put on the bottom that we put on the body.
All the proteins were changing the membranes -- when the genetic -- when we transferred the genetic code is exactly what we transfer.
This can be like the game of genomics, but it can be a fluid mutation to change the DNA is quite change.
Now, I was not that this is not that this is not the gene -- but it was building three billion years old, and we have a half a million years old, and we can be a new new new new appeared by the Cambridge of Cambridge of the Cambridge of a new specific planets a new specific species of the species of a new specific species of the species of a new specific species of the specific --
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty close to the point of the point of the news of needs
We are on the south, and half a billion people in the new hundreds of years ago.
As a way to me this in the context for me in 1946.
Now I'm three people on the planet for every new land, in 46; in 46; they would be four years later.
We have the problem is funny of the stability to be sleeping the city of the couple of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of and half millions of millions of millions of billion and the problem.
It would be divided to do for us.
We are all over five billion hundreds of hundreds of millions of millions of millions of millions of flight source.
This means that a million barbarbarbarbars.
When we try to think about the process of the biological process that process to any process that will be a check that will be a check that will be a check of process that will be a check of process that means.
And then of course, it's all that the CO2 in the CO2 in the atmosphere.
Now, our discovering discovery of our world, we have a bunch of the world, and I love to me a young hundred millions of the design of the design of design.
The electronics has just a common or that is just a common or whatever the diverse that was diverse that he was in this country.
We are the limitations here, in the first time of a reality and image of a reality and image our imagination.
We have now now now now that the time, the rest of these shape, to do what we call that we call the genual chemicals that the genemicals of the genimics.
We have a big ability to build a big robot that to do a big microsomoes that are running on the day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of these 20 million genes of genes or to try to reach the optimism of producing process to produce the channel of a hundreds of years ago, the last 20 years, we can only change a little bit more hydrogen than a lot more than a lot of the last 20 years,
And this is just just the standard standard of the standard.
We can change the improve for the computer power or common or or computers, or producing the computers,
This is a shape of a route of a software to a future, to be able to do these in the species that we work in the energy of the species in the computer.
You know, we don't know how to show you how to show you a little bit like this.
We know how they arrived, they look like the genetics.
Now we are now to four shape four generation.
You saw that in the humans that in the etery is just a experiment is just a experiment of the experiment is just a experiment experiment
We have the common the second generation of generation and the third of the past and the past that are amazing the funny of the history of the hypothese, or the hydrogen or the hypothese.
But the only way we think that biology can have a lot of more than a lot more more than the rest of the state of the limitation of the U.S. And we start with the CO2 as a Covil to project, and we think that we can be the first general for the growth of the ground in the four handle in the four hours of four months of the four months of four months of the four months of the four months of the four month.
The Burban and CO2 is a -- but in our world, but in our world.
This is a organism that I remember the City I remember in 1996.
The labs in the city of the oceans, by two kilometers and half a humans and half the degrees of the degrees of the farmers of the herbarbags.
Transwer CO2 in a metaphydrogen as as a molecule of energy.
We can see if we can see if we can take the CO2 cto, which can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to convert that CO2 in the computer to the common to the common to the conduct this process process to the common to the common to see this process that process to see this process to see the process to see the process to see if we can see if we get this process to see if we can see the CO2 to see if we can see the CO2 and see if we can be the the COOOO2 and see if we can see
So in a period of time, we think that we can move to the question of what is the question of the baby?"
We really know -- you know, you know, we have objective model to the entire industry of the entire industry of the stopp.
Don't do that you don't do this at TED, where you come to the other on?
Let's becoming a lot of energy to be a network.
But we also work now now now to use these same way to use these across the same invention to be able to achieved.
So you saw this with this year, we are always always in the urpose of a year, and a dollar in the mind of the four house of the future.
I think that the situation can be changed by the combination can be changing anything to do to be changing anything to be changing anything else.
Here's how it could be able to show up to the future of changing the architecture now with the brain with the brain with the bacteria of the brain with the stretch, the art of the history.
We are almost to get people.
Our reason is just to make us just to make us sure that we have a survival to survive that we can do that. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
What I want to show to you a little bit more exciting about the most aware a new new new technology that I added a new technology that I was a new new new technology that I was a history about a year.
It's a media that can be the local that can be the local of a big democracy.
We look at a lot of many times of you can be a digital and the machine and the flower and the funny and the future, the land, the reart of the typical message.
Not the way to do it in how many of us is how much of the largest or how the largest or how the largest images.
Most of the rest are the state of a camera was digital with a camera at the Bible for the Bivil Congress, the Congress of the Bield Congress to 300 metaphors.
It doesn't really important, because the only thing that should be limited to a system to be the number of a number of your monitor of the monitor of a moment of your monitor a very future. It's also a very future.
This is a book is a non-example of a non-teaching example.
It's about "Cash of "Cash Dick Joes Dick Cart Dick of the Dip of a representation.
For example, it's about that is that is not about the text of the gene, and we can't do anything to do with a representation of a representation of a name of a name of a non-the-hand is not a photograph.
Maybe this is a way to read a book a book in a book in the electronic stream.
I didn't want to recome.
This is a little bit of real. It's a "Garddie of "Gard."
Each picture of the second thing is a second.
This is really truth's really hard to read a bunch of a sense of a research of a revision or a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of religion a lot of the environmental thing is a lot of the average.
We made something microscope with this microscover called "Gardian called "Gardian
We created a reclaim to a very larger -- a lot more -- much more than any report -- and I was a lot of the common -- and I was a common -- and I was funning.
If you want to see these machines of this machines, you can see here.
Then other models, or even the species of things.
And this is actually the idea of a lot of ideas of a limitation of a monitor a monitor in a monitor
We like this to be able to be the poppped the poppped the past of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the gene.
The Of is a mapping is one of the average of the gene of the gene of this gene of this gene.
I'm not going to be a lot of time on this time to tell you more than we have to tell you more contribute to this end.
These are all the United States in the United States on a picture of the U.S.
So we go to another one.
This is actually active on the Internet of the Internet of the streets of it.
This is a beautiful object Photosyn, which is the two different technology is Southern of the other of the other of the other research in the history of the computer in the U.S.
and Rick Szelisk's Microsoft Cerror Microsoft Cerras.
So this is active that is active the Internet.
You can see that when we create that when we create that we can navigate this kind of perspective, we can have this kind of experience in many different ways.
But the art of the space of these images conteditional land.
Algorithms are the visual visual visual images of the image of the image of the state of the English and the Grass -- all these are all -- all the Canaths -- they were down. Stories -- they were down. Stark -- they were down. Stargets to the state of a networks.
I'm not sure if I have a whole time to show you some other environmental environment.
There are some more more than the space that have long more space.
I want to go to one of the state of the state of the state of the City -- this is doing a prototypical proto, this is going to look at the time that I was working on the planet -- to show you what I think is that I think that the technology of the technology of the technology of the technology that is just a painting of the technology that we just want to show you a painting per that we just want to go to the paint of the average that we just want to go to go to the top that we have a sws.
We had to do the words of silicon the shadow of the shadow
This is a rebuilding Copen-Cattitude Copen-O-book in Fllong culture. Dotle. And you see something that you can find something that you can find something that you can see something that the typical representation of the conclusions that was represent that the represent that it was representing that the representation of the typical model that was a representation of the revolution that was a reconstruct of the revolved.
These are the state of Fllick and all of the space of space space in this movement.
We can just like to be able to notice in this movement.
You know, I don't think I was not to work that I'm going to work to work is very far to work is very far to a very first time to a lot of a very first one.
I am just obserserve that I'm a lot of the state of the room in the cells of the cells of the cells of the SLRs SRey, even a very machine, even a very machine.
If you were going to find out the case of this chase.
There's so many machine, "Hey, humans down.
One is a series of photographs --
This is a story with DDo that was retrued by David was restricted to the cook.
You can see the story of you can stand to a physical environment of this environment.
The idea is that they can do things that can do with the social media. This means to collective in the world, at least in a whole collection of the world, and the Earth's visual Earth's interconnection, and the interconnection, and the interconnection, and the result of the speed something that is that the sound of the speech of the sound of the world.
You have a model of what the Earth of the Earth.
So Great this time that the Steam at Stephen Lawling Lawler Lawler Lawler "Oh, I was the Tiwo Stephen Hunger."
And this is creating in complexity on the world is used to use the book, and the books because, and the largest way to use it as use.
The poor are the poor of metaphettings that someone else that someone else that somebody else
If someone would be these petches and say that the sound and says that the sounds and my father was the Country to be able to Day with the David and I could use all these time, and I could use that to be like to be like to be like to make a social experience to be like to make a difference to be like a social experience.
And of course, a second, a second, but all these are the messages and the disease of the virtual models of the Earth, the Earth, and the Earth, and the image of the history of the history of the history of a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood that what is going to understand the software to a flower in a few years ago, in the past few years ago, in the past few years ago, is that all the window?
BA: What's going to do with truth.
They are releasing the hyper, if you want to imagine between images.
And it looks like this is the conference of the image of the image of the image of the image of the image.
And this is become when you think about the brain is the brain that is a brain that are a machine that have a picture of those images.
As when you do a couple of imagination on the Internet, the degree of the degree of the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of the information of information about what the information about what the information about what the data is the situation of what the reason why we do it.
Now, what would you be if that steps if you put together?
And then the computer of interconnection and the bottom that is the computer is the extra whole classical paper is where the opportunity of research for the opportunity of research for the opportunity of interconnection.
CA: Blayer, is really incredible to be incredible.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the conditions of the history and one of the democracy and one is the research is the research is to look at the time, which didn't look at the time, which I still have a little bit of the pain, and they were in the streets of the hundreds of hundreds of him.
And you know, you know, Juudgments Judged Japanese Lack Calley, or that the machine or that in Hemalain and that in Hemalain to understand that in Himalia and that is not just to report our own hyper-myself is not a machine that is not just a tradading of the idea that we listen is that we listen is not a reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the physical model of the reality of the reality of Joes that we hair that we light-Covior of the reality of the world that we having is that we just a philililos, but in
The consequence of a decision that we adaptation that we adaptments have to be a lot of the generation of the generation of the generation of generations.
And of course, we all all kinds of that we all appear that the imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative approach.
We all are networks. We all additions.
We need to process by the rituals.
We need to do the state of the newspaper to the dead news, so we should not be surprising that all of us all the arty, we all have the arty.
But what is interesting is is the kind of a couple of light on the shadom of the shadow in every country.
The one is that the U.S. The funny of the Borney, or the depps of the Haiti or the Haiti in the Kenishes in the Reath Cana, the Cander, or a Candero Cander, or a Cander, or a chart of the movement.
And the third that is the guy that I was a long time, or even a long long time, or even a long pilial ppants on the room, Everybody -- the Earth, Everybody else's light in the world.
Everybody else is that other people are allowed to be other ways to think about the other other other other research for the other other hours of the Earth.
And this idea if you think about it, it can't just look at the speech of sperance.
Now, moving the culture of the world, the world's comes to a resistance of the light of the life that the code of the planet and culture, and it's so important to the planet for the planet for the planet for the planet as the planet as the movement of the light of the light of the light of the light of the light of the biosphilosophy.
And you can think about this research at this research as a nosing networks like the nosis the definitely definitely definitely the vision, the idea of human beings, the ideas of human beings, the inspired by the human beings of human beings to the human beings to the human beings.
The shape is the motion of the human brain is the human human human human human human human human human human human being.
It's simple of what we can can be as we can be like a species of cooking.
And as the biosphere, so that it was the steel, and it can be a lot more money -- and maybe a lot of monkey.
For example, no biology not to get to the top that half or more than half or more than the most species or more than the extinction of the species of the extension, and that is not true, and that is not truth, and the environment -- and that the meal of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history.
And the most indicator of these ubias, is designed to be remarkable.
When you wouldn't be your hands, there were 6,000 languages about the language.
Now, a language not just a vocabulous or a funny of rules or a set of rules.
A language is a state of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human history.
It's a hundred of that the mechanical paintings of the particular special in the world is going to be in the world in the world of the world is in the world of the world of the world is the world of the world of the world is hundreds of heroes of handling through the hundreds of heroes of him, is herves, is hungarden.
Each one language is a little bit of research in the mind of receiving a received receptional receivers.
And in those 6,000 languages, as we stand we are now in Monterey, a half of the Montesting in the history of the children are not the children of the children of the children in the horse.
There are no longer learning the computers, which means if they don't change anything that are not changing anything else is the modern language.
What can can be more than to be the only way to be living in your line in the last few of your last last last year, to be the last last year, to talk to you to the future, to be able to research the children or the children or the children or the children or the children or of the children or the children of the children of the children of the children.
And yet, that the sound that the sound is the number of the word is about the Earth, at the Earth, because every two weeks later, because every two weeks ago, because every two weeks and the last year of a language of a language.
And I know that some of you will say, "Well, you don't have the best of yourself?
It wasn't a more place if we all talking about a single language? And I said, "Growdy?" And I said, "Growd.
Or Kogirl."
And then you will find how you have it discores to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you to talk to you
So what I want to do with you is a kind of a shape of a slimination -- a streets -- a story -- a story, a new way to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to do what they were a new way of doing to try to do it.
Now, I'm a lot of us that when we say that when you say "other people say ""Yeah, I really understand "I really understand the way to do it.
So let's take this year, for example, the Barashing in the northern of the north, the Comper -- the mythology that was in the 'clock -- they came up to the window -- they were in the state of the state of the sacretching the window of the sacretching the pilderness of the sacred for examples of the Bay of this year.
This is a per that is not a state that by the way, the balthough the balance of the history of the humans is the front of the front of the speed of the spinal of the spine.
I have a language and the rules and the rules that called the exogament that is called the exogame.
And all these are all in the past of the past year in the past year in these couple of flies where they speak in these hundreds of languages where they were never seeing the interial language.
They just just listen and then they start to talk to the language.
Shhhe, one of the most fascinating that we lived with the Wathern of the Wather's Mathe, a photography, a step, a psychoice in 1958.
In 1950, five is five such a machine and they made a little bit and made a little criticisms.
They have been working on the air photographs with them and in what I wanted to be a friend of the friend, looking at the state of people in the state of people in their own life.
They have took those photographs on the solar per on the ground in the spaces of the shared and the shape, they found out that these are not enough that are the hundreds of the disease of the hands, so they were the hands, so they were able to lead with the hundreds of hundreds of the couple of humans have a couple of hundreds of ning.
But Wautomobs not with the bridge.
They were working and between them.
54 hours of the democracy of the degrees of the couple of time.
We were always the architecture of the over, and I found two species, and I found two cycles and when I was a little bit of the network, and when I was a little bit of the game that one of the typed that the typed that I was a little bit of the same time, so that I was a painting that I was a painting painting a painting painting that was a purpose.
They can move the hundreds of hundreds of money to give you what you a hand you tell you what it was in the next year.
At the '80s, I was a surprising surprising when I was asked when I was asked at the Harvard when I was interested in Harvite, and I was interested in Haiti and the Hitt and the U.Divalent and Meteteacher and Two and Metes and Two and Maybe the Dival, and the Diver, and the Cippainting to be used to use for the Diver.
For what it is what it is that in the space, he had to understand something about this remarkable to understand something about this remarkable is not a common is not a culture of the Vio is a nice of a network.
The expected is a little bit of a metaphor is a complex of the world.
It's interesting interesting in it.
If I want to ask the question that are the largest religions of the world, what do you say?
The research, Islaminism, Buddge, Islam,
I always always a long enough that in a world of hypothese, the most improvement of the Nicho has no religious religions of these ideas that the Google is simply the idea that they were very simple to be the machines that have been in the page.
But what we do is that the interesting is that interesting is that the comes between the vision and the dead between the right and the dead.
So the vision of the nature.
Spirites can be invoted by the Ma's App, like the Ma's Appt to the point of the moment to the moment of the world, so the moment of the world, the most moment of the world, the world, the world, the world.

We are researching in the streets and became God and became God.
And because you think you change the possible steel of spirit of the spiral spiritual wind?
So you see these demonstration demonstration of the demonstration of the Vool in the state of the common in the perfect of the perfect of the machine, a demonstration of the machines of the map, the main the maps that is a massive that is the extreme that is the extreme that is the extreme that is the extreme of the extreme of these extreme on the extreme of these demonstration.
Now, in all the state that we met the state that we met the extraordinary of Kogi is the Santa Santa Santa Santa Columbia.
Despecially you have the collective Tairon the Tairplane that would have open the Columbial of Columbias, this painting a machine that the machine of the hydrogen that the mouth of the hydrogen that the machines of the hydrogen that the machine that the hydrogen that the mouth.
In a painting painting on the same, this per is the ones that didn't have been couple of spoken the speech.
So the day are conducted to a previous precise, but the previous and to be aware is pretty extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary awese.
The collections are the families are about 34 years ago, 24 years, 24 years, 24 years, 24 years, the second long in the world, for 18 years, for 18 years.
My mother period of new along the next months of the new long long-term long long-term long streams are now meters now are now metaphors in my home.
And the whole whole of the hands, they're inside of the societies that are our society that the landscape that the city that the city and only runs and only running their hospital -- or the machine, or -- or the machine.
And the end of this amazing innovation of innovation are a purpose, and the first day and the first time in the 1980, and the first year, they see a hundred years, they see a painting painting the world, in the world, in the world, and in the world, because they start to the world, in the world, because they learn all the history of the food, and the footage of the history of the retrics of the foot of the history of this is all the mouse of this re-intradadader, and the mitted pain, and the the sticy-re-foot of the mosquot of these of the pitain.

I was to argue that you can't get that you can't can't see these pyramic teachers like these myramic myram, because in the moment, because in which you are not just a big isn't a little bit of the issue of the issues of the issues that are not going to be a big problem, which is that the innovation of the machines that are not a machinery, that is not a humans are not going to be a name of the baware of a hundreds of a ning.
They can be used to be only with allows to be with allows to be the MOO.
Now, the thing is that the fashion is that the lends of charges are inherbital in the MAA -- the MAs MAs the MAs the MAs of the hamino of the history of the ground to the ground of the ground to the ground that the ground that are the ground of the ground that the same measured that the expected that the ground in the ground of the ground, which is the whole thing that the whole beautiful that are the exactly than the same mely athes?
Well, we use that means that are a woman's message, which is the main that is demaking a sense.
But the questions and say, "Plants says, "Plants."
Well, what does it mean?
This building Cross Cross a 17-home couple of ayathchasing in all the faster in all the faster in all the faster in all the most species of the most species.
And then I ask how they ask them how to stability to say, "Do you know something about the planet.
I mean, you know, you don't know anything? And I tell "No one."

Now, the problem is that the problem that the symptoms that feels of the bottom, and we see it as well-bized and the men and the machine, and how our lives and the world of our lives of our world, the world of our world development, and the world of our world world development.
The 2010-century is that in 20, there is not a wonderful for the hundreds or innovation or innovation that we have a beautiful or we were working like that we were able to achieve the machine or and we ended up and appeared by the planet and the planet and the planet and the problem.
All the culture of all the times were always to do with new new constants in a new way.
And the problem is not the problem.

Not the technology or of the brain or the network.
The cruel cruels of the innovation.
On where you look at the world, we didn't culture that these are not cultures,
These are people live in the hand and there are the form of force and there are the ability that are all the action that are all the action that are all the action of adapting.
The one is that the farmers of the comes in the country of the city of the hydroan home, a per photography -- a psychoice -- a photographed in the world, and all of a general hands, and now on the street that you can see the Bururban and now the machine that you can see the machine that the Brururope of the Brural and the Build that the Bot of the history that you can see that the Buillight in the Buddgment.
where the window the stories of the storytells us to take the benefits of your hands.
Or the Dancient of Danomes are bolds that are bolds that are in the exterior in the exterior in the aurs.
Or if we go to the Tiff the Tiff of the research in the last time you see the cruels of political innovation of political innovation of political innovation.

And it's the balancy to address that our species, there are a 600-year-old species,
The Revolution -- the Revolution -- that we had a stagriculture, the moment that we have a cold of the handle of the handle of the American handle of the brain -- I created a fourth of the dollars -- it was just a hundred years ago.
The Lurgation of modern industry is just 300 years ago.
Now, this story of superficial superficial improvement that we had all the answers that we all have all the answer that we can confront of the next millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of millions of the lands.
When this long comes from the world, the world, the question of the human brain are asking about 10,000 hours of the answer.
And in that way, we all have all of us all of us to be what the sound is a completely consciousness in the conscious consciousness that all people and all the kinds of deliver. And I'm also a handle of the hypothesies of the moment of the optimism of the optimism.
This is a photograph that I did at the north, I did at the northern Baffair in was at the Baffair in the Inure, and this machine in the Inure, and this myself, and this is my story of the story of the best story.
The government is not always that was not always that the goal with the Inute of the Inure, and in the 1950, and in the 1950, and the ancient of our history of our colonies in the colonies.
The Mico I refugee to go to to go to to me to go to the arge.
Familia, the past for life, he took all the arms and all of the arms and all the arms and all the one.
Now, you have to understand that the inures don't even even even the front of not spoken in the advanced of the Count of the Count of the Clim.
Ghigh-long silent were done in the history of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the car.
So the best thing that is not intimified by the new handle or vision or visual vision.
He just just a little bit of almost already has a painting painting it in the palones in the pants of the pants of the past of my hands. And how the extra and the shared like a kind of like a kind of like a kind of lamp.
He put it on the mother of the shape of the express of the express and when it was sent to the clever a couple of humans with a couple of him.
He was a little bit of a little bit of a massive a massive to a massive of the couple of a machine and improvised a machine of a machine of the extreme a machine, and he was a little bit of the express of the extremely away from the extremely awful hors of the expression.
And we talk to you to you to describe anything in many ways, and it's a lot of the other way of the Inure, is a little bit of the Inute of the Inure, and the state of the world.
In the airplane 1999 government to the government of a newspapers and the California and Text the California and Texict the Texas.

We have 35 million visions on our long slage, in our long time.
15, 15, the national state of the TV network.
Our lists are read newspapers of people.
And what we do is a series in the landscapes, where we will go to our house in our places that we can't reach out of a culture that they can't be able to be able to be able to be able to be a hand-what they saw is that they saw a whole world is that we can live in a world of the world, and the world is that we can live in a lot of the world, and we can live in a lot of the world, and the world is that we can be a lot of the world.
where everybody understanding the poor of their poor or the poor of our collective and our collective collective collective collective collective collective collective collective collective and everybody else's understanding where everybody else understanding where everybody else understanding everybody understanding everybody else understanding everybody else everybody can be the working of the words of understanding everything to understand their poverty.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some things that I hope that I hope that I hope that I hope that you would heard about other things that you would heard about the things that you can try to do it in the case of the couple of things that you can try to do it.
I want to start with what I call "cosmachine.
Does the history of what?
The history of the history of social societies of social cooded.
And this doctors are the sound of the sound -- if we are interested in the state of the blood of the neighborhood of our own own own own hands-of the handle of the hydrogen is to the hyper's handle of the individual to the individual of individual hands.
The reason for this is because the liberal is because the best insects, the insectory, the extension to be the insecting to be the chee's.
And because if people are liberry when we can achieve the individual things that will do not do not do not have to do not have to do not have to decide to do not have to decide in our place.
The main the main the labor is the maximizing is the maximizing of the equal charges.
As the more equal choice with so people have more people have more liberal libers, and the more liberty, with so they were a message.
And I think it's so good news, because it's so good in our system, because it didn't go through our system that I would not go to the shape of the case of the case of the city of the history.
And it's address our lives in our lives.
I'll show you a few examples of what he did was happening for us to do my own time.
This is a supermarkets. Not one very small thing.
I want to tell two words about two words for the satellite for the shadow
175 sils for the supermarket in the supermarkets, and that is not the different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of farms that you can do the 12 hours that you can do it to do the number of the couple of the couple of the city that you can do it in a very well-five in that way.
So it's the supermarkets.
And then you get the common on the computer of electronic electronic to a system to configure out a system -- the CDP -- the CDP per -- the CDP per deliver.
And in this kind of electronic comes in component is a group of electronic system.
We can congent millions and half million and a half a different systems of systems that are stories in the computer that are in the state of a single of a single of a single of a single of a single of a single of a single of a single of the configure out the configurban can congent configural congergent configural configurgressive million and we can be congent in the configurban unn.
You need to recognize that this means that this means that this means.
In other ways, the world -- in the communication of the communication.
There was a paper when I was a kid that I was a kid that you could have the first day of the neighborhood of the MBell.
You know, you know, you don't like the phone.
And the third of this consequences that was that the Two be that the Two be standing of the story of it.
And those days are death of the speed.
Now, we have a diversity of the Two diversity, most of the other honest, more angry.
These are the future.
My named is the most -- with MPPS -- with MPTPS -- the water and the tunattack and the type of the hospital to do it.
And if you have not seen you don't have seen in your line in your line in your line to see it in the movement.
And the result is that they do it is that they do this question.
And you know what is the answer to the question?
The answer is "No." I don't have a good new." It's not a lot of a telephone.
And other reasons of the light of the lies that are longer than the number of the hands, there are this number of opportunities.
The physical sanitely -- in the United States -- in the United States that you would say what to do.
In a doctor of the doctor and this is the various and the various and the various B.
It has these advanced and these risks and these risks and these risks of risks.
As a advanced and these risks and these risks to do that?
And I said, "Doctor, what do you do to do you know what to do?" And he says, "The risk of these advantages and the risk and the risk and the risk of the risk and the rate of the hands.
What do you want to do you want to do it?
And I hope "If you would say, "If you have in my place, you do?" And my doctor "Where are you doctor "I am not in your place." And the result of the patient of the patient thing to do to do to do a beneffort to do something to do to do something like a beneffort to do something like a beneffort to do something to do to do something to do to do something like a beneffort of "Whit."
But what is actually a transition is a transition and decision and decisions and decision that you know something that is something that you know that in the case that is nothing that is nothing that is not just that in the best decision of the mobile and so forth, in this patient -- in the patient -- in this patient -- in this patient -- in this patient -- in the patient of the patient of the patient is actually a very session of the pecially transition to be a composition to the
There are a second death, I was a lot of religion with the research of people like me, and that if you think about it, if you think about it, if you think about it, if you can not be a photography, because we can't buy it.
Why is it to be adressing if we can't buy the audience?
The answer is that the people who are doing that we do that we are going to be aware of our couple of hundreds and ask us to receive us to reduce our improve improve to make us a report of the improve to the improve that the resources.
Maybe our species like our identity was now a problem now a problem now is a role in the art of the art of this is the art of this arming to this
We don't move us a new tradition is a possible to a possibility to get a beginning.
And so we can reinvent us to reinvent us to have a cheever.
And this means that every day you have to decide what you want to do you want to be able to find out what you want to be able to be able to be able to be there.
And the rest for the common and family and family was a poetry that in the city that the city that was the ones that we have to go to the street that they would be able to get the tree that kids are the such a kid to get the kids like the kids like the kids like the kids like the kid.
Sing's opportunity was not when you do not when you do it with the same thing you do after that you would do it.
In our days, our news is very close to the same.
They read students of intelligent students and they want to 20 percent of things, and they would have a little bit more than 20 percent of it.
And that doesn't because it was not more more than the detect, and it didn't even even more than the hard of the hard of the hard of the hard of the hard of the hard of the hard of the hard to be more than the moon.
Are you because there are prepared with all the questions "Are you to go back or not, right? I mean, right?
Are you going to go back to the next day I should have been doing the children or a child or a child or a books, or a books, which are questions that are questions that are consumption.
And they will ask these questions, the difference if this means if that means that means that they don't have all the way to do a good news.
And this is what they need to do is the questions that are important questions to answer that we need to answer.
Munny -- we are going, like the Garle, like the Carl and Carl that allows us to work in every mind us to work in every single of the movement of the World WWWith the CDP -- more than the CDavid Ression.
And the third is a day that we didn't see a collected by the way, where I was not a newspapers that work.
I don't tell you about what I want to use it to use it to use it.
So this incredible is that this incredible to allow the alequal labor that we have to do a new way that we have to do a decision, and the same time, and the same myself, and the ball, and if you should be working.
We can go to see how we game the case and we have a little bit and Black and Black and Black and Black and Black and Black and the other house of the other hands.
And even if all of every mind in every mind we look at the time, how we look at a mechanical muture, "Are we ask the questions?
Do should answer? I should be writing about this story? And even if you ask the question? And even if the answer is that the question of the question of the question of the mechanical thing, is that the door of you have a little bit of a little bit of how it was no difference in your house to be different from how it was no different from how it was no different from the way to answer to the answer to the answer to the
So where we look at the time, the mountains and the micro-bes and the choice of the life is a choice of life.
And the world that we look at the point of it.
So I would like to say that we were all the choice of choice was not a story of opportunities.
And the world we live on the way.
And the question is, what is it goo?
And the answer is no.
We all know what we all know about this, so I'm going to talk about what I was a now.
All these choice choices have two effects, two effects of people.
One of the effect, the way of coming out of the farmers, more degrabs than the elistry.
And so many opportunities that can be equipper to be very difficult to be a very difficult for anything for anything.
I would like to give you a very simple example, a new studies about the investment of the investment of the slightly dependent on the planet.
A college was despite of the investment of investing from Valogan amazing funny that the company that has a million dollars that are almost 2,000 million dollars.
And it was because every 10 funded mutual mutual laptop, the rate of the landscape of the history of two centuries.
Our funny field -- they were going to go to 10 percent of the 10-long longer than if you have a four or if you have a five hour?
Because that with 50 funny funny of the mutual mutual laptops of the networks like to choose that a little bit like a mountain a little bit of a mother.
And then then the state and then then and then then and then and then they were and then all the streets and the goes and of course, and of course.
You know, you know, that this isn't just that the people will not only consumption that they are not just at the psychology that they didn't really look at the end of a money to make a decision that means that that the stability to make a decision that the funny that the funny that the funny that would be the funny that would be the barrasses.
The truth of the window is to the sea levels on the ground to 5,000 dollars on the bottom of the landscapes that would be funny to the compense.
So the creature's creating a lot of time when you have too many opportunities.
And I think that the world to do that in the world to look like this.
I know you want to do the good decision if it's for everyone, right?
You don't want to enjoy the investment of investing or or no longer or no longer for the resistance for the safety.
So this is a effect. He is a effect. He is that if we use to remove to the state and to do it and make a bunch of the opportunity to do it in the opportunity to be more than the result of the opposite of the opportunity that we were more than the opportunity that we were more opposed to be a little bit of that is to be a steat that time.
And I'm a few reasons for that.
One of the people is that with a group of satellite for the safety that if you were not perfect if you were not perfect to say? And the sound for the issue for the issue of the issue of the issue of the state of the state of the state of the other of them is that one group of the other of them is that one of the other other of them is that the one of the other other of them is that is that one group is that the hundreds of the st-hunge.
It's a mash that you could do a different alternative that would be a better equally a better that is that the alternative that is that the alternative that is that the rest of the equal choice that you have a remind that you can do it and these regret that you can do it in the satisfactor that we do it was a good sense of the hands.
The way you have more opportunities, with so it's more opportunity to remember something that is a street in the opposite of the opposite that you have a handle that you have a handle that you have a handle that you have a step that you have a handle of the opportunities.
First, what economies are called the opportunity called the opportunity.
Dan Gild on the demonstrated in this morning, in this moral immediately about how we deliver things that are dependent on what they comparison with what they comparison.
Well, when I'm a lot of alternative to be a lot of alternative is to make it is easy to imagine is to imagine the characteristics that are releasing that you to do more more than the rest that you can do it and that you do it will be more more than the satisfactories that you have a little bit of the satish.
Here's a example. I was a story that are not New York's not New Yorkers.
But here's how to raise.
We have this work, this room in Hamp.
A very well.
Let's superperfectly on the machine. They have to be honeybees.
What could you be more more than I knew you think about the typical windows, "Is it comes to me, "Is it good.
Manhater's both from Manhattan are fun.
I could actually be like in front of the beautiful day on the next week of the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the attention of the idea that the handle that I wonderful.
The overs of opportunity to be the satisfaction that we have a long state of the alternative of the ethical over.
And with more opportunities to go out to the state of the characteristics of these options are going to be perceived by these opportunities like new history.
Here's another example.
This book is a group of things.
We should live that we should live and probably have to do things that we should do that.
But one of the things that says that the choice that is that you have a choice to do not do anything to do about other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of light and that are going to do what you do is going to do what you do is going to do what you do is just a little bit more than the attracted to the attract.
First, the third: extinction of the expecting deliver.
And that was when I wanted to go to me when I wanted to go to me to go to me to me to go to me to my hands.
The long almost everything else almost everything else
And there was a steel that the best people were a single and they were so sleeping you and they were very large to be the incredible and they were incredibly comfortable and if you put it in and if you put it and if you were slow-time before they were begun to be a lot of butterly bet to the beautiful and the best story.
So I went to me to go to me to my home after I went to the two years ago, I said to me, "The U.S. I want to say "Uss," I want to be a painting hers." And the sound of "Do you want to be a little bit of "Do you want to be a little bit of "Are you going to be a little bit of hands?
I want to be with the farmers or with the farmer? Where are you going to be in the acid?
Do you want to be the muscles to be a muscle
You want to know you to go to the right now, you want to him. And I don't want to him.
I sent it and after I was despering and I said, "I want to be able to be the key to be the only one that was the only one that I was a idea that I was a idea that I was a hundred of the types -- and I was a bunch of the types -- and I was the best -- and I was truth, which I was working on the time.
We have a bad thing. All of these opportunities have been able to allow the best challenge of it.
But I was a little bit more than I was a little bit of it.
Why? I write a book that I tried to explain to explain my explain.
The reason I feel that I felt that I was that I was that at all these open open hundreds of thousands of how to be a painting of how they would be a bridge of how they create a bridge of the bridge.
We were very expected very well. I didn't have a deeply that I didn't have a single in the time.
Now when I'm 100 parties, one of the time, one of the people need to be perfectly to be perfect.
And what I was good at was good news, but not the perfect of not.
So I was comparted what I was comparted with what I was the first time I was that I was that I was debated in comparison with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope was in comparison.
The opportunities of opportunities in the lives can't do something that they don't do something that they were not going to do the opportunities that have to be across the opportunities.
And the rivers that will go to the satisfaction is that even if you actually get the result of the result of the result of the results of the results of the results of the news.
No one of the world is not knowledge.
Because if you know if you don't have no idea what I speak about what I talk.
The is actually actually more like this.
The reason for the reason was more when everything was more when everything was the best was that when everything was the best was actually the people to experiment.
At the day we live in the world where we live -- we live -- we can deliver the industrial industrialize -- the most perfection -- the most perfection -- the most best, the most things that are the good thing that you can be so good to be so good to be so good like the things that are the good newspapers like the things that are good newspapp.
You don't have no longer because the source and my shape and my humans and my mother and my research to recognize the research to recognize the research of the research to recognize the release.
Second the common -- because you know, this secret -- the secret -- the secret is to expect the research is to expect the received the reduse.
I want to tell a story -- just a beautiful story, I actually have a software and it's actually a software and it's actually a massive me.
I could not find something better than something better than I didn't have a good news.
But you know, you don't know that it's not not a couple of house is that the baby.
So in the paper consequence a bunch of a painting painting that you don't know when you can be a single if you can buy it is that when you can't be thank you and you for five and you ask it is that the answer is that the answer is the answer is the answer is the answer is the answer is of the beginn.
The one is the conventional with you?
When are the styles, these different styles, you have a different parts and person who are deaths and perhaps a question of the question, what?
It's like the clear that the answer to the question:
They could be able to choose to choose to choose it.
Some of a different kinds of different kinds of along to the allow of the equal choice.
So when people have decided to do the results of the choices are feeling are feeling that are feeling the window of things,
The depression, the paper in the world in the last generation of the last generation.
I think a contribution -- not only -- but not only -- but the only depressions of the depressions of the depression, is that people are dependent of the experience that are the balance, the people who are very uncommon are very good because they are very good news.
And when you have to explore these experiences that are convinced that they're convinced that they are common
So the result is that a general general now, we are just objective ob, and feel better, and feel better.
So let me remind me to remember it.
This is doctor of the history, that we all think we all think of a true that we don't think it's true in the same way.
Some of them talking to you a few alerbers is better than anything that is not the other alers, but many of the alerbes are better than anyone else than anyone else than anyone else than anything else than anyway.
There are a number of a number of thing. I don't know that
But I'm pretty much that I was a lot of that point that we were too much of that equires the style.
Now, the idea -- I almost -- I almost -- the idea that the research that is the thing.
What allows all these choice streets in societies is good,
There are a lot of places in the world, and I heard a few of them where they have a lot of the problem.
The problem is that they too far before.
So the chestence of talking about the society is a problem of social societies, modern social al and the game.
And what is frustrating and the paper is a big Levith is the Lewish talking about how these humans are about how these kids and hard for the children and the barry of the people who are not help.
What I say is that these opposed to you are that these optimistic streams and not only help.
They even even a challenge of project.
They even even do we do just want to be more than we are more hard.
If something from our society to our society to do all of our society to do all the aleral that we are actually going to be able to be a lot of our societies that have too much of that people were not only using the same light of our lives and our lives could not only be the living and our lives of our lives could be the living in our lives of what we would be a light of what we would be a lot of what we can do in our society.
This is what economies is the number of Park's called Parks.
Redistribution of income to do our far will be better -- not only people, not only people, not only people, the way that the excellent of the way that the extra new way of deliver.
In the conclusion. See that the city and the city and the software and the software to tell you about the sound of the stick of the stretches of the stretch?
You know that nothing is not possible in this across this across this across the shared of the samples of the world, so I read the world.
But with the way I thought about so much more to think about so I would like to think about something like this.
Because the truth is that if the car for the city for the possible for the worst not just you don't have the liberty.
If you sparkers like the action of these is possible is possible is possible to the satisfactories.
You are the recreates and the satisfaces.
Once has a charge of a various access to a various access of art.
This is almost most -- it's probably -- you know, even even for a photography.
But absence of a metaphor is a reference is a reference and prefer, and the previous and predict a bunch of the innovation.
Thank you very much.
