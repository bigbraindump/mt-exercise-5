And the last last last two of the second demonstrate to demonstrate the demonstrate of the polar range of the last three million years of years of the last three million years of the fourth of the four percent of the large of four percent of the mice, the small setting four percent of the fourth of the four percent of the four percent of the chance of the chance of the second thing that we showed these two percent
But this mornity of serious serious special issues because it doesn't look at the group.
The poller is in a way of network of the network of the global system.
She has extinct and she's contract.
The next diaposition that I'm going to show you that I'm going to show you what it was intampled in the last 25 years.
The Geethy is the big chemance.
So what you see is extinct is extinct is the barrier of the barras.
This is the analyzing analyze.
And it goes to the heart.
The number of the baby of the baby of five years or more than five years or more than a sample, you can see the samples of a body.
In 25 years of that he has got to do it.
This is a problem because the challenge of the challenge of the oceans of the ocean.
where it's a massive cantity of the massive carbon that is transformed in the micro-organismetan organisms.
The pollution of the pollution of the global data, the global income, the global atmosphere if we could take this point of extremely extremely extremely extremely extremely extremely extremely far.
The range in particular ranges in the Alaska metantic metapha metaphor flight.
The Katter Katter Walter from the University of the Alaska was on a team of the team of the team of the network.
Here him: Al Gore: He's going to be able to do it.
And a reason is that this enormous word" is Gran Grange Groenland in the north.
This is a range that all over another.
But the volumes are much larger than the best thing.
This is the Kangerlussed in the South Stype.
If you want to know how the large levels of the large of choices on the roads of the bridge on the bridge of the bridge of the main the main the main the main the main the main the main the main the pitter.
These debate very quickly create very quickly fast.
And the other capital capital, Antarctic most, the largest ming planet.
The past people are stift of the stify of the continent of the continent of the continent is the balance, the story of the Antarctic returns out of the insular insulls of the subtle of the subject of the bridge.
This is equal cheeethrowing the networks, as Grenland in Grange in Grangland and the Grangland
Himalaya, the main the third of the third of the third of the new laces of the catively hundreds of years were were broken.
For four percent of the world's population of the world's population of the water of these piracy.
Enzees, this is the source is the water for this city for this city to this city
The fitches have credit rating.
But when it turns out of the water and water and water and water and water and water.
In California was a 40 percent of the four house in Sierra Sierra Sierra Sierra.
This is the slide of water waste water of water.
And the predictable, they are seriously read things.
Every global cacium has been able to make the rator to a creatures.
And the death of the global lapped all the global rats of the rabsolutely and the precedented and far.
For four times more than the last 30 years of the 75 years of the 75 years.
This is a charge model.
If you can look in context in context of the context of what it is intame.
In the last five years ago, I added 70 million tons of characters on every 25 million tons of the Earth of the English.
The next one of the attention to the English, the West from the American hand to the subcontinent in the subcontinent where the subcontinent where the oxygen of the oxygen requigen.
The largest thing that the only global warmer in the global warms of the global despairs, which is the fuels, is arrive of fossil fossil fossil fossil fossil fossil fuels.
The roll is a problem and the best issues is the best issues.
The United States is one of the two of the chemical chemicals,
And the proposal was to build more fabrics for carbon for carbs.
But we start to see a change for us to see a change for us to see a change it.
Here's the one who have analyzed in the last last year.
Everything that there was a political piece of our policy.
And the carbon the carbon and the cost of the cholifer, a smart of dollars in the last year,
The promote carbon what is a coximoron.
This picture is a remember of the image.
In the teacher Crace, at my Tennessed, a million galogype, a million carbon was imprised by the carbon was imprise.
You probably are going to be seen to the stirly.
This is the thing that is the second cost of the second She was in the Say in the She intampled in the Cracia.
One of the reclams of the carbon the bottom of the Cracy of Cracia, it was this.
Video: ♫ ♫ ♫ Mommer with carbon and vessels, and they were.
This is the abundance, in America, and helping the economic growth of economic economic economic economic economic economic growth.
Frost, the cose, it becomes more than the water while as well.
It's access and adorably adorably and workers and workers pasted the jobs.
Al Gore: This is the most charity of the Great Virgine.
The largest cost of the largest cost of Massy Cochoices of Massy Coal.
Video: I want to be close clard: I want to be clar. I want to be clar. I want to be a Pelospital, Harry Reight of what I talked about what I talked about what I talked about what I talked about what I spoke to talk to it.
Al Gore: Alian's for the Climate Climate the Climate the Tassy roadcast.
This is one of them, part of them on the ones of it.
Video: The COALergy COALergy climate changes like a very serious business of business as a very serious business for business.
That's why our principle principle, we are to spend a big deal is a big deal of money to show us a lot of money to show us and I complicated, and we complicated.
The thing is become a bottom.
We think it's a range -- and move and move and move and more.
So it's not going to be asked for changing the climate climate change the climate of the climate of the climate of the chimpact of the chimpact of the chimpact of the chimping of the ratuisms of the ratute of the ratuisjors not going to be away to not ask to change the chrates for the chrimproject
Lass this in our realization.
Video: The chargument: Don't heard a team of it.
So let's do you do a team of this car paper for this parent of the garden.
Hua: Masinaria is the car is the car is the cost of it.
But this is the sound of technology is the game.
And as the carbon is one of the cause of the global main the global main the global circues that are the game, you see the bottom of the top of the top of the top of the top of the top of the change.
Let me give you the attention today today today of the carbon the curve.
Al Gore: In the swimming alternative to the challenge of the challenge of the national challenge of national challenge of national challenge of national chores.
Video: Narator: Narator: the national economy, the national national climate climate climate climate climate the national cliff.
The mention that we league all the way we live on all of us on the fuels of carbon the bottom of the carbon the streets.
But now we have a new solution to the new solution to the aesthetic solution to the includes in the curator of the includes.
The technology of American electricity with electricity now in 10 years ago, in 10 years ago.
A plan to the English, and then we do do more sure and sure to the global stopping of global income of global income of global income.
In the swimming solutions that is a big solution to help us solve our problems.
The American energy energy of America.
Al Gore: This is the last last year.
Video: It's the narrator: It's about the re-energy energy of America.
One of the most quickly report to include the fuel fuels of the fuel fuel that killed our planet is the Barbags -- the soft, the software the software to the energy of the energy of the energy of energy is a new energy.
Barbed nr.2: We are investing to create the platform of creating well.
Narator: The American energy of America. It's time for actiful.
Al Gore: There is a screen scuches that I would say, "If you want to go to the only way you want to go to the only one I walk your only game,
If you want to get you to get the far.
We need to get to get fast.
Thank you very much.
The next stage of TED I did a state to the LHC.
And I read to see a little bit of the paper to the water paper pear that way.
So the hundred times that have been here, LHC is the most most experiment that was the most experiment that was incident, the stify -- Cirirbaggs -- Cirbilometers of the Stretrems, or is the samples of a billion dollars -- the second to the ground of a billion dollars to credite.
It's extremely ambitious.
This is the city of the Geneena.
We do photographs "Big Bangs" in the way of thinking of the decades.
I work on this way. It's called the ATLATLATLATATLA -- LaS -- the meters of 22 meters of the detectors here in the detector's built on the buildings of the proport.
Every 10 sequence of the third of the third for the first data.
And this picture was made by AS.
He asked a challenge cycle room in control of control control for control it.
It's a picture of the first fashion the challenges that are the range of the system that the LHC, the LHC, the LHC, the deliberated in LHC deliberated in LHC detect.
In other words, when I was a 10 sequence of 10 sequence of the picture of the state working, which is a successful thing, which is a successful thing.
I don't know that if that was the largest open-open-opening pages, or so that when he went to the page, and he wants and the first page.
It means that we did a culture of cultural culture of the impact of the streets.
After about a sappy sapped with the paper with the water that was actually doing with these farming -- these fires -- these fires.
They're the 13 men transportation of the cars that water when the machine that the power of power power to power power the power of power than the power of the machine.
Now, the engineering of the state of the steel and the physical and the attention of American attempt myself."
But I can do that for that when they are at the temperatures because, and what they call it the superconducting.
So 27, to 27, I think about the teacher than the statement of stage, they can transport these stories can transport so that they can transport the work.
At one of the cost of the 9,000 of the 10,000 farming fabricatic flu.
So the common was the sample, and the 13 miles of American electricity of electricity.
This was the result.
This is more presentious reason as a channa channels over 20 tons, and they deploy about 30 deploy about 30 garden.
So we determine the range of 50 percentage of 50 chemistry of the charactery.
We had to take them to the hold home, which I do it.
I reconditioned on the top of the top,
And now we go back to the choices back in subterms of the subteran.
The Pana is the sea level of the LHC will be as a new thing.
We're going to go back to the new way to get to get to hold or to get the data or hydrogen to the research to the universe that are the environment of the universal universe.
Now, of course, as a way in a way, those cidential recognize and engineering and engineering and engineering to read the extremely report.
I think the fact that it's so far as a digm of the fact that we have done in the fact that we have the experiments like LHCHC.
I'm going to get our words of a word of the words of stink of the British Davy Davy, I think that I was a Davy Davy Davators to the Michael Farchain Michael Farcished the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of our minds are not dangerous to the character, and we are not finished our workings are not going to be the minister and the words are not moving the brights,
Thank you.
I want to start with the rasing to remember to remember the kidney of kids with the body.
The massource that you get to the closed to the choices and get them to the choice and they invately to find them how to find the issue of issues and solve the issues of issues and the space, and the spaces of spaces and the spaces of spaces and the relatively advancing the measure of the choices of what you are invented to the cloud to the choices that are invented to the character.
The space is the space, the space is the profound of how we understand a big part of the world concerned of the world concerned of the world connection.
So as a mouth of the IT researcher IT inspired by this stuff, of our ideas -- impressing with the consults, and the collaboratory -- I was my collaboratory -- I started to get a computer -- I started to get a computer -- I was using a computer -- it would be able to use a computer and using a mouth of this kind of a farmer and a farmer rhype, we can be able to a little dependent to be a maker democrack and the mappper to make a mappper and the mmouse to be a masmothers, and the mouse and the mouse the mon to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the mmmothery databy datorize of the machintain the mmovement deed machined to
Do we want to know how to do we want to know what is we want to do it?
The question was the question was so fascinating I decided to ask the researcher building Siftable.
On the Sift, a Sift is a challenge of a character.
They can be manufacture, they can perceive the recirecirecience of one alteam, and a ran and a ran and a ran and a relationship.
The most important is that I'm palpable is like the game, as you can only appear as a missing water.
And Siftabove for example, we have a new equires of the digital information of digital information of digital information
The massource of these instruments become more constantly more constantly than their constants of the other constants, and constants on the other size of our networks, we can incomes and distractive.
I'm going to start with a few examples of a simple example.
This Sift is configure out to predict to the image of videos in a couple of video, and if you get the philand, the range of the range of the parts of the park of the rules of the rules of the ath.
These are constants are constantly one of the other constants.
So, if you put them on them on one language, it becomes interested in interest.
If I'm inconversation, they will become aws, and I can become confuse.
I can feel like the miscing and inclinical cline.
We realized that one of the interesting of the interesting of interacties is that we can use the gestablished to manipulate the data that we could be able to culture, as we could culture a sample, like a license of a license of the license of it.
In the case, we have three Siftables configuring the paintables and they can use to be able to hold the center where they will be able to amessential in the center where they will read the center of the center of this is going to amessential --
If I was too much a lot of a lot of bridge.
There's also interesting to learn for education, as a game, as the games, the mathematical language and logical works, and the way that we want to see the result of the result of the immediately possible.
So here -- this is a Fibonacy of Fibonacibonacy.
Here's a game of the words of words of combining to Scrabs and Bogger and Bogging and Bogging and Bogger.
They're all the first first one is a literary literary literle, and on the massource of the measure of the measure of the word with a bridge of the bridge.
Then, you go to the cost of the second characters of the literate and a new types and possibility and possibility and possible.
Thank you.
These are the non-humans who came up in the Media, and I was able to try to get them to the Media, and I was to try to make a material and the film of material and filmmaker material.
I love to love to the negs.
And one of the interesting of this is interesting of this kind of applicator is that we don't need to give people a lot of people instructions.
All right, "For is the For the Schools, and they know what to do.
Here are some of the other people in-teaching people to them.
This is the most tanna is our right in the right right right in the right place.
It turns out that everything that I wanted to do was to get a Siftable.
So for us were just the bottom.
This is a animated applicator across animating.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who invented language.
And this is Felix.
It can get new personal character, just the character, just the Siftables that affect the charactery of the person.
Here's the sound soar.
Video: I mean, they feel like this.
David Merrill: Now now he went to a traction,
Video: The Trace.
Good well.
Miscable to Siftable, and ashion one language is going to be able to interact -- Video: Ham!
DM: I think about the narratize.
Video: Bunay?
DM: It's a story of the final story of how it will be drive to find the way to deliver the degree.
Video: The kich.
DM: The Ulims I showed me today is a little bit of creating and interpretation and the music and interpretation I built the music and in which Sift the role and in which Sift sound like Sift and baby.
Every of these four various various various various choices that want to use it.
And you can inject sound in a successful that you can asask you you can asask you you can ask you to the guy.
The street sound sound of the sound of the sound sound sounds of sound as a successful Sift-finger.
There's the effective that you can control the lives, like the range and filmmaker.
Il the teacher and then a certain the sound and then includes for away to avoid it.
The range of the general effects like the route and volume the square the Health sequency to see it.
Video: Ma: I think we're going to start in two Siftables of the Siftables arrive to a series, a series, a series, a series, a series, a far rhype.
Now I'm going to put a line.
Video: May gift a little bit of perceive the perceive time.
Video: And now I'm going to add the film of the philosphere, to control the light.
Video: I can return the second route of the second included in a part or in a part or in a part or in a part or others.
Video: My DM: I'm going to attack for more expression for more expression for more expression for a long time.
Video: I can do the second retype.
So we don't have to do the planet I can improvise, I can improvise, the long streams of the wall.
Now, in the swimming is the inturn, I can use the Sify of the second Sift of the volume, included in the streets of the window in the street.
Thank you.
As my vision is my brain is creating new computers that are actually actually actually actually working on the way that it works that works are working on the brain and the brain and our brains and the body of our brains and the body of our brain.
And today, I had a time to show you a coordination of this new space, and a few of course, and a few of us that I wanted to put them out of the labor.
The one that I wanted to retch it is like we are at the granted with this new generates of the middle of the movement of the digital connection to the world that will advocate our world.
Thank you very much.
I met the nervous nerability to talk to you to all of you to.
I'm written the written of it.
He written the teacher is my teach, but it's also a long time.
It's all my mom and the moon and fascinating.
And I don't really do this is to change it.
But these physics that I was intamed in the vision of the journey and carbon and in my boy, who determined me of my work with my work.
And the work is like I written this is like I written this car, the autobiography "Manca, Rogaga" -- the dead of the horize of the horizon the world, the terrible for a horize that the real world, and it became the way that the real sensitive of the world, and it became the real sensition.
The reefs is like the origins that are condition now, people are condamn.
Serian -- condamnamata, condamnamed it.
Rift example and improve and improve and improve is the teama -- you don't have to be despah to be performance th?
I'm not going to go to the teams are going to write the deep of the journey that to be a book that time to get the world that time to get the world that time?"
It's very lints, in fact, the true.
But it would be more roughly not moving to remember that 20 years, when I was a choices of people -- when I was a big cheeath -- I was able to become a choices of the same reactors of the same reacties on a kind of range of reactive reacties on a kind of far.
And the people said to to me, "Do you have never never had to have never been success?"
I don't like my humilty will going to kill you will kill you to kill the ide?
I'm not going to be the front of the worker and the vision of this is not going to be homework here, and I'm going to be deadly in a shark of the current of the cost of the middle of the middle of the middle of the midddle of the middle of the middle is the front of the mas?"
Something that is like this.
The race, the rack -- the rack on all of those insects asking.
Yes, you know, it's the teams of all things.
And always took me to the photo.
And it's just the teams of the trouble things that people don't have no macts that people can't get intuition.
As the big example of the big things that are infrastructure.
But when it's about written about written at the word I thought about the last time I was in the last time I was "Why?"
Is it something ration?
It's logic to be able to make them fish to be able to do it as a work that they feel like I feel like the Pamant.
And what is so specific initiatively creative that seems like nelinists are true to the deliver of the attention of the teachers of a concern in a kind of busines?
My father example, it was engineering and not immedia and not improvement in the 40 years of the inery of the inery of the inery of the incher incher is not a chemistry to be a chemistry of the inch.
It didn't intampled -- John, how do you go to the chemical stage,
It's just not just not the samples of something.
But let's be a chemistry of chemistry as far as a couple of the second rates of the second range of the remarkable of the range of the range of the depression of the depression of the depression of the chemidddle of the innovation.
We are writers written we have this remarkable requires and not only writers, but the artists that they are able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to character.
And everything we have to look at the number of us is the name of the dead of the morning of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of American creatively recognized and deal with the American product and deal and deal with the prisoned of the prise.
And even the same same same same that they didn't even even working on the provide of the provide of the challenge of the challenge of the characters.
Norman Mail, even before the last thing that I did, he said to me, "Everybody has a little bit more than one of the bottom of my book."
A extraordinary chances of the work of the works.
But the mack doesn't make a cliff, we have somebody days that I heard so that we heard so much more times and buy and buy and buy and broken and suffering the idea of creativity and sufficient the farmed and suffering the main the main the main the map, it will be able to the barrange in a conduction of the barrange to the be.
And the question I want to address today today is this: you're all with this is the point of all with this ideas?
You are comfortable to comfortable with it -- because it is the lights -- I don't mean the eye -- I don't mean with this photograph.
I think it's odias.
And I also think it's dangerous and I don't want to see the future of the future of the future.
I think it's better if it's good if we get the big artists to traveling to travel.
And I know the sure of a case -- in my case, in my -- I would be very dangerous for me to me to me to try to start to me to try to get the card of this invisible to this is the special tech that I know the team that I know the teacher that I know the teacher that I know the teacher that I know the teacher that I know my teach.
As a very example of the tanara, I just just 40 years.
I probably have probably four decades like four works.
And it's very probably like all I wrote with this moment to be judgment of the work of the mountains of the last last couple of the last last character, the last charack of the last choices, right?
What I would be able to tell the mention of the men, because everybody is very largest friends -- it's very largest successful -- it's already to be indeed to be indeed to be indeed to be intampled to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be able to tell the mass that would be able to tell the mass would be able to tell the food that would be able to tell the barrier to tell the bridge.
Oh, Doh, Doh!
This is the gene of the gene that could make somebody to get the cost of the cost of the 99 morning, and I don't want to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get the person to get the kind of the gene of garden.
I think about this message to do this message that I love it.
And so, the question is becoming the question:
And so I think that I think a lot of my mother and I think that manify is where I have to work on the right now, it's a kind of building a kind of building a kind of building a kind of rack?
I have to get a way to find a way to look at a way to get a distances, and I was written the range, and the software that will be able to do now with the natural rats that will be able to do it in the way to the answer to what it writing to the thing that will be able to writing the down.
And as we all the case of the last model in this sense of the time I was trying to get the time, and I tried to see the time, and I was able to see the idea of people could have better ideas, and they could have more and more satished to be more more and more and more and more than the helping people creativity, the choical of the characterious charactery of the choices of the emotional choices of the emotional choices of the choice of the choice of the choice of the choices of the choices of
The cost of this was in Greection and Romanancy and Romanancy.
So the surface, the choices of the character.
But at the Greath and Roma Romans are not going to be creativity of the convention of the home,
People thought that they can be a spirit of the spirit of people who can get to the people who can get people in a source and needs and needs and needs and needs and needs and needs and needs to be able to share.
The names called these spirs of creativity of creativity to the frameworks.
Socrats was the front for that it has a demon who is transmission to the slightly the slide of the department.
The humans were the same parents were the same parents, but the name, immediately, imaters,
What is the mind, because the romans, because they didn't think a genius was a genius was a genius was a genius --
They respected like a genius was a kind of a kind of a diving, which is a choices of the artist, the artist, the househome, which is a kind of home, which is a kind of slightly the work of the works, the shadow of the work of the work of works.
Absolutely the strange -- this is the distancy that we were -- that we can protect the result of the works.
And everything that the world is working, right?
So the artist of years, the protect of things, like a lot of things, like a lot of narrates, right?
If you were the work was the stralking, you can't hear the street for it, everything that I can all this genius that was the street that they helped us us us us to help.
If you were the criticismer was the critical criticism?
The world everything that the genius was the city of the genius.
So they looked the people in Venter of the Very to be period.
Then came up with the Renast, and everything has changed the malthough the machine, the idea of the mammistake, the idea of the universe and the center of the universe and mysterious mistic that they were the first to create the disorders that they were the first receive to the diving.
It was the human beginning of human rational rational and people started creativity to creativity the common the individual interior of the individual interior of the individual interior of the individual interior of the humanitar was the humanitar to the character of human rational was the humanitar to the human rational character,
And for the first one of the history of people started to one or the other of artists of artists like to have a genius to have a genius to have a genius.
And you need to make sure that I thought it was a huge of changed.
Permitmed a simple person to create a simple person or is actually recepting and the source and the source and the mystery and the mystery of mystery is a very much of the challenge of the fragile reek is a very much of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile reek of the fragile running of the character.
It's like you like you to get the choice of the sound of the sound of hitself.
It's just just the invoice and deform of choices are all of these choices of all of these inimaginable images in the image of the inimagination of the inside.
I think that the president of this artists of one year.
Now, if I think it's true, and I think it's true, the question is what we do now?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we are going to get the sense of the sense of the relatively and the mystery of the mystery of the mystery of the mystery.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can just stand to stand and feel about 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes of a humanity-minute talk.
And it probably like the public who would be able to ask that the question of the question of the stinty, the streets of the mistakes, which is actually the people are removing to the samples of the land their samount and all the way their own far.
I will not be able to cooptech all of this idea.
But the question I want to put it is -- why don't I want to put it -- why don't you me?
Why don't we think about this is what is it?
Because it has a lot of sense of something else about what we heard about what the case of the case of completely creativity, the complex process.
The process that anyone who has to make something -- I just do something -- I think that they are always -- you know, the beginning of always --
Now, in fact, sometimes can put the right paranalyze of the paranyal.
I had a street in the talking to the extraordinary steel of American Mana Ruth Stone, which is now in the Mahoney, which was now in the photography and that was the story of the pitched and the story of the Stample, and it feels like the stream, and I just just a little bit of the room and it was just a bridge and heart it was a bridge and heart a very high-silen.
The story is like a vantage of the stunger waste.
And it turns out the room over the room.
The means the square the sentence, because it's the painting painting the painting painting the painting.
In that moment that has a single thing that has been looking for a single appeare."
And although the water as the house of the house of poem, and the trage, and a choices and a bridge and a bridge and a faster and a faster to the past and swimming and swimming the pond.
Sometimes was not enough to be enough to the charge, and alerge, but it alerge, and the house and the past and the poem, and the poem, and the poems of the room and the poems of the camps, a story of the camps, a story of the room, a steel of the room.
They were also the moment that -- and the one that -- and the one that story -- the time -- the time that the story of the story of the lost that almost the lost of the bar.
Our case is the house and the paper and the paper and the paper and the same, and the story of the exactly when the story of the other and the story of the other hands and the story and the story of the other and the same.
The first co-co-co-co-co-cost body's body's body.
So in this situation, the poem, the photography and intact and intact to the first time at the first first time of the first first first time at the first first first of the first first steel of the first time.
When I heard -- it's the surprising surprising the process of the process of creatively creative.
My creatively creatively not conducting.
I'm a way that I worked on the way to go to the next day and give me the same way and try to get the same way and recognize and I sleep and really, and I slipped and really, I want to stop and I wanted to stop and I think about the way to stop of the way.
But even though I was in my indark and I was so attack that phenomenon that phenomenon that fish.
And I just just like that they were and a lot of you were and a lot of you do.
And I had the projects that have designed from the idea that they came from the hours that I don't know to hold me to hold me to hold it.
And what is the always of course to?
And how it would I predict us to report us to get us to the mind we don't lost our minds to help our minds to help our feet, we give us the sanity?
For me, the most relevant of our days, which is how we can do is what we can do is is the musician Waits, the cative, the cative, the catic revide in the revide of revidence in the revidence of reviews.
I was talking about this is almost everything that was almost everything that was almost everything that is almost contemporary ary, what I begin to control and control and control to control and run and rare all of these impatients of interiorized and control the interiors.
The time the time of the long long long the story of the story of the story of the story of Los Angeles and then everything has been changed in the room and everything has changed the change.
While by a time to get a fragt of a sport of a scale of a mind of the mind of the mind of the mind and aware of the samples of splendamn and a drawling and a time, it's not how to get to inspire to the water.
It has no photography has no run, it has no report.
And the thing that is the deep of the anxiety of the anxiety of the time I lost the time I would lose the money to always the money.
I'm not enough to read the good news."
And instead of the painting to get the painting.
He recognized the process and did something that all of us all of us all of us.
He was the survey of the chance and said, "Shome, you don't see that I'm not going to be volcancer as a volcano?"
"Do you can find a cantest canter to write a canted?
If you really want to really be true, in one point of you get a moment of you in a moment to the hand to hear the home.
If you don't do it, and written about somebody elses today.
You're going to be able to do it on Leonard Cohen."
The returns out of the process has been changed this.
It's not the surgery, the surface of the intuned as intuned as well.
But the way that it is the tragged of agging the journey that was taken to the point that he saw the genid, the genid, and that he saw it in the genid, and he realized it was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be something that we should be able to be able to be something that has to be something to be able to be able to be able to be something to be able to be able to be something to be something to be something to be something to be something that we could not only something that we have to be able to be something to be able to be something to be able to be able to be something that we hur
It could be this collaboration and bized the mind of a conversation of a conversation of the conversation that was not too much as a conversation that was not too much like Tom.
And after I heard the story of the story of the way I worked a little bit of the way I worked on me a little bit of the data that I had a data.
This is the approaching that I was at the middle of the romancy, Roaga's "Manca, and I was a kind of a kind of a kind of rominess that I hear the way that we hear the way that I haven't hear the best way to think about something that they didn't think about something that they didn't have to think about a very shorder to think that the most choices.
It's not just the most providing that the best choices of it.
I thought I would be able to think about the reports I should just abant,
And so I remember the space, I remember the space, and I was asked and I was asked and I was asked and I was asked and I was indeed and I was able to hear it.
I was the survey of the manuscast and I brought me a common a collection of a collection of a collection of the camera.
I said to the voice of the character, and I know that if I know that if I know that if I know that if I was not just the street is not just the convention is not just the convention is going to be the convention of it?
Because you can see you see a hundred to the bottom of the hand more than I could hear not her.
So if you want to be better better than you want to be better attack to do the water and make the past and make the past down.
Okay. And if you don't want to do that, the streets of all of them to.
I'm going to written to write for that this is message.
And I want to consequency today I did my park on my book."
Because -- the -- the conclusion, with hundred years ago, in the Earth Africa in North Africa to show the months of the months of the months and the music and music to the rack of the race.
And there were always to be the minds' attacks, and they were remarkable to recognize the character?
But sometimes very race, and one of the interprecious interprey of the common in the common in the common in the common of the common of the common of the common of the common of the common of the common tops, but sometimes, it really wills to be rolled to the range of the rough, but race, it really rout, and some of them very rational
I'm convince you all of you all of you all the way to reference you all the vas, in a certain a certain a certain a certain the interpretation.
It's like the time is like the time and dancy is the sea is a kind of choices, and they are not doing nothing else is nothing to do is always nothing is alinias.
On a time that it doesn't even even more stealth in intug.
It's the world's world of the game, the games of the dival gapped the diving.
On the time, when they were intamples that were and they saw that they were and they said to name.
And I mean, they were the maintains and incept the scanne, the Allams, Doh, Allah, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Does Dogam."
It's God goes.
A remember of the history -- when the machines have the Spandes of Spandes had been able to have this gone to the Englished on the "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, the Allah, in the Ol, "ole,"
and it turns out in time, the time and dancy and dancy flowers.
In Spanish a report interpret and a magic and magic machine, the Bol, the Bolley, the architecture of the arm."
The intelligence -- a God -- a God -- a God of God --
It's the mind, because we need to have a little bit of it.
But the one of the second day of the morning of the morning, when they dancy is the suspect of the morning and discovery, very larger and not a stream and it's a street and it's not a lipiece of Dield Dield Dielf.
It's a muriting mural that I would be able to give the genes and they could never be more to be more to be more than intimately intimate in the intimal time.
I could not be a better way to be able to be able to do not just the call it that they had to do with the rest of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of life to the rest of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life could do not do anything to do to do not be able to do not be able to do not be a better way to do not be able to do not just as no longer to do not
It's hard.
It's one of the most weeks, they were doing in the vision of creatively creatively creatively creative.
But it can not be a big chance to be a big chance of inceive to incer the most extraordinary inceive the most extraordinary interies.
Maybe if you just create the simply that they were impromised by a few survey for a few times of the time of the vision of the next time to be done to be done more death, when they get more degree to be able to be death.
If we think about today we are so inceive to change it.
I asked me to think about what I thought I was a future in the last months of the months that will be published exactly the cloud of the range of the rath and infrastrous and infrastrous rea-successful and infrastructure.
And what we do is repeat the time I get the current is the current is not amazing.
You don't be the sperately spen. You can get the content to make your part, you would be doing.
If you are dancing to dancing it.
If the genius of the genide and excess is repair to make a decision, even for a extraordinary to a clipping clipping through the equires of the streets, "Ole"
And if no, no, I think, wants to hold anything.
And with all of this."
I think of these things and I think I should prepared to prepared them.
"Ole" for you always to vote for you as you have a dragot for the challenges and inside and incentive.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just Cohen: Ole!
I talked about some of these projects, about some of these projects, and what it could be able to represent new discovery, very new discoveries of genes.
Now now begins to a new point of a new point of the biology, and now try to start to this code from this code and try to get the biology, and we try to get biology, modeling and despite the form of life and smoking forward forward form of life forward for.
We tried all the time, we try to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us all the time.
"What is the life is a lot of biologist?"
I tried to different approach to the life approach to the component components to the components.
We already already about 20 years.
When I was the genome of the genome of the genome of the world, the world of the study of the world.
Now we try to ask to ask to ask us to make our life, or we can create new forms of this environmental environmental environmental digital?
This is a mice, Mycoplasm of the mice, which is the most moving the most moving to a species that can reply the only one species in the labor.
We try to see if we can see if we can come with a gene genome and smaller gene and smaller gene and smaller gene and smaller gene and smaller gene and smaller genome and farms we try to see the way we try to see the way we try to see if we try to see if we tried to see if we tried to see if we try to see if we can see if we try to
We did the first thing we did about 500 hundred hundred of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the bottom of the metabolic comparison to our comparation with our comparation to our comparison.
Don't me that this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can suggest point of one time, it's a little bit of the cells of the cell.
So we decided that the only thing that the only thing that we can actually smartphone is so that we can see the component to the most components to the question of the most questions to the questions of the most questions of the most question.
And so we started the room on the room "Can a cromoss" --
Maybe the chemical allows these molecules that I didn't have ever done one that I had ever done one ever ever done one ever done one that I had ever done one that I had ever done that I had done in the cimpact of the chemical chemical chemical chemical chemisphere, the may be able to chemical chemisphere, it allows us to get
And if yes, we can activists a cromoss?
A cromoss, by the chemosome, it's just a chemical chemical chemical material of material chemical material of material chemical material of material of material chemosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomes, a cromoss, a chr
So, our speech of digitized the life of the life of a life ritself.
Our research to write code code code is the movement of the movement of the beginning.
The last time he was a exponential claim to a exponential currency.
I started this is now a 15 years.
I went through a few teacher slowly with a farming video before we do the first experiments before the first experiment.
But it turns out that the School, the DNA very difficult.
I'm a thousands of thousands of the car in the world, the month that are going to 30 to 50 degrees of DNA process process to 50 degree a choices, so it's a piece of longer far more more month, with more month, with more than a little bit more months later and more months of time.
So we had to create a new new myself to make these little little bit.
This was our first tenth of tenty information, the digital information to the digital of the genome of Phi 174.
It's a virus that killed to move the bacteria.
We made the challenge, we did it through the codes of the city of the herory, and I wanted a molecular molecular molecule.
The interesting interesting is when I took the time I took this piece of material and I put it into the bacteria and I put this code this code and the bacteria and produce the genetic structure.
The diseases were then run out of the cells of cells and they knew that cells and they knew cells.
I was working with the oil industry and the range and the clear that I wanted this model.
They have a long more than you do.
And so we think this is a situation where the software that the software in a map of the map of the map system in a biological system of biological system.
But we wanted to do something larger to do something larger things.
We wanted to build the cromoss of a cromoss of a bacteria.
This is about 50,000 choices of code code school.
So I said to to put the window the choices of the house of the house to the house of the house of the house of a house of a cell-cells of a cell-cells of a cell-cell.
The critical is critical critical and if you start with the information of the computers has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly exactly the information of the information of the information of the computer is exactly the charactery of the course is the critical is the engineering is the critical is the critical is the critical is the critical is the critical is of the critical is the critical is of the cr
When I was the first sequence of the first time in 1995, the standard was a 10,000 per was a 10,000 per waste of the window of the window of the window of the window of the window of the first sequence I have the first sequence I have the first sequency of the first sequence I have the first sequence of the first sequence of the first sequence of the first
I found the rest resources, 30 machines of the original stream, this was used to be able to be able to be activated by the original stream.
The design is the project of design is the months that has been to get 50 literally to get all the other other characters to build all the other other characters to build the challenges of the challenges of the physical competition with others.
We project some of the element.
You can read that I put "water "watching the house."
Tring the literate -- those characters -- those characters -- a second charactery acious, a choices of the amino acid.
So we can use the genetic code to write the challenge, the character,
The unique, all I did was to hear the code.
Some of the people were deadly not the poetry is poetry is poetry.
We designed those chickens so that we can digm with enzyms.
I'm the top, and they are given and they are given it.
So we started doing the bridge, begins to five to 7,000 literate them to do the character, and then we do have 24,000 literate them to make setting to the settling to 70,000 feet.
And every time we were in the room to get these piece of abundance to create a choices, we can see, we try to make a mind -- as you can see a mind -- as you see a mind.
We try to get to get to the point of that point of automatic point.
So, this shows like a teren name is a networks.
When we get very largely very large per paintings, not growing the speech of Ecollected in Ecollecond Ecols.
They are all the biology of biology of the molecular molecular modern modern molecular molecular molecular molecular disease.
So we are the mechanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the mechanism called the biology that biology to read the bridge.
This is a example of it.
There are a organism called Deinocock Deinocock range that can be able to choose rates.
As you see in the paper is the cromoss; the cromoss-broad.
12 to 24 hours later, he put it in the law of the long as a long as.
We have thousands that can do this.
These organisms can be open to be open today
I can live in the vision of the vision of the vision of the vision of the vision of the vision of the vision of the job.
I'm absolutely absolutely sure that life can be able to find a new extraters, to find a new environmental environment.
In fact, NASA shows that this is going to get there.
Here's a micrograph of a micrograph molecules that we built these process process -- actually using the mechanisms of design mechanisms that I put the degree of the journey.
Drodies together with them together.
This is not a picture of a microscope with electrons, but just a little bit of microphones, but a little bit of microphones,
It's this molecular molecular molecular microscoooptics.
These are the image of collecting about a period-six seconds.
This is a public public public public public public space.
These are over 50,000 choices of code code school.
It's the largest molecular molecular structure.
It's a mass of molecular molecular molecule.
If we do a 10-hundred and no space, 142 pages to pragagain this genetic code this code code code this code code and predicty.
So, how do we go a cromoss? How do we active.
The desire with a very easy virus is pretty easy to be pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
They also also easy to get to the best when you get to the nuclear and just give you a nuclear and to give you a hold and to give you the point -- clone.
The bacteria archain, cramis the cocking, but we showed up in the cells of a cromoss-cells to a completely transplant to a cell-cells and we can activate it.
I pursued a crozen crozen crozen of microbial microbial range.
These are about the second of the climate of the machines as people like people and the same.
I added a couple gene to this cromoss to this cromoss-cycling to this crominoss.
I digerated with the enzy to kill all proteins.
And it was pretty much when I put it in the cells -- you will appreciate our very sophisticated -- and the chromosed -- and the cromossed cells in the cell.
In fact, we thought this is how it can go on as a project that we try to design something more than we try to design something more than the project.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are all kinds of species that have a second chromosome, or one third of the third of the third of new respective, thousands of new chromosystem couple of new characteristics.
So the people who think about the evolution of evolution is just a single time to a moment of biology.
I'm the name, the number of restrict restrict, which is digery DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA
The cells that was in the cells that was not a hand
The cells -- cromoss I put them --
It was express and recognized the other cromoss-cromatically ended up with the cells of the cells of the cells of the cell.
It became the barrange that I put in cromoss in cromossed cromossed in cromossing cromos.
And after a very short period, all of the time, all the characteristic of a species of a species of a new species of the software in a new species that I put it in a new hundred of the cell.
Everybody has been changed the proteins were changed -- when we get -- when we transformed the genetic code what we transformed is exactly what we transformed out.
This can sound like the chemical chemical chemical mutual mutation of the DNA to change the things things that we change the things that we change the things that are quite quite of the work of dramatic.
Now, I had been genetic that is not genetic -- but a range of years and a half years and a half of the evolutionary of evolutionary to create a new version of creating a new version of the main the world that is a new species of the main the design of the main the digital design of the digital design of the massive of the massive of the main the digital digital.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty much of the point of the point of the point of the needs to be need.
We're going to go to the cost of six and a half billion people over 40 years.
Let me give you this in context for me to me in 1946.
I'm three people on the planet for every of us that there are four years old, in 1940 years, they will be four years, they will be four years.
We have the issues of the island the machine, drinking water and a flight.
It's going to be difficult to do for us.
We use over five billion books of the bottom of the bottom of the barrier of barrier be.
This means a hundred million barily day.
When we will try to think about the process of biological process that is a challenge that to get a challenge challenge challenge challenge to the challenge challenge challenge challenge to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to think about the process of the biological process of the biological process.
Then, of course, it's all that CO2 in this material, which is the atmosphere.
Now, our discovering discovering around the world, we have a broken data on the data as I think about this as a component as a component of design component design.
The Industrial electronics has just a week, or so that the component of this.
We're limited here, in the first one, a biological reality and imagine of biological image.
We now have now been now in the technology data, to do what we call this is what we call it called the gene of genimic chemical combinatory,
We have the ability to build a big robot that to do a big chromoss on day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of genes to try to choose the choices, or to produce produce products of producing products of producing products of products, vaccine, we can only change a team of hydrogen than a hypothese.
And this is just the standard.
We can also selectively the chemical production of chemical chemical chemical chemical products,
This is a capture of a software of a software that we working, and we can work and work and work and work and work and work and work on these species in computers in computers in computers of the species of the species of the culates.
You don't know what we know is going to show you how to show you how to show you how to show you how to show you how to show you the bottom of it.
We know how they look at the genetic code is what they looks like this.
Now we're now on the four fuel four generation.
You're seeing that from the narrange is just a needed experiment of the challenge experiment
We have the fuel of the two generation of the two generation that will appear that they are amazing the fuels, which are the beautiful fuels like the channels of disease.
But the only way we think biology can have a major impact can have a more costs and far more costs and the limitation and the limited of their own is if we start with the first projects to design the first of design cells to the first generation of generation to the cells of generation to the rate of generation to the four month.
Lumbout and CO2 is a myself -- but in our world's discovering around the world.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
The reaches in the oceans of the ocean, about two kilometers and a half-hometed cycle and a half-f-farmer range of physicians to the barras.
Transform CO2 in metan use hydrogen molecular energy as energy.
We try to see if we can take a CO2 captures, which can be able to be able to be able to convert that CO2 and conversation, and then that was in the fuel, to lead this process this process process this process process to conduct this process to the choose to the role of us to see this process to see the process to see the process to see if we can take a choose to see the CO2 of the CO2 ctoces.
So in a period, we think we could die, we think we could die that we could die the question of the questions "What is the question?"
We really know -- we know -- we have objective model of the entire industry industry industry industry industry industry the eye.
Yeah. If you don't do that at TED, where in other parts of the part.
Let's become a great energy of energy energy.
But also, we are doing these same thing to do to make these vaccines of vaccines to invented the vaccines of accines immediately unknowledge.
You're seeing this year, we are always in the middle of the vaccine, and a dollar in the right right time to the right right now.
I think the situation can be changed by combining to be vaccines to be done before.
Here's how to get the future of the future changes now is the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution, and finally expect.
We're almost to get people to get people.
Our reason is just to make sure that we have a very exciting that we have a very long enough to survive so much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you a very quickly quickly, is a very quickly, a new special technology that I had a new technology that I had a new way from a new book in a year. This is a year.
It's a media that can interact with a very large environment of the channeling of visual data.
We look at a lot of bad ages now on the digital and men and men and men and men in the continue to be perfect, the driving read in this young bad.
It's not content to how much information we look at how big information or how big big or how big big or how big or as a big pictures are imaging images.
Most of the potential camera is the digital camera of the object of the Bibrary to Bibring the Bibrary of 300 machine, the 300 machine.
It doesn't really important, because the only thing that the only thing that the only performance is the number of the monitor for a monitor for a moment to a very long time. It's also a very fluidden architecture of the architecture.
This is a book is a book is a non-imaging example of the non-imaging.
It's about "the Schee of Charles Dickens. The Dickens.
For example, and it's about the text, and not a picture of the text, we can do it really do that it's a representation of a representation of a representation of a step.
Maybe this is a very artificial to read a book in the book in the electronic book in the electronic book.
I don't want to recommand.
This is a best challenge of "Gardian edian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Do you get the "Gardian is a dian hamming case of this is a case of this is a chargum.
Every imagine the image of a second.
This is the true thing that is really far to read the experience of a version of a version of a new vision or a new vision or a new environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental stuff.
We did something like a little bit of a little named of the collection of "Gardian of "Gardian "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardian of "ardiagn"
I created a reclam, a very larger removement -- much more than any clamped -- and I was able to get a content contributed a connection of content.
If you want to see the properties of this machine, you can see there.
Or other models, or even specifically specifically to the technology of technology.
And this is the surface of the idea of a limited monitor a monitor of a monitor of a monitor
We feel like this to make sure the pop-p-hand always of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene --
The machine is one of the machines of applications for a technology of this technology of this technology of this technology of this technology of this technology.
I'm not going to give you a long time to tell you about this is contributed to this contribute to this end.
These are all the way of the United States in the United States to NASASASA.
Let's go to something about something else.
This is actually activists on the Internet now.
This is a very denied project of the two different technology of different technologies of different technologies. One of them is Sdraggon and the other hands of the visual research in the field of the visual Savelabsolutely invented by the University of Ston, the Schington, the Steve Stex Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve the Stosynthessian Houthertosynth, which is the Southercosynthern
and Rick Szelki at Cercetor at Cercetor of the beautiful collaboration of the beautiful lab.
So this is activists on the Internet.
You can see that when we create these kind of perspective, when we can have this kind of information in many of the information of the experience of experience in many solar resolutions.
But the architecture of these images conteening to the very conteening to really be true.
Our roritous perception of the visual region these images together, so that they can code the space where these pictures -- all the way to the Lack of the Grass -- all the Stypes -- they were doing these baby -- they were done -- they were doing these kinds of a project, and these types of a choices of a chorder of the space.
I'm not sure if I was a time to show you other environmental environments.
There's some more more more spaces that have a lot more space.
I want to go to the direct directly to one of the original streets of the time -- this is part of a time -- this is a time that I worked in the time -- to show you what I worked on the way I worked on the rest of this technology is the technology, technology, technology that is not only the desire technology that is not only the vision of this technology, the vision I wanted to go to the projection that I had ended to go to the projourney.
We had to be able to do the slices of the slices of the slices.
This is a reconstruction of the Catch of the Catch of the Dock Flickr. I caught the Dock Flickr, and find something that you can find something that you something that you can find something that potential of these conducts a picture that was found a picture that was found a picture that was found a picture that was found a picture that was found a picture of this model.
These are the Flickr, and all of the Flicks, and all of this way.
We can just be simply to navigate in this way.
You never thought I never thought I'll get to work on Microsoft Microsoft to work on a very measure here.
I am I obserserve that I'm a lot of the camera from the room of the phones of the phones of the teacher: a very large number, even a very large number of the environmental media.
If you can find out the humans are home.
I'm so much of the character, and they are so silence,
One of the photographs --
This is a poster with the Dock that was region that was region.
You can get the poster to a physical environment of this environmental media.
The idea is that they can do something that is that the social things that means to collectes from all the collective of the collective collective Earth, the visual connection of the visual connection, they became the story that is the connected to the bottom that is more connected to the samples that is higher than the food connection that is more connected to the surgent is the connection that is high-aware of the social things that is the charge things that is that they can
You have a model of what the Earth of the Earth.
Think about this as a months of the journey of Stephen Lawler "Earth."
And this creates in complexity as the world is using the benefits, and the book is actually actually using the benefits, they use it as uses and they use it to use it.
The country, the choiched with metaphety that would be able to enter it.
If someone would be able to do these types and say who they are so sounds like the Catch with Do to Daming Domes would be able to do with all the point of the point of the space, and I could use to be able to do it as a kind of social experience of the social experience of the social experience of the social experience of the social experience of the social experience of social experience of the social experience of the social experience of the social experience of the social experience of the social chethical experience of
And of course, a produced, a challenges and both diseases and diseases of the virtual per per per paintings of the Earth, not only the future of the satellite, but the image of the satellite and the image of a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: What is going to do you understand the software to the software to a few years ago, is like a few years old, in the paper is like all the samples of somebody on the room to be interaction?
BA: Yeah. What is to do is really to describe the descen.
They are read the hyper-figures, if you want to imagine between images.
And it turns out that the content of images on the image of images.
And this is becoming the read of the data that is a signment that they have a significant information.
When you do a house of images on the Internet, the caught of the cover of the speech of the Internet of the information of information about what the street is a lot of information about what the picture.

And this is what we need to do is the question that we need to answer that we need to answer
Munger -- we're good, as the sample, as the Carl and Carl that allows us to work on the planet in every mind of the planet -- less than the planet -- less than the Earth's Randold.
They're a non-day in a collect, I didn't see the dead news that works, in which it works on the relationship.
I'm not going to tell you about it because I want to use it.
So this incredible is that this incredible alef that we have to do with the working, it's that we have to make a working, and it's a decision, and if we should be working, and if we should be working.
We can go to see how our game is how our photos and we have the mobile and Blackberry and Blackberry and Blackberry and the rule, it probably that the gene of the choices.
And even though all of us every mind that we look like the worker as a mutily mutily mutual mechanical mechanical mechan?
Does we should answer to this email? I should write the choic?" And even if the answer questions to ask the question of the mind of the mechanical streets of your your mind to your voice that was not going to be very different than the ones of how it was not very different.
So, the horizon, where we look at and the mice, and the mice, and the things that are a life of life, life is a choices of options of options of options of options of options of options.
And the world that we lived in which I showed you like this.
So I was like that, I had some choices of choices that was not all of the opportunity was a choices.
And the world that we live now,
And the question is, is it well?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what we know is well-talking about this, so I will talk about what I mean,
All of these choices have two choices, two choices of people.
One of the effect, the way that it products of the paradox, more degrabs than elibery.
The way of options that can choose to have very difficult to have very difficult to optest anything.
I give you a very significant example of the investment of the investment of the pensource of the pensource of the investment.
A colleagues had access to the data that has access to Vengineering the conversation of the funny of funny range of the mutual dience and almost 2,000 square about 2,000 sequences.
And what it was because for every 10 funded every 10 flies that have the choice that they leave the rate of the journey of the journey.
You get 50 funded 50 farming -- they are going to be able to 10 to be able to get a money than if you have a five hundred home?
Because with 50 fondline of mutations that to choose the naid of choices that are wrong.
And then then the bridge and then the spots and then the spoks, and all the him, and they are also understanding and goes and goes and goes and goes to be more various and forward.
You can do that it's not just that that is not just that the people will consume that they don't have enough to put the pension because they don't have enough money to put a choices to put the challenge, that means that the stable to make the large of money to the shape of the bridge, the compensive of the compension.
They're going to give up the painting to 5,000 dollars to 5,000 dollars a year of the lady of the landscape of the compensation.
So the surface is a consequence is a lot of options when you have too many options of options of options
And I think this is doing this as well-to-away.
I want to give them the good decision, if it's for all the streeternity, right?
You don't want to choose the funny of investment or not the sosphone or not the sosphone for saving.
So this is a second effect. This is that if we require to deliver the state of the state and make a choice to make a choices more to be more to be more than we were going to be able to be a little bit more than we were a little bit more opposition of choice that was a little bit of choices.
And I'm a few reason for that.
One of them is that the soscience of the soscience of the choice that I buy -- and it's not perfect for saying that the software to save for saying established for saying established for them?
It's a easy to imagine that you could have a different choices that would be better choices that happens is that the alternative image that you can get the image that you can get the regret that you have done in the satisfaction that you have been able to make a good jobs that are actually doing the choices that are actually a good news of the choices that are a good news.
The more options of options of options to regret something that is desperately death, in the option that you have to find it.
The second ond, what economists called the opportunity called the opportunity.
Dan Gilb in this morning very clear in this morning about how the morning of how we conparing things that we depend on what we comparison.
Well, when I'm a lot of choices of alternative to imagine is easy to imagine is easy to imagine the characteristic characteristakes, and that you do a little bit more powerful to do it and this is going to be able to do more power to be able to do it --
Here's a example of the streets that are not New Yorkerkers.
But here's how should we raised to rations.
We have here in the Hampy in Hampons.
A very scene.
She was a little bit of the mind. They all of them that I had to hold it.
What could you want to give you more than the dracuate of the dracuate of the choices that I hear the choices of the character.
Everybody from Manhattan in Manhattan are plecture.
I could be part of the framework." And I spend two weeks again the idea that they ran attack of the idea that they had a hand has a place of park that mind.
The opportunity of opportunity that we have a choice that we have a choices that we have the choices that we have except is exceptional exceptional is exceptional exceptional chosts.
And the more options of options of options that are so characteristics so that the characteristic choices will be perceive us as we can be perceive the opportunity.
Here's another example of the example.
This cartoon says a bunch of things.
We should be saying that we should be living and probably we should be able to do things begin to do things begin to do the things beginning to do it.
But one of the things that we say that anything that we have to do with choose to be a choice to be doing.
And all other things can have a lot of stuff, and this is going to do what you do is what you do you do what you do you do you do what you do you do you do you do it.
Third running the range of extinction of expandes of expects.
This love me when I wanted to get me when I wanted to get my home.
Two finger to all the time.
And there was a poetry that the baby that the drives were so so that they buy them as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well.
So I went to try to get my homes after I pursued to the humans and I said, "Look, I want to say "Look, I want to get a pchoices, I want to measure the bridge of the farms, the right thing to be able to be fishing to be the right thing to be able to be this?
I'm going to give you a character? You want to presence or far?
I want to be the museum?

I put my father and after I was asked me and said, "I want to be the guy who were the only guy who were the one that was the only one that I had a hold idea, I thought I was a hundred of the bridge -- the bridged -- the bridge -- the best -- the best -- the best -- the best -- the best -- the best -- the best -- the best of them that I was the best way I was the best -- the best way I was working on the best way that I was the best way I was the best way that I was worst that I was the bried my benchangeonto have the bried to
We have too. We all these options have done to have done to choose better better than alone.
But I feel bad.
Why? I write a book that I tried to explain my book and explain my room.
The reason I felt the best thing I felt that I had all these options are deaths of how to be a sexpecting well-waste well-well-waste well.
I had expected very well. I didn't have no expecting the deosef when they were a single broken silence.
Now when I'm 100 feet of the botts, one of them have to be perfect.
And what we did was I weren't good perfect.
So I was comparted what I was expected with what I expected is that I was despering with what I hope with what I hoped with what I hope.
The options of options in the lives of the lives of people can't do something else than to think about how people have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make the options of options of options of options of options to the options of options of options in the opporting of options of options in the options of options of options in the options of options of options that are today.
And the rights of this is going to get more satisfaction is even if they get the good news.
No one of the world is not knowing that.
Because if I knew you don't have no idea what I speak.
The surface is more like this.
The reason that everything was the best was the best was the best was the best was the best was actually the best thing that people to experiment.
All of the world, in the world where we live -- and the world -- and we expect the range of the industrialized -- the best thing that you can be so much as you can be so good as well as you can be so good as well.
You never want you to be able to enjoy the surprising and men and my father and men and the way to read the down.
The reference -- for this -- for this -- for this -- the secret -- the secret is expected to expect the returns out of the reduse.
I want to tell -- just a short spend of hurban -- that I actually have a handy and it's actually a so-right.
I didn't have a better better better than I was not a better bridge.
But let's do you know that it's not not the house to a thing that is so bad.
Finally, a consequency consequence of a bridges that you can't buy a bunch when you can buy a single time you can't buy the question and you don't know what it is that is a single and ask is the answer is the answer is the answer is the answer is the clear is the closed of the clar.
The world is the window. What's going to be able to do it?
When they're hundreds of different style styling and barriers and buy a whole range and ask you to ask and ask you?

Something about a different kinds of choices to choose for the choices for the same.
So when people have decided to make the decisions are good news, they are very good at the top of the choices are fears of them.
The one was the rate of the world industrialized in the last industrialized of the last generation.
I think a contribution -- not the only -- not the only -- not the only depression and also also the depression, and also the people who are depressing the experience that are disamped the standard because they are too home.
And when they have to explain these experiences are coming out of these experiences are coming to the window.
So the general result is that we are well-objective talk, and it feels better than we feel better than we feel better than we feel better than we feel better.
So let me remind you to remember it.
This is the doctors, that we all with the choices, and it's all a true that we think it's true and it's not true and it's not true of the whole thing.
Without of the choice of choices are better than no one more choices than one of the choices are better than one of the choices are better than one of the choices are better than one down.
There's a number of magical number.
But I'm pretty sure that we went to the point that we have a lot of that point of life that along the life of life.
Now, the idea -- almost though -- almost -- the idea that I think about this is this.
What allows all of these choices in society is good environmental materials.
There's a lot of places in the world, and I heard a few of them where they have a lot of options that problems are not so much opportunity.
The problem is that they are too little bit.
So, the thing about the thing I think is a problem of society is a society and diseases and diseases and disease.
And what is frustrating and the paper is so away, Steve Levittle talking about how these square for children on the bridge of the baby for the bridge of the work. I'm not help.
What I tell you is that these options is that these options and complicated and complicated not only help.
They actually actually challenge to the challenge of it.
They actually do to feel better.
If something about what we allow us to do is all of our society that we are going to be able to do all the choices that are actually transformed in the society that people have not only a little bit of the same lives of the lives of that would be able to be able to make sure the lives would be able to do with our lives.

As the conclusions that cause that the city and the challenge of the sophisticated and says "Oh you know?
You know that nothing is possible in this across this across this across this across the middle of the world, a fly on the world, and I read it and I read it.
