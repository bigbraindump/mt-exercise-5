And the year I showed these two diapositive to demonstrate the polar of the polar polar that the big polar from the last three million years of the last three million years of the big dimension of the 48 percent of the big 48 percent of the large of four percent of the big states of the 40 percent of the big 48 percent of the awful counts.
But this morning, this is special special problems because it doesn't look at the gross of the gross of the guy.
The polar is from is from a way, the heart of the climate system, the heart of the climate system.
She was expected and contraction and contract.
The Urimate that the diaxing that I will show you a quick of what was happened in the last 25 years.

We have to get fast, quickly.
Thank you very much of it very much of it.
Last year, I did a very well to LHC.
And we promised to come and give you a little bit of how it works about how it works apart.
So here is the mass that were not here, the biggest of the most experiment is the most experiment that was certainly experiment that was certainly 27 kilometers -- Cirumms is to create the conditions of the present of the world to the ground of the universe -- the flight of the universe -- the six billion times a seconds.
It's extremely ambitious.
This is the south of the Geneva.
We are making photos "Big Bangs" in the decades.
I work on this. It's called the ATLASTLASS, LASSS, Four AS, 22 meters of 22 meters of the ATASS, a photography here in building the proportion of the proportion of the proportion of it.
On the year of the year, we started to the first past for the first time.
And this image was made by ATLAS.
It caused a huge cycle, in the room in the room
It's a picture of the first fascent particle of particular particular system that has been the intreatment of the system of LHC, the deliberately deliberately deliberately detector.
In other words, when I was seen that when I was stuck at 10 sex seper that apart that has been a huge successful apart.
And I don't know that the larger has got the larger ovative or that, when someone went on the page of the first page of the first page of the first page of the first page of the first page shows that the first of all.
It means that we made a cultural impact on the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the street impact of that we did a culture of that we did a culture of that we did a culture of a cultural impact of the cultural impact of the cultural impact of the cultural impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact impact impact impact impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact impact impact impact impact impact impact impact of the impact of the impact of the impact impact impact of the impact impact culture of the culture of the impact culture
After about a week of a seapart with a problem with a problem that has had been dealing with these fires.
These are the 13 thousands of both when the apart works on power to power to power to power to power in power to power to power to power
Now, the engineers in the room and said, "I can't transsport: "I can't transsport."
But I can do that for the time when they're at the temperatures become what was called the superconducting.
So as a garden, as a deep of the street between stream and those are those are those are these are these are these are these things.
At one of the laws between the 9,000 magnetic magnetic magnetic fields in HC, was a fabricatic defect.
So the common has been a little bit of a little bit of a bottom of electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressive to the magnetic field of magnetwork, and they have been funny about 30 chases 30 chas.
So we deteriorated about 50 percent of the magnetic magnetic magnetic field.
We had to take affair, which we do.
We had all reconnected them on the top of all.
And now we take the magnetic magnetish in subterms of subteran.
The big web at the big stage of the large of LHC will be like new this.
We will start to go back and then, and we have to get our data or hyth, and we will continue to keep the research to try to fix the research to find the ends.
Now, of course, in a way, those those accidents reopen talking about the important important engineering and engineering engineering to break at the extremely to rejected it.
I think the data, I think of that is so difficult so hard to be done with the fact that we have you have the important experiments like LHC.
I'm going to lask that the inches of a words of a stify of a stify of the experimental inside, I think of the protect of the protect of the protect of the protect of the protect of the minds of mind-dangerous for our minds of minds are not longer to the such human minds are not the ends.
Thank you.
I wanted to start with the range to remember of the childhood of childhood with board with board with board books.
And as you know, what you invite them to get them to get them to get them and get them to get them and make them do you have learned how to find how to figure out how to figure out how to figure out how they have to solve and the spaces.
The space, the space, the profound as intelligent how we intelligent a lot of the world inconnection.
So, as a research of IT research, the inspired by this useful behavioral objects -- impressing with the physical objects -- and my collaboratory -- I started to get me -- I began to Kalani Kali Kalaans -- it would be able to use a computer of the mouse of the mouse that we can use a death of the mouse of the mouse of the mouth-inspiring of the couple, and we would be a mammoths to the maps of the moth,
Audience?
And the question was so fascinating that I was asked to ask the answer to the answer the answer to the Siftable.
As a Sift-figure is a computer of a bisure.
They can be manufactures, they can perceive the recipropal of one of the altest one and a wide of a wireless and a wireless.
The most important is that they're palpable to be the game, so you can miss them as just as you can miss them as just approaching them.
And Siftables of an example of an ecosystem of a new enemies of digital manipulation of digital manify of digital manify of digital maniftables of digital ftables of a new gype.
On the mass of what these instruments are becoming more palpable to do their food constants one of the other one of the other active non-to-driving and new consties on their active and degrees of interactive and destruction to explore new and new degrees of interactive and deal with new interactive and degrees and determining with the instrument of what these tools are becomes more palters and constantly constituted,
I would start with some simply examples of simple.
This is the Sift-present is configuring video of video of video of a direction, if they could include the film in the same way that if they were including the other parts of the park of the parks.
These portrait are constatic constantly one of the other.
So, if they put them on the other side of the other things.
If they're inconjured and that, and they can become a little bit of confusion.
And I can also feel and including and inclining.
We realized that one of the interesting of interactive implications is that we can use the baby of manipulating the manipulation of manipulation like a culture like we had a license of how we could culture a lhid.
In this case, we have three Siftables configure out as the galeons and they can use them to the center in the centre, where they will ames;
If I was too much to be able to charge the case of the case of it.
There are also also possibility for education for education for education, as a game and logs like we want to give people the possibility of the possibility of possibility to try to see the results of the immediately immediately the results.
So here -- this is a slightly smart that I do with a simple program with a simple program of equatic equatic program.
So here we have a game of words, kind of combination to Scrab, and Bogging and Boggle.
Every first time, every single taste a literally literally every Siftable, and on the mother of what I try to form work, they're going to be the greater with a dictionary.
And then after 30 seconds 30 seconds of literally set of literally set of literally smart and new possibility of literally choices.
Thank you.
These are the baby of the kids who came to the Media, and we had to do the Media, and I had to try to take them to the film and filming them a material.
It lived on the neighborhood.
And one of the interesting of this kind of applies of applies is that you don't need to give people a lot of instructive.
All of you have to say, "From words, and they know what to do.
Here are some other people are intriguing people intritributes.
This is the most tank, our tester in the right right in the right right now.
It seems like everything that had been to push it was to take a Siftable.
So for them, they were just runs.
This is a application of animation applies.
We wanted to build a tool for the people who invent languages.
And this is Fellow Fellow Fellow Fellow
He can get new character, just the stage, just ridiculous, just the Siftables that affairs.
Here are the sounds of sound.
Video: The race.
David Merrill: Now he wrote a traction,
Video: The broken portle.
Good good. Yeah!
Siftses and Sifts' and assing one can do the characters of the characters -- Video: Ham!
DM: I create their narrative.
Video: Hehy!
DM: It's a final story, and he decided to be drawing how it will be draft.
Video: Zara, the pish.
DM: The next example I showed you to show you is a today and interpretation is a beautiful music that we built the music that we built the sound that we built the role of the sound like Sift and all the role of the sound like Sift and bas they were rolled and bas well.
Each has four various various various various choices, you want to use it to use it.
And you can inject the sound of sound that you can assemble it that you can ask you can ask what guys you will.
You can also sound the sound of the sound of a Siftable-Sift Siftable Siftable Sifts.
There are effects that you can control the live and filters like the philter.
You know, you have a certain a certain sound and then they can help it sounds to take it to the help of the air.
It looks like the general effects like the tempt and the volume of sequence of sequence of sequence
Video: M: M: Well we start with a Siftables in two successful arrow in a series, we have been in a series, we have ritted rhitter, a ritself.
Now a basic line.
Video: Now I add the potential purpose.
Video: And now I'm going to add the filter, to take the tober, to control the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the form of the form of Videoto: My : DM: M: M: M: M: And now I'm going to address: And now I'm going to address: And now I'm going to address to address the movie to address
Video: Maybe grabs the square the inclining of the second inclining in a part or other.
Video: Now I'm going to attack to the move to more expression.
Video: I can do the section of research in time as a quantly.
So I don't have to do the plane in prealable and improvise, I can improvising or short in the walking.
Now, unfortunately they can estompet the second second the Siftable-volume, included in the stange.
Thank you.
As I see, my passion is creating new interfact of new interface, the very computer that works better with the way that it works and the body of the brain and the body of our brains and the body of the brain.
And today, we had a time to show a coordination of this new space, and a couple of design, and a couple of possibilities that we tried to get out of the lab.
The Ganding that I would have to retinent the new generation is that the new generation of instrument with the middle of interactive interactive middle of our world that will bring our world of our world world has been able to get our information in our world has been able to get our world of our rules of the world that will bring our world to the world the world of our world that we want to make it to make the new world of our world that new world of
Thank you very much.
Astep with the nerable to talk to you with you to.
I'm writing.
It wrote is my own profession, but it's more than that.
It's all my love and fascinatory and fascinating.
And I don't have this took that this is to change it.
But these figure out something like he was really bad in the living in my life, and in my career and in my career and my career and my career with my relationship with my relationship with works.
And the amazing thing I wrote this boograph of the boography of "Manca, Rog, Rog, Dorm." And Iubster terrorists of all of my cards of the books of the world for a little bit of the world for a little bit of the world for a sensitive sentising world.
The reultly is that anywhere where I go right now, people are going to be damn.
Serio-hero-condamnature, damnature.
From example of ingroom, and I say, "You don't have the themselves are the themselves that you may not have to be able to depass that you could have the performance of this?
You don't have the team is going to keep your life to write your life at the flow of your life, a book that time to put a book on that time?"
It's very links, indeed insight.
But it would have been more running if I was not always to remember 20 years ago, when I was a great excited people -- as I was adolish -- as I was adolish -- as I want to get the same way -- as I want to get the same based on a bear of the same based on a such front of a broken of the same books.
And people said, "Not that you have no longer than you have no success?"
You don't have the humans will rejection will kill you?
You don't have the fear of working in your life, you will have no story and nothing that you don't have to get themselves here and not going to deadly deadly deadly on a farming death of the center of the center of the midle of the center of the midddle of the average of the midle of the engine?"
Something like this.
The answer -- the answer on all those insects questions is "Yeah."
Yes, it's the themselves of all these things.
And it always step.
And it's just the themselves in many other things that people can't get macross the people who can't get them to not maccounts.
As a great example of the big alge, and other things that are infront of things that are infrastructure.
But when I was talking about written about writing and what I was all about in the last time is "why?"
Is something rational rational one?
It's logic as anyone to have this tool to be the themselves that they feel like it was enough.
And what is so specific initiatively initiatively that seemed in the sanitation of the sanately mental sanaters in a way in a way in which other way in a way in which other professionals don't do it?
My father, for example, was a chemist and they don't remember the 40 years of team in the 40 years of chemicals that they were asked to the chemistic engineer to be asked to be a chemist.
It wasn't happened -- John, how do it go, how do it good?
It just doesn't have to go to the same thing.
But to be honests, the engineers, the engineers have not been able to chemists have been able to choose to be alcoolic to be alcools.
We write a street, about this reputation and not only writers and not only writers like this reputable reputable reputable to be powerful as this reputable reputable lab.
And all we have to look at the number of dead morning, the basis of the subject of the Mindle 20, in the Mind's Deep of the mind of magniff and delivering and often often by young and often often in the own own own own own own own own own own own own own dle of the own stream of the own death of the case of the samples of dead dead disease.
And even those who didn't have honest to have the own own own own stream of the own stream of the own talent of the own talent.
Norman Mail, even before the last dignose, he said, "Each one of my books me that killed me to have a little bit more than I knew a little bit more than I would knew a little bit more than I would have a little bit more than I would have a little bit more than that.
A great extraordinary of work on a life of a life of mountains.
But it doesn't have the clip when we hear somebody says, because we heard these things so that we heard of things and they buy and they buy and they buy and they have absorbed and suffering the idea that creativity and suffer in the map, the idea of the southern artists and as argue the enough.
And the question I want to address today today is you know, you are all of the impact of impatients with this ide?
You are comfortable with it -- because the light of the light of the light of the light of the light of the ipo.
I think it's odias.
And I also think it's dangerous and not want to see it in the future of the future.
I think it's better if you incurrently better if you have the big artists to live the artist of artists
And I know that the case of the case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start to me to get my insurance to the needs of this indeed of this ipost, especially of this ipost, particularly tests that I know that I know about professional tests now to be teaching my professional hands.
As a tank, I'm just quite about 40 years.
We probably probably have the four decades.
And it's very likely to write everything I wrote with this moment to be judge as a work that came to the strange of my successful monkey to the last last last bridge of my neighborhood of the last cou?
What would be to say the far from the mention of the kind of all of the way we are already -- it's very likely to be the largest successful of my successful was already to be intamed already.
Oh, God, what gand!
This is the kind of gold that somebody to do somebody to get the flow of the morning, and I don't want to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person could do that person to make that person to do somebody to get that person to make somebody to do somebody to make that person to make it on the home of the kind of well.
I would do it continue to do this message that I love love I love love
And then the question becomes the question, the question?
And so I put it on a lot of meditative meditative in which I have to work now, to write now, it's by making a kind of psychology is by protective protective protective, right?
I got to find a way, to find a way to find a way to be a distant distant to me, the one, and the team, the one, and the themselves that written nature, which is going to be now led to what I write a long ago to what I write what I write a way to look at what I write a way.
And as I was all the last year in this last year of models to try to find out the time to find out the time to find other society to see other society to see if we could have better ideas if we could have better ideas that they could have better ideas to be more sanitation about how people create better than how to do it to find people to think about how the emotional art of the emotional art.
This was this to Greece and Roma and Roma Roma and Roma Roma and Roma Roma
So the mass of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the mass.
But in the Great Rome, and the Rome, and the Rome, and the people don't believe that creativity of the human interior the kill?
People believed that creativity was a spirit of the people who were able to be able to define the inside of a source and needed to understand needed to understand needed to understand needed to understand needed the intelligent to the reason to the reliable people thought and neighborhood of creativity was a spirit of creativity was a spirit of creativity was a spirit of creativity was a spirit of the creativity of the inside.
The Great these spirit comes from creativity of creativity of creativity with the fair."
It was the famous was the famous because it was a demon that the intelligence of the intelligence in the departs.
The same research, but they called the same spirit of creative, but they called creatively creatively creatively --
What is wonderful, because the romants were not that a genius was a genius was a genius was a genius of a kind of waste.
I had a kind of a kind of a magicity of magicity in the proper of the study of the artist of artist, and he sent the Dobby, and he sent the machine, and insession, and insession, the artist of artist in the work, the model, the model, the model, the model, the model, the model.
Absolutely strange -- that's distantly distantly about -- that build psychological building that you can protect the result of your work.
And all the world that the way that it worked, right?
So the artist was protected by certain things like for example, for example, too much narcism, right?
If you could work was the stralose, you couldn't have the same worker for her, all the way you had this kind of such as you had helped you to help you to help you to help you to help.
If you were criticized, it wasn't the completely well.
And all the world of the genius was kind of ignorant.
And they looked at the West creativity for a long time.
And then he came up with Renast, and it has always been the big idea of idea, the idea of the big idea that the great human beings to the universe of all the way that the universe and mysters, the far and mystical mysters, the far that they get the horrible for creatures that they get from divings to divings that they get from diving.
It was beginning to the rational rational and people have began to creativity that creativity of the individual interior.
And for the first history, people have before they started to get to one or the other, in one or the other of artists like a genius to have a genius to have a genius of a genies.
And you have to make a huge was done one was done one error of mass.
Permitand someone who is actually creating a simple simple person or it is actually receiving and the source and the essentially and the source and the source of mystern, creatively a little too much of the responsibility is a little bit of the human-fragile of the human.
It's like you to take a few some of the sound of sounds to type the sound of sound.
It just just incovoid and deforms of equipping all these inimages of these inimages on the performance.
I think this pressure has been the artists of the last 500 years of the last 500 years.
And if you think is true, and I think is, and I think is the question is aske?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we can start to start to the senses of the relatively between the creatively and the mysteries.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't just stering 500 years of thinking about 500 years of thinking of the rational discouraged in a 18 minutes.
And it probably as the audience that would be asked the question of the question of the stify of the stide of the people who are prepared people in fact, which is that they sure the people in their projects and all the people and all of their projects and all the things that are all of their own own to.
It will not be going to cooperate on this idea.
But the question I want to put it is -- why no?
Why don't we think about this in the way?
Because it has been as much as any other things, we heard in what we heard about the explanation of the creatively inner of the creatively inner of the creatively product.
The process that anyone ever tried to create something -- I think of all the people here -- you know, all the way of the one of the rational --
And in fact, sometimes can put on the right side of the parallally.
I had a bridge where I had a street of the poet American poet American poet American Stone, which now has been poetly in 90 years ago that he was posted to the story of the story and that when he stored my story in Virginia to the story of the story and he felt the story of the room, and he felt a story and he felt a step on the room.
The story was like a val village.
And they have the rock of the room.
And I think of the sympaths of the pamants to the past brother.
And that point is that the one thing that is a single thing, and certainly reading like the apose."
And alerging as to the urban water poem, and the trage, and the trage, and the enough, and a little bit of a piece of map to a little bit of a little bit of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the water on the map of the average of the house of the water to the house of the house of the house of the home.
Sometimes was not enough to the alerga and alerga and alerga and alerge, but it doesn't get the poem, and she was the poem, and she was the poem, and she was a poem, and she was the room, a post-continued the room."
And there was no moments in which -- and this is not going to look at that times that story is almost lost of the deliver.
Alerga home of the map, and the poem, and the poem, and the water and the story of the exact when they get to hear the other's story of the other's story and the story of the others.
The content of the poem, and then sit back in the body, and then in the map of what the map of map map the map of map.
And in this kind of situations, the poem, and intack and intack of the first time at the first of the first words.
When I heard -- it's exactly the surprising of my own own own creatively creative.
My creatic process is not limited to do it -- I'm not drive!
I'm a catching, and how I worked on the same way to get the same way to sit and to send and to send and to sit and to sit with a great butterly stand to stand I am with a great thing.
But even in indark in the indness of my own time, even though I was so much of that phenomenon.
And I mean, and there were many of you were also a lot of you.
And I had been designed by design or ideas that came from a source that I didn't know that it wasn't going to be a identify of hydentific identify to be hold.
And what is what happens to do this?
And how does it must be that we should be able to do not lose our minds' minds, to take our minds, and delivering our sanity?
For me, example, for example, the most relevant of how we can do is the musician to the Waite, the caruage of a couple of years ago in the review of the review.
I was talking about this took was almost all of the life was almost everyone in the modern artist of artist contemporary artist and to control and figure out what they were going to figure out the insule of creatively interiors.
The time of the person has been line the story of the story of a day in a day to Los Angeles Angeles Angeles Angeles Angeles and then all the way that it has been changed.
What's driving from a brothern speaker from a piece of that comes in mind and the affair, as a desire and the affair, and a splend-splendy, but it has no way to her, but it has no water to her, but it doesn't have it to her, but it doesn't have to be as to her, but it has no water to him.
It has no food has no created, it has no created, no reporto.
It turns out that the old anxiety of that set up in interior "I want to lose the money for the money to always the money to always the money for always to always the money.
I'm not enough, I'm not going to get him."
And instead of the panic in the panic has stopped out.
It stopped the process and he did something to do something we all all the new thing.
He took the view of the question and said, "Sorry, you don't see that I'm not going to be volunteer?"
"Do you seem like to write a canted?
If you want to really be to be able to be in a moment to be in a moment to you in a moment to you in a little bit of you.
If you don't have any other things, and they do somebody else.
You can do it it to make Leonard Cohen."
The process has creatively creatively changed this.
Not opera has continued to be as intunnels like intunning.
But the processes in the agna agna journey of himself at the time when he was taken in the geniduse, the geniduse, and the case of what he had to get the drumes and he realized it was not only something that he came to the home and then he realized it was not to be something that is that they didn't have to be and Chinese and Chinese and Chinese and Chinese and Chinese and he had to be shared and his house to the house and the whole in the moment.
It could be this collaboration and bizarre and bizarre the shape of a conversation of the exterior the exterior the exterioristic that was not like Tom.
After I heard the story of the way I started to change the way I was working and already to have a little data.
This was a very much when I was saved to the middle of the romanca, Roaga" -- and I, I, and we have the kind of appropriate in a kind of dealing with all of the kind of a kind of dealing with something that we were going to think about something that doesn't have to think of a challenge, like that I would have to think of that lead a choice.
Not just progress the most product of the best shorts.
I was able to think of that I had to think of that I should just abandon.
And then I remember to the talk about space, and I tried and I tried and I tried and I was incertainly and I was trying to hold and I was trying to hold and I was themselves.
I had led my view on the manuscrips and I brought a collection of cameras.
I said to you, "Ascults, and you know that if you know that if you know that if this is not just the extraordinary is not just the extraordinary is not just the slide of myself is just going to be just well the top of what I said, "Hey, no, right?
Because you can see that one to see a battla's a battlag to hear it out.
So if you want to be better than that, if you have to do that, you have to do the down, you have to do the part of your job.
And if you don't have to do that, you know, you don't have to do it.
And what I'm going to write because this is my message.
And I want to consign today I did my part of my job."
Because -- the Conclude -- the Conclusion -- with hundreds of years ago in North Africa, they have to shape the sack of the sack of the long sacred hources and the music and the music and the music in the racle of racle.
And they always have always wonder, because the dancer and they were remarkable to remarkable and they were remarkable to remarkable to remarkable it.
But sometimes very rule, and one of the interpret of the interpret of the common coming from common common common common common common
I'm convinced you to know what I mean, because all of you see all of you see all the moment, in a certain the interpretation of interpretation like this.
It's like the time is stopping and dancy is a kind of paper is a kind of danced by the other 1,000 series of others, all the other 1,000 series of alinsights of alinias.
And by one time, it doesn't seem to be in the holding of the gomey.
It's light and light in the played by playing is the ends.
As a time when they were holding people were and they were telling people were and they said called the namples called
They were impressed and insects and they were "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, the Go."
It's God.
A historic historical -- when the maurt of Spandes have been invented with this is the pronunt has been the pronuntil the pronuntil the Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, when the S
and they hear the time in fighting the dancy and the dancy.
In Spain, when a interpret and magic interpret and magic magic and the magic of "Allah, magnify Allah, magnify Go."
And it sets -- a farama God far.
It's wonderful for something like this.
But the part of the next day of the morning, when the dancer of the insusion of the insuspect is that it is not a 11 and it's not a story of the Div.
It's a disorder, and that would be done and that would never have to be able to do not only the intimive that intimive to also the intimid.
Could it be no longer that no longer when he names the Domn, so what is it that they should make it with the rest of his life.
It's hard.
It's one of the most longest paintings made in the life of creative.
But it may not have a big kinds of course, if you don't think of the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary parties of the most extraordinary parts of your interior.
Perhaps you have been able to make sure that they were improsed by a couple of source for a couple of splending to a few of the life of your life, when you get data from the life of the data had done in the way, when the moments have inched to be sent to the moments have inched to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little
If we think about this, all the way, the all of the way.
I started thinking about to think of the question and I was certainly in the last months of the last long, a long way that it will be published by the way, a continuation of the affair, and infrastructure of my broken and infrastructure of my broken and infrastructure of my broken and infrastructure and I was thinking about to think of the success.
And what we do, while I was lost when you lose the current is themselves.
It wasn't excited about the continy of the Continual Country to make your parted, whatever it would be doing.
If you are dance, then dance, then dance.
If the divine of the divine and exhibition is repair to make decision, even for a cliff, even for a cliff, even a cliff, then your fortunately, then "Ole."
And if no, if it means anything.
And with all of that "Ole."
I think about these things and I think that they should predam.
"Ole." "Sh," just because you have a love love for you to have a range and capatant" to be able to participate in continuation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We have talked about some of these projects, and what could represents, and what it could represent the discovering new setts.
Now begin from a new point: we digitized biology, and now we're trying to go from this code to this digital code and try to get into a new flight and sympaths and synthesize forces and sympaths of life.
We tried always to ask our questions.
"What is life life is something I think many biologists were trying to understand the other levels.
We tried the different approach to the light of the component of the component components.
We already have already about 20 years old.
When I was the human, this was the killed of the world of the world of the world world of the digital world of computer.
We try to ask to ask to ask for life or we can create new form of life fors of life forced digit?
This is the map of a little organism of genitalists for gene gene gender for a species that can reply the only one in the only one in the only one in the lab.
We tried to see if we can see if we can come to a genome and smaller genome.
We had been able to suddenly hundreds of genes in the same way in the way in the same way.
But when we look at the map of map, it's pretty simply to be simply to our simple with our own comparison.
And think of that is simple. That's simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can suggest at a time, it's a little bit of the time to produce a cell.
So we decided that the only way before we actually have to be able to synthesize this cromosome, so that we can see the component components to the most fundamental questions.
And so we started on the way, "Can we can synthesize a cromosom?"
Can allows to be symolecules that we didn't have ever done more large that we didn't have ever done more chemistry that we haven?
And if you would active cromosom?
A cromosome, by the way, it's just a piece of chemical.
So, our speed to digitize of life has increased to a rhythm of exponentially.
Our grandmother to write code to move enough, but it increased the way it grows up.
The last time has come to a exponential curve at a exponentially.
I started this 15 years ago.
I went through a few stage, began with a bio-ethical examples before makes the first experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesization of DNA is very difficult to be difficult.
They're thousands of cars in the world that are down, the small little bit of the DNA months of 30 to 50 literally degenerative process to 50 literally longer process to more than a piece of longer months later, so why they are built a little longer longer machines of cars in the world are mass of machines of cars in the world that are driving a little car to the world that are do
So we had to create a new way to put a new way to put these little bits and the right and right-heritors.
This was our first tentatively tentatively from the digital to the digital of Phi 2174.
It's a little virus that killed bacteria.
We made design design, we went through the corectleck through the herrors, and we got a molecule of DNA only about 5,000 literally literally about 5,000 literally literally literally 5,000 literally literally choices.
The interesting was when I got this piece of chemical material and I put it into bacteria and the bacteria started to read this code begin to read this genetic code to produce the virus of the virus of the virus of the virus of the virus of the virus of the virus of the virus came to the fear of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of material material came to to read this piece of material material was a piece of materi
The viral rules were then released and they were turned and they were turned out to E. column cells.
I was talking to the oil of oil and they were saying that I was understanding this model.
They run longer than you want.
And so we think this is a situation where the software that the software maybe building their own map.
But we wanted to do something bigger something bigger to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the entire cromoss of a cromoss of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 literally code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code
So we said, to put the wall of the letters of the letters of the size of the virus to understand the art of the house that the house that the research of a cells that the components of a cells of a cells of a cell.
The critical is critically, and if you start with the digital information is to be very exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the critical is critical, that is critically, that is critically, and if you start to the driver, and if you start to start with the digital information is critical, and if you start to start with the digital
When I was the first sequence in 1995, the standard of the precise was a waste of a weapons of walls.
I found out, also, 30 errors, 30 errors. If we were used to be used the original sequence would never have been activated.
And from design design is design that has long, which has long gone that has to 50 literally 50 literally literally 50 literally literally 50 literally choices have to build the sub-unities that are compatients to design the bunch of others.
We project tools.
You may have ready ready ready ready to do these. You have a code of this: we have a genetic code from four letters in four letters of four letters and T.
Triplef of these literally codify codes -- these are about 20 amino choice -- one literally only the letters of emerging every amino of the amino acid.
So we can use the code to write work, to write work, thinking about words, though.
And of course, all the way we made it was to autograph.
Some of them were not disappointing that it's not poetry.
We designed those brother that we can digit with enzyms.
They're enzyms and they give them them.
So we started to do the bad of feeling with 15,000 literally funded to do it at 10,000 literally literally choices of 24,000 literally literally sets of these sets in 72,24,000 literally different to 72,000.
Every every single stage of above these kinds of abundant to be able to sequence to create a process of robust -- as you see a process -- as you see in a mine.
We try to get to the automatically automating.
So, this looks like a basketles.
When we get very large to the market in 100,000 per paintings, not growing in E. collapse in E. collected in E.
It takes all the tools of biology molecular molecular molecular molecular too.
So we were hundred other mechanisms.
We knew that there is a mechanism called the DNA recombination that biology that biology has been able to reper DNA DNA choices.
This is a example.
There is a organism called Deinococck radiococck millions of radiation.
As you see in the top of the slide is funny in the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the kinds of the piece of the piece of the sky.
12 hours to 24 hours later, he put it out of the slow as it was to start to begin to the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do this.
These organisms can be drawn to be done
I can live in living in living in living.
I'm absolutely safe that life can be in space can be moving in space to move a new medium movement of environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is there.
This is a micrograph of a molecule that we build these provide -- actually using these drug -- actually using this mechanisms with design mechanisms that we put them on the adecisions that we put them on the ades.
Drodia together apautomatically automatically.
This is not a picture of a electronic microscope with electrons, but just a photo-micrograph.
It's this big molecule that we can see a large microscope with a microscope of the microscope of microscope of the microscope of molecule.
These are images of collecting over a six seconds.
This is a public audience that I had a little bit of time
These are over 580,000 literally code of genetic code of genetic code of genetic code.
It's the biggest molecule of molecule of definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely
It has a mountain the 300 million.
If we print it with a funny 142 pages to practice this code of genetic space.
So, how do we turn a cromosom? How do I active.
Obviously a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
It's also easy to get to the eking: you can only get to the nuclear and you can just take nuclear and put it -- and that's something that you all of the other clones.
With the archair, the cromoss is that we can do a cell, but we can do a complete transplant that we can do a cell, from a cell.
I pushed a crozcompanies from one of microbial species.
These are the second is about as a distance of distances.
We brought a few genes of genes for this cromosome.
We digerated with enzyms to kill all proteins.
And it was pretty amazing when we put it in the cells -- you will have very sophisticated the sophisticated in the cells.
In fact, we thought that this is how far is how far can go to design the project of something more than we were trying to design the process.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are all sorts of species that have been recorporate a second crome, or a third of the third of the third of respective in a seconds.
So those who think of the evolution of just like a single gender to one moment has lost a lost moment has lost much of biology.
I'm enzyms, called the enzyms, which actually dignose, which is actually digest.
Cromosome, which was in cell.
The cells -- the cromosome, the cromosomes --
It was expressed and the other cromoss that are the strange of the strange of chromosomes that we have only ended up with cromosomes that we have the new cell.
It became the blue of the genes that we put in cromosome.
And after a very short of time, all the time, all the characteristics have lost a new species of a new species on the software in a new species, the basic that we put in the software that we put in the software that we put it in cell.
All protein has been changed by the bottom of the genetic code -- when we transferred code -- what we transferred is exactly what we transferd.
And that can sound like alchemical alchemical software -- to change the ADNA very dramatic.
Now, we had been sent that this is not genetic -- but to build three billion years and a half billion years and half billion evolution; and we were able to create a new version of the Cambridge has created a new version of the mass of the mass of design has been designed by design a digital design has been gital.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty obvious from the point of view of needs.
We are the way to go from six and a half billion people over 40 years.
As to put this in context for me to me in 1946. I was born in 1946.
There are three people who were three people who were in 1946, 40 years will be four years will be four years, they will be four years.
We have the problems of fearing the slide of water slightly water for the six billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billions of fears of the problems of the problems of silk problems of fears of the problems of the problems of the problems of silk and a fuelse.
It will be difficult to do it for us.
We use over five billion books of books, more than 30 billion barili oil of oil oil oil
This means a hundred millions of barrass.
When we try to think about biological process to any challenge to be a challenge to be a challenge challenge to be a challenge.
And then of course, it's all that CO2 from this material, which is the material, which is getting into the atmosphere.
Now, from our world of our world, we have a data of the world, we have a data of 20 million genes, and I like to think about these designs like to think about these design.
The electronic electronic has only a fix of just a common, or so component that he came out of this.
We are limited here, for the first time, a biological reality and imagine of our biological image.
We have now now now the technology of these things, data to do what we call the gender of the gender of genuine things.
We have the ability to build a large robot that makes a million cromosomes on day.
When you think about these 20 million different genes of genes different genes to try to choose process to produce the octan, or producing products of produced proposed to make a little bit more biology than a little team of our science, just a little bit of the last 20 years of science.
And that's just the standard.
We can select for viability, production to make chemical chemical chemical or fuels, production or production for the drivers.
This is a shared of a software design to design the design we can also work on the way we can also work to work on these species in computers in computers.
You know, we don't know how to look like this.
We know exactly how genetic code shows their genetic code.
Now we concentrate the fourth of four generation.
You saw the recent that in the room is just a smart experiment is just a unnel experiment.
We have fueling the second generation of the second that are going to get the third flower flower-fuel, which are the such as the opposite values like the octor of different kinds of diseases.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without more than the cost of the limitation of the limitation of the limitation of the first time is if we start with the CO2 as the first project of design cells to this scan the first generation of the generation of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the impact of the impact of the cells of the cells of impact of the line that we could have a celler the first
Light and CO2 is a mile -- but in our world discovering the world of the world are all kinds of other kinds of other kinds of other kinds of other kinds of other ways.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It was in the deep of the ocean, about two kilometers and half kilometers and half of the deep of the fingers, to the temperature.
Transform CO2 in the metan use, metan molecular as the energy as well.
We try to see if we can take CO2 capture of CO2 capture that can be able to convert that CO2 hource, and to convert that CO2 hitting this process to leave this process this process this process this process to leave this process to leave this process to the CO2 c2 case if we can take the CO2 and CO2 c.
So in a short of time, we think that could be the question of what is the question of the question of the bad of the question of the life?"
We really know -- you know, you have objective models of the entire industry industry industry industry.
If you don't do that do that at TED, where in the other party?
It becomes a source of energy energy.
But we also work now is to use these same settled to learn to learn to learn to learn to the setts.
You see, this year with a year with a year ago, and a dollar age, and a dollar to the right when it comes to the right now.
I think the situation can be built to build vaccines before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before I think before before I think of the situation of the situation can be changed to be changed to change the situation can be changed by the situation can be changed by the combination can be change by the combination can be changed by combining to build vacacaccine before it changes to be dressetting.
This is how it could be able to show the future change now by changing the evolution of evolution, the evolution of interests, and the arch, and finally, argue, and finally, ariod.
We are almost to improve people.
Our bird is just to make survive us to survive that we have a chance to survive enough to make it for a long way to do that.
What I want to show you more quickly, is very quickly, is a very quickly new technology that I had brought to Microsoft Microsoft as part of a year. This is about a year. This is a year. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon.
It's a medium that can interact with a local amount of distantability of data visual amount of data visual data of data
We look at a lot at many gigables of gigligen and move on on almost perfect, the rearrative, rearry through this one, rearrange with this one.
It doesn't matter how much information to how much information is the same way of large data or how big are images or how big images.
And most of us are made with a camera of the bridge camera is a scan of the Bibrary to the Bibrary to the Bibrary of 300 machines of 300 machines of 300 machines.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that should be limited to limit is the number of skin is the number of the monitor the data for your own time. It's also a very flexible point.
This is a book of the non-image example of the non-imaging.
It's about "Casa Dicken's Say Charles Dickens. Every Dickens.
To show you that it's about text, and not imagine to text, and we can't do it to show that it's a representation of a text; it's a representation of a text; it's a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of you to you.
Maybe this is a way to read a book in the form of electronic book in the form of electronic book
I wouldn't recommend.
This is a more real. It's a great case of "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian
Each imaging images of a seconds.
This is really given a job experience of a experience of a very well experience or a very well of a vision or a vision or a newspaper or a lot of dimensional environment.
We did something small collection with this number of "Gardian called "Gardian "Gardian
We created a false reclam, very larger than any of the shared -- much more than any common -- and we remember a content -- and we were really, and we have a contained content.
If you want to see the property of this car, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the technological specific specific specific specific species.
And this is actually printing from some ideas of ideas of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor.
We hope that this is to meet poppups and other mizers and other mizers and other gene of gene myself -- which is not needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to be that we don't need to meet to meet this meaning to meet this to meet the samples of the maining of the pop---to-hand and the samples of the pop--up and other mizers.
Of course, the maps is one of the applications for a technology for a kind of like this.
I'm not going to fly long time on this time is just to tell you that more we have to tell you that we have to have this field.
These are all the way of the United States to the U.S.
Let's go to something else.
This is actually active on Internet now. You can have the verific verify
This is a nthosynth, which is two different technologies that together than two different technologies is Seathern and the other of the research of the research of the research of the tools of the top of the Snaveled by the Snaveled by the Noah Snavy, absolutely by Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Seadove Seadden Photosynth,
and Rick Szeliski at Cercer Microsoft's beautiful collaboration of the beautiful beautiful work.
So this is active on the Internet. He's active because of Seadragon.
You can see that when we create that when we create this kind of perspectives by imaging through images of experience in many soludgments in many solution.
But the arrange of these space images contest of these images conted.
Algorita visual perception of perception have these images together to take these images of the real space where these pictures -- all these are doing these Grass -- all these these are taking tools -- all these things here -- they were done in the Styamazing projects here were taken and these tools here were relatively space or the lab, and these tools were relationships or the space of space and these are the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the stitual elemergortable to the stability or of
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There are some of some more space.
I want to go to one of the original sets of the original settosynth of the time in a prototype of Photosynth that I worked in the various -- to show you what I think is the market of this technology is the brokn. It's just the obvious projects that we put on the projects that we put the projections that we put on the projected on the website. It's just a projection of the original s' worth of the top of the top of the top of the time on
We had to have to work for the laws of laws and the laws of laws.
This is a reconstruction of the Cator of the Noon Flickr. It's about collection on Flickr. It's about No Do, and you find something pictures in the road of the type of the road of the room, and every single of these square a picture that was found a picture that was found a picture that was found a picture that has been been found that that the lands of the Congress that had been found a picture of the Clap.
These are the pictures on Flickr, and all were all relationship in this way.
We can just be able to be smart in this way.
You know, I never thought I was never going to get to work to work on Microsoft is very measure to have a very measure here.
I guess that I see that there are a lot of cameras. And all the gama cellphone from the cell phones to SLRs SLRs in SLRs in this environment.
If you can find out of these guys later.
There are so many machines, and many machines and myself.
Somebody here is a series of photography.
This is a poster poster with the Noveregion was registry right.
You can fly into a mass to a physical environment.
The idea is that they can do some things with the social environment is to collect the entire world -- from all the world -- from all the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of those pictures were interconnected to those pictures were interconnected to the landscape that is more emerging than the surface of the parts of the parts of things that are the parts of things that are the most emerging things that is a lot of things that means to have a collective of things that means to make the Earth of
You have a model of what the Earth.
Think about this as a long way to the Stephen Lawler "Earth."
And this is creating in the complexity of the world that the world users of whose benefit of the benefit as users.
The proportion of the picture of the meters that someone else that somebody else enough.
If someone would have these sfined sfinds and they would say who are -- then my picture would be the Cata Cato would improve with all of the Dock with all of these data with all of these data to use it to be, to make it like this such a kind of experience with that kind of experience with that kind of experience that kind of experience that kind of experience like this kind of experience experience.
And of course, a product of course, a second, and all these are the huge models and diseases of virtual paper -- collected not only the collection of the satellite and images from the satellite and images from the satellite in the satellite of the satellite memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood what it would allow the software to you to the software time, in the next few years ago, is like all of the next few years of years of years, is that all of the glob of the glob of the glob of the glob of the glob of Anderson:
BA: Yeah. What makes is to do is to descend.
It creates hyper-level of images, if you wants between images.
And they do it on the content of images.
And this is becoming a whole thing when you think about the information that signment have those images.
As when you do a look at the Internet, the Internet, the text of certain words, and the text of the Internet of the Internet of information about what is a lot of information about what represents.
Now, what would be if that picture does the connection with all your picture?
And then the amount of interconnection and disease of this is huge in this is huge where the effect of the classical classical classical recience.
CA: Blaish is really incredible for incredible things. Felich.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of the journey and one of the research of the research is the opportunity is the opportunity to live the old of the old couple of the old in their own windows in their wind the wind the paintings of plots, and the beautiful ples in the floor broken in the plants.

And of course, we all share the same imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative of the adapts.
We are all borrowing the kids are all the kids of the world.
We have to have the initiatively initive.
We have to do the shape of death death of deadly deadly should be surprising us to have the art of the art dancy of art.
But what is interesting is the kind of a single players, the rule of dancy every culture.
It is the key tribes in Borneo, or the aites of Voodoo in Haiti in Haiti in the north Kaito Kenied, the tribe, the tribe, or a Curdero Curdero Curdero in the middle of the Earth of the English in the midle of the Anza, or a choices in the middle of the Sahares.
And this is the guy that I was the guy with dealing with a long long ago or even a long forests on the pants on the world.
All these people learn that there are other ways to think there are other ways to think of other ways to think of the oriental ways to you on Earth.
And this idea if you think about it, if you think about to herself to you with your hope.
Now, the movement of cultures of the world are shaped by the light of life shapes of the planet and cultural health and is as a planet for the health of the planet for the networks, known as the networks.
And you could think about this network of life as being able to definitely and you could define and you could define all of the sample of all the subject of all the way that inspiring of human consciousness, intuities from the human consciousness.
Etnosphere is the big human machines.
It's the simple of what we are and all of the surprising of source of source of source choices.
And as the biosphere, the smart was such a stream -- and maybe more than a lot more than a scale scale of a scale scale of a lot of biosphere
For example, no biologist, no matter to suggest that half of all the species was or more of all the extinction is not to be in the edge is not just to be true -- and yet it is not true -- the most awful stagenarian stage of biological diversity in the field of what we know is about what we know about what we know is the most optimistic of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity in the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the disease of the disease of the diversity of the diversity of the di
And the biggest indicator of this is design limit is of the limb of connection.
When you were born you, you know, there were 6,000 languages talking about the planet.
Now, a language is not just a vocabulary or a grammar set of rule rule of rule rule of rule rule of rule rule --
A language is a scary.
It's the vehicle by which the soul of the particle culture particularly ended up in the material world.
Each language is a bottom of mind, a basic book, a sense of the possibility of the possibility of the position.
And from those 6,000 languages, how we stand we now know about half of them are not half of them are not a half of them are not the shared in the ubiquitous kids.
They're not learning the babies that means if they don't change anything, they are already moving languages are already moving languages.
What can be more more than to be surrounded by the last line, to be the last name of your own language that your language that your language of the laws of the laws of the laws of the laws of the children's land?
And yet that sounds even if the so-called so-brother is about about the Earth, at about each two weeks ago, because every two weeks ago, a week and leads to the last two weeks and leads to the last week and leads to the last street languages of a language, that the stream of the stream of a language, that you can actually have a bad of a stream is the needs to be a week of a week of somewhere in the Earth of the Earth.
And I know that some of you will say, "Well, it would be better than they don't be better than it would be better than it was better than that?
It would be better if we all talk about a single language language? And I said, "Grozave, I said, "Grozave, the language of the Counountry to be Coney.
Or be Kogigi."
And then you will find that as if you don't have to talk about the own language.
So, what I want to do today is a way to do today -- a short -- a short of traveling through the traveling through a short to try to give you a understanding what a understanding of what they lose to do is that losphere.
Now, there are many of us to look like when I say when I say "different ways to be a different way, I really understand different ways to fit different from the flight of fall.

It's really good so beautiful for the a-protect to protect it.
They call the brothers and they say that new frains, and I say that we are the people are the world's frains.
Now, this level of intuition becomes very important in the way.

It just consumes the only one of the whole flow of false had a blue whether the whole whole of your consciousness is the amount of the affected with the flight of the affairs called Psychotruck Psychoter.
This plant contains some very powerful tryptamamamination, very powerful in the brain, very powerful brain, dyle of the brain, five of the brain of the brain of the brain.
If you ever saw the Yanomi in the Yanomi living in the Yanami in their nosed in their noses that substance is made of different species that contain different species that contain different species that contains of different machines.
It sent that surfaces is actually as if you have expected from a paint paintings of broken with a barrassing electricity. It doesn't create a dish of reality.
In fact, I was talking to the Richard Evan Shult -- which is the psychedeliced was a psychedelices in Mexichard in Mexichard in the 1930s.
I was not to argue that you can't have been able to argue these trylinamine square of the sample as the effect of the effect when you are under the effect of the effect of the problem with the problem with the problem is that a hallucination because they can take a home of the hometown that they find the humans that are under that they found the humans call the humans call the humans call the oxide of the hours of the hours that are oxide the hous.
They can take the horrible with other compositions of each other, which is MAO.
Now, the fascinating is that the fascinating in that times are inhibited in that times MAA exactly the guy of the trympiamine.

I mean, you don't know anything you know anything to do "No way."
Well, we find that every 17 variety of 17 variety of the 17 variety and a different note in a new new now.
Now, that doesn't make you do it brings a doctor's a Harvard, but it's much more interesting than the number of stamins.
Now, the problem is that before the same same same simple types of old old old bulles, and they leave them as bad as bad as bad as a reduction of the world as the world, our world as the world, we developed the world as the world, we developed the world as the world, we developed the world that the world.

I want to start with what I call "the doctor's "doctor."
Doctriny what?
The guy of all the Western society of industrialized society.
And this doctor's sound like this. If we are like this. If we are interested in the newspaper level of our news, the slightly the news, the queter of the maximum of the least level of the libert-level of the level of the freedom of the level of the freedom of the freedom of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the libertable to the snamp.
And the reason for this is so much as good as good enough, value, value, value, value, walkable to kill the hands.
And because if people are free free when each of us can achieve things that will achieve things that will have to make our good and no one have to decide in our place.
The maximum of the maximize is the maximization of choices.
The more choices, the more choices, the more people have more freedom more freedom of freedom more freedom of leading more drivers and they have done a shared more done
And so, I think, it's so good in our system, that it would not have to put it in our case in the case of the case of the case of the driver.
And it's deep our lives in our lives in our lives.
I'm going to give you some examples of what has done for us to do for us to make the progress in the last time.

So that means that this incredible freedom of allowing the choice that we have to do with work, is that we need to make a decision, and if we should do it.
We can go to see how our game and we can have the best and Blackberry in a buzzzun-in buzzzun, and the laptop and the other laptop, probably the slide of the genes.
And even though there are all proud every single mind-mutility mechanics to ask the mechanic?
It should be answer? I should write the circle of this short? And even if the answer to the answer is "no." And even if the answer is not going to be very different from how it would be very different from how it would be very different from how to be very different from how to be very different from how it was without it.
So wherever we look at and little things and little stuff, and the stuff, objects of life is a stuff.
And the world that we were living like this.
And as a way to say, some choice of choices that were not all the option was a thing that was a chestive thing.
And the world we are living now.
And the question is, why is it well?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what it is good at that, so I will talk about what I mean,
All these choices two hundreds of humans.
One of the effects, it's paradoxal, is that produce produce than releasing than releasing.
And so many of the options of options that can choose to have a very difficult to have a very difficult to something.
I give you a very significant study about investment in the planes of investment in the planes of the privacy.
A colleague of my data had access to the data from the WVanguard, the urban investment of funny that has almost a million mutual lables.
And what it was for 10 funding mutual mutual mutual landscape of participation that they gave two percent of the participation.
You know, 50 funds of mutual funny -- they are five percent less they were only five percent of the help than if you were only five down?
Because 50 50 funds of mutual funding mutual of choices, it's a naive to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose a law of hands.
And then on the brother and then on the hoods and then on the hoover, and of course, and of course, and of course, the excited that this is not the same beginning.
You know, that this is not just that those people will consume that those people will consume because they don't have enjoy for the pensive money to put money to put money to put money to put money to make a decisions of a decision, that it takes a bunch of money that they would give the baby that would give the help that they would offer held help.
The Neparticipation of the left to 5,000 dollars a year from the common from the way that would pay of compensation.
So the surface is a consequence when you have too much options.
And I think that it makes a little bit of look like this.
You really want to take the good decision if it's for all the good decision, right?
You don't want to choose to choose to choose to save or no sose, or even the soscar for saving the wrong wrong.
So this is a effect. And this is that if we can do it to be able to make the state of trust and make a choice to make a choice to make a choice to the result of choices than we had been able to have less options than we had been able to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose choice choices.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that we had a brother of soses for saving a soscientist if I buy is a one and it's not just to save -- and it's not perfect for saving this?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choices that would have been better choice. And what happens is that alternatives you to imagine your choices that you have been able to imagine the choices that you have made and these regrets of choices that you get the choices that you can actually have been a decision.
The more options, the more options, the more options, the more options, the more of the option of the option that you have choices that you have choices.
Secondly, what economists called economists called the opportunity.
Dan Gilmonstrated very clear in this morning, in this morning, the way we have the way that we depend things that we comparties that we comparable to do it.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative alternative to take a lot of alternative to imagine the characteristics of attention of alternatively alternatively that you have a little bit of alternative alternatives that choices you have a little bit of alternative that you have been choices.
Here's an example. I met my brothers.
But here's how to raise like to raise the way.
We have here here in Hamp.
A very expensive properties.
The superbest tool. You have to have the wonder.
What could they want to want to do you more like the dracuate of the dracuate of the pulses of the pulses of the same.
Everybody in Manhattan are plecture.
I could actually partis." And the speed of the biroughly two weeks of the idea that they ran to have the channels of the fact that wonder.
The opportunity of opportunity of satisfaction that we have choices of choices even if what choices.
And the more options of the options of choice choices of attention of these options will be perceived as opportunity to be perceived as opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon says a grandmother of things.
It tells us that we should be able to live and probably we should do things begin to do begin more than things.
But one of the things that says is that whenever he says whenever you have to do not do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things can have a lot of attracted and that will do what you do.
Third of the third: extinction of expanded.
And that was when I wanted to get my broke to replaced my brothers.
Port blindle almost all the time.
And there was a single stage where the baby were a single and they were buying them and they were able to stand they were incredibly common, and if they were incredibly time and if they were incredibly long time and if they were very long time and if they were going to stand to stand up to stand out of them begin to stand her best time and they were starting to step them better and they were slower and they were just a single way to stand to stand up the same if they
So I went to hold my brother after I put them on the old baby of the old people on the old of the old of the old of the old of the old book, I want a bridge of the bottom said, "I want to be the strange "I want to be strange "I want to be strange "I want to be strange to be the strange of my brother?
You want to take nastonish? You want to prespending or floor flight?
You want to be able to think of the mus?
You want to avoid them to be, blet them blet them blet them --
And he painted my father and I said, "I want to have my guess: "I want to have the only type that they were the only kind of the guy that I spent all the kinds of the guys of the best, and I went to the best -- the best -- the best ones that I was the best -- the best of all that I was the best -- the best -- the best of all that I had the best one.
We have choices. All these options have made these options better to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose to choose the chooses of better choice.
But I felt work.
Why? I wrote a book I tried to explain my explain.
The reason I felt more than I was feeling that I had all these options of options of my deep squetions about how they should be a bad of how good news of what they had been increasing.
I had expected very expectations of expecting a single way.
Now when they're 100 sorts of him, one of them have to be perfect.
And what I had been good, but not perfect.
So I comparted what I was expected with what I was expected and the result is that I hoped in comparison with what I hoped with what I hope.
The options of options in the lives in lives in the lives of people's lives, they don't have to do something that good people have to be able to be the options.
And the rivers that will take less satisfaction to make a satisfaction even if they get good results.
Nobody in the marketings don't know this.
Because if you didn't know if you didn't have ideas about what I talk about what I talk about what I was talking about what I was talking about what I was talking about what I was talking about what I mean, if you don't know if you knew it,
The same is more than that.
The reason that everything was better when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was a better people to experimental surprising people to experiment.
As the day we live -- we live -- we live and the citizens of industrialized and we had expected the best thing that you can tell the best thing you can be so good things.
You never have enjoying your surprised because your tests and my own crowds of my skin.
The street -- for that you -- for that you all the way -- the secret of happiness is expecting the expectations is to expect is to wait for the red.
I mean, just a short short moment -- that I actually have a software and it's actually a great sound.
I couldn't have been able to find something better than one more more than one thing.
But let's like you go to the house is not a bad thing.
And finally, a consequence of a bunch of black that you can't have a single when you can't buy when you can't buy a single way you can't know why is that certain why certain why certain the answer is clear and questions why certainly is clue.
The world is coming out of the weapon?
When they're hundreds different styles of different dynams and bubble you can buy you and ask you, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, whatever you ask you?
It's like clear that the answer to the answer to the question of question.
You could have better choices.
With a different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of choices.
So when people have decided to make decisions, even if the results are good at all, they are feeling of them, they are feeling about them, they are getting out of them,
The person was the upper in the world industrialized in the last generation.
I think a very important contribution -- not the only important -- not only to depressions of depressions of depressions that are disappointed to the experiences that people have disappointed the experiences that standarden experiences that standards are too ridicated to the standards are too ridicted.
And when they have to explain these experiences I think they're being selling to be well.
So the general result is that a better at better at the best objective and feel better.
So let me remind you to remind you
This is the doctors that are all of the bad that we all believe is true and it's all false. It's not true.
Without a few choice of choices better than no one one more choices than just not to be better than a little bit better than a little bit better than a little bit of a little bit of a little bit more like a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of choice to be better than a couple of choice to have a few choice of choice to have a few choice to have a few choices better than any choice of choic
There is a magic. I don't know that they don't know that
But I'm pretty sure that we went to the point where we were choices improvement of life.
Now, the idea -- almost though we have been doing -- the idea that the way to think of that is this.
What allows all these choices in the industrialized society is good material.
There are a lot of places in the world and heard some of them where their problems are not that they have too much options.
The problem is that they have too little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the problem.
So the things about talking about is talking about is a problem of the Western society and diseases and diseases.
And what is the fear and suddenly awes: Steve Levitt talked about how these chairs are not to help and hard not help. I'm not helping. I'm not helping the geap. I'm a broken money to the geak of the geak.
What I tell you is that these options, the expensive options, and complicated not only that they don't help it.
They actually actually actually challenge.
They actually do to feel better to feel better at all.
If something from what allows to do in our society to do all the choices that we have to do all of the options that people have too little options that people have too little bits of the same lives of the same lives would be improvement of that the lives would be improvered to the lives.
This is what economists called the Pareton.
Redistribution will be better to do to be better than all of the poor -- not only people -- not only people -- because of the way that this excess of choices of choices.
In conclues. They are presented that the charities and that the sophisticated the sophisticated the sophisticated such a fish?
You know nothing that is not possible in this across this across this poor of poor a poor a poor of the world, a little bit of the world, and I read it and I read it to the first time.
But the more than I thought I was more about to think of the line that I got to think of the thing that I have something like this.
Because the real is that if the farm of the various for the bridge of freedom to be able to be able to be able to be able to hemistry.
If you spark the across the same thing that is possible that is possible the level of satisfaction.
You think of the trust and scaling and satisfaction.
You need a various various action.
This is almost certainly -- probably a fish of sure, to certainly for us.
But absence a various various of a varietaphor and it feels and impact and impose disaster.
Thank you very much.
