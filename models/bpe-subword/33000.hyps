That's why our principle, our principal is to spend a big shared sland for the public effect that we had to help us to help us to help us to show us the truth.
The thing is that the goal is not dirty dirty is not did.
We think it's currently -- and the game, and woks.

If you want to get the far today, you go out to the insite well.
We have to get faster fast, we have to get fast.
Thank you very much of it is going to thank you.
The year I did a TED I made a LHC.
And I got to get to see a time and give you a data data that works like this.
So the iat-mast. And for those who hasn't there the largest experiment is the most experiment that was intentific experiment -- Cirumint -- Cirbilometri recreating a second billion poor is to recreate a second to the ground of the universe -- the second level of the universe -- the second to 600 times on the seconds.
It's extremely ambitious ambitious.
This is the city of the Geneva.
We make photographs of these mines "Big Banglack of the decades.
I work on this one. It's called the ATALASTALASS -- Lungin -- Lungin diameter of 22 meters photography here detectors here detectors here in building the proportion.
On the 10 seper seped the top for the first time.
And this image was taking driving by ATAS.
He caused a huge case in the room.
It's a massive image that the first particular particular particular line that the intreatment of LHC, the car LHC deliberate in LHC deliberated in the LHC delibers,
In other words, when I was seven that image that image that image that image that this is a huge successful thing that is a huge successful successful for a huge successful for the process of the other way.
I don't know that if it was the largest open, or that when someone went on the page Google and seek at the first page of page, and he was the first page.
It means that I did a cultural impact on the street impact on the stretched the street.
After about a set of seven a sappeared with the problem, which actually had a problem that actually had the aura.
These are the 13 thousands of thousands of thousands of maximum works at the power of maximum in power of maximum pact on the ground of himself.
Now, the engineers in the rooms and say, "I can't transport the attation of the amperiod of minds."
But I can do that for that when they're at the temperatures becomes the super-hundred super-conductor.
So as a 271 degrees of the street than the space of stretched space of story, those are those of these stories.
At one of the one of the people of the 1,000 magnets in LHC, it was a fabricative.
So the competition was incalated a little bit of thousands of both sides have intently resisten.
This was the result of the result of it.
This is more impressive that those magnets of magnets over 20 tons, and they deployed almost 30 degrees of the chase.
So we deteriors of the chain 50 magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic magnetic field.
We had to get away from the argument, which we were doing.
I was a today's all of the tool, we repaid them out.
And now we go back to the subtermits.
The website of the martpharrow of LHC will be like new as we are like new HC will be like new HC is going to be like new
We're going to start to go out of us, and we have to get data or hyundred or hythes, and we'll keep the research to detain to the universe to affect the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, in a way of these accidents accidents about the important accidents of the important engineering and engineering to spend up to the average to reject the top of the engineering to rejected to rejection that is what it was likely to re-in-of-the-in-in-in-of-the-in-the-the-resident in a resident of resident-residential accidents to recognize that are the resident of resident residentired in the residentissue of the re-re-residentives of the resident.
I think that the fact that the fact that is that the fact that we have the fact that we have the important that we have the important experiments like HC.
I'm going to shared the words of a word of a hand-of stight Davy, Humphrrey Davy, I think when I think about the inside of the protect of the protect of protecting the protect of the protect of the protect of the insight of our minds are not finishing to ask the parents are finally finish of our stify words are not finally finally finally finally finished to our lives are not the living worth,
Thank you.
I was going to start with the run with the range of childhood when you play with board, when you play with bottom.
On the mass you invite the water, to enjoy them and make them square and teaching them how to enter and make it shares and figure out how to figure out how to make sense of space, and you get to the space, and the relatively intelligent and the relatively inventions.
The space is the profound is profound about how we intelligence a big part of the world inconjecting world inconjecting world.
So in the way, in the IT, the inspired by this inspired by the inspiration of our physical consultaneous consultant, my collaboratory -- I began to my collaboratory -- I began to start with a computer -- I began to the mouse of this garden, and we can use a mouse of this garden, and we can be able to a mouthern depend on the digital and information that we could be able to reach intend to in-inspiration with a maintaintain the maybe intain the mmaybe as a main the maybe inly aware that we going to be the mouse in that we going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the maybe as of the mer IT ct of the mail as of the mer as of the mazing thing to be able to be
Dayanjis?
The question was so fascinating that we decided to assume the answer to the answer the answer to the Siftables.
On the short Sift-in-in-in-in-in-source of a bisure.
They can be manufacturing them into the recivil can perceive the mission of one hands, and they have a wide radio and a wide radio radio radio radio radio ran of wireless.
The biggest thing is that are painful, like these are like the bottom, you can miss like the water.
And Siftables of a new equires a new equiety of the digital manipulation of digital manipulation of digital maniftable.
On the massive that these instruments becomes more constantly constantly constantly one of the other active actissues of our actissues of the active active active and deployed to explore the stiles of interactions.
I'm going to start with a few examples.
This Siftypes is configuring video gurope in a video direction, and if you include the philosopher, if you include in the parroll, the parroll,
These paintings are constantly one of the other.
So if you put them together, it becomes interested in interest.
If they're inconjected and that, and they can become confusion.
And I can also feel the missing and cline.
We realized that one of the interesting of interactive involves is that we can use the gestures that we can use the gestures how we could be able to share, how we could be able to a license like a license lyellow of a license lying.
In this case, we have three Siftables as the galets of the galets and they can use them to hold them in the central corner, where they will reach them to the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the case of this case,
If I was a lot of thing, we can get the slightly inside the inside of the air.
There's also interesting to education, like interesting for education, like the mathematics and logical logical logical and logical logical things that we want to do the result of the result of the result of the result of the immediately to see the result of the immediately unexpected to see the results of the interesting thing that is the interesting of
So here I -- this is a Fibonacial that I make a simple program that I make a simple programs.
Here we have a game of the words, a kind of combination and Boggle.
By every type, every one literally in the intimately intimately, and on the mother, and they try to form the words of form words, are the verified with a dictionary.
And then after about 30 seconds of the letters of the literacy of the literacy of literacy and new possibility of trips.
Thank you.
These are the history that came to the Media, and I was at the Media, and I was trying to move them a movie, and I was trying to movie.
It lived on the neighborhood of it.
And one of the interesting of this kind of application is that kind of application is that we don't need to have a lot of instructions.
All I have to say, "Look is "I know what to do.
Here are some other people are building them.
This is the worst of our tester in our right now.
It turns out that everything that he wanted it was to take a Siftables' one.
So for him they were just books.
This is a interaction of animation across the interactive act.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who invent language.
And this is the Felix.
He can get new characters in the scene, just the Siftables that affolds.
Here is the so-button.
Video: Shorror rates.
David Merrill: Now he got a traction, he was a traction,
Video: The purpose.
Good good.
Miss Siftable, and the Arab and assing one can make them interacting -- Video: Ham!
DM: creating their narrative narrative of the narrative of the narrative of the art.
Video: Hey,
DM: It's a final story with the open story of how it will be draw of how it will be draw is going to be draw up.
Video: Shy: Shy!
DM: The last example of the time I showed today is a couple of created and interpretation that we built the recent music that we built the recent that Siftables that Siftables like Siftables like and bas the rhythms of sound and bas well.
Each of these four different variation has four different variation that you want to use it to use it.
And you can inject the sound of sound that you can assemble what the guy you can assembly the guy.
The stores are the sound of sound Siftable of sound Siftable Siftable Siftable.
There are effects that you can control the live, like the movie.
And you know, you get a certain sound and then they can make it out of the air.
It makes the street general effects and volume the apply that apply the square the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the square it.
Video: DM: We're going to start with a second Siftables of successful Siftables them in a series, we have rhythms, we have rhythming in a lot of thing.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: DM: Now I add a little bit of percutting.
Video: DM: And now I'm going to add the movie, to control the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the living of Videootype.
Video: Ma: Maybe the second inclining inclining in a part of a parts of a part or in some of the one or in some of the other one.
Video: DM: Now I'm going to attack for moving for the more expression.
Video: DM: I can do the second time that the mother.
So I don't have to do the plan, I can improvise, month, months of the walks.
Now, in the sfars; I can estomatpedly use the Siftable-volume Siftable-volunteer in the room, inclined in the stang.
Thank you.
As you can see my step, my passion is creating new interfaction that the right thing that works better with the way that works better with our brain that works better with our brains and our body is working on our brains and our body body is our brains.
And today, I had time to show you a new space of this new space, and a few of course, and a few of the possibilities that we tried to hold them from the laboratory.
The one that I would have retinent that we are at the granted of this new generation of instruments of instruments of digital instruments of digital world.
Thank you very much.
Astep, the wish of the newspaper to yourself.
They're writing about it.
He wrote is my teacher, of course, but it's more than that, of course, more than that.
It's all my mother love and fascinates and fascinating.
And I don't like this is the slightly change.
But, this is something like that, something like that, something like the recent of my life and in my life and in my career, which he determined me of my relationships with the relationship of working with the work.
And the thing that I wrote is that I wrote this book, "Manca, Rographics "Mana, Roath, Roah Dorchoican email of my cartoons, the seller of my cartoon-best mega-seller mega-seller international meaningful meological meanings.
The result is that the origins that people are going to be condamner.
Seriod, concerned -- condamnose, condam!
Since example, and you say, "You don't have it: "You don't have that is the themselves, you can't depassive the performance of performance you might be depassive that performan?
Do you don't have the themselves are going to be able to write your life is the mostly the more creating a book that would ever have the world that ever set of that ever happen?"
It's very line in truth, in the truth.
But it was also run if I was not going to be like that I was going to be like 20 years, when I started to start to be able to start to get a great time -- as I was bring the same entertaining -- like I was a kind of reactive reactive reactive as a broken kind of reactive reactive as a broken kind of reactive reactive weapons of the same front of the same front of the same thing.
And people said, "Do you don't have any of you have never been successful for success?"
Do you don't have the humilination will kill you will kill you will kill you the idea of it?
Do you don't have the front of the life of your life in this domain, and nothing that is going to be here and nothing that will be here and I'm going to death with the gura farming of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the chas?"
Something about this gender of the gender of this gender of the gender of this gender of the gender of this kind of a kind of silence of this kind of one of the gender of this kind of one of the gender of this gene of the gender of this gender of this gender of the gender of this gene of gender of that.
The answer -- the answer to all those insects questions is "Yeah."
Yeah, I am is the themselves.
And it always standing me on my house
And it is the themselves in the insides that people can be intuitive things that people can be intuitive.
As a great example of the large things that are infruit are infruit is infruit
But when it's about written about writing the word that I was all thinking about the last time is "Why?"
Is something rational rational rational rational rational rational?
It's logic that anyone to the work that it would be the working that they feel like they were enough to do it was really enough to do it on this Pamant.
And what is so specific initiatively creative that seems like the nest, is really truly in a kind of mental process that other teachers are not doing this kind of a kind of way of doing it?
My attraction, for example, it was engineer and not remember of the 40 years of engineering that he was asked the chemicals is not a chemicals is not a chemical engineer to be a chemistry of engineer to be a chemistry of the chemistry, for example,
It didn't go out -- John, John, how do it goes to the chemical?
It just doesn't really get the way that it doesn't matter the question.
But to be synthetic engineering as a group of the century hasn't too chairs to be alcool-depressive maniaco-depressive maniaco-depressive maniaco-depressive manipuls.
We writers of insands of insulls, and not only writors, but artists that they have this reputation that they have this reputation that they have this reputation of the limits of limits of limits of the limits of the limits of insands of insands of insands of insands of insands of insands of insands of insands of reputable and not only the reputable to be the remarkable to be the writors of the bridgors, and the ard of the remarkable to be the statory of the retystic
And all we have taken is to look at the number of death, just in the century, in the 20th century, in the Mofield of the mind of the mind of young creative proprisoners and open-of-the-hand delight.
And even the same thing that they didn't seem to be a very smart of the providing of the talent provide providing the talent of the talence.
Norman Mail, indeed in the last die, in the last interview, she said that "Each of cards had a little bit more like "On a little bit more of the cartoon."
A great main a great main the mountain of a life of a violence.
But we don't have the clipiece when we hear that we heard about this because we heard of the things that we heard of the things and somehow how we have it to absorsorsorry and suffered the idea of collectively and as art, the provided and suffered as art, it will always be in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-final to the main a maintain the main a massive intain the main a lot of time.
And the question I want to add to bring it today is the one of the things that you all impact with this ideas with this ide?
You're comfortable with it -- because it is the light of the light of the light -- I don't get that the ipoth.
I think it's odiodiodia.
And I also think it's dangerous and not willing to see it dangerous.
I think it's better if you get incurrently incurrently of artists to live in the house of artists
And I know that the surface of my case, in my case, in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start to start to me to start to me to start to me to the intuned of this hypothesia in the hypothesia that I find the teachers.
As a story, I'm pretty tanard, I just have a 40 years old.
I have probably inside the mountain the works.
And it's very likely that everything I will write the incept that moment that was judgments like the mountain the last money to the last money of the last last money to the last last money to the last last men go?
What would be saying it was the samples, because everybody is already about the best of the best success -- is very likely to be intampled to be intamed to be intampled to be intampled to be intamed to be intamed to be to tell you the shared the shared.
Oh, yeah, yeah, what gand!
This is the gene of the gene that could make somebody to get the broken to the hort of the morning of the morning, and I don't want to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person could get that person could make somebody else could make somebody that it is the kind of a game that could make someone to make somebody to get somebody to get someone to get someone to the shares someone to get someone could get the bridge.
I want to do this is continuing to do this message that I love it.
And then the question becomes inside of the question, right?
And so I think that I have a lot of meditative meditative that we have to work right now, to write a kind of writing this kind of building psychological building to the psychological buildings of the protective, right?
I have to be in a way, to think about a way to the photography of myself, the one, the one, the one, the work, the work, the team of the natural that will be able to what it is now writing to what it is.
And as I was all the last year of this sense of the last model, I started to try and began to see the other society to see if you could see if we could be able to see if you could have better ideas about how it could be helpful and sanatching the chance of how to be helpful and the challenge of art of the art of the art of art of art.
The rest of this story has led me in Greece and Roma ancient and Roma ancient of the ancient of the ancient of this story.
So the massive chairs of the chair.
But, the Great and Rome, and Rome, and the Rome, the people who don't think that people were not that people were not thinking about the inside of the house of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the Great Diver,
People believe that creativity was a spirit was a source that poem on the indeparation of a source of reasons and neighborhood and neighborhood and neighborhood and neighborhood of reasons.
The Great these spirit of creativity, creativity, the term of the term "May "May "May "Moy."
Socracy was the faimos that it has a department of the satish of department.
The range would have the same parents were the creative spirit creative, but they were the genius of the genius.
What is wonderful is that the romants were not that a genius had no genius had a lot of enough individual genius in the house of it.
They thought that a genius was a kind of a kind of a divinced of the wall, which is the kind of study of the artist, in a kind of like Dobby, the insession and insessil and insession of the artist of the work, model, model, model, model, model, the mountains of the works.
Absolutely staled -- this is the distance, this is the building that we were building psychology that can protect the works.
And everyone is the story works, right?
So the artist was protected by some things, like that, like that, like a lot of narcism, right?
If you could move was the strallow, you couldn't be the standing of the world as you had this kind of such a shared state that you had helped out.
If you move was the criticized criticized that was not completely shared it?
Everyone story that the genius was about the ignorance.
So they looked people in the West creativity for a long time.
And then he came up and all the way that it changed and the idea of idea of idea, the idea of the massive of the universe like the universe like the unique of all the daughter of all days that they get out of all the daughter, the farms that they get from divicides that they get from diving.
It was beginning to the humanism and people start to create that creativity that creativity begins from the individual inside of the individual inside of the individual inside of the individual beginning,
And for the first one of the people began to have the people began to one or one of the artists of artists like a genius of a genius.
And it must be a great heroes, I think it was a huge hero.
Permite, a little bit of people to think about it or is actually create that it is actually receptable and the issue, and the essentially and the issue, creative mystern, creative is a little bit too much more likely to be a little bit of the psychological responsibility of the psychological responsibility.
It's like you who are a few of the so-like so-hittaneous sounds.
It just incle and deploy and deforms of eeptils all these expects of all these inimages on the performance.
I think that the pressure of the palter of the last 500 years of the last 500 years old.
And if I think is true, and I think is, what does is asking is, what does it now?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we can start to the sensitive of the relationships of the brain of the creative mystery.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can just stand we can stand five years of human rational thinker of humanity's rational talk.
And it probably as the audience that would be asked the question of the question of the stiintific stiinizend-shared style, which is the people prepared of their projects and all of their own shares and all of their own and all the other squares and all the way of them and all of their own and all the people who are affaffairs in the audience of people in the projector in the massive of the people who are absolutely affected to the massive stage.
It probably will not be cooperating all on this idea.
But the question I want to put it -- why not?
Why don't we think about this in the way?
Because it has a lot of that we heard about how any else of the crazy of the creative of the creative process of the creative process of the creative process of the product.
Process that anyone who tried to create something -- you know, everybody is that everybody is always like the rational behavioral behavioral behavioral behavioral behavioral that is the rational process that anyone else that anyone else that anyone who are trying to figure out that anyone who are trying to make a trial that anyone else of the tries to try and make it beyond the course of the tries of trying to create something like anyone --
And in fact, sometimes can put the right side of the paranormals.
I had a retent where I mean, where I met the American poett-hundred of the American Ruth Stone, which now has been in the 90 years ago, and he was the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the country to work on the wintample, and she feels like it on the window and heard it to work on the rops.
The story was like a vast vantage of the air.
And they get out of the catching rops.
The sense of the inven, because they are southern sub suddenly under the purpose.
And that moment that moment has a single thing that is a single thing that apattached as the apatt."

In this situation, the poems of the map of the map of the map of the first bottom, but de-nosed at the last last to the first of all.
When I heard -- it's surprised -- it's exactly how the process of the creative process of creative creative.
My creative process is not limits -- I'm not run -- I'm not run the league.
I'm a catching way, and I am asked me to go on the same way to trove and truth, and to trove me to slide and slightly stretched and slightly hard to stretched with the hard of a hard catching catch, and I'm a catching catch, and I'm a catching catch, and I'm a catching catch, and I'm sure I am a little bit of slightly shared to me to me to me.
But even I actually have my house in my house in my house in the phenomenon.
And I just imagine that they were also also in many of you.
And I had projects or ideas that they had the idea that they have, the source that they don't know it to be a identified to hydentified.
And what does it always represent?
And how does it assummer should be reported to the mind of us that we haven't lost our lives to help us to help our sanatosired to him the anatosid?
For example, the most relevant of our days, we have the musician that we can do is the musician to the Waits, we took a few years ago, we took a few years in the review of revidence of revidence.
I was talking about this super-life suffling was almost everything that was almost everything that is the contemporary artist, what begins to control these impulsed and figure out how to control these impulses these impulsed insanited insanited and run out of the insanity-controlled to.
The time of the time of the line of the story of a day in a day long day in a lautostreet Angeles Angeles Angeles and then everything has changed the whole thing has changed the time.
As a time of a short of a short of a bag, that comes from a mind that comes into the mind of how it happens to deset up deseveral with inspace, it's splendly not how to get to the splendly and it doesn't have the water.
It has no food has no creations, it doesn't have the creational reportofon.
It starts to feel that the neighborhood growing up the point of "Look, and the cancer of this moment, and the cannot always to the money for the time.
They're not going to get a good enough that I would reach to reach it.
And instead of the paintings has stopped out.
He was the inside of the process and made something of the new and made it all the new new and all of us all the new thing.
He was taking the catching and said, "Sorry, you don't see that I'm not going to be at volan?"
"You know, I would be able to write a cantee cancer now?
If you want to be truly in a moment, inside a moment of a little bit more rightly worse when I can take me to you up.
If you don't get you and forget someone else today.
Let's do you and you do it on Leonard Cohen."
The trick process of process has changed that.
It doesn't operate that it has been working as intuned as intuned as intuned as well.
But the process, and the intragna agnosed in his time he was taken the time that took the hyridushed it in the hydrogen and the cause of it was going to get out of the today's going to be something so so that he had to be something so that it doesn't have to be something so that it has to be something so that it has to be something so that it has to be something so interiorized by the interiorizing.
It could be this collaboration and bization of the bization of the top of the exterior of the exterior of the exterior that he was not too much like Tom.
And after I heard the story of the story that I started to change a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a data.
This approaches when I was a home when I was the middle of "Manca, Roatha, and Iuban in-Manca, and I, Iubbers in a kind of desperates that we had all the way that we haven't think about something that we would not be the most process that it will be the most process that it will be the most process that it will be the most process of the book.
Not only provided this process of the worst of all.
I was going to think about it as I should be able to abandoned the project of the project of the project of the project.
And then I remember all of the space of open space and I tried to me.
I went to the shared my manuscriped and we brought me a collar collaboration of cameras a goal collapses.
I said with voice voices, "Shults, and you know that if we know that the book is not just the extraordinary is not just the shadow is not only the slightly willing to be the slightly willing with my daughter?
For you can see that I put on a battle at all of the way that I would like to hold me not the pottent.
So if you want to be better than you have to do that, you have to do it to do the side of the stretched the side of the stretched the street.
Okay. And if you do that, you know, the stretched with the naid with the tops.
I'm going to write because this is my message.
And I want to connect that I did my father today's side.
Because -- the conclusion is, on the hundred years ago, in the world of North Africans have to shared the people who are trying to shared the months and the music in the rooms of the race, and the music in the rack of the race.
And they were always wonderful for the dances, because they were remarkable and they were remarkable and were remarkable to do it?
But sometimes it intample, and one of the Internet of the common from the common from the common from the common from the common from the common from the commitment.
They're convinced to all of the time I was going to see all the way, because all of the interpretation of interpretation of interpretation like this moment, like this is the interpretation of interpretation of the interpretation of the interpretation.
It's like the time is the time and dancy is like a kind of kind of silence, they are not doing anything different than the other 1,000 series, in the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series is alinias.
On a time in a time, it doesn't seem to be in the home.
It's light from the interior and light is the game, and the divinced of the dives.
On the time, when they were standing people were standing what was the named and they were telling the numbers called the name.
And they were mass and they were "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Doamname, Doamname, Doamname, Doh, God, Doh, God, Doh, oh, God,
It's God.
A historical historical historical -- when they were invented with this Spanish the Spanish Allah, the pronuntil the Ol, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, the people who have a interesting histor

In Spain, when a common was a measure impossible and magic magic and magic magic -- the magniff of the game, arm."
The unintelligence -- a God of God -- a God of God.
It's wonderful for that we need to have something like we need to have something like this.
But the one of the dad of the shared when the insushing that is the insuspect is also the 111 degree, horrified that is a 111 degrees and not a lipiece of Divin.
It's a diitor who are the disorders that would be that they could never get to be able to almost hurt the intimate that intimate it in the intimate of intimacy.
It might not be that no one more invoice the name of the name is when he was a room that they would ask it that he had to do with his restoral rest of his lifes?
It's hard to be hard.
It's one of the most painful paintings of creative creative creative creative in the creative of the creative of the most of the most amazing of the most purpose.
But it might not be a big kinds of course, if you don't think about the most extraordinary engineering parts of the most extraordinary parts of the Inistry from the Inistry from the Inistry from the Inistry of the Inight.
Maybe you are creating that you are making you that they were imprised by a few source of the end-time endishes for a few splending out of the next step in the endanger to be driving to be in-in-in-in-in-in-called the moment they have in-shark ms.
If we think about this way, all of us begins to change it.
I started to think about how I began and so I thought it was sure in the last long thing that will be published by the way, a continuous thing that will be addptick of the excess of the successful and infruit of my successful and infrution of my success.
And what I do, repeated when you get when you hold the courage is the theater.
It doesn't be the father's fairly expected to the content to the content to be doing.
If you are dance, then dance, then dances, they dance.
If the genius of the divine that is repair and excess is repaid to make it insects the extraordinary clips through your effort fortunately, and for you, "Ole."
And if you don't get anything.
And with all of that "Ole."
I think in these things and I think we should predness them to predness.
"Oh, yeah, it is simply for you, just like you have a claimed and inability to participate and inability to participate in continuing.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I have talked about some of these projects and what it might represent the house and what it might represent new settings of genes.
Now it stars, in fact, in fact, in fact, we are now trying to start to start to start to start to start to this code from this codigital codes and go into a new physical floor and we are going to get the biology of life form and sympath, modeling forward to share,
We tried to ask us to ask questions.
"What is the life life is something that I think many biologists were trying to understand diverse to figure out how to figure out how to do we have tried to make the difference of the botts.
I tried to different approach, similar life at the basis of the basis of the basis of the basic components.
We are already about 20 years.
When I seen the genome, this was the human, this was the world of the world world's digital world digital world of the computer world.
Now we are trying to ask to ask for life -- or we can create new form of life digital form digital universe of this universe of the universe of this universe of the universe of this universe is trying to ask to ask to ask the question, we are trying to ask to ask to ask to ask to ask to ask to ask to ask to as
This is the map of a mice, Mycoplasma genitals, which has the most smallest gene of the only one in the only one in the only one in the only one in the laboratory.
We tried to see if we can come with a genome and smaller genomand smaller genome.
We were able to surely surveillance of a hundred of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of the metabolic metabolic is pretty simple to our factories.
Right me this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can suggest at a moment that we can suddenly make a cell.
So we decided that the only way we were to feel that we actually want to sit this cromosome, so that we can see the components to address to the most fundamental components to deal with the most fundamental questions.
And so we started on the catch, "Can we can feel a cromosom?"
Maybe it allows these molecules that we haven't ever made it ever made it ever made it ever made it ever made it ever ever made it ever ever made it more than we ever ever ever made them ever be?
And if yes, we can active.
A cromosome, by the way, it's just a chemical.
So our speed speed to digitize was a raised rhythern ritself.
Our holding genetic code is moving enough movement moving enough to grow up, but it grew up the house of it.
The last time has happened to a speech speech of a speech curve.
I started this 15 years ago.
I went through a few ethaper, in fact, in fact, in fact with a bio-examination before the first experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be very difficult to be difficult.
These are thousands of machines in the world that are doing little little DNADNA 30 to 50 literally degenerative process degenerative process of degenerative process of degenerative process of the attack of the attack of machiners.
So we had to create a new methods to put these little little bit.
This was our first tenth of tenth from the digital data from the digital shadow of the Phi 174.
It's a little bit that kills that kills humans.
I did design design, I went through the corectly-molecule molecule of DNA molecule of DNA 5,000 literally literally literally about 5,000 literally literally literally we were able to 5,000 literally.
The interesting thing came out when I got this piece of chemical material that we had a chemical bacteria, and I put it into the bacteria began to read this cgenetic code and producing this room.
The viral particulated in the viral cells and they came back and killed the cells and they have come back to Ecolls.
I was talking with the oil industry and share that they used to understand that this model.
They run longer than you do.
And so we think that's a situation where the software in which software in a system in a system in a system in a system in a system of biological system in a system of biological system of biological system that is a biological system is a system that is a situation where this is a situation where this is a situation where this is a situation where the software in which software in which software to build a situ
But we wanted to do something bigger something bigger than it was a larger thing.
We wanted to build the entire cromoss of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 literally choices.
So we said, we have to put the walls in the house in the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the house that are the resident of a cell-cells cells of a cell.
The reason is the critical, and if you start with the digital information has to be very exactly the exactly the exactly exactly the exactly exactly the exactly exactly the exactly exactly the exactly the shadow is critical,
When I seen the first time of this genome in 19955, the standard was a 10,000 walls of the walls of the walls of the walls of the walls of walls.
I found out the rest resource, 30 hers, 30 herrors. If we were used to be used to be activated, this would never be activated.
The design is design project is project that has long 50 literally shared by all the other source of 50 literally slightly to build the subject of the other little bit of the other smaller to build the compatible that we have to design compatible compatible to each other.
We projects of under the charge.
You can read that I put "floor in the house in the house in the fourth of thes: we have a literally choice: Ah, God.
The other of those literally literally literally codif-a-acier acier acier acier acier acier acier.
So we can use the genetic code to write words, thinking, of course, thinkers, thinkers.
Iian initially, all we took the code we took the code.
Some people were despaths that it is poetry.
I designed those broken that we can digit with enzymes.
They're enzering and they are to.
So we started to make a little bit of a little bit of five to 7,000 literally funded to do it at the 24,000 literally literally to make settings of this layer to 7,000.
Every time we have taken these pieces of abundant to the abundance to create a process of the robbed process of robbble-shared process -- as you can see in a minute.
We are trying to get to get to that point of authors.
So this is what a baskets of the baskets.
When we get to the market in 100,000 walls of the basis of basically basically basically assessment in Eur.
They are all the tools of biology of the molecular biology.
So we got to other mechanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the DNA that biology that biology would return the DNNA DNA NA, and that intends to reach out the broken that inside of the broken that we were able to kill the journeys.
This is a example.
There is a organism called Deinocockrocus that can sudden rate of radiation that can suddenly hurts.
As you can see in the pain, the cromoss of the top of the piece of the piece of the piece of the beneath of the bottom.
12 to 24 hours later, he put it out of the shared it was the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be open.
I can live in living in the living in the living in the way.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be able to exist, to be moving in the extrators movement, to find a new environment.
In fact, NASA has shown that this is happening there.
Here is a micrograph micrograph molecules that we build these process -- actually using these process -- actually using the mechanisms that we put them on the adecisions that we put them on the athleted.
Drojustice together.
This is not a picture from a microscope, but only one of the micrographics of micrography of the micrograph.
It's this big molecule mechanical molecule of microscode microscope of microscode microscode microscode microscope.
These are collectors over a couple of several about six seconds.
This is a public public public public public published it a little bit of time.
These are over 580,000 literally choices.
It's the biggest molecule did ever with a definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely in the world.
It has a molecular set of over 300 millions.
If we do a fun-fun, 142 pages and without space, 142 pages to practice this genetic code code of genetic code of genetic code and you get this genetic code with a genetic funny of a funny funny fun. If you do a funny funded funded with a funded fun, and you get a 142 pags and without space, 142 pages and without spacross and adequ
So how do we start a cromosome? How do we active.
The obviously, with a very easy of easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
They also get it to the bridge, as you can only get the nuclear and you can just take the nuclear and you can get the other side -- and that's something you heard about -- cloning.
With bacterial chromosomes is integrated in cells of cells that we can make a completely completely completely completely a completely celling cells to each other, from a celling cells to the other, and we can do it.
I pursued a crowd of the microbial species.
These second are about as a second as people and men as people and small.
I added a few genes in the rooms that we can select this cromoss for this cromosome.
I digested with the enzymes to kill all proteins.
And it was pretty amazing when we put it in the cells of our very, very sophisticated -- and our cromoss -- and the cromoss of cell.
In fact, we thought this is how far it can go out of the project of something more than we tried to design something more far today.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are all kinds of species that are colors that have the second crome, or a third of the other hand, in thousands of new respective, thousands of new carry in a second.
So those who think about evolution is just like a single gene of changing the moment that they lost lost lost of biology.
They're enzymes called DNA, which actually digers, which actually digers.
The cells that was in the cells that was not a cell.
The cellular -- the cromoss that we put it -- we put it --
It was expressed and recognized the other of the other of the other cells that we have digers, and so we have only got the new cell.
It became blueprint of the genes that we put them in the cromoss of the cromosome.
And after a very short period of time a long time, all the characteristics of a new species of a new species, and it was based on a new species, based on the software that we put it into the cell.
All proteins were changed the membranes -- when we call it is exactly what we had transfed the exactly what we transfer transferring the cheath of what we had transfer to the future.
This can sound like alchemistry of the DNA but we can change the DNA to change the DNA to change the jail.
Now, I was susped that this is not the genetic -- but half years and a half years and a half years and a half years and a new version of the Cambridge of Cambriana, in which has a new specific new specific design specific design specific design specifically has a massive specific design specifically shared by the digital --
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obvious obvious from the point of the unknowledge.
We're going to go from six and half of the six and half billion people over 40 years ago.
To this in context for me sweet in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for every one of the 1946, in 46; in 40 years will be four years will be four years will be four years will be four years ago.
We have problems of the problems of the slightly water potable, drugs, fuel fuels and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half the issues of the issues of the issues of the issues of the issues of the issues of the horrible se.
It will be difficult to do it for us.
We use over five billion cards of the game of the golden barridges of oil oil shares of oil.
This is a hundred million barily bars.
When we will try to think about the biological process or any challenge that this is going to be a challenge challenge to be a challenge challenge of challenge to be a challenge challenge to try and make it a challenge of course, when we try to think about the challenge of the process of the process of the process of the process of biological ces.
And then, of course, it's all that CO2 from this material, which is that the atmosphere.
Now, from our futures around the world, we have a data of the world of genes, and I love to think about 20 million genes, and I love to think about the design components of the future.
Industrial electronic has only a pain, or this is a components that came out of that.
We're limit here, at the first one, a biological reality.
We have now now data data data dated by the way, to make it that we call it the genetic genetics of genome, combinators of genome.
We have the ability to build a big robot that are a million of cromoss on the day.
When you think about these 20 million different genes of different genes of different genes of different genes to optimize process to choose the optimize of optimization, and we can change the last 20 years, we can do more change, just with a small biology of the last 20 years, and we can change the last 20 years,
And this is just standard.
We can select for viability, production for suits, production or fuels or fuels, the production of vaccines,
This is a screen captures of a software that we worked on the design we could work and work to work and work on these species in the computers in the calculators.
You know, we don't know how it will not know how it will look like this.
We know exactly how their genetic code looks like their genetic code.
Now we concentrate the fuel fuels of four generation.
You see that recent that from the landscape is just a nice experiment is just a nine.
We have the fuel of the second generation that will get the second that will applied enough to fuel fuels, which are the bigger values like the octaneous taneous or different kinds of diseases.
But the only way we think that the biology can have a major impact without a major accountaneous and the far affect their limited to the CO2 men as we start with the CO2 as the first cells to project the cells of the cells of the fuel of fuel fuel in about 18 months.
The light and CO2 is a male male -- but in our world is a new way, we have all kinds of other ways of ways.
This is a organism that we described in 1996666.
They are living in the ocean, about two kilometers and half kilometers and half miles and half the cloud of the farmers of fiers' birds of fierrors of fierrors in the fibers of the fibers of the over.
Transform CO2 in metan use metan energy as a source of energy.
We are trying to see if we can take CO2 capture, which can be easy to convert that CO2 back in the country, and to convert that CO2 back in the fuel, to leave this process process this process process that procells to leave this process if we can take this process to see if the O2 captubes that can be able to take a slightly buttype,
So in a short period of time, we think that we could have the question that is the question "What is the question of the life?"
We are really -- you know, you know, we have the entire model of industry to the industry industry.
Yeah. If you can't do that at the TED TED Talk in other parted?
Let's get a major energy source of energy.
But we also work now is to use these same source to inventing these source vaccines of vaccines immediately in the hundred of the inside.
You seen this year, we are always with a year and a dollar in minus when it comes to the right right of the right of vaccine.
I think the situation can be built by the combinators before the combinators.
Here's how it might be able to show the future of the evolution of evolutionary change, accelerating the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the sychart, argue arch, arms.
We're almost to improve people.
Our big, we just have to make survive that we have a chance to survive enough to survive enough to survive that very long for you to do that. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you a little bit of a very quickly, is a fundamental work, a new technology that I had brought to Microsofisive Microsofisy that I had a year. This is the Seadragon.
It's a local environment that can interacting with a big declining about a big amount of data visual amount of data.
We are now looking at a lot of photos of the digital and smood, and I kept the perfect, by the way, the arrow of the doraming with this dormous dormous dormous dorder.
It doesn't conteach how much information we are these shared us how large data is these large collected collections are imagining how large images.
Most of the photos are driving with a digital camera from the Bible scanning from the Bibrary of the Congress, of the order of the order of the order of the order of the order of the orders.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that should limit the performance of a system is the number of monitors of your monitors of your architecture of your architecture of your architecture of architecture of the architecture of the architecture of the propurpose.
This is a book is a non-image of non-imaging.
It's about "The Say Say Say Dickens. Every Dickens. Every top represent a represent a capita
To demonstrate you that it is about text, and we can't imagine that we can do that it is a real represent that it is a representation of a text; it's a picture.
Maybe this is a artificial way, to read a book in the form of electronic book.
I wouldn't recommend.
This is a more real. It's a lot of "Gardian edian edian "Gardian
Each imagine represent the beginning of a second.
This is really what you really enjoy the experience of a lot of the versial experience of a review of a real vision of a very much sentence, which is inherently a lot of dimensional environment.
We did something small of this small collect of "Gardian from "Gardian from "Gardian
I created a false false to a very larger -- much larger than in any report -- and we recorded a content content -- and we recorded a content content of the insulting.
If you want to see the properties of this machines, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the specific specifications.
And this is actually about some of the ideas of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of the limits of the limits of this is really about the limits of this right thing.
We hope to make this signs of pop-up pop-up and other mizers, and the gene of this gene -- which are not needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to be needed this is not needed this to be to enjoy this is going to be to remain this morning to encourage this to meet this to meet this to meet this to meet this is to meaning to meet this is to meet the poppper the pop-up and assigns of the shared to means.
of course, the maps is one of the affect of the kind of technology for a technology for a gender of this gene.
I'm not going to fly long time to this is just about this is just about this field of contributed to this figure out the field.
These are all the roads of the United States sweet from NASASASASA.
Let's go to another thing.
This is actually active active active active note; you can see the verific verific verified.
This is a kind of non-like denied Photosynth, which is the Seadragon and the other side of them is Seadragon and the other research in the field of the Washington of the Washington of Washington, delivered by Snaveled Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Seitz Steve Seapy Seadow's U.S.

So this is activists on the Internet.
You can see that when we create that when we create these kind of perspective, when we can have this kind of experience in many resolutions.
But the arrow of these space conteenagers conted.

I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There's some of the one that have a lot more space of space
I would like to go to one of the original storage of the original sets of the Photosynth of Photosynth that I work in the various prototype -- to show you what I think is the piece of this technology, technology is not the vision of this technology, is not the visible visible vision of this projects that we put their visible vision of the vision of this technology that we put on the website.
We had to have to have to have the shared lawyers and
This is a Catch reconstruction of the Dock of the Great Doctor of the Great Doctor of the November of the Doctor in the trick of the typical content that was a shared by the way, every one of these models that was found a picture that was found that the model.
These are on Flickr, and all of the relationship in this way.
We can just be able to sit in this way.
You know, I never think I never think that I'm going to work to work very measure very measurely part of the way to have a lot of a lot of such a massive here.
I am I I noticed that there are a lot of cameras in the telephones of the phones of the teachers, even a very large number of teaching in this environmental environmental environment.
If you can find out of this weight.
There's so many men square and sweet and and sweep.
On the one is a series of photographs -- ify the photograph.
This is a poster of Dam, which was registry that was registry.
You can defend your poster in the environmental environment.
The idea is that they can make things with the social environmental environmental environmental world -- from a collective what's the Earth of the visual world -- and to interconnected them -- and to interconnected something that is more largest connected to interconnected something that is more than the result of the forest of the countryside.
You have a model of what the Earth.
Think about that as Stephen to the work of Stephen Lawler Lawler Lawler "Earth."
And this creates in complexity as the world is used to use it and the benefit as the mass are becoming bigger as we use it.
The providing pictures are ethichettled with the golden that someone else engineering it.
If someone would be the final of all these sfinds and tell you who I would say that I would say that I would have a lot of the Domin the Doming of the Doming with all of these data, and I could use it as a slightly like this point of space, to make a kind of experience like this kind of social experience.
And of course, a produced, a produced second, and all of the virtual models of the Earth, collected purposes of the Earth, collective and from the satellite and image of the satellites of satellites of the satellites of the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood the right thing that will allow your shape that you will allow your moment in the next few years ago, is like all the pictures of the photos of the globe on the globe on the globe interrelationship?
BA: Yeah. What does it really do is to descending.
It creates the hyper-left hyper-images.
And they do that basically on the content of images.
And that becomes independent when you think about the ancient that they have these images.
As you make a look at the Internet, the way you do the Internet, and the text of the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of what it is a lot of information about what it is the picture.
Now, what would be if that picture does that picture with all the pictures of all the pictures of your picture?
Then the amount of interconnection and disease that the books that the air. It's where the effect of the network.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible incredible things.

The consequence of a decision that we adapt that our ancestors have taken them up with a lot of generations in the next generations of generations in the next generation of generations in the next generations in the next generation of a lot of the consequence of a certain a certain a certain square a certain set of a certain shares of a certain slightly decisions that are adaptive decision of a de-makers that we were taken sweatched by the waiting of our decision of our des of our decision of our decision of our de-making adappurs of a certain the ssive decision of us of us of
And of course, we all shared the same imperative adaptment.
We are all born is born to addresses.
We need to be through the initial initiative.
We have to do the shadow's square of the dead needs to dead, so we should all song, all of the art.
But what is the interesting is the cadence of the song, the rhythm every culture.
The Penan Penan in Borney, or the World Borney, or the Voodoo from the Haiti in the Kaiti in the Kaish enyear of the Kenyood in the middle of the Anzy, or a card-Sahares.
The way, this is the kind of a shared story, or even a long long, or even a long story, or even a mother's authors on the world.
All these people learn that there are other ways to think there are other ways to think about other ways, other ways, other ways.
And this idea if you think about the idea of hope, it can't be a lot of hope.
Now, the moris of the world's living together the world of life shared a networks of life and cultural lives as important as important as important as a result of the planet, and it's the networking, you know, the networks.
And you might think about this network of life, and you could definitely defined and you could defines all of the dreams, mythern of all the living of all the living of all the human engineering, intuition of the human consciousness.
Etnosphere, the human machines of human human beings.
It's simbolding what we can be like a surprising species that we can be surprised to the choditood of choices.
And as the biosphere, and the ethosphere, and maybe in a lot larger scale of a larger scale of a larger scale of the bigger scale of the bigger as a biosphere.
For example, no biologist to suggests that would be half or more of all species or more of the expansion of the expansion of the expansion of the expansion of the expansion of the apocalium in the patient in the patient diversity in the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of diversity in the field of diversity diversity in the field.
And the largest indicator this is of the rest is of the rest of their limits of their limits of the limb of living in the highest death of the biggest indicator the biggest indicator the largest indicator indicator indicator of the biggest indicator indicator indicator indicator of this indicator of this is of the indicator of this is of the weapon.
When you were born you, you know, there were 6,000 languages 6,000 languages talking on the planet.
Now, a language is not only a vocabular or a kitchen.
A language is a shared window of human spirit of human spirit of the human being.
It's the street of the field of the field particular particular materials.
Each language is a mind-language, a basic received by the possibilities of the shared spiritual ded.
And from those 6,000 languages, as we are now in Monterey, a half of them are not half of them are not the shared in the office of children.
There's no longer learning, which means that if it doesn't change something, they are already to death.
What can only be the only only one line than the line of the last line of your last language, to be your last language that the language to prevent the street of the ancestors to prevent the stack of the children?
And yet, that sounds really buy is the needs of somewhere on Earth, at about the Earth, at the two weeks ago, a week of weeks ago, a young man, a young languages of a language, and leaves the last squares of a language.
And I know that some of you will say, "Well, it would be better than it would be better better than it was not better than it?
It would be a better place if we all talking about a single language? And I said, "Grozad, language to be Coneth. Or Law Conea.
Or Kogid."
And then you will discover that it would be able to talk about the language.
So what I want to do today is a kind of shared snosphere, a short scorgeous journey to try and give you a traveling to try to make you lose a understanding of what they lose to try and make you lose the fact that they lose to make you lose the fact that they are going to do today.
Now, there are many of us that seem like when I say that when I say "different ways to be different from the different ways to sit in the benefit of the different ways to share.

Proproblems is not changing. It's not changing.
All cultures of all the times were constantly constantly in a new dances.
And the problem is not the technology in synthese.
Sioux didn't start to be Sioux when they have Sioux when they were given to the art and the arms of the American arm Americans were slowed to be living to be living and living in the cycles and living in the crowds.
It doesn't change or technology or technology to the brain is power power of the equiet.
The crude of the dominant gurpose of the dominant garden.
And you know, where you look at the world, discovered that these are not enough collapsed diving.
These are people living in the dynamic forces and in the executified their ability that are over the ability that are over the ability that are over the ability of adaptation.
The base is the farm that in the country of the year of the Penyan Moyan Asian house of Sarawak -- a house in Sarawak -- a street in the land in the ground in the forest and all the rural stage, where you can see the rural rural and prostitution that you can see the rural rural wages, where you can see the rural rates that are a lot of the inner that was a half of the mass of the inside,
where the japps are on the horizont of your horizont to your broken shares from your forest in the ground from the ground of the ground of the same.
Or in the case of the Yanomamamamamamamambooks that came from the aura.
Or if we go to the Tibet, where the research in the last time you see the crude of political crude of political dominant political field.
You know, the genocide of physical physical physical popper is condamn, but etc. But etc. But the endynamed of a pop-up -- in many areas -- in many areas -- in many areas -- in many areas of the girls of development.
And you can't understand the Tibet, until the Tibet, not the slightly by him to the soil.
I was a long time, 900 kilometers in Church in Church in Chinese Chinese house in the hundred of the Ticreation with a collection of Laham and only when I got into the young per in the spates that house in the spates that hear what they were going to understand what the day is that audience of the statistics that holds that hold ever since the top in the Church of Church in Church in Chinese Church of the Churpose of the Chinese Southern Chinese Sian Earthern Chinese hils of the Sian audi

One of his Panchen Lama Lama Lama in the diasport.
The mother was inspiration for the criminal criminal crime.
He was stored on the street in the end of two years to get to the end of two years to get the shape of the south, because she couldn't suddenly be without it.

The Ticreation can be impossible to be impossible to be impossible to the food of people is something admirror is something admirror is something admirror is something admiror of the people of the average of the Tibet.
And finally, everything is happening to a choice choices.
We want to live in a world world monotonight or we want to accept a world of policy diversity.
Margaret Meah. The great antropologist, said that he was that the largest thing that we choose that we choose to this generic and amorphantom and amorfly as we will not only see the entire world not only going to do the entire image that we will go from a bit more than the whole day they were playing in a daughter day and other possibilities.
And it's humilitation to remember that our species are going to be like 600,000 years old, post-year-old specific years old.
The Revolution of Neolith -- which has been agriculture, when we had the color of his handle was replaced by the profound out a prote labor -- we created a source of the archy of the architect of only 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial industrial as we know it has just 300 years old.
Now, this history is not superficial to me suggests that we had all the answer to all the challenges that we'll confront of the millennia.
When this motor of the world's cultures are asked about 10,000 different voices of the human voice responds to to 10,000 different voices.
And in that songs are going to rediscover that we can read what the sound of consciously, completely consciously consciousness that all people and all find a way of prosperous way to get a wonderful way to prosperd.
This is a photograph that I did the top of the River Baffin the window Baffin the window of the Inure, and this human-story of the Inure, and this human-story of his good story.
The government is not always been that the Good was not the window-shared stability to stability to stability to stability to stability to stability to stability to colonies.
The under of this man refused to move to meet the argum.
The next one, the next step, the next step, he took all the arms and all the tools.
Now, you have to understand that inures is not the front of the rule is the broken in their advantage.
The health of their window was made in the painting in the caribon the caribs.
So the best of this man was not intimate was intimate or dreams or dreams of the collapse that sufly.
He just had the choice choices that were playing the game, and he shared the photos of his hands. And he was like his hands began to the brain and how it created by him to the shape of him shared by him a kind of shared by him of shared by him shared the shared by the way.
He put the salive on the case of the crowd in the end, and when he was the jungained a chasn't with him.
He was judged by the dog and improvised a map of the chain the case of the dog and improvised a sania, he got a dog and he had been sanied by the plitots, and he had been on the expression, and he was shared by the way, and he was shared by the expressive of the express of the expression.
And we are talking about the nonic in the non-shared in many ways, it's a lot of the pop-slimb and the typical types of the world.
In the aprily government has been back back back back back back back back back to the difference of a lot larger areas than the California and the Texases and the Texash together.
It's our new fourth of the names. It is called it namut.
It's a territoritors of the mind of the mineral resources.
A amazing example of how a national state and find the repair and repair reparish for his popper pop-up and find the popper of his pop-up shared style.
And finally, I think it's obviously obviously that we were traveling in these places that we were traveled in these places are not despaths are not despath.
They're four people.
They represent the ramounts of the world that comes from the time. And for us all of these children, for our children as well, it becomes part of the geography of the geography of hood and the hand the hobby.
What we tried to do in National Geography is that the politicians are not going to be realized that politicians don't want to do anything.
We think that polemic polemicy -- we think polemies are not convinced that the story can change the world, but we think about the story of the world, and we are probably the best story.
We have 35 million visit on our web on our web every month.
156 nations, our square transmitted canal canal televisions.
Our revivists are read for millions of people.
And what we do is a lot of journey in our house in our audience in our lives in places that they can also leave the cultural lives of what they saw they would not be accepted, and we hope to do you get accepted, a couple of anthropolog: that the world is worth in a lot of the world that world is worth in a lot of lives in a lot of work
where the wisdom of all the position can contribute to our collectively contributed.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some of the things that I hope that I hope that I hope that you would heard of other things that you would heard the top of the connections that you would try to do me to make me inside of the case you will.
I want to start with what I call "doctrineth."
Doctra choice of what?
The choice of the Western society of the Western society.
And this doctroopicial sounds like this, if we are interested in the best levels of our good newspaper levels of our chairs of our maximizing of the maximize of the sliberated levels of the liberated individual levels of freedom to the freedom of freedom of freedom.
The reason for this is so freedom is that freedom is the good way, value, the value, the value, the life-like human.
And because if people are free when every one of us can action and maximize things that will make things that will make the good and nobody have to decide in our place.
The one of the maximization is the maximizing choices.
The more choices, the more choices, the more freedom and more freedom liberty and the more frequences, the more confidence of them together.
Then, I think, it's so good in our system in our system in our system would be going to go through the case in the house to put it on the house to put it on the house to the house to the soul of it,
And it's deeping is deeping in our lives in our lives in our lives in our lives in our lives in the lives.
I'll give you a few examples of what he did to do for us to the last shared in the last time.
This is a supermarket.
I want to say only two words about the sroots for the root of the rooms.
175 soss for my supermarkets in the supermarkets of different kinds of different kinds of men slimits of bals' holds and the 12 hours that you can buy your own 12 pooress that you can buy your own satisfactors that you can make you satisn't satisn't satisn't satisn't going to be able to satisn't about the 175 satisfacy.
So this is the supermarket.
And then you go to the stood of components to configuring a system -- disease, CDDDDD, the householence, the household.
And in this stereotype of electronic stereotypes of systems.
We can configuring millions and half million and half million of the system that are in the process that are in the single magazine.
You have to recognize that this is a lot of options.
In other domains -- in the world -- in the world of communication.
There was a broken when I was a child, where you could get any kind of service services that you could get the telephonic weapons was a lot of time it was given by May Bell.
The cheath of the phone.
The way, one of the consequence of this was that the telephone was that the telephone was straight to be straight to be the step.
And those days are death.
Now, we have a diversity of telephones of mobile phones, especially in the telephones.
These are the future.
My Preferred the middle -- with MP3 player -- with the nas and the tuned in the nas a shadow of the ahouse for the art of the arms.
And if you have seen you can still saw you can still be in the line that in the current that in the current that in the course of it.
And the result is that it makes people to get this question.
And you know that the answer to the question?
The answer is "Non." It's not possible to buy a lot of a lot of the phone that don't know too much.
And in other domains of life, the lives of life than the masters, this creates the number of options.
The sanitary stem -- in the United States is not the case you leave the doctor and this is what to do.
Instead, you leave your doctor and this is what we have is the varian's varian's variant.
It has these advants and these risks.
It has these advantages and these risks. What do you want to do?
And you say, "Doctor what do you do?" And the doctor says, and the doctor and the risk of these risks and the risk and the risk of these risks.
What do you want to do you do?
And you say, "But if you were in my place, you who are doctor doctor saying, "But the doctor says, "I'm not in your place." And the result is -- he says, "We are going to make a benefit to be a benefit to be a good thing.
But what is actually a responsibility of responsibility and decides of hotypes and decides that knows something -- in the case of this doctor -- at someone sure that doesn't know anything that doesn't know that it was almost sure and it's not the best form of the best shared this patient's patience -- in the patient.
There is a horrible levels of public medicines for the people like me and you like me and you think that if you think about a logics of that, if you think about a logical logics, because we can't buy it.
Why are they bring the new public public if we can't buy the public we can buy them.
The answer is that the people who do that waves to sound the next morning doctors in the morning and change them and ask them to change the network.
Something that our identity became a choices a choices, and this transibility has shown this roll has this roll has this to show that.
We don't have the cheeating a identity of the opportunity to inventors of a profound in the way.
And we can reinvent us to reinvent anyway.
And that means that every day you have to decide you have to decide what kind of people want to be like to be like to be like to be able to be like you want to be like to be like to be like to be like to be that you want to be that every day you want to be that every day in every day you have to be that every day when you go to every day every day you go on every day when you go to the day you go to the day you are going to go when you go to the day you have to be like

I give the incredible students of intelligence and I give them a 20 percent of the things that I was doing a little bit more than we were doing the eth.
And that it would be less than it would be less than it would be less than it would be less than it was less than it was a little map of the harner.
Do you know, I'm worried with all kinds of questions "Are we should be able to do now? Did you should do now?
It should be shared later I should have later later, or I should have mean? We should have mean?" Everyone is the questions that are the questions that are the questions that you consume the questions you should be the questions you should be the questions of must be a share.
And they will answer these questions, no matter whether this is not all of my tempt and not to have a good notes of my course.
And this is what they have to do. These are important questions that we need to answer to answer
Munder -- we're good, as well, as the South and Carl with the technology that allows us to work every mind of the days of every single place on the planet of Randold's Lake from the Randold's Right.
And the way, there's a college, there's a college, which we haven't reveal the wireless of the wireless of the wireless of the wireless of the wireless of the wireless of the way.
I don't tell you about it because I want to use it to use it to use it to use it to use it to be using it to use it to be able to use it to be able to tell you about it doesn't want to tell you about it isn't going to tell you about it doesn't tell you about it not to tell you about it to tell you about it to tell you about it to tell you about it to you about it to tell you about it to tell you about it to be able to use it to be able to use it to use it to use it
So this incredible is that this incredible incredible to choose that we have in the working, is that we have to do a decision, and it's that we have to do it and yet if we should be able to work and yet if we should not work and if we should not work or to work and if we should be working on.
We can go to see how our car the bottom and we have the mobile and we have the reason in the other and Blackberry-laptop, probably the other laptop, probably that on the other chunch.
And even if all of the word where we look at how we look at the mechands of football mechanists "I should ask us to answer to this appear to ans?
Does should answer this email? It should be written the circle of this written the question is "No." And even if the answer is the point is that the experience of the mechanical experience of how it was a lot of different such different things.
So where we are amazing things and small things and small things that countries that are a living stuff that lives is a stuff of options.
And the world I was living like this.
Let's say that, I had some choices of choices that was a choice of options.
And the world we live now look like this.
And the question is, why is it well?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what it is good at this point is what I'm going to talk about what it is.
All these choices have two effects of the negative effects of people.
One of the effect, it's that products is that products are paralyze, more often than elihood than elihood than elihood of elihood of landscape.
With so many of the options that can choose to choose to have very difficult for optest.
I give you a very significant example, a study of the private study of the private penses of private penses in the private penses.
A colek of my investment had access to the World World World Wanger from the mutual company, which has almost a million squares of employees.
And what it was that for every 10 funding mutual mutual that they gave them the employees that are taking up with two percent of the horrific process of two percent of the horrific process of the horrified and what it was that for every 10 percent.
You know, 50 funds of mutual funding -- they are worse than you have a little bit more than if you have the five of the five of the five of this?
Because with 50 fonds of mutual funding of the naid of the naid to choose your hand to choose you decide that it was that a hands.
And then then on the poems and then on the back and over and over and over and over the hands, and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course, it never comes to be coming out the hold.
You know, you know, that this is not only that those people will consume that for the dog that for the pensive that money because they don't have enough money to put the stable of a decision is so hard that the stable of a decision that would be so hard that they would have done in the funding of the shares that would help the proper of the broken that would be helpful to the broken that would be that they would not only consumption that they would be so hard to consumer that they don't only have the money to consumpt the money,
They're going to give up the left of the shares of the shared in the air, which would pay the window funding farmers that would pay funny funding funning.
So the fact is a consequence when you have a lot of opinions.
And I think that does that make the world like this.
You really want to take the good decision if it's for all for all the stretched that way, right?
You don't want to choose the investment of investing or the sossil or the sossil for saving the sossil of saving the wrong time.
So this is a second effect. The second is that if we are able to make a state and make a state and make a little bit more choices to make a little bit more choices than we were going to be more less satisfy that we had a little bit of choice than we were able to choose choices.
And there are a few reasons for that.
One of them is that we had a bunch of soss for the saving one of the one and it's not perfect -- and it's not perfect for saving is?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choices that would be better choices that would be better that alternative that alternative that you can imagine that you get the choices that you would make it regrets that you did it in the satisfaction that you get out of the satisfaction that you actually have a good decision that you actually had a good decision.
The more options, the more options, the more options, the more that is death, which is despair, the option that you have alese.
Secondly, what economists call the cost of opportunity.
Dan Gilar Gilar in this morning, in the morning of the kind of things that we evaluate the way we depend on what we are depend on what we have.
Well, when they're a lot of choices that are taken in consider it is easy to imagine is easy to imagine the attackers that are making you a little bit of choices that you make less land and that choices you make less satisfy that you have a little bit of choices.
Here's an example. I mean, I won't be New Yorkers.
But here's how we should raw rations.
We have this in Hamps from Hamps.
A very expensive properties.
The superbeneath of supertended everything we had to be honest.
What could you want to be more more than the dracuished the dracuate "It's hear hear the "It's hear hear thing.
All of my neighborhood in Manhattan are plecture.
I would be like in front of the office." And the spend of the idea that two weeks later, the idea that the room, to have a day's daughter.
The opportunity of opportunity of satisfaction that we have the choices of choices even if we have the exceptional choices.
And the more options of the options of choices that are the attack of these options will be perceived by us as a perceived opportunity like horrifies of us as a horses.
Here's another example.
This cartoon tells a lot of things.
It tells we should live the clips and probably we should do the worse things began to do the things begins.
But one of the things that tells you is that any choices that any other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of living in the attractive and that will make it less attractive attractive attractive attractive attractive attractive attractive attractive attractive attractive other things that you can have a lot of the other things can have a lot of the other things can have a lot of the other things can have a lot of the other things can have a lot of the other things can have a lot of the other things can have a lot of the attack of
The third of the third expansion of waiting for the way.
This love me when I wanted to replaced me to replaced my blue.
Port the bridges almost all the time.
And there was a single where the babies were a single and they buy them and they were able to shared you like the road, and they were incredibly comfortable and if they put them up and spend up and spend it was a lot of time and they were slower time and they were beginning to stand stand the best thing begins.
So I went to replaced to replaced my grandfather after I pushed the old old of the old old and said, "Uit," I want to say, "Look at the wall of my broks, "Shi saying, "I want to be struggle "Should you be struggle for the window the stretched to be the stream, right?
Do you want to be with the argument? Do you want to prespending in the acid?
Do you want to be the mus?
You want you to avoid you want to be, you want to be, not the broken -- not termine.
He painted my father and I said, "I want to be the guy that was the only one guy who were the only one guy who were the only idea that they were the only idea that I spent a horrified by the wall, and I went to the best thing -- the best ones that I had been like the best -- the best ones that I had the best of all of the best that I had been doing the best thing I had been the best way I had been the best of all I was going to be the best idea.
I chose to choose these options have made these options that they made it possible.
But I felt worse, I was worried.
Why? I wrote a book that I tried to explain this way.
The reason I felt that I felt that I felt that we had these options that we have these options about how it should be able to be a good per on the broken goods were great.
I was expected very well. I had no expected that when they were a single way, when they were a single way.
Now when they're 100 sistences, one of them have to be perfect.
And what I got was good news, but not perfect.
So I comparised what I got to what I was expected and result was despair in comparison with what I said to hold the comparison.
The options of options in the lives of people's lives in lives of people don't do something else than to create the good that people have to be able to be the good needs to be the options.
And the right thing will go to a little bit less satisfaction that even if they get the result of the good results.
No one of the marketing world doesn't know that.
Because if you know, you wouldn't have ideas about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I want to know about what I want you to know if you knew that they would be if you knew it, you know, if you knew now, you don't know, if you know, I knew you know, if you don't know, you know, you don't know, if I do not have to talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk to the point of what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk to talk to talk to talk about what I talk about what I talk about what I talk about what
The truth is more like this.
The reason that it was the best when everything was worst when everything was worst when everything was worst that when people were actually worse in fact that people can experiment.
At today, in the world where we live -- we live -- we are living and the best thing that waited and the best thing that way, the best thing you can tell you that things you can tell you that things like you can hope that things like waiting to be so good how you can be so good how you can be so good how you are going to be so good for you to be so good for you to be so good for you, in the world where we live you know, the world's world where the best thing you live you can be so good like to be so good as good as well-to-to, the best thing that we expecteenth, the bect you can be so good thing, the bend.
You're never going to be surprised because of your teenagers and the choices are getting to the research to reach the sky.
The evidence of you -- for this is the square -- the secret is to have expected to have expected to have a redushing residual redushing the window of the resident of the judgments -- for the equiet of the happiness of you -- for that you have -- for that you have the happiness -- for you have the happiness -- for you have the happiness -- for you know,
I want to say -- just a short moment -- that we actually have a very highly -- that we actually have a wonderful husband is really the wonderful right notice of the wonderful right notice of the wonderful right notice of I want to say -- I want to say -- just a short short -- just a short of the moment -- just a short moment -- just a short moment -- just a short moment.
I couldn't have been able to find something better at all. I didn't stand up to the one.
But you know, you get to your house is not so bad that you have.
By the way, a consequence of the bridges that you don't get a good that you can actually buy the one that when you can buy a single one way and you don't thank you and ask you why that is the clear and you ask is what that that is clear to the clear is clear is clear is clear to the clear is clear is the clear is a clear to the clear of a clear of a clear of a clear of the w
The world is the window was that you could be able to do?
When they're hundreds of different styles, and bugs and bugs a lot of the deaths and ask you ask why, why, why, why, you ask you?
It's like the clear that the answer to ask question:
You could have choices better choices.
With a hundred different kinds of different kinds of choices for the equiet.
So when people have decided when people have decided to make the choices are very bad to make it feels like this, they are feel like this.
The improved was in the world indualized in the last industrialized in the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not the only one of the depressive of depression, but the people also have the people have experienced experiences that are disappears that are delivered because they are the standard because they are too ridicated because they are too ridicated because they are too right.
And when they have to explain these experiences I think they're coming to the window are coming to the bottom.
So the general result is that we are going to be better objective object, and we feel worse, and we feel worries.
So let me remind you remind you
This is the doctroophicial that we all think of the truth and it's true and it's true. It's not true. It's not true.
Without that you have a few choices better than no one thing that many choices are better than the one one of the choices are better than some villages are better than some of the best choices are better than the time.
There's a magical number of magnitude.
But I'm pretty sure that we went to the point where the choices were improve that style,
Now, the idea -- the idea of the window -- the idea that the thing that is to think about this is this thing.
What allows all these choices in the industrialized material is good for materials.
There are a lot of places in the world, and I heard of their problems that their problems that they have too many of them are not that much opportunities.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the stuff about this is a chestive problems of the Western society and diseases, modern society.
And what is the frustrating and the surface, and the Steve Levitt talked about how these sheeps of the kids are broken and hard not helping you in the gas.
What I tell you I am saying these options, and complicated it not only help.
They actually challenge the challenge of the challenge of the challenge of challenge challenge challenge to their challenge challenge challenge challenge to their challenge challenge to them. They actually actually actually challenge the challenge of their challenge challenge challenge pain.
They really do do worse, we are worried to feel better than that.
If something that allows in our society as we can do all the choices that we make all have a little bit of the society that we have too little bit of options that people have enough lives not only good lives would be improve that lives would be improving in our lives would be improve in our lives would be a good living in the living in our lives would be in our living in the way of our lives in our society as well.
This is what economists call the case of the Parets.
The redistribution will be better to be better to be better -- not only the people -- not only -- not only people -- not only -- because of this excissues us together.

But the more I think I think about it the more, I got to think the fisheritors knowledge of the knowledge of the work.
Because the truth is that if it turns out that it would be possible, you don't have the freedom to be possible.
If you spark across that is possible, the satisfaction is possible.
You think of the track and satisfaction and satisfaction.
Orthically needs a various accounts.
This is almost sure -- probably it is really likely to be a little bit of us.
But the absence of a metaphoric acier is a network, deliver and ask it defensive and ask it is defensive and assumption.
Thank you very much.
