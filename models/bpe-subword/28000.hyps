That's why our principle, our principle principles a big surgery of public forces to help us to show us and to show us and complicity that we have the real news about the carbs.
The myself, in fact, the carbon is not did.
We think that is the current -- and moving and movie and good.
So it will not the ingrijors for change.
You know, that you can do that in the way.

But now we have a new solution to the top, to the course of the curately includes.
The energy of energizing in the electricity of electricity now in 10 years ago.
A plan to put the case in the tree of the tree, and then it makes us to help us to the stopping of global ineful in the global stop.
In the swings, a solution that is the big solution to help us solve the problems.

Thank you very much of the well.
The year of TED TED I did a LHC.
And we have the promised to give you a little bit of how it works on how it works.
So, the home. And so the people who had no one there. And for the most experiment is the most experiment that was the most experiment that was recreated the Someter's recreating the Stremer or is the recreating the Stree or is the recreating a baction of a baction of a second-broken in the size of a second-broken in the sixth of the six billion times a seconds.
It's extremely ambitious.
This is the apart of Geneva.
We are going to photographs of these mines in the decades.
I work on it. It's called the ATLASS is the ATLASS -- Leagypes, the diameter of 22 meters of the ATV photography here of the ATATLAs you can see the proportion of the ATALAin building to build the proportion of the proportion.
On 10 sepatient the year of the third of the first time.
And this image was the making of ATLAS.
He caused a cheebrutation of control.
It's a picture of the first fashion the particular of the species that the LHC, the system of the LHC, the LHC, the LHC, the word on the HC, working with a deliberately deliberate in the HC deliber's detector.
In other words, when I was going to know that this image that image that I was stored that the water work, which is a huge successful for the successful machine.
I don't know if that was the most largest open, or that somebody else went on the book on the board and his first steps and the first piece of the first piece.
The meaning that we did a cultural impact cultural impact of the street stream.
After about a seapartment of a sapart, I had a problem with these field -- these fieldly.
These are the 13 men to the 13 thousands of maximum when the power of power to power the maximum of power of power
Now, the engineers in the engineering and said, "I can't translate the attention of remote myself."
But I can do that when I'm at the temperatures becoming the temperatures.
So as a 27-hand the future of the decades of the street and those fields can translate the way of cool.
One of one of the 99,000 of the 10,000 in LHC, was a fabricatic fabricatic fabricatic fabrication.
So the comes that the Comb, and the 13 thousands of both dies were intentled the resilience.
This was the result.
This is the more impression of those magnets of the magnets of the tone, and they have been funnetworks.
So, we have deteriorated about 50 deteriors of the magnetic field.
We had to have to have to be able to do it.
We reconditioned on the top, I repaid.
And now you go back to the magnetic magnets.
Pana map of his sfarmers of the LHC will be as a new thing.
We will go from again, and we have been able to get the data or hundred or hythese, and we're going to keep the research to research that are the elemental elemental elemental engineers of universe.
Now, of course, as a sense of those cidence recognize about the important engineers of the important engineering and engineering to report the extremely rejured to reach it.
I think that the fact that the fact that is that the fact that we have a little bit of the fact that we have a little experiments like HCH.
I will be the lased of a word of a word of a stiinary story of a story of the Humphritantic experiments that are the inner of the protect of the Michael Farchael Farchael Farchael Faradly: "No one of the mind that we are not going to be the kind of mind-driving stintissue of our minds are not more than our own stinitially and the light of our minister that we are not going to be more.
Thank you.
I would like to remember the kidney to remember the childhood of childhood, when you play with the boxes.
On the mash you what you have to have the kinds and to the choice and to get them to the cology of the cology and you can actually get to the issue and manipulate the problems and manipulate the spaces and manipulate the spaces of spaces and manipulate their spaces and the relatively you can get the spaces of the massland what you can invest with their spaces and you can get them to the choose to get them to the choice them to get them out what you can have to shape their choose to take them to take them to the se.
The per spaces of spaces of how we understand how a big part of how we understand a big part of the world of inconjects.
So that if we can see a research of IT inspired by this usually inspired with our physical objects -- imprice -- impresence of Pattty -- I including -- I started the collaboratory -- I started using a computer -- we have a computer of a computer in this case, when we have a computer in this case, if we can use a computer of the cancer of the cancer of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse of of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse of the mouse of you could be a mouse of the mouse of the mon to be couse of the mouse of the maybe while of the maybe if we be able to be call of us of the call of the mouse of the maybe whoice of the main
Do we have to do it in the arm?
The question was the question of fascinating that I was able to ask the answer to the Siftable.
On the scorout, a Siftable computers is a computer of a bisure.
They can be manufacturing the reciprocess of the reciprocess of one other perceive, and a relationship, and they have a relationship.
The most important is that I'm a palpable of the game, so you can just take the water and you can just approaching it as you can do it.
And Sifables a new equipment of a new equires of manipulation of the digital information to the digital information.
On the mash of what these instruments becomes more constantly more constantly one of the other constantly one of our acties active.
I will start with some examples of a simple example.
This Siftable is configuring is to predict the video of a video of including the film of a film in a direction of the film in the other parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the Sifts.
These comes are constantly interactive of each other of the other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other people.
So, if you put them on one language, it becomes interested in the way.
If they're going to be inconjected and that, and it can become confuse.
And I can also feel the missing and inclincline.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of interactive implications that we can use the gestablish of shares how we could use a culture of a lymouse of how we could have a culture of a lympic lys.
In this case, we have three Siftables configuring as a painting, and they can use to reach their book, where they will use to reach the center where they will be amestecture.
If I was a lot of scape, we can be a lot of the inner in the air in the way.
There are also also also also interesting to education for education, like education, like the mathematical language and holding and the humans of the possibility to be the quicity to see things that things we want to see the result of the results of the results of the results of the results of the results of the results of the immediately interesting of the possibiliti
So here -- this is a Fibonacibonacibonacibonacier programs.
Here we have a game of combination of combination of combination and Boggle.
The acticker, every other one type of the first tables on every Siftable, and on the mother of the words of form that they have the verified with a dictionary.
Then you can take about 30 seconds of the literate of the literate set of the literal choices and new possibilities and new possibilities of recognize and new choices.
Thank you.
These are the kids who came into the Media Laboratory to the Media, and I was to try to make them settled to the film of them and film to film a material that and film a material material that and film and films are going to be able to filters in the rooms are the children are the kids of the kids of kids have the kids of
It lived in the neighborhood.
And one of the interesting thing that is that the kind of applications of this kind of applications of people are not to give them a lot of instructive people in the structure.
All you have to say, "For word," and they know what to do.
Here are other people in the cancer, you have a few people inside it.
This is the most tanar there, and our best and in the right-the-fashion the right.
It seems like everything that everything that was to do was to take a Siftable.
So for him there.
This is a bad apply apply apply inactivates.
We wanted to build a instrument language.
And this is Felix.
He can get new characters in the scene, just the Siftables that the Siftables that affess.
Here is the so-like so-husle.
Video: The race.
David Merrill: Now he would get a traction, he wrote a traction,
Video: The Trace.
Good well.
Siftable, and Siftable, and you can make their own characters to interact -- Video: Ham!
DM: creating their narratic narrative.
Video: Okay!
DM: It's a final story with how it will open the story of how to open the story of how it will be drawing it.
Video: Zara, the pis!
DM: The UlS: The last example I showed it is a instrument and interpretated music and interpreted music live and in which Siftables that Sifables and in which Sifables and all the Sifables and all the baby sound like the role and all of the baby of the sounds of the gype.
Every one of these four various variation is different choices that you want to use it.
And you can inject the sound of the sound that you can asasambon what you can do you walk you can do it.
You can get the sound sound of the sound of a Siftable-sland of a successful Siftable Sifts.
There are effects that you can control the live and filters and filter.
You know, you can get a specific that sound and then include it for the use.
It takes the effects of the emerging effects and the volume of the square of the square of the House sequences of the House and sequences.
Video: DM: We're going to start with a Siftables in the Siftables of a series of a series, we have inside a series, a series of a seriouse.
Now a basic line.
Video: DM: So now I put the percur in the percur of the percutts.
Video: DM: And now I'm going to bring the filter of the filter of the effect.
Video: Ma: Ma: Make the secsecsection of inclinical inclinical or someone else.
Video: M: M: Now I'm going to attacker for the expression of the expression.
Video: DM: M: I can do the second time as a second while the quantly.
So I don't have to do the planet, I can improvise, maybe improvise, long with melodia in the work.
Now, in the swings, they can throw the second of Siftable-second Siftable-volunteers.
Thank you.
As you see my passion is my passion is creating new interfaction of us that is the way that it works better with the way that it works and our brain and our brain and our body and our body is works.
And today, I had time to show a time of a new space, and some of the process of design, and some of the possibilities that we have to attacks that we have attempted to the laborators.
The one that I would have the retinent of the network is that we are at this new generation of instrument instrument with the middle of the digital world will aduck our world to our own digital remote the information in our world to make our funny information in our own rules of our world that will bring our floor of our own gardens that we will add the rest of our retiny that
Thank you very much.
Astept with your nerable nerable nervous about it.
They're writing.
He wrote your career is the professional profession, but it is more than that.
It's all my money and my mom and fascinating.
And I don't have this this to this is what it is going to change it.
But these physics to hold the bad was a little bit of the life and in the book, and in the book, which was the benefit of my worker remote with the works.
And the thing that I wrote is that I wrote this car, this car, "Manca, Roagain and Iubish Rool, Rool, Iubeber, who is in the deossil of all of the world for a little bit of the world for a little bit of the world for a sense of bad sensory sensory of the world for a sensation of by-sensation sensory sensitive sensation of the world of international sensition.
The reefs is that the original horrible now, people go now.
Serios -- conamnature, condamnature!
Are you in example, and you say, "Do you don't have a teama is themselves, you might not be able to more and more you can actually be able to more to be perform of th?
Do you don't have to write the traveling to write your own story of your life on your own book a book a book that would be a book that would ever have the world on the world on the world on the world that everybody els?"
It's very line links, indeed.
But it would be more running if I was not my remind that I was going to be able to received to be when I was a big story when I was a writing people -- I want to become a writer -- that I want to become a kind of same assumption of the same assumption of the same assumption of the same mouse of the same box-based on a kind of like a kind of friction of the same thing.
And people said, "Not the tomorrow that you will never have any of success?"
Do you don't know that the windness will you you?
You don't have the front of the word in this field of your life and no one will never take a girl here and not will not be here on a deadly deadly on a deaths of the garages with the center of a couple of a center of a couple of making a mas?"
Something that is that that way.
The sland -- the rack of the question on all those inside the questions is "Yes."
Yes, you know, it's the theater of all of those things.
And it always store.
And you know, it's a teama lot of other things that people can never inture.
As a lot of examples of the big things that are infrastructure that are infrastructure of things that are infrustrating.
But when it is written about writing the work that I was all about the last time I was doing in the last time is "why?"
Is it something ration?
It's the logic that anyone to the worker that they feel like that they feel that was pretty much like this Pamant.
And what is that this is attention of initiatively initiatively that seemed to be the sanatelinists of mental chanates in a way that other professionals don't do a way that other professionals don't do it?
Tatal for example, was the chemist and they don't have the engineer remember of the 40 years of engineering of the chemistry of the chemist.
It wasn't intamed -- John, how do it goes with the chemistry of the chemical?
It just doesn't really get it in the way of it.
But as we can be syndromes are chemists that have too much the crops of the century of the centuries of the remarkable maniaco-depressive maniaco-depressive maniaco-depression of the holes of the holes of holes of the engineers,
We write writers -- we have this remarkable remarkable remarkable remarkable remarkable reputable results, and they have this reputation of the labor to be powerful,
And all we have to do is to look at the number of morning of the death of the death of mind-field fish of creatively creative, who died died by creative, which have been opened by the young people and aware of the young people and aware of the young people who have been doing it.
And even the same thing that didn't have hear the same way, they would actually have the distracted to the choices.
Norman Mail, even though the last die, in the last interview, he said that "The Each has a little bit more than my books."
A extraordinary extraordinary about a life of a life of a life of a life of a life of it.
But it doesn't have the mack when we hear someone day's heard that we heard about many times and so many times and buying these things and buying and deliver, the idea that creativity and unfortunately, the idea of creativity and the immediately to be buying inherent and as arts, it will be able to the art of the art of the barras, it will always be inside of the farmers to the map of the far.
And the question I want to admit today is the type of all of the impact with this ideas with this ide?
You are comfortable comfortable with himself as a light of the eye of the eye of the hypothese.
I think it's odiodiodi.
And I think that I think that it was dangerous and not to see it in the future.
I think that if you get better if you include the artists to live it.
And I know that I was a sure of my situation -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to me to me to me to me to me the charity of this ipost-inric invisipost, special in the horite.
As a young example, I just have a 40 years.
I have probably because four decades like four decades.
And it's very probably like, what I wrote with this moment to be judge of the mountains of the last couple of the last couple of my own own story of my own story of my last book, right?
What would be a measured to mention that all of the way that we are already -- it's very likely to be a very important successful of my friends.
Oh, Doh, Does that goes like it.
This is the gene gene that could make somebody who could make somebody to get the nine of the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I think that I would do this in the message that I loved the message that I loved it.
And then, the question becomes the question?
And so I can put a lot of meditative meditative myself to work now, to write now, is through the building of a psychological buildings that are a kind of like that built a psychological protective protective that that we have a kind of coaste to be able to build that is the psyching of the psyndddness.
I have to find a way, to find a way to the pastrally a distant way to me, and the phone, and the phame, and the term of the natural law of what it will be able to reactive natural to what they write about what they written to what they write a reactive reactive of what they write writing about what they writing about what they written to the be,
And as we all have been looking at the last year of this sense of the time that I was trying to get the time and I tried to see other societies and then I could have more societies and more and more and more and more and more and more sanately, and more sanitary of how the emotional chanoice, and you can actually help us creatively to help us creative art of the emotional art of the emotional models of the emotional models of the emotional model.
The cost of this type of this ancient and Roma Roma ancient and Roma ancient of the ancient of it.
So the main the main the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the surgeon is so enormous. So the ursuit of the surgery of the main the marriage, so the main the marriage.
But in the time Great Great and Roma Roman ancient creativity that creativity of the tool, and the home,
People believe that creativity was a spirit of the people who can be able to enter people in a sure of the reasons and needs and needs and needs and needs and needs and needs and needs and needs and neighborhoods and needs and needs to be able to creativity to the creativity.
The city call these spirit comes to help creativity, the term of the face of the face of the face of the ty."
Socrats was the faimos because it has a demon that the shape of the shape of the shape of the departs.
The range of the same parents, but they call that spirit creative, but they would have the genius of the genius of the genius of the genius of the genius of the genius of the hospitals were the same disorders were the same disorders were the same disors were the same anothers.
What is wonderful, because romans, because the romants were actually a individual genius was a kind of individual genius to be enough to be enough to be enough romans.
They have a genius as a genius was a kind of an enough enough to the wall, which is a kind of like Dobby, and he said that Dobby, and he said to the house and insession of the case and insession of the machine of the mountain the workers of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of work that the mountains of the mountain the mountain the main the works.
The balloon -- that's what I was the distant that I was talking about -- that we have -- that built the result of your works.
And everybody knowledge that was work?
So the artist, the protected of that is the protecism, like a narcism, and too much narcism, right?
If you could get the strallow, you couldn't have the street for it, everyone else that the world that the world that the world that the genius that helped us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help his work for the label, if you could have been a strallow.
If you were criticizing the criticize was not completely there, isn't it?
The world steps that the genius was that the genius was a northermore.
So they look at the West creativity for a long time.
And then he came up with the Renast, and everything has changed with a big big idea that the mareats, the idea that the mare-maintain the center of all of the universe, and the mysters, and the mysters, and the mysters, and the mystery of creatures that they get the digital disorders of the digits.
It was the broke of the rational chased to creativity that creativity of the individual internal beginning.
And for the first history people have started refuel in one or one or one or one or one or one or one or one gene that you can have a genius to have a genius to have a genius to have a genius to have a genius to the genius and for the first genius to the first history of the overline over.
And you have to be a big cheeese herot.
Permite, a person to create a simple person or is actually creating the receptor and it's actually the sad and the surprising and the surprise, and the surprise, creative is a little bit of the mystery of the brother is a little bit of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the fragile of the person of the psychological person is a bagal person is a psychological person to the person of the person is actually a psychological person to make a patic
It's like you to have a few of you to keep the so-shape of the soil.
It just just just incord and form form and form all these asteptils of all these inimages of inimaginable inimaginable inimaginable.
I think that the presensus of the artists of one of the last 500 years of years.
And if I think that is true, and I think that is, what do we do now?
Can we do the things els?
Maybe we can go to the sensors of the relatively equires of the brain and the mystery.
It can not.
Maybe we can just stery it to stergem 500 years of human rational talk, the rational discurs of a 18 minutes.
And perhaps that are the audience that would be the question that would be absolutely unexpected to the typical resolution of people who are actually remote the people who are the rest of their own areas and all of their own areas and their survival areas and all of their own areas and they are probably as well-like audience and they are probably in their own places to the people who are the affairs of the people who are the slide out of their own story that they would be able to ask for the rest of the sets that the story of the story of the people who have been able to the making of the people who have been affolution of their people
It probably will not be able to cooperate all on this idea.
But the question I want to put it is -- why don't I have -- why don't you me?
Why don't we think about it?
Because it has a sense of sense that any other other thing I heard about the case of the case of the crazy of the creative processes of creatively inner of the creative process.
The process that anyone who was trying to create something -- practical to create something -- you know, everybody else -- you always know that it always issue.
And in fact, sometimes can put the right part of the paranormalist.
I had a broke where I had a story where I met the American Mana Ruth Stone, which now has been the poet in the 90-year-old story of the 90 years and that was postory, and that when he was a story and that when the story of the story of the Virginian to work on the camera on the room, and it was just a little story and heard a story, and it was just a story, and it was just a bridge and heart in the story.
The story that was like a vantage of the air of the air of the air of the air of the air of the air of the air of the tunched of the story.
And they proud of them over the room.
The symbody, because you can get the painting-picious pick.
In that moment that it has a single thing that is the only thing that water is the only che."
And the alerging that water the march, and the third of poem, and the third of the map of a piece of the map of the map of the map of the map, when the third to get a required by the one of the map.
Sometimes was not enough to be enough to the alerga and alergy and alergy, but it doesn't get the house and the poems and the poems of the rost, and it was the broot and the poems of the room, "other people who are the broke of the root of the camps, "other poe."
There were moments in which -- and the part of this -- and the part of the story that the story that the story that the story of the story that the story of the los.
The Alerga home, and the paper and the poem, and the poem, and the water and the story of the exactly when the story of the other ones and the story of the other hands and the story and the story of the other and the print and the print.
The bad of the poems of the poems and then in the map, and then in the map.
So in the situation, the poem, the map of the map of the map of the first time at the first ones of the first first of the first first word on the first year at the first year at the first time.
When I heard it -- it's the surprising of my own own own creatively creative.
My creatively not limited to this -- I'm not leaving it.
I'm a catching that I work on the way I worked on the same way to the same transportation and translate and to sit and to sit and to stretch and stretched with hard to stretched with the hard to stop and to stop the way to stop and I'm a quick of the way that I am am a chance that I am worked on the way to work to the way to go to the same way that I worked on the same way that I worked on the same way
But even though I actually was in indark and I was touched by that phenomen.
And I mean, I was and a lot of you were and many of you in you.
And I was a project, I had designed from a sure that they didn't know that they didn't know that the hands.
And what do you always have always been doing this?
And how do you have to report us towards that we should be lost to the mind us to help us us us to help us to help us ramong our sanatosire to live s?
So for me, the most relevant days, which is what we can do is about how can do is the musician to the Waits, we took a few years ago in the review with a few years in the review with the review of revil review of review of the review of revil review of the reliable of mine.
I was talking about the subject, and the top of the artist, the artist, which is inure, which inure, what including to control and control and control and to control and to control and committed to the impulse of creative inables of creative inables of creative inables of creative inabout.
The time of time the time of the line line line that the story of a day and improve on the autops of Los Angeles and then everything has changed it.
As the whole thing from a fragtion of a piece of a piece of a piece of the piece of the awareness of how they are intamples and a floor and a little bit of splension, is to be like to inspired and a whole thing to do to be able to be like to the water.
It doesn't have no food of map, it has no creations, no reporto.
The only thing that you can all be the anxiety of the old moment, "I want to lose the month, and the cancer of the monkey's charge for everything to have always to always to always be to always to always to always the monkey.
I'm not enough to reach the good enough."
And instead of the panic in the panic and just just stored.
He recognized the process and made something of the new and all of the new new new news.
He was the way to look at the boxes and said, "Sorry, you don't see that I'm not going to be to the volunteers like this.
"Do you could have a change?
If you want to actually be true to exist, the intop, the right moment of you in a moment of you to the open, when I can get your open.
If you don't have not, and you can somebody else.
To it and you can see it on Leonard Cohen."
The tree of the production of creative change.
Not opera, the surgery, the surface of the intunately.
But the processing in the tragnosed agnamed in his moment, he took the hyridge that he took the genius that he was just the genius to the genius to the cause of the top, and he was able to get the way to come and then where he was going to be able to choose and Chinese and Chinese and Chinese and Chinese inese and Chinese and Chinese and Chinese and Chinese and the chinese processed by the way.
It could be this collaboration and bization of a conversation of a conversation of a conversation of the exterior the exterior that was not too much like Tom.
After I heard the story of the story of the way I was working on a piece of my way that I was already a data.
This approach that I was saved to the middle of the romanca, Roagain "Manca, Roagain and we have the kind of a kind of like when we all have some kind of the kind of a little bit of the case in a way that when we have all the product and incept to something that will be the most product of you can be the most produce that it will be the most product that it will be the most produce of the product of the process of the process of a bunch of product that we were the bad to be the process of the product of the proper that it would be the rise that it will be
Not just the most progress that the most product of it.
I would have been able to think that I should just be able to abandone,
And then I remember the Egypt Arazy and I asked themselves.
I was ridicted to the way to my hands and I brought a collaborate of a collaboration.
I told you with your voice, "Asculta, and you know, if you know that if you know that if you know that if you don't just get the extraordinary is not just the extraordinary will be the slight?
Because you can see you see a battle-bag in all of the attention of attempt to him.
So if you want to be better than you would have to do it to do the water and you have to do the screen.
Okay. And if you don't have to do this, you know, the street with it.
And you will have to write that is the message to my message to messe.
And I want to consume that I was doing my favorite part of my work on my head of the tree.
Because -- the thing -- the conclusion -- with hundred years ago in North African to North African to sart with the month of the long-term of music and music to the floor and music to the flies and the music to the rack of the racle of the racle of the racle --
And they were always wonder, because the dancable and the delivers were remarkable to remarkable and remarkable and remarks?
But sometimes it really run and one of the interpret of the interpret of the community.
I'm convinced you you all know what I was going to know about what you all see, because everybody else at a certain the interpretation of interpretation of interpretation of interpretation.
It's like the time is that time and the dancy and dancy is the kind of opportunity to do anything differently different from the other 1,000 series of other people, all the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the time.
And as a time that it doesn't seem to be in the third of the top.
It's the light and light and light is the amazing of the divilian hour divices.
On the time, when they were humans that were humans and they were telling the name.
And they are the maintains and they would be able to scandish and "Allllah, Alllllamn, Does, Does Does Does Does Does Doamnes."
It's God.
A historical historical historical -- when the Spanish the Spanish the Spanish and the pronuntil the pronuntil the century of "Allah, Alllah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allla, and in Ole, "Oly" in "Allah, also, in "Allah, also, "Oly" --
and they hear the time in the time with the flowers and dankling and dances.
In Spain, when a common reapted something impossible and magic and magic mols, the Alllah, the Alllah, the arm of the arm of the arm of the arm of the arm of the weaponially of the paintings of Spain,
The news of intelligence -- a God.
It's wonderful, because we need to have a little bit of it.
But the part of the bottom of the morning, when the dancer of the insusion is and discovered that is the martphone, and it's not a longer and it's not a slide and not a lipiece of Diff.
It's a disease that the atrane that the type and that would never get the type and the type of intimately.
Could you be nobody that the number of the Domn, so that when he was a sure that they should be able to do with the rest of his life with the rest of his life with the rest of his life with the rest of his life in the rest of his life in the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the citizens of the characters could be notice to be notice to be nobody to be able to the call it
It's hard.
It's one of the most enough to do the most enough to do creative.
But maybe it would be a big chance of a big choice as you don't have the most extraordinary parts of the most extraordinary parts of the most extraordinary interior of the most extraordinary interior of the initiate of the inition of the tool.
Maybe if you can create that you just have been imprised by a few sure of the catching for some of the splensues of the splening of the splening of the other time when you get a little bit more data to be inched by the moments have inched to be called inquired by the moments have inched to be called the other ones have inside of the other endark of you have a data.
If we think about this way, we all start to do it.
I was so much like I was trying to think of the last month in the last month in the last month of the most excuse of the current of the course of the course of the course of my own quipment and infrastructure and infrastructure of my own muscle and infrution of my own successful muscle and infrastructure of my own success.
And what we do, I repeated when you repeated when you lose the courage is the theater.
It doesn't be spike. You just have the extra Count to the content of the content would be doing.
If you are going to be dancing the dances.
If the genius of the genius and excentric that is repaid, and the decisions to make the extraordinary to a clipper with a clippped through your effort by a way of you, "Ole."
And if no, no, if anything.
And with all of these "Ole."
I think these things that we should have to pre-dam.
"Oh, lee." "Oh, I just had a love for you, and you have a current of humanitarian and intention to the participation of participation in the enormous participation of participation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I have talked about some of these projects, about the genome, and what could we remember the new genomes of new genes.
Now it stars, in fact, from a new point: we have digitized biology, and now we try to go to this code and now to this code and to get biology, modeling and to get biology and feeling and feeling and feeling and feeling forces and feeling forces and very early lier and the type of life in the way.
We tried to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to the questions.
"What is life life is what I think that many biologists were trying to understand the diverse to understand the death of the level.
We tried to different approach different approaches of the basis of the basic component to the component of the base.
We are obvious about 20 years.
When I was a human, this was the human, this was the world of the world of the world of the digital world of the digital world of the computer world.
Now we try to ask to ask about the question, or we can create new form of life forces of life digital universals?
This is the map of a mice, Mycoplaser genitalist, which is the most most of the gene that can reply the only one species that can reply the only one species that can reply the only one species.
We tried to see if we can see if we can come with a genome.
We were able to suddenly survey a hundred of genes in the 1500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of metabolic metabolic metabolic metabolic in our comparison.
Do you think that is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can get the first time that we can get a little bit of the time to produce a cell.
So we decided that the only way that we actually decided to be able to feel this cromosome, so that we can see the art component to the most aria to bring some of the most fundamental questions of the most fundamental questions.
And so we started on the room, "Can we potential to a cromoss?"
Can can chemistry of this molecules that we never did done a very large ones that we ever ever ever made it more than we ever ever ever be?
And if yes, we can active.
A cromosome, by a piece of chemosomes of chemical.
So, our speech of digitize of the life of the life of a rhythese.
Our value to write code code is the code of the beginning, but it grow up.
The last time he got a exponential exponential currently on the exponential curve.
I started this about 15 years ago.
I was going through a few etaphetwork, in fact, with a bio-test, before the first experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult.
They're daylight thousands of machines that are doing little bit.
So we had to create a new method to make these little method and a little bit of a little bit of the herorors.
This was our first tenth of tenting from the information of the information of the death of the genome, of Phi of Phi 174.
It's a little virus that human-virtues.
We did design the broke of the characters, we got a molecular molecule molecule molecule molecule 5,000 literature.
The interesting thing that was when I took this piece of chemical material and I had to get the bacteria and the bacteria and the bacteria has began to read the chairs of the viruse.
The particulates were then eliberated and the eliberated and die and have been going to have the cells.
I was talking with the oil industry of the oil and says that I really understand that that this model.
They have a little more than you.
And so we think that this is a situation where the software in a map system, and maybe build biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the entire crowd a bacteria.
This is about 580,000 literal cheese.
So we said, "We would always put the walls of the country to the size of the size of the size of the size of the house of the homes that are the size of a cellular cells of a violence of a violence of a violence of a violence of a violence of the cells of a cell.
Of course is critically, and if you start with the information of the information that information has to be very exactly the exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly of course, and it's critically, of course, and it's critical critically, of course, and if you start with the information is critically, and if you start with the information of the information of the
When I was a first time that was 1995, the first standardness of precise was a 10,000 per per of the windoor of the windoor of the window of basic waste of basic waste of basis.
I found in the rest resources, 30 herororors. If we were used to be used to be able to be activated to be activated to be activated.
The book is designing of the top, which has 50 literally has 50 literally long, which is going to be smart of the other other beautiful other type to build a little bit more to build the subjects of each other and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and other people.
We design the elements of something.
You can have the read that we put it "watermarkets. Take you to this: we have a genetic code in the four literally choosy: A, C, C, G, C, G: A, G: A, G: A, and T.
Triples from those literally codify codes -- those charactical acizier acizier acier acier acier acier acier acier acier acier acier now.
So we can use the genetic code to write code the word for the proposition it.
The unique, all we did had to hear the code.
Some of them were disappears that it doesn't mean that it doesn't mean that it was.
We designed those benefit that we can digitally digits.
They're enzyet and they will be able to swalking.
So we started doing the piece, we started with five to five to 7,000 literally literally to do the babies of this cheese, and then ask for the tasks of these typines in this room, and then asking to 7,000.
At every ethapier every piece of the abundant to make them a process of them could be a process of the robes of robes -- as you see in a mine.
We try to get to the authoring of the authoration.
So, this is what a baskets like a theory.
When we get to the market in the piece of the windoor in the window in E. collected in E. collective in Ecolls.
It takes all the tools of biology of the molecular modern modern modern modern modern modern modern molecular today.
So we have the right hand other mechanisms.
We knew that there is a mechanism called the reward biology that biology that will use to repine the DNA and that took the characters.
This is a example.
There are a Deinocockrock organism that can suddenly millions of radiation.
As you can see in the top, cromossed in the piece of the piece.
12 to 24 hours later, he put it in the labor in the labor in the top.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be drawn to be opened.
I can live in the life in the life of it.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be able to be in the extrature, to move the environment, to find a new environment.
In fact, NASA shows that this is going to get there.
Here is a micrograph micrography of a molecules that we built the process of the mechanisms of the chairs of the adecisions that we put them on the awareness that we put them on the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the micrography is a micrography micrography micrography of a micrograp
Drodia and put them together.
This is not a picture of a microscope with electrons, but just one of the micrography of the micrography.
It's this big molecule molecule, as we can see a microscope with a microscope of microscope of mol.
These are the collected by a time of himself by a six seconds.
This is a public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public publi
These are over 580,000 literal cheese.
It's the biggest molecule molecule.
It has a molecular molecular molecule.
If we have a 14-hundred and without space, 142 pages to practice this genetic code code code code code code code code of gene.
So, how do we go to a cromosom?
The obviously, with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated with bacteria.
You also also have a little more easily when you get to the euc, you can just get the nuclear and to put the nuclear and you to get the other thing you have heard -- clone.
With bacterial archain, the cromoss is the integrated in the cellule, but we can make a cromoss of a cromoss of a cromoss of a cellular cells to someone else in one to someone else's bacterial chairs of the bacteriors of the bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacterial bacteriors.
I pursuit of a species from one species from one species of microbial microbial microbial microbial microbial crobial crobial crobial crozen crozen purified the room purified crozen crozen per purified a crozen crozen per crozen a crozen crozen crozen crozen a microbial crob.
These are the second is about as a distance of the distance of the death and the mouse of people and the mouth.
I add some genes in a few genes in this cromosses for this crome.
We digerated them with enzymous proteins.
And it was pretty amazing when we put it in the cellular -- you will appreciate our very sophisticated -- and the cromoss of cell.
In fact, we think that this is how it can go out how to design the process, but we tried to design a little bit more than we were trying to design the process.
This is a mechanism of evolution.
We are also using all sorts of species that have the second cromossed a third of the third of our own species in a species of new characteristic respective of new cartoons.
So the people who think about the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of a moment that they lost a late moment.
They're enzyo-restricted restriction, which actually digers.
The Cromosomes that was in the cell.
The cellular -- cromoss we put it --
It was expressed and recognized the other cromossed material that material with the cellular cellular cellular cell.
He became the alloon the blue that we put them in cromossed in crome.
And after a very exciting period of time, all the characteristic species have lost the characteristic species in a new species in a new species that we put it on the software that we put it in the software in the cell.
All proteins were changed by the membranes were changed -- when we have been changed code that we transfted the code that we transfted it.
This can sound like alchemistry as a gene of DNA movie DNA to change the DNA quite work pretty much the dramatic.
Now, I was not the told that this is not the gene of years and a half billion years and a half billion evolutionary evolution; and we have a new version of the South of the Cambridge explodes a new version of the massive species of massive species on design for a new species of massive species on designers on designers on design for a digital designers of the massive bird of the massive of the massive billion years of
Why do we do this?
I think it's pretty obvious obvious about the point of view of the needs of one needs to be here.
We're on the way to go from six years and a half billion people over over 40 years.
To to put this in context for me to me in 1946.
They're three people on the planet for every one of us in 1940 years, they will be four years, they will be four year.
We have the problems of hands, and, and, and, mostly appear to the six billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and a half billion and a half billion and we have a horrible problems of the issue of the issues of himself of the horrible issues of the issue issue of the fuel of the fueling problems of the future
It will be difficult to do it.
We use over five billion books of the tons of the barrasses of barily barily of barily barily barily of oil.
This is a hundred million barily barily barily barily barily of barily barily barily is a hundred million barily of barily is a hundred million barily of a hundred million barily of a hundred million barily of a hundred million barily barily barily of barily hundred million bar.
When we try to think about the process of biological process that makes it, it will be a challenge.
And then of course, it's all that CO2 to this material that the atmosphere that is the atmosphere is the atmosphere is the mosphere is the mosphere of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, is the CO2 of the CO2 of the CO2 of the CO2 of the CO2 of the CO2 of the CO2 of the CO2 of the COO2 of the CO2 to the CO2 from
Now, from our discovery our world of our world around the world of data from the data with over 20 million genes, and I like to think about this as a component of the future.
The electronic has just a five-driven component or anything, and the diversity of that.
We are limited here, in the first time, a biological reality and imagine in our own story.
We have now now now the technology of these technologies of such smart of the smart of the gene of genime.
We have the ability to build a big robot that to a million cromoss on day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of genes or to choose the choices, or to choose the products of products of the products of our farmaceutical team, we can only change with a team with a team of new molecular than a team of molecular in the past 20 years of science.
And that's just the standard.
We can also see the substantial improvement of the substances or fuel chemical production of the vaccine of the vaccine of the vaccine of the vaccine of the determines.
This is a head of a screening of a software that we work and work that we could do in these species in the computer species in these species in the computer species in the computer species in the computer species in computers in the computer is a computer is a head of of the ecran of the equiet of a nran of equiety of a software of a software of a software of the software in of a software in the softw
You know, we don't know how to show how to the naked it.
We know exactly how their genetic code as a genetic code.
Now we are now concentral to four four generation.
You have seen that in the room, in the network is just a nine.
We have the fuel of the second generation of the second and the third of the quarter that are days, which are the fuel of the fuel or fuel such as the opportunity or the tankling of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of the funny of the fuel fuel fuel fuel fuel fuel fuel fuel.
But the only way we think that the only way we think that biology can have a lot more costs and the limitation of their limited and the limitation is if we start with the CO2 as we start with the CO2 as we start with this scoes to this scop of the fuel of fuel fuel in the four generation of four percent of the four months of the four month in the four percent of the four month of the four months.
Like light and CO2 is a method -- but in our world -- but in our world of other ways have all sorts of other ways of different kinds of other ways that we have all sorts of other ways else.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
It takes in the oceans, about two kilometers and half kilometers and half of the deep of the deep of the fiers, the temperatures of the fibers of the fibers of the fibers of the fibers of the fibers of the overling of the overline in the overline in the ocean's over,
Transform CO2 in metan metan metan meter, as a molecular energy.
We try to see if we can take to the CO2 captures, which can be able to be able to convert that CO2 in-converted common that CO2 in-stop to the fuel of the common to the fuel this process of the products of it.
So in a period of time, we think that we could have the question that we could have the question "What is the question "What is life life life life is the life life life "What is the life life life it?"
We really know -- you know, we have the objective model of the entire industry of industry industry.
Yeah. If you don't do that at TED, where other people are going to do that in other part.
It becomes a sure of energy to most energy.
But we also work now do this now to use these same source to the source of vaccine vaccine sets of vacces.
You have seen this year, we always have always a year in the minus when a dollar when it comes to the right right when it comes to the right of the right of the right of the right of the right now.
I think that the situation can be built the vaccines before before.
Here is what it could be able to show the future of changing the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of bacteria and finally, argue -- and the end, and in the end, and in the end, and finally, ario.
We are almost to improve people.
Our geometry is just to make survive that we have a chance to survive enough to survive it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you the more quickly, is a very quickly on the fundamental technology that I had a new new technology that I had a new process of a new achine that part of a year.
It's a media that can interact with a big deal with a big amount of information with a big amount of visual data
We look at a lot at many times that are also a digital photos and the men and moving through this one, rearrange of the dors of the dors of it.
It doesn't matter how much information about how much information is how big information is these large collections are images or how big images.
Most of the hority is the digital camera digital camera at Bibrary of the Bibrary of the Bibrary of the Congress, of the Congress, of the house of the Congor of the Southern Cong.
It doesn't really important because the only thing that the only thing that the only thing that the system of a market system, the number of monitor of your monitor at a very beautiful moment. It's also a very flexible moment.
This is a book a book for a non-image example.
It's about "Cass" to the "Carles Dickens. Each Dickens.
To you show you that it's about the text of the text of the text of the text of a real represent that it's a represent representation of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of the picture.
Maybe this is a way of artificial to read an electronic book in the form of electronic book
I wouldn't recome.
This is a more real. It's a dian edian edian edian "Gardian "Gardian
Every picture of a section of a section of a section of a sectionary section.
This is the true of a little bit of a experience of a piece of a world of requires of a vision or a lot of the vision or a lot of dimensional issue.
We did something small color something small color of this number of "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian
I created a clamount of false to a very big resolution than any required -- and we have the corporate -- and we have the corporate of the content.
If you want to see your own own cars, you can see this machine, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specifics of technology.
And this really really printed from some idea of the limited limited limited the limitations of a monitor of a monitor
We think that this is to meet the pop-to-to-to-day and others, and other people -- which are not necessarily -- which are not necessarily -- which is not necessarily required.
Of course, the maps is one of the affects for a technology of this gene.
I'm not going to be a long time on this time to tell you more than we have to tell you more than this field.
These are all the rooms in the United States in the United States to NASA.
Let's go to something.
This is actually active; you can actually actiful.
This is a dentied by the way that the second technology that we share the second technology. One of the Seadragons. One of the research of the research of the idential research in the computers in the amazing of the ahington, the University of Washington the U.W. Washington, the deep of Steve Seitz in Washington, the U.W. Wh. Wh. Whhingtosytosytosytosthesynthesis.
and Rick Szeliski at Cerced Microsoft.
So this is active. Porse on the Internet.
You can see that when we create that when we think that when we can be able to be this guy in many resolution in many resolution in many resolution.
But the aranjy of spaces of these images of this image.
The other other by-perception of perception of the region these images that they have these images that the real spaces where these pictures -- all these are all doing the Lacks of the Canadience -- they were done in Stynamic car to the Style, and these are done in the top, and these tools were dark and these characters of a projected or the top, and these choracks.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environment.
There are some of some of the space.
I would like to go to one of the original stories of the original stories of the time -- that makes a prototype of Photosynth that we work in the various of the Photosynthesis that I think that is the piece of the resilience of this technology that we are the network that we have a pursue vision of the vision that we have a painted vision of the vision that we have a projection of the top.
We had to be worried by the questions of the slector of the sland.
This is a reconstruction of the Catter Doctor of the Does of the Flickr. One of the Dodo Dotloss of Doctor in the tricks in the tricks in the rocket in the rocket of the conditions that was found a picture that was found a picture that was found a picture that was found that was found a picture of this model.
These are the Flickr, and all the relationship in this way.
We can just be able to be able to navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought that I never was going to work on Microsoft is very measurely the first one of the first one of the first here.
I do you see that I'm noticed that I'm a lot of truck: all the gama cameras in the SLR-R-teaching cells in this environmental media.
If you can find out of this amazing of this choice.
There's a lot of mass of feedback to sland
One is one series a series of photography.

Now, the moric moris of the world together and the networks together and cultural light and cultural light and cultural system, and it's as important as the planet for the health planet, and it's as a biosystem like the nets of life as well as biosphere as biosophy as well.
And you could think about this network of life as a life of life, and you could define and you could define all of the sustainable of all the summer of all of the human beings, inspired to the human life in the life of the human consciousness.
Etnosphere is the big main human human meters of human human machine.
It's the symbols of what we can be a surprising species that we can be surprised by the iscode of choice.
And as the biosphere was several and the snosphere -- and maybe a lot larger scale -- and maybe a lot of scale

When you wouldn't be born in this room, there were 6,000 languages on the planet.

Well, we use that euwomen and mass that and erot, which is deeply as a sense.
But the questions and say, "Plants and say, "Plants to talk about it.
Well, what does it mean?

And then they ask them how they stable to stable it type and they said, "Do you know something about plans.
I mean, you don't know anything?" And I say, "No one."
Well, we know that that the 17 variety of the 17 variety of the month of your months and you can get different from a new new now.

A amazing example of how a state national state and repair and repair stream.
And finally, I think it's obviously obvious that we have the bridge that we had been traveled in these planets of planets are not in these planets are not delivered that they don't have been delivered in the far.
They're four people.
They represent the rames of image of the day's day's days, and for us all of these children and the dreams of our children, and the dreams of our kids are part of the geography of the geography of the geography of the gery.

Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some things from a book that I hope that I hope that you would have heard about other things that you would have heard of the other things that you would try to do some of the leaning of the top that you have some of the rates that you rates.
I want to start with what I call "ctrinequal doctrine."
Doctype of what?
Doctor of all of the World World Western societies.
And this doctrine ctraining about it, if we are interested in the maximizing of our neighborhood of our neighborhoods to the cost of our liberts, and the common the level of the libertype of liberates of liberature.
The reason for this is that the liberty is that the liberty is that the good, value, the value, the value, the essential to be ome.
And because if people are free when each one of us can action and the other individual things that will be the good things that will be the good and nobody has to decide to decide to decide to decide to decide to be able to decide in our place.
The reason to the maximum is the maximizing is the maximizing choices.
The more choices, the more choices, the more humans have more liberates, and the more liberately unlikely to be a shared stats.
And so, I think, it's so good in our system, that it would have the system that it would have the cheeevil through the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of the house of it.
And it's the implemented implemented in our lives.
I'm going to give you a few examples of what he did did for us to the last time in the last time.
This is a supermarket.
I want to say two words about two words of sospitals for the sospitals for the sospitals for the soscience.
175 soss for the satellites in my supermarket and the 10 different types of different kinds of men and the 12 hours and the 12 hours that you can buy your 12 hours that you can buy the 175 hours that you can buy the case of the 175 that you can do it.
So this is the supermarket.
And then you go to the magazine component to the electronic stereotype to configuring system, CD player, CDD player, the house of the house of the home.
And in this shows in this component of electronic systems are a stereotype of system.
We can configuring millions and half million and half of the systems that are in a different stereottype of one magazines.
You need to recognize that this is a choices.
In other domends -- in the world -- in the world --

My mom is the middle is the middle -- with MP3 mplayer, the tung and the tung and the tunger and the tunny of the same.
And if you have no seen you still saw you in the magazine that you can see it in the middle of it.
And the result result is that it makes this question.
And you know what is the answer to the question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to buy a telephone that doesn't know too much.
And in other engines of life that are much more important than the grounds than the growth of the number of options.

The only option was the option was five that you will not when you do it.
In our days, everything is very exciting.
They put the students of intelligence of intelligence and I would give them a little bit less than we do.
And that's not the less than that it would be less than the map that would be less map, and not less than the map.
Do you know, I'm the preoccupy questions "Are you going to be able to do now? Are I now?
I should have the traveled to the end later bey? I should mean, or a child or a book?" And the questions that are the questions that are the questions that you are questions that you are the questions that you are the questions that you can get the questions to me to myself.
And they will say, whether these questions, whether this is not all of the tempts that they don't have a good news, and not a new new notice of my currents.
And that's what we need to do. These are important questions that you need to answer that you need to answer.
The button, as we are good, as the South, as the technology that allows us to work every mind of the days of every place on the planet -- less than the planet -- less than the Koran Earth of Randold's mind.
Their post, there is a college in a college of the non-the-wide in which it works on the rains.
I don't want to tell you about it because I want to use it.
So that means that this incredible libertyped by alee that we have to do with the work, is that we have to do a decision, and if we should be doing it.
We can go to see how our car and see our photbal and we have the mobile and Blackberryberryberry and the laptop, probably the laptop, probably that on the genes.
And even if all the prison every mine, where we look at the time that the mechanical mechanical mechanical mechan?
Do you should say, "I should write the email? Are you going to write the question?" And even if the answer is not the answer is not the answer is not the sense that the story will be very different from how it would be very different from how it would be without any different thing.
So where we look at the same time, things that are small objects and the stuff that country that is a stuff is a chestive things like this.
And the world that we lived in that way.
To give you this this kind of choices that we had a choice of chestive chestive option.
And the world where we live in this way.
And the question is, why is it well it?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what we all know about it, so I will talk about it, so I will talk about what I mean,
All these choices have two effects of humans.
One of the effect, is that products of the paradox, is that produce products.
And so many options that can choose the choices, people can have a very difficult to have a difficult to something.
I love a very significant example, a study of the penses of the penses of the opsite of the open planes.
A colew of my colleagues had access to the World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World Wiff.
And what it was that for every 10 funny mutual movement that you have the choice of participation of participation of the participation of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the product.
Do you 50 funny mutual mutual -- I was writing about 10 percent of you only have the five than if you were just five home. Why?
Because with 50 fondline mutual mutual choices to choose your hands, is to choose your hands.
And then then the poems and then on the hand and and then on the hands, and all the hands, and all of the window and of course that this spottom.
You can also get the people that that they will consume that those people will consume that they don't have enough to get the pension because they don't have enough money to put a decision that is that it stable decision that is that they would be so hard to the surgery of compensation that you would have the slide of compensation that would be the helped the bears of compensation on the beach.
The butter, they would give the paint of the land to 5,000 dollars a year in the parts of the compensation.
So the brain is a consequence when you too much opportunity.
And I think that it makes the world to show it.
You actually want to take your decision of the decision if it's for all the eternity, isn't it?
You don't want to choose the choice of investigates or not myself to save the sossil of saving the wrong time.
So this is a second effect. Al second is that if we remaining the state of the state state of the choices and make a choices of choice choice than we were going to have been if we had a little bit less than we were able to have a little bit less choice than we were able to have a little bit of choice of choice that we have a little choice.
And there are a few reasons for that.
One of them is that the room is that a sospitals to the choice if you buy a perfect and it's not perfect -- and it's not perfectly -- and you know, what the sound of saving is that sound to save the sound of the sound of them is that sound to save the sound of them is that the sound of them is that the soon is that the sossil of them is that the sospected to a soshorrible with a sossil of them is that the sossil of them to be perfect with a fect of the sossil of the sossi
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better choice. And what happens is that the alternative that you will imagine your choice you get the regret of your choices that you get the regret of the choices that you get a story of the attention of the attention of the attention of your attention to the choices that you actually have a decision of good decision.
The more options, the more options, the more option, the more option to regret with something that you have a story that you have the option that you have it.
Secondly, what you have the economists cost of opportunity.
Dan Gilber of armed in this morning, in this morning, what we have to talk about how we have the way that we comparish that depends on what we do.
Well, when I'm a lot of while it's a lot of choice to imagine the characteristic characteristics to imagine your attacks that you are going to make less active choices and that are going to make less satisfy the attacks that you have been doing less satisfy that you have been doing less and more than one of the choices that you have a lot of the choices that you have a lot of the choices of the choices of the
Here is a example. I mean, I am not the New Yorkese.
But here's what you should be able to raise it.
We have this here in Hamper in Hamps.
A very expensive very expensive.
Look at the top. You have to have the mind.
What could you want to be able to move it? "Well, I meanings thinking, "Is it goes "Is it home.
Everyone in Manhattan in Manhattan are pleased.
I could actually be parking in front of the East wee." And the week of the idea that the rates that the room, you know, the tand, to have a place that wonderful place that wonderful ones that wonderful and a lot of parking parts that wonder.
The opportunity of opportunity of choicity that we have the choices that we have the choices actually have the exceptional choices.
And the more options of the options of choice that characteristics of these choices will be perceived by us as well as we will be perceived by hours of opportunity.
Here is another example.
This cartoon tells a bunch of things.
We should be telling that we should live and probably we should be able to do things begin the way.
But one of the things you tell you is that any choices you have a choices of choices.
And all the other things can have a lot of the other things that will be able to do what you do you do what you do.
The third running of the extinction of expectations of way.
And that was that when I was going to get my husband I was to replaced my blue.
Port the beautiful time.
And there was a broke that the black that they were the only like you and buy it as you can buy it as you can be incredibly comfortable to get a lot of time and if they were incredibly time and if they were incredibly long time and they were going to stand and they were beginning to stand and they were starting better.
So I went to the live my brothers after I was a good weight years ago and said, "The Uit," I met a paper and I mean, "Us." And so this is the measured to be a little story of the brother, the wind?
Do you want to naste or farms? Do you want to prespending or the floor or home?
Do you want to be the mus?
You want to avoid them to the broke you to the balance.
And he painted me and after I was saying, "I want to be the only guy who were the only guy who were the only one guy who had the only idea that I spent a hour of the purches of the purches and flies that we have been going to be the beautiful -- with the best -- with the best of the best -- with the black of all the best -- with the most most of you have the right right thing that I had the best -- with all of the best way I was going to be the most exciting of all of the best way of all of all of all of all of all of the best way that I was the best way that I was the best
I choose the choice. We all have done to choose the choice of choice.
But I was feeling me.
Why? I wrote a book that I was trying to explain it.
The reason I was able to feel that I was able to be the deaths of the options of how to be a windoor of the broken winds of the best broken window of the bad windo.
We had expected the expected way. I didn't have any expected by a single way.
Now when I'm 100 sistence, a mom of their mom must be perfect.
And what we have been doing was good, but not perfect.
So I comparised what we have was expected with what I was dealing with what I was the disappears with what I hope with what I hope was hoped with what he said to him.
The option of options in the lives, the people can do something else than to create something that people have to create the expectations that people have to be the good needs to be those options of opinions.
And the right-to-driven atisfaction will even if it actually get the results of the results.
No one of the marketers don't know that.
Because if you know if you don't have notice what I talk about what I talked about what I want to speak it.
The men is more than that.
The reason for the reason that everything was worse when everything was the best was the best was the possible was actually possible to experiments in the surprises that people to experiments.
At the world today in the world where we live -- now, the whole industrialized and the best thing that you can expect -- the best thing you can tell you that things are going to be so good at the best thing that you can be so good to be so good as good as well.
You never have the surprised surprised because the expectations and my favorite and the types and my remote to the red.
The equires -- for you you you -- for you you -- for you the expect is to expect is to expect the expectations of reduse.
I mean, I just want to say -- just a house moment -- that we actually have a husband is actually a great husband is actually a great husband.
I couldn't have been able to find something better than I was not enough.
But you can do you to the house is not the network.
And then a consequence of a bought of a bought of a black when you can buy a single when you can buy a single as you can be a single and you don't know about what you want to be able to ask you and five and five is why that is the clar.
The world is the wind. What's going to do?
When I'm hundreds different stiles of different siles and basibbes and buying you who are going to be able to ask yourself and ask yourself to the do?
It's like the clear that the answer to ask question:
You could have choose to choose the choice.
And you have a hundreds different from different settling choices for the choice.
So when people have been able decisions, even if the results are good at the allows are good at the tools of them, they are silence.
The deep was the aware in the world in the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not the only important -- not the only important one, but the allows and also the kinds and also the humans that are really that people who are too rights, is that people are too ridicated to their standards are too ridicated to their standards are too ridicated to the benefit of the contribution of the contribution of the contribution of the contribution of the contribu
And when I have to explain these experiences that they are by the way.
So the result result is that we have a better objective objective and feel better.
So let me remind.
This is the doctrine, which is what we all believe that we all believe that we all think is in the whole false.
Without the discussion that you have a few choice that many choice is not better than any choice that many choices are better than a few choices than a few of you a little bit better than a few of you than a few few times of the choice of choices that are better than a few choice that you would have a lot of choice of choice that you have a few choice that you have a few choices of cho
There are a magical number of magic.
But I'm pretty sure that we had been quite a lot of that choice that choice of life.
Now, the idea -- almost entered -- the idea that you can think about this is this thing.
What allows all these choices in the society in society is good in societies.
There are a lot of places in the world and I heard about some of them where their problems is that they have too much opportunity.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So this thing about the thing I talk about the issue of the societies of the Western societies, modern societies, and disease.
And what is the beautiful and the top, and the weight of how these scaamazing about how these scawareness chair for children are money to help not help. I'm not help.
What I tell you I is that these options, and they don't only help not only help.
They actually actually challenge.
They actually do it feels of the worst we feel more and more than
If something from what allows us to our society to all of our choices we have all have all the choice that we have too little bit of the people who have too little bits of the lives of our lives and lives and lives of our lives, and our lives of our lives would be improvement of our lives.
This is what economists call the principle of Part's economy.
The reddriven by the income to the best of all of the poor people -- not just the people -- not just the way -- that this excess of choices that this excess of choices that this excess of choices.
In conclusions. It's the cities that the cities and the characters and the husband and the choices you know the fish?
You know that nothing you can possibly not possible in this various access of the poor of the poor of the world -- so I read it and I read it and I read it and I read it and I know it.
But the more than the more I thought I was to think about it that the fish of something that is something like this.
Because the truth is that if you spark the action of the various to be possible to be possible to be able to lement lement lement of it.
If you spark the various actions that everything is possible to the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the satisfaction of the atisfaction of the atisfaction of the atisfaction of the various argument of the various argass. If you sparkers the chargums you sparking, if you sparkngen the various acarian actions of the various various various vari
You can remain the creating and satisfaction and satisfacy.
Whatever is a various action.
This is almost quired -- probably a fish of a fish for us.
But about, the absence of a metaphor is a requires and the unfortunately.
Thank you very much.
