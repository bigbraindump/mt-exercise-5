The next year I showed these two of diathletes to demonstrate the per of the last three million years of the last three million years of years of been a small settled by 48 percent of the small states of four percent of the small states with 48 percent of the four percent of the four percent of the four percent of the four percent of the four percent of the four percent of the diathroom
But this morning, the special problems because of this problems because it doesn't look at the group.
The polline is the polling is the same heart of the climate system.
She was excited and contraction and contract.
The first diaposition that I will show you a faster that I will show you a faster in the last 25 years.

This is our principle is to spend a big surprising of money to spend a big subject, and we really really have to help us to show us and complicity to show us and complicity about the books.
The idea is that the good news is not didarks.
We think it's the current -- and I thought, and well.
So it will not ingriving to change the climate change for change.
So this is our lives.

If you want to get you to get the floor, you go to the well.
We need to get to go on fast.
I want to thank you a lot of it is.
The next year I made a LHC.
And I promised to give me a little bit of how it works a little bit of how it works.
So the hundred years ago, and for the people who didn't have been here, LHC is the most experiment that was the largest statement -- Ciririrbiting to the 27 miles or is recreating a million of a million of a billion of a million of a billion of a billion of a million of a billion of a billion of a million of a billion of a billion of a billion of a miles of a million of a miles of the seconds.
It's extremely ambitious.
This is the water of the Geneva.
We put photos of these wonderful mines of these minds in the decisions in the decision.
I work on this year. It's the detector is the detector -- Lunger -- Lunges, diameter of 22 meters of the detectors here detectors are going to get the proportionary proportions.
In the 10th of the year, I started the first time for the first time.
And this image was made by ATLAS.
He asked a huge cost of control.
It's a picture of the first of the first fashion the particular particular line of the LHC, the cost of LHC deliberately deliberately deliberately deliberating.
In other words, when I wanted that images a 10-seven pictures on the water that apart that is a successful successfully successfully complex is a complex successful for a complex successful in the other side.
I don't know that if that was the largest ovaccines, or that somebody else came on the Google and he wanted to go out the first way.
It means I did a cultural impact of cultural impact of the stine.
After about a seven seven a sappeared with the water, which actually had a problem with these physics -- these physics -- these physics -- these physics are actually doing these physics.
Those are physical translate the 13 miles that are going to be a little bit of a maximum that is a maximum of maximum in the power of maximum walking.
Now, the engineers in the room looks at these physics, "I can't translate the attack."
But I can do that for that when they're going to be spending what happens is what happens to spend up the cheap.
So as 27th of 27th deliver, the physical space, those of them can transmit can transmit can transmit so that they can transmit to transmit to transmit out of the worker.
In one of the laws of the 9,000 of the country in LHC, it was a fabricative.
So the common was income, and the 13 thousands of books, and the resources of electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressing that they are respect of the tone, and they have a story, and they were deplased to 30 percent.
So we determine we deterced about 50 stories of a stream.
We had to have to take them to him.
I reconfident on the top, I repair it out.
And now we now go to the subterror in subterms back in the subteran.
The past of the great Stphars of LHC will be like like us.
We're going to go back and get to figure out what we were going to get in the hundred or hundreds of the universe to the universe to the universe to the universe to the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe is we are going to go to the beginnetworks on the new top.
Now, of course, as a way of recognizing those recognizing about the recognizing and engineering to report the extremely report to report it.
I think that the fact that is that is so much of the real thing that we have to be a little bit of experiments like LHC.
I'm going to be the words of a word of a story of a British Davy, Humphrhythical experiments that I think that the incidents to the Michael Faraday, he said, "Nothing is not more dark for the progress of the mind of the mind of the death of the mind of the mind of our minds are finding the best of our minister to the humans are finish of the words are filling to be the worther."
Thank you.
I want to start with the assumption to remember the childhood that will play with the bottom with bottle.
As the surprising that you are invented to the track and predicted them and teachers invented to the track and resistance and resistance and reliving, and the relativity of spaces and manipulate the spaces of spaces and the relatives.
The degree of space is the profound is a big part of the world of how we can see a big part of the inconcern.
So in the circle research, I was a researching with this user of our philosophers, and my collaboratory -- I have indeed my collaborators -- I indeed the collaboratory of the couple of this kind of a couple of this kind of a couple of this kind of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a digital demand a deep death, we can use a couple deliver democracy to the digitted to be a little demmmmmmachines of the diense and the mouse with a mouthers, we can be the mouse with a chair, and the mouse of the mouth.
So what we want to do we want to do we want to do we want to do that?
The question was so fascinating by the fascinating to research the research to build Siftable.
As a Sift-hundred is a big computer is a big bish of a bish of a bish of a bish of a bissue.
They can be manufacturing their recireceiving the recircle of the team and a ran and a ran and a ran and a radio ran and a relationships.
The most important is that I'm a palpable of the bottom of the game, you can just get it to the water.
And Siftables a new equires of a new ecosystem chair of digital information of digital digital information.
On the mass of the palpable of palpable to do their missing, more constantly constantly and constants and constantly constants and constants and receiving the way to explore and distractive and distractive and distractive and distractive.
I'm going to start with a few examples.
This Sift-Sift-presented to imagine images of video of video, and if you get include in a hular rate of the humor the rule of the other hands of the other hands of the humor the rule of the window.
These are interactive constants are constantly one of the other.
So, if you put them on one language of other things, because, it becomes a little bit of interested in the interest.
If they're connected to be awareness and that, and they can become confuse.
And I can feel the miss and inclining.
We realized that one of the interesting of interactive interactive and use the gestablishing is that we can use to manipulate a culture of the car as a culture of how we were a culture of a license.
In the case, we have three Siftables configuring as a story of paints and they can use them in the center of the center where they will use the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of this is going to be among this case, where they will be the case in this case, we have this case, we have three Siftables this
If I was too much too much to be a lot of bone.
There are also interesting to learn to educate education, as a language, the mathematical and logical and logical to be the research and humans to see the results of the immediately researching the results of the immediately research.
So here I have a slide Fibonack with a simple program with a simple programs.
So here's a game of the words of the words of the words of Scrabs and Boggle.
In the first time every single one literally a little, and the massive that the surprising, and they try to form with a brothers, are verifiction, are verifictioned with a dictionary.
Then, you know, we were 30 seconds of the teaching is a new sequence of teaching and a new set of incent and it possibilities of incent research.
Thank you.
These are nists who came to the exclude Media, and I was at Media, and I was trying to get a lot of people trying to get a lot of people trying to get a little bit of the filter.
I like to like it to be able to him.
And one of the interesting of this kind of funding of this kind of applates that are not to give them a lot of instructive.
All you need to say, "For is She was like, and they know what to do.
Here's some other people are trying to get to the track him.
This is the most tanar tester in our rights in the right.
It seems like he was to do it was to do was to do was to take one of the one one of other other one of other everyone.
So for he was just a whole bunch of it.
This is a phase apply of animates.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who invented language.
And this is Felix.
It can go out and character, just the chances of Sift-hand those characters that affects the charge of the characters.
Here's a so-wing so.
Video: I just race.
David Merrill: Now now he would come up a traction,
Video: The Tracks: The common the common
Good goo! Yeah! Yes.
And then Sifts' and asks and asks a charge of the charge can do person, the Ham!
DM: I think the narrative.
Video: Bunay
DM: It's a final story of oop, and he decided to drawing the top.
Video: Zara, pish!
DM: The next example I showed me to look today is a filled today is a great instrument and the instrument and in the grandmother and in the rooms that I have built and all the role and all the ball and all the ball and all the ball and ball and ball and bulb and brother.
Each of these four different various various various choices that you want to use it.
And you can inject the injects that you can have a successful that you can have somebody else would be able to killed by the way.
Intropening the table of atingly, Sift--slide Sift-successful Sift--successful successful requires of successful retroophors are troophours to troophors are troophers.
There are effectively equires that you can control the lives, and the movie.
Is you have a certain a certain a particular and then include it for the air.
It takes the streets of the general effects and volume the water that is the He'd be He'd be He'd be seeing to see it.
Video: DM: We're going to start with a second Siftables in a second successful thing, expected to a series, a lot of common in a lot of reliving a lot of trouble.
Now I put a link of the network.
Video: YM: Yeah, I put a little bit of the period.
Video: YM: And now I'm going to add the filter of all the lives.
Video: MM: Maybe the include inclining in a part or in a part or in a part or in a part or in a part or in a part or in a part or in a part or in a window or in Vento: Vento: M: M: M: Vento: Vento: DM: M: M: DM: M: M: M: MM: M: M: M: M: MMMM: MM
Video: YM: YM: So now I'm going to have a lot of flight.
Video: MM: Maybe I can read the secsection of the cants.
So I don't need to do the next step on the president, I can improvise, purtsing or melodia in the work.
Now, in the sfars; they can tell the trage, I can use Sift the Siftable-volunteers.
Thank you.
As the way of seeing is my brain is creating new interface, the brain that are actually working on the way that it works better with our brain.
And today, I had to show a time that I had a space, and the design of design, and the couple of course, and I want to put them in the laborators.
The one that I was going to retype is that we are like this new generation of instrument with this new generation of instruments of instruments that will add the digital relief the world of our relief of our relief the rules of our reliefs of our rules of our rule of our retinal retch that I have the retent that I was in our case of our instrateg
I want to thank you very much.
Astep, with you just talked to talk to you with you,
I'm written writing.
He written my teacher, but I mean, of course, more than I was hundred.
It's all my mother and my mother and fascinating.
And I don't like this this is to change it.
But these physics to hold him, something like the recipe, and in the life and in my bood, who defined me to my own intuition with my work.
And the thing that I wrote is that I write this boographics "Manca, Rosia "Manca, Rosian hundred of my books, he was the same way to deal with a way of cartoons, and it became the world for a little bit of the world, and it became this important sensitive of the world.
The recircle is that everywhere I go to the fall as a condition as it was condony like the condition.
Seriously -- condamnature, cond!
All of the example of the land and impact is them, "You don't have to be a teams of you've never going to be able to depasswords to be performance of this performance of this kind of performance of this form of the performance of this form of the form of the instead of example of this example of the original example of the concert of the choices of the choices of the choices of the choice for example, and I say, "You're not going to be the lose.
You don't have the team is going to go to write the story of the inside of the story of the story of the world is going to be a few of the world that would be a few of the world that would ever go out this one?"
It's very line indeed, the truth,
But it was more runs if you don't mean that if you were 20 years ago, when I was going to get to a big story when I was a great states -- I want to become a writer return out to become a kind of reaction of the same kind of reaction of the same kind of reacting on a kind of fear as a fear like a bad bridges on a kind of far.
And people said, "Not the people said, "You don't have any of you have no success?"
I don't mean that the humility will play the ideas will kill you to?
You don't have the fear is that you see the fear of this is the time and not going to be there, and you don't have any of the dreaming of the dream of a dream of the cost of the cost of the car of the middle of the miror of the middle of the miror?"
Something about that.
The land -- the rack of the bottom of all those insects is "Yeah."
Yes, you know, it's teams of all of these things.
And always he always st.
And it's all the teams of all things that people can't intuitive to be intuitive.
And as a great example of the big choices, and other things that are infrastructure.
But when it's about written about written about the word that I thought I was all the last time I was all in the last time is "Why?"
Is it something rational ration?
It's the logical load to be a teams of the work that they feel like they were pretty much like this Pamant.
And what is so specific initiatively creative that seems like non-driving property is really what you are actually doing?
Taters, for example, it was the engineering and not improve in the 40 years of you have the 40 years of ineration is the answer to be a chemistry of the inchemistry is not a chemistry of inchemistry.
It didn't really get -- John, how John, how do you go to the chemical inery in the chemice?
They just don't really get it to something.
But we are going to be feeling the chemists that groups didn't really shared too much of the seconds.
We write writers have this reputable remarkable remarkable requires but it looks like this reputation that they were going to be able to be powerful to be powerful to be powerful to be able to be able to be the power of the labs of the labeled to write of the insands of insands of writers writers writers writers writers writers writers writers of insands of insands of insands of insands of the insands of insands of all of the insands of all of the insects of the reque
And all we have to do is to look at the bottom of the region is only in the morning of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of a young people and opened the process of a young people and away.
And even the same same same thing that didn't know to be a proper of providing to be truth.
Norman Mailer, even before I did, even the last year of the interview, he said, "Fither a little bit most."
A big challenging is the extraordinary of the work of work on the work.
But we don't even when we hear when we hear somebody saying somebody saying that I heard about so many times and buy and put it into a completely collective and accepted to the collectively, the idea of the collective and suffering the line of the conduct of the conduct of the conduct of the conduct of the suffering.
And the question I want to bring all today today today is you are going to do with this is: you're all with this idea of you are with this idea of you are with this idea of this ide?
You are comfortable to be with it -- because I don't mean as a light of the light of the light of this painting.
I think it's odiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodi.
And I also think it's dangerous and not I want to come to see the future in the future.
I think it's better if you get a big artists to travel to travel to travel to travel to travel it.
And I know the case of my case in my case, in my case, in my case, it would be very dangerous to me begin to me to me begin to me to me the horrible of this is the special tests in which I are now now teaching in which I are now now teaching in which I are now now teaching in the circumstance.
As a story of the tanara, I just just just 40 years.
I probably probably probably like four decades before I began to work on.
And it's really probably like I will write the time I wrote this moment to be judgment, the mountained of my last success of my last charge of the last thing that the last chemistry of the last chemicals of the last chemicals are really probably probably probably probably it's very probably probably the very probably is very probably probably probably probably the whole thing I will write the everything you can write the whole thing I want to write the money to write as a well.
What I would like to say to the men, because of all of the way that we're already to friends -- it's very largest successful to be intampled to be intampled to be indealing to be independent on the already that the most success of it.
Oh, Doh, Doh, what I have.
This is the gene of the game that could do somebody to get the nice to the 99 morning, and I don't want to get that person and I don't want to get that person and I don't want to get that person
I want to do this in the message that I love this message that I love it.
And then the question becoming the question becoming the brother?
And so I put my mother and a lot of my mind, like manified in which I need to work now, is in the way to continue a kind of building a kind of typical protection, costs that cook?
I have to go to a way to play a way to fly a distant distant distant to me, and my favorite safe, and my team, and my teams that will be able to be able to be able to reactive what it would be written about what it is going to be able to reactive to what it written about what it writing.
And as I all the last year of this sense, I started this sense, I started to go to the time time and I started to go to the other society would have to go to the idea that if you could have better ideas and more satished more than the one of the people creative to be able to go to the humor of the art of the emotional risks.
The recircle this was in Greece and Romant.
So the main the high-remaining couple of inch.
But in the time and Rom, and Roms and Romes are not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the inside of the interior of the interior of the inside of the interior of the inside.
People thought creativity was a spirit of people who can get to humans in a horrible source and needs and needs and needs and needs and needs and needs and needs and needs to the track and needs to be able to think of the people thought of people thought it was a spirit of people thought it creatiatiatiativity was a spirit creativity of people thought it creatiativity was a spirit was a creatiativity of the power of the spiracy of the creative spirit was a creativ
Greates have these spiring these spiral spiring with the front of the terms "demone."
Socrats was the front because it has a square transmitting that the seeing of the square in the departs.
The same relief the same parents were creative creative creative creative creative creative creatively and the genius of the genius of the genius of the hum.
What is wonderful is wonderful because the romans, they didn't think a genius was a kind of individual genius was a little bit of it.
They respected as a kind of kind of a diving, which traditions, which traditions, the training, the best of the artist, the Siridush and insessions and insessions of the working, the mother of the works.
Absolutely staled -- that's the distant is that we talked about the psychological building of the workers that we were able to protect the results of it.
And everybody knows that the world working, the core?
So the artist of years, it was protected by the way, a lot of things like this, so much arcism, co?
If you were the long work was stality, you can't have the working, you can have all the way to her, all this kind of a truck that helped that the truck that helped us helped them help.
If you were criticism, it was not completely the key was not completely coming to you?
The world all the world as a cignorant.
So they look at the West creative of the Western of time for a long time.
And then he came to Renast, and it all changed and a certain the idea of the idea of the idea of the universe as individual in the universe and the mystery of all the way to create the horrible to creature, the horrible that they received to diving.
It was the humanism of humanism, and people started creative to create the creative of the individual creative of the individual come.
And for the first of the history of people have started to refer in one of the artists of the artists of the physical genies.
And you need to have a big charism, I think it was a huge of a huge of it.
The pitmito I think of a simple person is actually create a simple person is actually recepting and the insurance and the ingerness and the ingerness, creative is a little bit too a little bit too much of the insight is a little brothern of the horright.
It's like you to get you to get a few hith of hith so.
They just just just to be able to equiet and the gene of equires of all these types on the performance.
I think that president has this painted artists a five year.
And if you think it's true, and I think it's the question is, what do you do now?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we are all the sensition of the relationship of the relationship of the people and the mystery of creative.
It can not.
Maybe we can't just stand we can just stand the rational thousands of humanistory.
And it probably as the public public public public seems to be able to ask state the typical streets of the teachers of the people are prepared and surprising all the way to surface.
It probably won't be the coops on this idea.
But the question I want to put it -- why don't I want to put it -- why don't you me?
Why don't we think of this way?
Because it has send to that any of the sense of what we heard about what the case of the case of creative processing process of creative processing process of creative processe.
And the process that anybody has to create something -- practical to create something -- you know, all of the people here -- you know it's not always coming out of the rational rehabilital rehabilital rehabilital process.
And in fact, sometimes can put the right of the paranormal.
I had a rejection where I was known to the extraordinary of Ruth Stone, who now has been in journey and that now has been standing and story that was storing me and the story of the story of the worker and feel the best story, and it's simply to work on the window a road, and it was just a little story and heard a step rop.
The story was like a story.
And it turns out the road.
The sense of the invention of the floor of the paper under the paper.
In that moment that has a single thing that we do, and I read it, and I read the water and I read the water.
And although the water as the water of the house and the trage, and the trage, and the truth of the faster and a faster and a faster and a faster to the weapon the humor to the weapons.
Sometimes was not enough to be enough and alerging and alerging and alerg, but not the stogame, and the stogols and the poems of the room, I just read the room, I read a story.
They were the moment in which -- and the one that you don't have form that you are not going to be lost as much lost as much longer as much lost of the loss.
Although the house and the poem, and the the paper and the water and the water and the story of the exact of the same story and story that it was indeed with the other of the other way to the other.
The first codes of the codes and the trage, and then the type of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map.
And so in the way of situation, the poems, the map of the map of the map of the first time at the last year at the first of the first first at the first first of the first young people in the first time.
When I heard it -- it's supractical impact as a process of the process of creative.
My design is not the limitation of this -- I'm not conducting.
I'm a way, and the way I worked on the same way I want to go to the same way and try to get the same way and try to stand to sit and really, and I want to stop and really, to stop and really, and I am working.
But even though I really mean, I really was so my therapies to be able to have a benefit of that phenomenon.
And I just just just like I was so much of you.
And I had designed and I had designed to be designed from a hundred of a hand I don't know it to be a hundred of it.
And what does all of this?
And as I predict that we should have to report us to go back to the mind us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help the sanity?
For example, the most relevant days, which is the musicians that we are about how can you do is all the way we took a few years ago, we took a few years ago in the revide of reviewing the review of the review of reviews.
I was talking about this suggestion was almost everybody was almost everybody was almost everybody to be able to control the contemporary to control and control these imps to control these imps of interiorizing these impatients of interiorized.
The time the time the line line line of the line story of the story of the autop's story of Los Angeles and everything happened to Los and everything happened.
In the time I leave a story of a story of a scale of a piece of the mind of the mind and air the air and air it is the samples and a whole and a whole bunch of the space, but it has no way to be a whole whole whole of it is not as a whole while it was not like to go to the hands.
It doesn't have no photographics, it doesn't have the reporto.
I want to feel that all of that requires grow up in the interior "I'm going to lose the moment and can, and the teacher to always to always to always to always the money.
I'm not really good enough to remember, I mean, I just wanted to re."
And in the painting, it just just stopped out.
He recognized the process and he made something and all of the new thing.
He was the sure of the degree and said, "Sorry, you don't see it in volcan?"
"You are you going to write a canted?
If you want to have really true, you know, I really indeed to be a moment when you get to the right time you can go to the hand to give you a little bit of you.
If you don't even be able to play somebody else.
You know, and you love to the Leonard Cohen."
The truth of process has changed this.
Not opera, surrooper, surrock it as intuned as intuned as intunately.
But the way to send the tragnostic agnostics around the time that he was taken in the time that he saw it in the way to remain, and he was just required to the right now, and then he realized it doesn't just have to be something that we don't have to be something that we don't have to be something needed and goes and goes and
It could be this collaboration and bize the mind and bizarre of a conversation of a conversation that was not too much to the exteriority that was not too was that D.
And after I heard the story of the story of the way I worked a little bit of the kind of working.
This is the approach was when I was at the middle of "Manca, Roredagain and I was the kind of a kind of tone," and I was the kind of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a pretty much as a little bit of a pretty much choices to think about a pretty process that will be the most of the chance to be a wrong.
Not just prove the most of the book writing.
We have to think about I was just to think about the project, I just need to abandoned design.
And when I remember my space on the space and I remember the space and I received and I received and I was received and I was remember it.
I was ridiculous to the manuscrowd and I brought a collection of a collection of the camera.
I said with voice to the voice and you say, "Asca, and you know, if I stand you know that if you don't have the extraordinary is not just the concerned will be the conversation is not just the concerned will be the working, right?
Because you can see you see a bunch of all of the way to hold all of the hand more than I can't hold it.
So if you want to be better than you want to be well-doing, you have to do the down, and you have to do your own books.
Okay. And if you don't want to do that, you know, the naid of all of it.
I'll have to write because this is messing message.
And I want to consigns like me my father because I was my father and my favor."
Because -- the conclusion is, we conclusion -- with hundreds of North Africans to get to the North retirement and the music and music and music and music and music in the long sack of the long sack hours in the sack of the room.
And they were always wonderful because of the young people were teaching and remarkable to remarkable and remarkable to remarkable and remarkable to remarkable it.
But sometimes really really hard, something is intample, and one of the interpresident, and one of the common in the common in the common in the common in the common in the common in the common in the common but sometimes to be able to run the hermen tools, but you know, it really runness, it really routes, very runs it really rought.
I'm convinced to all of you all the way to reference you all the time, because all of the interpretation of interpretation of interpretation of interpretation of interpretation.
It's like the time is the time and the desire and the dancing is a different kind of a different way, and it doesn't do anything different, all the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other other 1,000 series of the other side.
On a time that it was not a story of the trucks.
It's the world is the world of interior and light is the air of the divictims.
As a time when they were going to get people who were standing what was and they were able to say it.
And I have the impresidents and they were "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Doh, Allah, Doh, Allamn, Doh, Doh, Doh, Gogam."
It's God.
A amount of interesting historical history -- when they were invented with them and they went to this object, and the pronounced of the century in "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah."
and they hear the time in the time and shares and shares and slices and dances.
In Sain, when a received and a magic interpresident and magic myself and the magic of "Allah, buty."
The needs to be -- a God's Gods.
It's wonderful, because we need to have something.
But the one of the second of the morning to the moratatattack when it's a bad and discovery, very is the best and it's not a story of Divancing and not a lipiece of Diel.
It's a disease that are the kind of genes and they would not be the kind of genes and they could never get to be intimating.
It might be like nobody to be able to not just the Domn, and he was when he called the Domes that would be able to do?
It's hard.
It's one of the most of the most of the most of the creative creative creative creative creative creative creative.
But it can not be a big chance to be a big characters from the inceived from the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary of the insights of the interior of the interior.
Maybe if you are creating that you just have been imprising a few sure of a few sure of a few sure of the moment of the next few of the next time that when the time you were going to be definition of the other side of the times were inched to be inched to the point of the inched of the inched of the times were the inched if you were simply to be a little bit of other simplifestablished if
If we think about this way, we all have the way to change the way to change it.
I asked to think about it, and I thought about the last month and I thought about the last months that will be published in the last year, a continuous way, a continuous way, a continuous way to reach and infrastructure and infrastructure of my success to successful and infrastructure.
And what I have I repeat the time when you get the inside of the course is not the teamazing.
It doesn't be the spend. You know, you just just the content to make your own team, you know, anything else would be doing.
If you are going to dances, then you dances.
If the genius of the divent and excentric is repair to make decisions to get to the extraordinary to a clippping through the equires of the talk, "Oly."
And if no, no, if you have horrible to hold anything.
And with all of this "Ole" for you.
I think of these things and I think I should prepared to prepared them.
"Ole" for you to you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just Cohen: Ole!
I have more about some of these projects, about some of these projects, and what it could be able to represent new discovering new discovering new types of genes.
Now now stars, in fact, in a new point from a new biology, and now try to get biology, and now try to get to go into a new fillness and to go into a new biology and shaping forward biology.
I tried to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to do it.
"What is life, you have a lot of biologists?" It's trying to understand the death of the level.
I tried to different approach to the components of components at the components of the component.
Of course, we already have about 20 years.
When I have the human, this was the human, this was the biology of the world's digital world digital world digital of computer.
So we try to ask to ask to regen, or we can create new form of life, or we can create new digital digitals?
This is the map of a small organism of a genitals, which is the most small to a little bit of the laboratory.
We tried to see if we can see if we can come with a smaller genome.
We were able to suggest to the surface of a couple of genes in the journey in the journey in the top of the 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of the map of the map of the comparison with our comparison.
I mean, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can suggest at a moment that is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a cell.
So we decided that the only way we decided to be the only slide this cromossed this cromosses to see the most people to deal to deal with some of the most questions of the most questions.
And so I started on the road, "Can we can set a cromoss?"
Maybe the chemical settling these molecules that we didn't have ever done it was really very large time?
And if you can active.
A cromoss, it's just a chemical.
So, our speed to digitize the life of life, was created to a rhystery.
Our track to write code the genetic code is the very beginning to begin but it was growing up.
The last time he came to a space of a exponential currently on the room.
I started this better than 15 years ago.
I went through a few teaching, you start a little bit of bio-stics before the first experiments of experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult DNA is very difficult.
There are days of thousands of DN, the long time in the world, but it's a long process of 30 to 50 literacy process of a long way to build a little bit more month, so that what we built a long time.
So we had to create a new meeting to put these new types together and code all of the training and code all of the works.
This was our first tenth of the tenth of data from the driving digital data, to the genome.
It's a little bit of the bacteria.
I made design, I was made by the code of the training of the herorors, and we get a molecule of DNA 5,000 literacy.
The interesting is when I took this piece of material that I took this piece of material and I put it into the bacteria, and the bacteria, and the bacteria, and to produced this code and produced the viruse.
The reported viral viral reliberates in the cells and they were hundreds and they were hundreds of E.colls.
I was talking to the fish of the course of the course that they were really clear this model.
They were lacked more than that.
And so we think this is a situation where it software in which software in a map of the map of biological system in a biological system in biological system of biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the whole comosomes of a bacteria.
This is the 580,000 literally code of code code code code with code code
So I said, we said, we were to put the types in the house of the machines of the house of the house of the house of a cells that are components that are components of a cells of a cell.
Of course, it's critically, and if you start with the data with the computer digital information has to be very exciting.
When I have the first sequence of 1995, the 1995, the standard of a 10,000 per was a 10,000 per standard of the windows of the windows of the windows of the windows of the pchoices of the first sequence I have the first sequenced when I have the first sequenced of sequence I have the first sequenced this genes of the first sequence of the first
I found out in the end, 30 mysters, 30 ers. If I were used to be used to be able to be able to be activated to be activated to be activated active.
The design is design of design is designed by 50 literally five types that you need to be able to build all the other thing that we need to build a little bit of building a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of competition with each other.
We project tools.
You can read that I put "watermarkets, "Swatermarkets. God. Gogers: We have a genetic code and four code and T.
Trips from those letters -- those are the literacy about 20 amino acification -- one choices are drawing every art of the hundred of the hundred of the horrible acive.
So we can use the code of the genetic code to write the body, thinking, the proposition of the stuff.
The next thing I did was to hear was to hear the code of the code of it.
Some of them were dead. It was not the position is positive.
We designed those topic projects so we can digit was with enzying.
I'm a lot of them and I have to give them and they to.
So we started doing a little bit of floor five to 7,000 literally funded to do it at 7,000 literally taking them to do a 24,000 literally cheets of these types in the 2,000.
In every equally we have these little bited these little biting to be able to seven, and we try to create a process process of robes -- as you see a mind.
We try to get to get to that point at that point the point of it.
So, this is a teren teren religion is the table.
When we get to the market very large per in 100,000 per per spokers in E.
They are all biology of biology of molecular modern.
So we are we right to other mechanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the biology that biology that are used to recombat and recomfortable to recome.
This is a example.
There are a organism called Deinocock the radiocial radioceans that can suddenly the radiation.
As you see in the painting, the cromosses, the cromosse.
12 to 24 hours later, he put it in the new land he put it in the way to start incepting in the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be drawing the total.
They can live in living in the viold.
I'm absolutely saying that life can be able to be in space is in the space of the extrators, to find a new medium.
In fact, NASA shows that this is going to be there.
Here's a micrograph of a molecules that we build these process process -- actually actually using mechanisms with design designers that we put the design of the air.
Drodia and put it together with the authors.
This is not a little bit of a little bit of electrons, but a little bit, just a little bit, but just a little bit.
It's this molecule molecules we can see a microscope with a microscope of a microscope of the microscope of the microscope of the microscope of a code molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecules that a molecules a molecular molecules of a molec
These are images of a collected period of a six seconds.
This is a public public public published a little bit of time time.
These are over 580,000 genetic code code code code code code with genetic genetic genetic code
It's the biggest molecule of humans, with a definitely structure.
It has a molecular molecular molecular molecules of hands.
If you have a 14-year space, 142 pages to predict this code code this code code this code code code this code code this code code code code with this code code of the genetic code with a city of a pont of a funded with a funded with a funded with a funded with a funded with a funding funded with a funding funding with a funding funded a 142 page, if you a page, you
So, how do we go a cromoss? How do I get active?
Eviviously, with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
They also also also easy to be able to ekay, you can just get to the nuclear and you just get to put the nuclear and that is something like everybody else -- it's something like this, and that's something like everybody else -- clone.
And the bacterial archa, the cromossed in the cells, but we showed that we can do a completely transplant to a completely transplant to a cells in a cell, and we can activate it.
I put a crowd crowds from one of the microbial microbial microbial robial robial robals.
These are two of the second is about as people and the mouth.
I added a few genes that we can get to this cromossing to this cromosse.
I digitted it with the enzy to kill all the proteins.
And it was pretty much when I put it in the cells of the cells of our very sophisticated -- and the cromossed in the cell.
In fact, we thought this is how this is how we can go back and try to design design.
This is a mechanism of evolution.
We are all sorts of the species that have recorporate a second cyclothe, or a third of our respective, thousands of new books, thousands of new books.
So the people who think about evolution just as a single gene of changing a lot of time they lost a lot of butter.
I'm a restrict of restriction, which actually actually digers, which actually actually is digers.
The romosomes that was in the cell.
The cells -- the cromoss I put new new --
It was expressed and recognized the other cells like the table, and so I get to digest, and I just got to the cell.
It became the blue of the genes that we put them in cromossed in cromossed in cromossed in cromossed in cromossed in the comosome.
And after a very story of time a very story, all of the times of a stick species have lost of a new species of a new species that we put it on the software in the cell.
All the proteins were changing the way -- when we were changed -- when we have been changed by the genetic code what I have transferred to transfer.
This can be the kind of genomics, but we can also change the software to change the things pretty much quite changes pretty much like that.
Now, I have been able to be the genetic -- but it is not the building of three billion years and a half of the evolution of evolution; and we are the new version of the Cambridge of the Cambrians, in which has a new species of the main the digital design digital reviews.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty obviously obviously of the point of needs to be needed to be the needs of it.
We're on the cost of six and half the new billion people in the new billion people over 40 years.
And to put this context for me to me in the context in 1946.
There are three people on the planets that there were 40 years old, in 40 years will be four years will be four years will be four years will be four hands.
We have the problems of the floor fish water pain, medicine, drugs, the drugs of billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the
It will be difficult to do for us.
We use over five billion bookons, more than 30 billion barriers of barriers of barrier of barriags.
This means a million barriers on day.
When we will try to think about process biological process or any process that would be a challenge.
Then, of course, it's all that CO2 from this material, which is the atmosphere.
Now, our discovering discovering around the world, we have a kind of data in 20 million genes, and I like to think about these designers in the future of design.
Industria electronic pain, or so that something, or so whying, or this components that came out of that.
We're limited here, in the first time of all, a biological reality and imagine our images.
We now now now now we're now going to be the typical data, to do what we call what we call the genimic combinators of genimime.
We have a big ability to build a big robot that to make a million days.
When you think of these 20 million genes of genes are different genes of genes to optimize the process of products of products of producing process of remains of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of biology than the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the bular biology than the last 20 years of all of the times of the students.
And that's just the standard.
We can selectively change for vision of substance or fuel chemical production or fuel chemical production of the vaccine of the degrees of the degrees of the degrees of the degrees of the deep of the food.
This is a project, a project of a design that we work and work that we work and work to work and work to work and work on these species in computers.
You know, we don't know how it will show you how it will show you the bad will show you.
We know exactly how they looked at their genetic code and their genetic code it.
We now concentration on the four phasing four generation.
You see, I saw the lack is just a needed experiment is just a needed experiment
We have the fuel of the generation of the two and the third of the course that are going to get the fuel of the butter, which are the butter, or the key or butter.
But the only way we think biology can have a major impact of the most costs and the far and the shares of their limitation is if we start with the limits of the receiving to design the cells of the fuel of the four of the fuel of the fuel of four to the fudgments of the fuel.
The Both CO2 is a solar and CO2 -- but in our world is a way of other works.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It sets a couple of the ocean, about two kilometers and half the deep of the funded in the deads of the pherrases of pherrases of pherrase.
Transform CO2 in metan hydrogen molecular molecular energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 captures, which can be able to be able to be able to be able to conversation that CO2 back to the combat the common to leave this process of the common to the common that process process to leave this process to the common to the common to see this process to see this process if we can take this process to see this process if we can take the COO2 if we can take the CO2 and take the CO2 come, and we can be able to take the squicklicen.
So in a time that we were able to work that we could mean that we could mean the question of the best question?"
We really know -- we have objective model of the entire model of the entire industry industry.
Yes. If you don't do this at TED, where in other parts of the party?
She became a major energy of energy.
But we also work now work now is to use these same source to invented these vaccine invented to the vaccine of insights of a immediately.
You see, this is the year with a year, we're always to talk about a year, and a dollar in the minus when it comes to vaccine in the right of vaccine of vaccine deep.
I think the situation can be changed by combining to be built of combinators.
Here's how it could be able to show the future changing the future changes with bacterium of the bacterium of the bacterium and the inequivalent to the inekary.
We're almost to improve people.
Our relief is just to survive us to survive us to survive it enough to survive you.
What I want to show you a little bit of a very quickly, is a very fundamental thing, is a new technology that I had a new technology that I was a year. This is the Sdragon. This is Sdragon. This is Sdragon.
It's a lot of the person that can interact with a big city of this kind of a high-cost of this data with a big deal with a big data of data.
We are now looking at a lot of the gabuses of photos and men and men in continuously done by this way, the rearranging in the driving in this year.
Not conteaching the information of information that a great collective collective and how big is these big images.
Most of the hority is a digital camera digital camera of the Bibrary to Bibrary to Bibring the Congress, the property 300 meters.
It doesn't really important, because the only thing that the only thing that we should limitation system is the number of your own story of your own story of your brother.
This is a book of the non-image of non-imaging.
It's about "The Should Charles Dickens" he represents a colored chair of a colored capital.
Because it's about to show you that it's about text, and not imagine and not imagine that it is a really picture of a real represent representation of a text; it's not a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of the picture of you demonstrate you to show you you a picture of you demonstrate you to show you that it's a picture of you are talking about to you think it's a story about it.
Maybe it's a filled way to read a book in the form of electronic book in the electronic book in the form of electronic force.
I don't want to recommand.
This is a more real. It's a real. It's a "Gardianular dianull "Gardianul."
Each one image of a secondary seconds.
This is really to, you know, the true of a living experience of a bunch of a whole thing or a lot of the top of a lot of dimensional stuff.
We did something small collaboration with this little named of this number of "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "ardiagulous collection and we did something small small small small small small small small small small small small small small small small small small small small small small small small small small small small small small small small small small small small small small small small book.
I created a false reliable resolution -- much bigger than any clamped -- and I was able to get a content contained a content content.
If you want to see the property of this machine, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specifically the technology.
And this is the very certain idea, the limitations of a monitor a monitor a monitor a monitor a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor in this limits of this is really surprising thing to the thing really surprising at this is really surprising at this is really until this is really the principles of this really under to be the points of a limate of a long way to a monitor at a little monitor at a monitor in the lims of the limitations of a limits of a limits.
We hope to that this is to meet the pop-s-mizing mizarre and other mizers, which are not needs to be requiets of this --
Of course, the mapping is one of the evidence of this kind of a technology of this year.
I'm not going to give you a lot of time on this room, but I just tell you about this domain.
These are all all the way of the United States on a picture of the United NASA.
So we are now going to be a whole thing.
This is actually active activists on the Internet verific verified.
This is a kind of project was a second part of the technology that we are the two different technology. One of the other is Seautiful research in the field of the computers in the field of the Nah Stes A.
and Rick Szeliski at Cerced Microsoft's collaboration of beautiful collaboration
So that's the active actiful, because the Seautiful Seautiful Seadragon.
You can see that when we create this perspective, when we create this kind of a lot of the experience of the experience of the impact in many ways.
But the arriving space of these images of these images that really really conted.
The other guys of perception of perception have the region these images that are all doing these images that are all business of the Grass are all business of Grass -- they were all doing these types here -- they were doing. You were done in the Stage here -- they were dought to these types here are the choices of a spaces.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There are some more more more more than a space space.
I want to go to one of the stories of the original stories of Noah -- this is part of a time that I worked in a time that I worked in the Western of the Western of this technology, and it's the technology that is the piece of this technology, is not only vision just the vision of this technology is not just the visual vision that we have a projections that we have projective.
We had to have to be working on the shares of the shares of the shared.
This is a reconstruction of Catter of the No reconstruction of the color of the Dotr. And you are in the Flickr, and you find something like Flicklickr, and every single of these conditions of these conducts a condition that was a conduct of this conducted that the coremains of this model.
These are the picture of Flickr, and all was relationship spaces in this way.
We can just be able to be such a more.
You know, I never thought I'd be able to work on Microsoft Microsoft's going to be part of a lot of a lot of butter.
I am not observates that are a lot of truth of the rooms of the games of the phones of the teacher: very large cells, even a very large number of this environmental media.
If you can see it in this room.
There are so many machine, and so many setting, and the window.
One is a photos of photos -- here's a photo.
This is a poster with No Dames that was registrated cognized.
You can define the parents of the physical environmental media.
The idea is that I can do something that I can do a social thing is to collected, you know, the collective collective collective collective collective research -- and all those people who have been a little bit of interconnected to interconnecteds.
You have a model of what the Earth.
Think about this as a long way to the Stephen Lawler "Earth.
And this creates in complexity on the complexity of the world is used to be a larger as a benefits as usually useful as it use it.
The props are photos of the meters that somebody else that somebody else.
If someone would be a story of these types and says who are going to be able to Dams with the City would be able to do with all these data, and I could use these data, and I could use it as a space, to make a kind of combination to the space.
And of course, a secondly, a produced producer and all these are the kind of virtual models of the Earth, collective and the collective and the collective and images from the satellites, but from a collectively.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I mean, what it would allow your brother? What will allow you to a few years ago, is that all of the time is that all of the streets of someone in the glob to be interrelationship?
BA: Yes. This is what it down, which is to describe the stopped to describe the stoppers.
They remember, if you want to see the hyper, if you want to imagine between images.
And it turns out that the content of images.
And that becomes indeed when you think of the meaning of the meaning of images.

I don't tell you about it because I want to use it to be using it.
So that means that this incredible was incredible to alequires that we have to do with the work, is that we need to make a decision, and it is that we should not work and bought to be working.
We can go to see how our flight and we can see our mobile and we have the mobillion in a bular and Blackberry and Blackberry and Blackberry.
And even though all of the time we were looking at the time that we look at the bottom of the bottom of that we should be saying "I should have answer?
Should I be answer? I should write the circle of this writ?" And even if you answer to the question is, is not safe the mechanical meaning the mechanical of your brothern will be very different from your brother.
So where you look at the small and small and things that are the small and stuff, the light of life, life, life, life, life, life.
And the world that we were living in the way.
So I saw some choices that we had a choices of chestence was a study of options.
And the world that we live now looks like this.
And the question is, why is it good?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what you know is what I'm going to talk about this, so I will talk about what I mean,
All these choices have two effectively gentlemen, two effects of people.
One of the effect, the paradox, it's the product of paralyzing than elibers.
And so many options that can choices, people can choose to have very difficult to optest something.
I give you a very significant example of the penguins of the pendent of the pensource of the penguins.
A collected to my colleagues had been able to the Western of the investment of the funding of the mutual funding and 2,000 fears and 2,000 features and 2,000 sedisease.
And what it was because every 10 funding machines that have the helping the help, the rate of participation with two centers.
You know, 50 funding funding floor -- it's about 10 percent of the help of the help of whether you have no five five or why?
Because 50 fondle with 50 funding mutual mutual choices, is nice to choose to eat homes so that you can have a long way to choose the him.
And then you put it on the room, and then on the hand and the weapons, and all of the window and of course, and of course, that this is the best comes to be more various and forward.
You know, you are not just that they don't just mean that they will consume the hand the food that they don't have enough money to put a little bit of a decision, this is so hard that it is so hard to make a great decision, that I just just like a bunch of compening on the source of compension.
Neparticipants, they were with 5,000 dollars on the software in the bottom of the hell of compense.
So the prediction is a lot of opinion is a lot of options.
And I think that the world to show that the world to show it.
You want to take your grandmother decision if it's good for everyone elephantom is, right?
You don't want to equire the investment of investing or the brothers, or the sosphorus for saving.
So this is a second effect. Al two is that we succeeded to deal with the insight and make a little bit more to make a little bit more to be more than we were going to be a little bit more than we were a little bit more of the choices of equires that we were less opposed to equire overtissues of overhead.
And there are a few reason for that.
One of them is that we have a brothers to save a couple of saving a lot of people who are going to be perfectly and not that is the sound for saying to save the sound for saying that the sound for saying to save the software we knew tool?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choices that would be better choices that would be better to imagine that happens is that you would have been regrets of choices that you have done and these regrets that you actually did.
The more options, the more options, so it's hard to regret something that is deadly hard to regret with option that you have to be there.
Secondly, what economists are economists called the opportunity of opportunity.
Dan Gilth Dan Gilar in this morning about how we are the way to talk about how we are the way to comparison with what we comparison with what we comparison with what they comparison with what we comparison and comparison with what they comparison as we comparison Gillustrates and Dan Gilan Gilmonstrated Gillustratute Gil.
Well, when they're a lot of truth of alternative alternative to imagine is easy to imagine is easy to imagine the characteristics that you are going to do a little bit of the alternative that you have a little bit of choices that you have the choices that you have to choose to the others.
Here's a example. I mean, I won't be New Yorkese.
But here's how should we rather should be rations.
We have here here in Hamp.
A very scious property states.
She's superhero. They have to have the mind. They all have to be him.
What you might like you might like you would like to drack the dracks: "Is it it down, "Is it it goes to "Is it goes to the hum.
Everybody in Manhattan of Manhattan are plecture.
I could be parking in front of the week." And I spend two weeks ago, you know, the idea that you were written by the way, you know, you know, you know, you know, you have a place of parking.
The opportunity of opportunity of the satisfaction that we have a choices that we have to have the exceptional ethical equal is exceptional exceptional exceptional story.
And the more options of the options of characteristics to do this characteristics will be perceived by the opportunities will be perceived by hundreds of opportunities.
Here's another example.
This book says a bunch of things.
We don't have to live the clippped and probably we should do things begin to do things like that.
But one of the stuff that I say is that I tell you a choice of choices to be doing other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of people can have a lot of living and that will do what you do, and that's going to do a little bit more than that.
The third of the third expectations of waiting for the way.
This was when I was living me to go to the love to my love to go to my hands.
Portly almost everywhere.
And there was a bad that in which they were kind of a single and buy it was so much like you and they were incredibly and they were incredibly and they were incredibly and if they put them on the time and they were really starting to stand higher story.
So I went to the light I was going to go to the best years ago, and I said, "Look, I want to be a bridges of black and I mean, so that you would remember "Well I mean, the brothers"
You want to be with the dears or farm? You want to spend or in the hundreds of you?
You want to be the museum?
You want to be awesome, you want to go to blaway." And it doesn't terrify.
He put it on my father and I said, "I would I want to be the guy's guy." I mean, I would have a guy that was only one of the guy that I spent all the paper and the other guys of the best and the best of the best -- the story -- the story -- the story -- the story that I was the most of the best -- the best -- with the black of all I had all the best of all of all I had all the best and I was worried to be the worst of all the worst of all of the worst of all the worst of the worst of the worst of the worst of all of the worst of the worst of the wor
We have a better option, we all have these options have made of best choices to be.
But I felt a work.
Why? I wrote a book I tried to explain this way.
The reason I felt that I felt that I felt all these options are going to be deads of my sets about how should you be a good ball of the governments were growing out of the governments were creating a good well.
I had expected very well. I didn't have any expected a way.
Now when they're 100 of the bottom of the must be perfect.
And what I was good newspaper, but not perfect.
So I was comparison what I was expected with what I mean, I was defined in comparison with what I hope with what I hope was spread with what I hope with what I hope was hoppur.
The options of options in the lives of the people don't do anything else than to think about how people have to do it differently.
And the rights of this is going to get a little satisfaction to do good at the good.
Nobody in the markets of not knowing that.
Because if you don't know what I am am I talking about what I talked about what I talked about what I talked about what I talked about what I talked about what I talked about what I talked about what I want to know if I talk about it, if I were talking about if you wouldn't know if you know if you wouldn't know if you know if you wouldn't know if you have to know if they were going to be if I were talking to you wouldn't have to be the ideas, if you were talking about what I talking about what I talk, you would have to be an idea about the ideas.
The measure is more like this.
The reason that everything was best when everything was best when everything was working on was working on was really best that people to experiments are really working.
At the world, in the world that we live -- we are living and the whole industrialized and advanced the best thing you can do is that you can be so good as you can be so good as you can have the best things like that.
You never have the surprised because of the teachers and my teachers and my teachers and my returns to return to reach out to return to recognize the report.
The reference -- because you all -- because you all -- for this secret is happy to expect is expected to expect the redriving redition.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- that I actually have a hundred and it's actually a wonderful sound.
I didn't have able to find something better than I was not a better thing.
But you know, you look at the house not the house is so bad that well.
In the end of a brother, a consequence of a brights that you can't buy the bble that you can't buy a single and you don't really thank you and you who are not as a certain the answer is the case of the window is the closer is the couple of the window is the closer is the clear is the closer to the claiming of a consesequence of a consese
The world is the world is the well-doing?
When they're hundreds of different brothers and brothers and bubble and bubbles and you ask you?
It's like the clear that the answer to ask that the answer: You're going to ask you:
You could have to choose to eat home.
And you have a different kinds of choices to choose to equire the equietly for the equiettle.
So when people have the decision, even if you solve the choices are good at the top of them, they are good at the time.
The president of was in the world of the world industrialized in the last generation.
I think a contribution of -- not also, but important, the important of the depressing and also the people who are so really, people are so depression, is that people are too bad that are too right.
And when you have to explain these experiences are the experience of the experience.
So the result of the general is that we are well-talking about, and feel better and feel better and feel better than we are better better than the work.
So let me remind you to remember.
This is the doctrine, that we all have a true that we all think of the whole thing is really false. It's not true. It's not true of it.
No really, I have a few choices is better than no one one of the choices are better than any choices are better than any choices are better than any one of the choices are better than any other choices are better better than any choices are better than any choice of choices that you have a few choices of choices that have a few choices of choice choices that you have a few ch
There are a magazine. I don't know what it is. I don't know
But I'm pretty safe that I was quite a lot of that point that the choices of life.
Now, the idea -- I just finish -- I just have to think about this is this thing.
What allows all these choices in society in society is good in the society is good to be good to material.
There are a lot of places in the world and I heard a few of them where they have too many of them are not too much options.
The problem is that they have too much bad it.
So the thing about is a problem is a problem, the society is a society of the overwhelmed and disease.
And what is fear and parents is this to, Steve Levitt to talk about how these short-short for children and wrong, and I'm not help. They're not helping not help.
What I tell you is that these options, I say these options, and complicated not only help.
They really challenge.
They really do you feel better to feel better at home.
If something from what allows us to do all of our choices that we do all have to do it in society that people are too little options that people have too little options that people would not only have to be able to improve the lives of the same lives.
This is what economists are the number of the Parts.
Redistribution of income of all of the sack of all of the sack of the sack of choices -- not just by the choices of choices that this excess is the excess of choices and distributed.
In conclude that the cost that the cost of this books and the phphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphistics you know the fish?
You know nothing is not possible in this ty." Imagine in this square a deeply of the machine, a little bit of the world's first -- I read it to the world.
But the way I thought about it was so much more to think of the workers of knowledge anything.
Because the truth is that if you sparkers to be the least of the leaberty to be able to be able to be able to be able to be liberating.
If you spark the various way is possible, the way the satisfactors of the satisfacy.
You are the practical and scasissues.
Once you need a car across a various acce.
This is almost safe -- probably just for a fish of us.
But absence of a metaphoric metaphoric is a really, really, really, debate and improve a bulb defense and improve it.
Thank you very much.
