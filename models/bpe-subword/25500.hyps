And the year I showed these two diaxies to demonstrate the motion of the last three million years that the last three million years of the last three million years of the last three years, it was small, the size of the four percent of the blood of four percent of the baby of the four percent of the babies of the last year.
But this morning, this is the special problems because of this problem of this issue of the blood of the blood of the blood of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the bad of the heart of this morning.
The polar polar is is in a way, the heart of the climate system.
She was extinction and they have to be contract.
The Uruther's diax, I will show you a faster will be a faster on what happened in the last 25 years.
Gehythm is the big chemical chemical chewing.
So as you see the blue of the blue inches of blue inched.
This is the another, the another.
And they give you the heart of the window it.
Asays, the bad of the permance, with a five years or more than five years or more than a five years of same, you can see that it was almost like a body.
In 25 years ago from this year, at this time.
This is a problem because the challenge of the process of the death of the article of the artic.
where it's a massive massive carbon that carbon that the meters, when they are transformed in metan micro-organisms are transformed in me.
The pollution of the pollution of the global data in the world in the world in the atmosphere if we could go to the point if we could go to the point of extremely extremely extremely extremely extreme.
To in some senses in a little bit of a bone-lapse of disease of disease of disease of disease.
The Mather's Katter from the University of the Alaska was on a other hang of the team of a single physical lab.
Here, yeah, yeah, he is OK, and the question is notice if we are going to be notice to be be.
And a reason is that this enormous enormous inforce of income,
This is a range that all over the year.
But the bad are much larger as no longer than anything.
This is the Kangerlussian Genlussia.
If you want to know how the large levels of the large levels from the blood of the blood of the blood of the blood of the main the main the main the main the main the main the main the main the main the making of you want to stand in the making you want to know how to stand to stand to know how to create the slightly you want to know how the ground.
These debate growing very quickly on the future.
And at the other capita plant, Antarctic, Antarctica the biggest of the planet.
The past people have one style style of the continent of the continent is the networker is negative, and the story of the Antarctics on the top of the insular today.
This is the equal equal meetings in Genlanda.
In Himalaya, the main the third of the third of the third of the new formats, who were in the house of years were touching a few years of years of were touching the top.
Four four percent of the world's population of the world of half-bathrown bath.
In Anzy, this guy, this is the water is the source of this city for this city.
The Debits, they grew up with it.
But when it was coming out and fly and water and water and water and water and the water.
In California was a 40 percent of the four in Sierra in Sierra in Sierra in Sierra.
This is the affects of water the rest of the water.
And the predictions, so I read the bad of the bad of things.
And in the world all the global world took a creature's growing up the incenter of the incentives of the incenter of the diseases.
And the disaster apart all the global world grew up with a rate rate and the future and the far.
Four times more in the last 30 years of the last 30 years.
This is a very until we have a challenge model.
If you look at the context of the history of what you can see is what happens.
In the last five years I added 70 million tons of tonight every 24 hours of the bones of the tonight of the oceans.
The unique of the attention to the Obvil of the Pacific of the subcontinent to the individual of the individual requigence in the oxygen.
The biggest because the only only only one of the global income, which is the global despairs, which is the fossil fuels of fossil fossil fossil fossil fossil fossil fossil fossil of fossil fossil of the most fossil of the most fossil of the most
The trolling is a problem is the most serious problem.
The United States is one of the two of Chinese are the characters of China.
And the proposal to build more fabrich.
But we start to see a change change the change.
Here's the last who have anulated in the last year,
All there are a political fight in our own bottle.
And the industry carbon and the key of the oil and the purpose of billion dollars in the last year in the last year in the last year of the last year of the comment.
The promote carbrief what is a oximory.
This picture of the image of something.
In the presence of Cracia, at me to me a billion galogallons of stering stery was imprised by carried of steryle.
You probably attention to the stird of the window.
This is all the way that you can get a big deversary of the Sintampled in the previous Sintampled in the previous Cracia.
One of the industry of the industry, as the industry, as the Cracium of the Cracium was this.
Video: Yeah, my bad with carries of carries and vessels and vessels and vessels and vesel.
He is from abundance, here in America, and helping the economic growth.
Frostom, the God, it becomes more than the weappon.
He is access and adorable and adorable and workers of past,
Al Gore: This is the surface, the cost of the Goreat Valley.
The biggest of the biggest of the best of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankend: I want to be clary. I want Pelosose, Harry Reight habar --
Al Gore: So the Alian for the Climatory of the Climatory of the campaign.
This is one of them, part of one of them, part of them in there.
Video: At COOLergy new argy new argy as a very serious things.
And that's why our principle, the cost of the money is to spend a big sumption that we have to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help about the carries of the carries of the bottom of our good,
The case is that the charguments is not didnose.
We think that is that it's like -- and we move and move and move and move and good.
So it will not inguisn't going to change the climate change the climate change the climate change the argums.
Lasass that we do in our own hands.
Video: The Great the beaten of the gyped of it.
So let's do you have a house of this car painting the cost of the current of carbs.
Huicy: Masinaria is like the zromoto.
But this is the sounds of the technology of the carbon the current of the cost of the blood.
And as the books is one of the bottom of the global warms of the global remarkable technology that you see here that the mountains that you see here that it changes the change that you see here the change that it is the changing that it changes the change that you see here is the changing of the books of the carbon the books is as well.
So this is the attention, this is technology is technology is technology to do the crazy.

Video: Narrator: Narratory, the economy, the security of nationalist.
The intenth that leads to all the way that we have the bones of the fuel, the carbon the books of the bone, but also fast.
But now we have a new solution to take a new solution to hold us to hold the includes.
The energy of America's energy with electricity for 10 years ago, in 10 years ago.
A plan to the American to the house in the training and safe the global helping stopping the global stopping of global income.
In the sfars; a solution that is a big solution to help us solve the problems.
The energy of America's America.
Al Gore: This is the last last year.
Video: Narrator: It's about re-energy requires.
One of the way of way to start to start to start dependent on the fuels of the fuels that killed our planet is here -- the Viity: The Viitor is the sound. Sweden, the software the remote of the energy remaining energy remaining the energy of the energy from the energy of the way to requick in the way.
Barbed nr.2: We are investing to create the platform of the platform of the platform of the platforce.
Narrator: The American energy for active.
Al Gore: There are a vican amazing amazing you to go to the fast, and you walk out of the only only one of the single one.
If you want to get you to get the farmed to reach out of the bad of it.
We have to get faster fast.
Thank you very much.
And the year of the TED TED I made a LHC.
And I got to get to a and give you a little bit about how it works works.
So the attacy of the hand and the most people who were not here, LHC is the most experiment that was intiful, the World West 27 kilometers, the Street is recreating a second military of a billion second-second billion second-second second-second seconds.
It's extremely amazing the blood of the blood.
This is the water is under of Geneva.
We do photographs of these minds of the mind of the decades.
I work on this way. It's called the ATLATLATLATL: Lungy's diameter of 22 meters, diameter of the ATV, the ATST.S.
On the year after the year of the year, I started the first time.
And this picture was made by AdS.
He because of a huge cycle of the room for control.
It's a first picture of the first fashion the particular that the track of the system of the system of the system of LHC, the car from LHC, the work, the deliberated in the HC, working on the particular detect.
In other words, when I was seven, I was seven, I was stored 10 seven, which is a huge of working, which is a huge successful for the success.
I don't know that if that first got the biggest hours of the biggest that when he went on Google and the first page, and he was the first page.
It means that we made a culture of cultural impact on the impact of stage.
After about a paper sapped with the water of the water with these field flipping -- these field flipping -- these field flipping aurt.
They're the transport of 13 thousands of both that the works that the power of power to power to power the power of power.
Now, the engineers in the world of says, "I can't translate the attack."
But I can do that for that when they're coming up to the temperatures become what they call the time.
So as a 271 degree of the teacher of street the decades of these streets can translate these such as they can translate these things like this,
At one of the country between the 90,000 streets in LHC, it was a fabricatic fabricatic fun.
So as the common the beginning, and the 13 of thousands of both of the electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impression, that is more likely to be a street about 20 tonight, and they deploed them 30 ways.
So we determine the determine about 50 percentage of a magnetic field.
I had to take them out, what we would do and do is and I do.
I reconditioned it all the way to repair it took them up.
And now we now go back to the subterms of the subtermble.
The farm of the big farm of the LHC will be like new that we are going to be like new that.
I will take the purpose of us, and we have to get to drive or hydrogen to the research or to keep the universe that are elemental elemental elemental research.
Now, of course, as a way, of course, these recognized recognize and engineering and engineering to rejected to report the extremely rejected to reject.
I think that the fact that the fact that is that the fact that we have a little bit like the fact that we have a lot of the experiments like HC.
Don't you lask that they are not funny in the British Davy, Humphrage, I think that I think that the protect of protecting the protection of protecting the Michael Faray, he said, "Nothing is not darady, he said, "Nothing that we have a wonderful beautiful for our minister and ask us to refer and the blood of our ministakes, as we are not moving our minists are funny, I don't have a bought badebt workers are the lights,
Thank you.
And I want to start with the assemble to remember the children, when you play with the botttom, when you play with the bottom of the bottom of the bottts.
And in the monkey to what you get to him, and to get them to the challenge and get them to the way to get invented and remains and remains and remains and manipulate the problems of space, and the relatively spaces of spaces and the relatively spaces of spaces of spaces and the spaces of what you are invented to the bad of inventional inventions.
The space of space is the providing of how we understand a big part of the world inconnection.
So if we can do the research of the IT inspired by this usually inspired with the physical objects -- impression, and my collaboratory -- I got my Pattty -- I got my Pattack -- I got my Jeevan Kanthanks -- we were indeed to use a computer, and we use a computer, in this case, and we use a computer and if we use a computer and ask to a little bit of the house of the mouse of the bathanks of the beard of the bears of that could be a mouse information of the choicaccout, we could be able to be able to be able to be a bend, in the p, and and and choick of the p, in the p, in the p, in the baloicending bridgy of us of the cushernettttunneternetwor
Do we do it again?
The question was the fascinating was so fascinating I decided to bring the building Siftable.
On the story, a Siftable computers is a very large computer.
They can be manufacture, they can perceive the recirecipe and a perceived one, and a ran and a ran and a ran and a relationship.
The most important is that I'm a palphase, so you can only missing them as you can only get them as they can only applying them.
And Sifables of a new equirement of a new equiets of digital information.
On the monkey that these instruments becomes more constants of the palphase constants one of the other constants on the other sizes of the other of us of the other stiles of the content and distractive and distractive and distractive and distractive and distractive and distractive and distractive.
I'm going to start with some simple of example.
This Sifty-Sift-predicted video of video of video and including in a direction, if the philanthropy of the park of the parts of the part, race.
These ink of the interactive are constants one of the other.
So, if you put them on a language, it becomes interested in the way.
If they're connected to be inconfusion, and they can become a confusion.
I can feel the missing and inclining.
We realized that one of the interesting of interesting involves is that we can use gestimate the gestures of manipulate the manipulate a license of how we turn a license of how I figured license a license of a license of how we turn out to the benefit as we could have a lymouse of one of the implic
In this case, we have three Sifables configuring as well as well as well as well as they can use to hold them in the center of the center where they will remember the center of the center of the center of the center of that will reach that they will reach that they will reach that they will reach that they will be the Siftynamics of this thing
If I was too much fun, we can turn out to inherite.
There are also interesting to educate education, how many other interesting education, how the mathematical language, and we want to humans and humans to do things like the results of the results of the results of the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the immediately possibilities of
So here I have a slightly slightly on a simple program with a simple programs.
Here's a game of the words of words like the bad of combination and Boggle.
The first time, in every single one literally a literally lose every Siftable, and on the mother and form to form the words, they're all verify of the words.
And then, you know, it was 30 seconds of seconds of the literally set up a new set of type and possibilities and new possibilities of research.
Thank you.
These are the children who came up in the Media, and I received to the Media, and I received to film a lot of the material and filmmaker material.
He loved her to nurse.
And one of the interesting of this kind of interesting is that kind of applicator have to give them a lot of instructive.
All right, "Maybe you know what to do is "I know what to do.
Here's some other people are doing some other people inside them.
This is the most tanar tanar in our right now, play in the right way.
It looks like everything that he wanted to take a Siftables;
So for he was just for him to him.
This is a animation applicator active applicator.
We wanted to build a instrument language.
And this is Felix.
He can get new personal characters in the scene of the Siftables that affects that affects that affects that affects the person.
Here's the sounds of sound.
Video: The bad news.
David Merrill: Now he got a traction, and he got a traction,
Video: The blood of the beginning.
God. Yeah, well, yeah.
Miss Siftable, and the ashes and ask them one way that he can help them -- Video: Ham!
DM: I create the narrative.
Video: Bunay!
DM: It's a final story of what it is going to be drawing how it will be drawing it will be draw and asura.
Video: The cycle of the pychoices.
DM: The U.S. I showed it to show it is a little bit like the music is a live and interpretated music that I built the music that I built the role of sounds like Sifables and in that the role and all the role and bas well.
Each of that has four different various various choices that you want to use it.
And you can inject sound in a success that you can asasasambition that guys.
You are the sounds of the sounds of sounds like the sounds of a success of a success of a successful Siftable.
There are equired that you can control the live and filter, and the filter of the philosphere.
Here's a certain a certain and then they are inclinics for the a-a-job.
It makes the effects like the general effects like the floor the volume of the second Hetve Hetve Hetve Hetve Hetve Hetve to see it.
Video: DM: DM: Don: World Wiftables and arges a bad of successful thing, extinct, a serious seriously reported to a seriously report.
Now I put a link of the basic line.
Video: Yeah, I love a period.
Video: Yeah, and now I'm going to bring the filter of the light of the lives.
Video: You're young people in the second second the second inclining or something.
Video: Yeah, I will attack for a lot of bas a expression.
Video: Yeah, I can receive the second time as the city of while the city of the cants.
So I don't have to do the plane of prealable to improve or melodia or disease in the work.
Now, in the sfars; I can tell you the second secsecsecsection of the secsecsection of volume, inclined in the stretched in states.
Thank you.
As you see my passion is creating new computers is creating new computers that are far better, and the brain that works in which is working on our brains and the body is working.
And today, we had a time to show a new space of design that we have a space, and some of the possibilities that I try to get out of the lab.
The Gand's that I was like to reach it is that we are at the new generator of this new generates of instruments of instruments that will add the middle of the world that will add the world of the world of the world the information in our world to the world the data of our world to reach our rules in our world that will addressing our ruls that they will adly remember that they will adly remember that they
Thank you very much.
Astep, with you all the nervous newspapers.
They're writing the written of it.
He wrote your teacher of my teacher and more than that, but it is, more than that.
It's all my mother and my mother and fascinating.
And I don't have this this is that this is to change it.
But these physics to hear a little bit like a returned out to my own book, and he determined me that he determined me that my related to the work.
And the work of the work is that I wrote this book, this book, Rography "Managain the "Managain and Iubeter," which is that the death of the botttom, and he became the world, and it became the world for a sense of the world, and it became this important sensitive sensitive sensitive that the reasonable of the connational weapond.
The research is that everywhere I go now, people go now, people go away.
Serious -- I guess -- yeah, connecting it.
All rights of injudged and improve it -- you don't have the choice that you can't even more you can actually be able to deliver the performance of the performan?
Do you don't have the worker to write your vil funny your own time you walk out of the blood of the world that would ever get the world that time, and they are going to get this world?"
It's very links, in fact, in order to be true.
But it was more run out if I was not moving to remember 20 years, when I was a little bit like 20 years, when I was a big stretching people -- as I was going to become a writing of the same reacting of the same reactive reactive reactive on a kind of bad on a kind of fascinating on a kind of fun.
And people said, "Not your hand you have no longer in the success of success?"
Do you don't have the humilian humil?
Do you have no fear that you are going to be a life of you and nothing that you don't have the opportunity to die and death you can deadly deads on a classrooms of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the second is the excit?"
Something like this.
The sea -- the race, the racy of the question is "Yeah, not."
Yeah, you know, it's the themselves.
And it always stopped me to hold me me my house
And it is in the floor in the funding that people don't get to access them to be intuition.
As a big challenges of the big challenges that are infrastructure of things that are infrastructure of things that are infrastructure.
But when I was talking about written the work, and I thought all the time, and I was "Why do I have a whole thing is "Why do you get to what?"
Is it something rational ration?
It's love that anyone to be thrown to be a little bit like to do it as a worker that they were feeling that they were feeling this Pamant.
And what is that is that specific initiatively that is really non-beaten inists is really dark in a way, in a kind of mental teachers in a kind of business that other professional teachers in which other teachers don't do it?
My father, for example, it was inchemist and not remember that in the 40 years of you have a chemical engineering to be asked, and that is not a question is not a question is not a beginning en.
It didn't really get -- John, how do I go with the block of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning?
It's simply not just the beginning of something.
But to be honest, the beginning, invented that they were too cools to be too couple of the centuries of the centuries of the centuries.
We write a writers, and we have this required and not only writors, but the artists of all kinds of all kinds of the labeled to be powerful to be powerful to be powerful mental labeling the labeling mental labeled by the labeled insanitors to writers of the insness, we have this requirement.
And everything we have to do is to look at the bottom of the moral death of registric in the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the brain diseases, which have died by the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the promise.
And even the same same same same same same size of the blood of the distractists of the own challenge of the own challenge of the own characters.
Norman Mailerman Mail, even though my last couple of the last book, he knew it a little bit more of the book."
A extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary of a movement of a life of a life of a life of a life of a life of a life of a life of a life of a life of a life of a job.
But it doesn't mack when we hear that we heard about it because I heard this because I heard these things like this, and I have heard about completely complex and bad and suggesting the idea, and the idea, and suffering the idea of the depending on the art of the barras, and the art of the barras, and the art of the suffering thing in a final far.
And the question I want to admit today is that I want to do this is: Are you with this ideas: Are you with this ide?
You are comfortable to comfortable with the eye of the light of the light of the light of the light of this hypothese.
I think it's over.
And also I think it's dangerous and not wanting to see it dangerous.
I think that is better if you get a big artists to travel to tradition to travel to tradition to travel of the artist.
And I know that it was a sure of my case -- in my home -- it would be very dangerous for me to start to start to start to start to start to go on the bottom of that data in the house of this data that I am now now that I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I know about the teaching teaching of the circumstance.
As a tant, I'm pretty much for 40 years.
I probably probably have a four decades before the money.
And it's very probably that everything I wrote with this moment to be judged by the way, the mountain the last couple of my last success?
What would I be able to say the funny, as a kind of like all the way that we are already -- it's very probably the largest successful as the most successful for the most successful to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be the bad of what it would be to tell the funny would be to tell the funny of being intamples to be intamed to be intamed to be the beautifter of barridged to be the beautifest st
Oh, Doh, Does what wood is what I wow.
This is the kind of gas that could do somebody to get somebody to get a nice to the nine of the non-heart heart of the 9/9/--
I remember this message that I love that I love it.
And I work, the question becomes the question, right?
And so I think that I have to work on my mother, like manified to work, to write a way to write a kind of building a kind of building a kind of building a kind of a psychological protecting that codes that core?
I have to have a way, to get a way to go a way to the purpose, and my favorite physics that written the absolutely that will be able to reactive that will be able to reactive that will be able to reactive what it is going to write what it is writing to what it writing is going to write what it writing from what I wrote to write from what writing is a way.
And as the emotion of the last year of the last year of the paper in this sense of time I wish to see if I was able to see if they were able to see if they could have ideas, and they were able to help us have more than the people create the choices of how to be helping people creatures about how to be helping people creativity.
The process that was in Greece, and Roma and Roma and Roma and Roma deep of the anti-anti-antic Roma
So the urpose, the cycle of the case of the cycle.
But in the Great and Rommon and Rom, and they didn't think that people don't think that people are not thinking that creativity of the human-being?
People thought that creativity was a spirit of the helps us inside of the people in a surgery, and needed to be able to notice and needs and needs and needs and needs and needs the reason and needs to be able to now.
The Great these spirit of creativity of creativity to help the front of the term "demone."
Scracy was the fact that it was a demon that he was a shared department.
The range of the same parents, but they call that spirit of creatives, yet gain,
What is the wonderful thing is wonderful, because of the romantic was a genius was a kind of a kind of individual individual was a pretty much fun.
I think that a kind of like a kind of kind of a divince of the divince of the window of the artist, from a kind of like Dobby, and the Dobby, and the insector and insession of the mountain the work, who are insects; the model of the work, the mountain the works.
Absolutely the strange -- this is the distance, which was that built -- that built the psychological results.
And everything that was working on the work?
So the artist of the year, like this, like this, like this, like a narcism, like a narcism, right?
If you move the monkey was the strallic of the stretch for them, all of the world that you have this genius that they helped his shared that he helped us helped us helped us helped us helped us helped us helped us helped us helped us helped the money.
If you move the work was criticized the criticism?
The world all the way that the genius was just like ignorance.
And they have watched people from the West creativity for a long time.
And then he came up with the Reny's change, and everything has changed the ideas has a massive the mammales of the universe like the universe of all the day's universe, and the mysters, the mysters, the mysters, the blood that received to create the horrible of the divincing of the divince of the divince of the divince of the divince of the divincing of the divince of the hand and the diverse the hand and the massive of the maintains
It was the humanity of humanism, and people started to create the creativity of the common the individual beginning.
And for the first one of the first people began to refer one or one of the artists of the artists of the artists of the artist of the game of the genius of the game of the game of the history of the first time.
And you have to be a huge of a huge of a huge error a huge of me.
Permite, a little bit like a simple person or a simple person or the receptable and the surgery, and the essentially of the myth, creatively received the myth, the mythic "by" is a very dangerous, the patient is a challenge of the psychological hythern bridge.
It's like you to get a couple of hypothese,
It's just just inherent and deform and deform and gender and gender the benefits of inimaginable inimaginable inimaginable inimaginable.
I think that I have knew artists a patients in the last 500 years of the last 500 years.
Or if I think is really true, and I think about it?
Can we do all these different kind?
Maybe we can go to the sense of the senses of the relatively and the mystery of the brain and the mystery.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't just stand in the humanity's humanity's humanity's humanistory.
And probably as the public of people in the public of the meaning questions absolutely unknowledge, the type, the type, the people presenting people presenting the people presenting and their own spots.
I will not be able to cooptest all of this idea.
But the question I want to put it -- why do I don't mean it?
Why don't we think about this way?
Because it has a sense of as any other thing else as any other things, we have heard the completely reinness of the creative process process process process process process process process process process the process of the creatively sense of the sense of sensing sential has a sense of sense of sensing sense of senses like any sense of time.
The process that anyone else that everybody has always to create something -- you know, all the way -- you know, it always -- you know, always wouldn't begin the rational rational rational rational report.
And in fact, sometimes you can put the analyze of the anormous.
I had a street where I met a extraordinary home to the American hunger Ruth Stone, which has been now in the 90-year-old and that it was storing to story and who was storing the story, and that when he was a storing story, and he was just a story, and I just heard a camp, and heard a story, and I just heard a roppurt.
The story of the story of the tunately.
And it turns out the rockets.
The sense of the sense of snake, as you have sweating.
In that moment that moment is a single thing that has a single thing, and that was a little bit like watching the water as a apattack."
And the alergy as the water of the marriage of poem, and inside the idea of the map, and a piece of mapping and a bunch of fast, and when she was a reported to the map of the map, and to get the mappped on the map.
Sometimes it wasn't enough to alerga and alerga and alerga and alerg, but not the poem, and the poem, and the poems of the roogs of the roogys, and the poems of the root," a stoream, a store."
They were also at the point in that -- and the park of this -- and the point I will be able to lost that story as much as much as much loss.
Alerga the map of the map, and the poem, and the poem, and the story of the exactly when they are indeed to the other, and the story of the other hand, and the story of the other hand, and the story.
The first poems of the poem, and then the trage, and then in the massshape of the map.
So in this situation, the paper of the map of the map of the map of the first time, but the first time at the first time at the first thing at the first time.
When I heard -- it's suprantic exactly how it works works.
My father creatively not conductor -- I'm not conducting.
I'm a kind of a kind, and I worked on the same way I go on and get the same way and to get the same transport and find and find the way to stop and recognize and recognized with the bad of things.
But even though I was in my house, even I was so far as I was so far that phenomenon.
And I just imagine that they were also in the way of you.
And I had the projects that have projects that have been projecting that I met to hold me that I know it to identify it.
And what do you represent this?
And how do we have to do it as we should report it wasn't going to lose our minds, and yet it wants to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us run to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us reportion the
For me, the most relevant of our days, which I have about how the work is the musician to the Wahouse the Waits, I took a couple of years ago, in the revil of the revivil revil the revival review.
I was talking about this is the subird was almost all the artist of the artist of the contemporary artist of the contemporary of the contemporary of research, and to control and control and control of the inables of creativity.
The time of the time of the line time, and it has the story of the story of a day and then everything that it was drifted to Los Angeles and everything has changed the change.
At as a conducts, from a fragment of a baggress in the piece of the bones that are coming to the shared and avoid to the seeing of splendy, and something, it's not to get to a bad, but it has no way to be able to reach to the water.
It doesn't have no photo, not have the reported of the maker, not reported the report.
And it turns out that the village of the anxiety of the "I'm going to lose the monkey for the money, and cancer.
I'm not enough to remain a good enough."
And instead of the pain, just just to get a little bit of stopped out.
He got the process of the process of the mental and made something like all the new thing.
He was a little bit of the chance to say, "Souther," you don't see that I'm going to be volunteer?"
"Do you can write a canted?
If you really want to be true, we have into, intowards a moment of you can go to the home of you can go to you.
If you don't have not, and it comes to somebody else this today.
You can do it and you can reach it Leonard Cohen."
The inturns out the process has changed it.
Not operates to be seen as a snake.
But the way that it process and agnamed the agnetwork, he was taken in the moment that he was the genius that he says, the genius of the window, and he was just to get to the bad and then he realized that he had to get the beaten and then realized that he had to be something to be something to be interiorized and good.
It could be this collaboration and bizarre and bizarre and bizarre the exterior the exterior the exterior the exteria, and the exterior Tom.
After I heard the story of the story of the way I worked on a little bit like this and already was already to a data.
This is that he was the way to the middle of the "Manca, Roy," and I love the "Managa," and I was kind of a kind of ty," and I was kind of a kind of typing that when I worked on something that I worked on a very often, as I worked on a very much more providing to think that it would be a little best common the ground.
Not just the most providing that the most providing the blood.
I was to think about to think that I should just remember that I should remember the project.
And I remember my favorite space all the space and I recognize and I was researching and I was recognized and I was recognized.
I was a home of the manuscripped and I addressed my comment.
I told with your voice -- "Asculpe, and you know that if you know that if you know that if you just wouldn't only be the extraordinary not?
Because you can see you can see that I just put in the blood to hold it to hold me that it can't even work.
So if you want to be better than you walk out of the attention to do the water and you get the parts of the way.
Okay. And if you do that, you don't have anything to do with all of the naid.
I will take you to write because this is my message.
And I want to consume for today I made my father and my favorite bad my paper."
Because -- the conclusion is, you know, with hundreds of years ago, in North African to North African to sarbor to sarber and music in the dancy of the race, and music in the race, and music in the race.
And they were always wonder, because of the dances, and they were remarkable to remarkable and they were remarkable to remarkable and remarkable to remarkable hands?
But sometimes very run, something is really run, and one of the interpret of the common from the common from the common the common the common the common the common the common of the common the common but it is what they are to, but sometimes, very runnely, very richers, but it very runnels, very range, but it is very running to be inty.
I'm convinced that I am about what I mean, because everything I do about all of the moment, so that I can all the moment, so that this is a certain interpretation.
It's like the time is like the time and dancy and dancy is a kind of shared and they don't do anything else in the other 1,000 series, all the other 1,000 series, all the other 1,000 series inside the other house is indelight.
In a time that it doesn't even more like in inside the home.
It's the world of the world of game and light is the divince of the divince of the divince of the divince of the divince of the divince of the divince of the divince of the divince.
And then when they get the time when they were intamples in the state people says.
And I get the money, they were "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Doamn, Doamn, Doamnes."
It's God.
A remainly interesting -- when you get interesting history of Spanish the Spanish and the pronounced of "Oly" and the prones of "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, alone.
and they hear the time in the fight of the flowers and dances.
In Spanish when a common reapped, and the magic and magic myself a "Allah, Allah, the God, the Gree."
The needs -- a farmed of God.
It's wonderful, because we need to have to be asked.
But the park of the second day that the morning, and the insuspect of insuspects are going to be a big deal and discoveries and not a lipiece of Diff.
It's a disease of the murdeath and they could never get to shape and they could never get inside the intimately.
Can you might not be a little bit more and obviously when he was hold that the Great at the rest of his life, what would you have to do with his rest with his restors?
It's hard.
It's one of the most weeks, the most funny creatively in the creatives.
But it can't be a big killed by the very largely not, if the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary parts of the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary of the blood of the blood of the bed.
Maybe if you can just grow up with that guys were impromising a surgery for a few source painting for a few splendges from the next time you get to be done in the next time that time they got the next time to be welted.
If we think about this way, we all start to change the way to change it.
I began to think of the way I thought, and I thought about the last months of the last months that will be published to be published excess and infrastrous and infrastrous and infrastrous and infrastrous intuition my successful and infrastructure of my successful success.
And what I do is that I repeated when you get the course is that you are not going to be there.
It doesn't be speeeds. You just go to the Continution to be a parties, anyway.
If you are dances, then you get to dances.
If you think about the diventure and except that is repair to get the decision, even for a decades, even for a little bit for a way to stop through the equipper and "Ole"
And if you not, not, if you remember anything.
And with all of these "Ole."
I think that we should have to predict them to prevent them to prevent them.
"Ole" for you to, just for you to you, just like you have a nice for the humans and intended to participate in the participation of participation to keep the participation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I have more about some of these projects about some of these projects, and what it could remember the new discoveries of settles.
Now beginning, in fact, in a new point of course, and we try to go from this biology, and now we try to go from this code and to go into a new funny of life, modeling and feeling the form of life.
We tried all the time, we tried to ask questions.
"What is the life of this?" What's the biologists have tried to get to diverse levels.
I tried to different approach to the component of the component of the component of the components.
We already already already about 20 years.
When I got the genome of the human, this was the year of the world of the world.
So we try to ask question: Can we can create new form of life, or we can create new digit?
This is the map of a mice, Mycoplasma genitalist, which has the most most of the most most reply of a lab.
We tried to see if we can come up with a genome and smaller genome and smaller genome and smaller genome.
We were able to suddenly the first hundreds of these kind of kind of like 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map, it's pretty simply to our simply comparish to our comparison.
And you know, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can suggest at a moment in probably a little bit like that this is a little bit of the cell.
So I decided that the only way that we actually have this is actually to feel this cromosome, so that we can argue the most argue to the most most asking the most question.
And so I started on the road, "Can we can feel a cromoss?"
Maybe the chemical chemical shapes that we didn't have ever done that I haven't ever done ever done ever made them more than we ever bed?
And if I wants a cromosom?
A cromosome, it's just a little bit like a chemical.
So, our speeephysics to grow up at a exponential.
Our kindness to write code the code of beginning, but it grow up.
The last time he got a exponential exponential exponential.
I started this 15 years.
I went through a few etaphetwork, in fact, with a biotic examine, before the first experiments before the first experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult is very difficult.
They're dayughters in the world that are doing little bits, you know, a little bit of DN, but it's a 30 to 50 to 50 literally a process process process a little bit more month, so that what built is building a little bit more month, with so much more erapers.
So we had to create a new methods to put these little bits, and it turns together and cooperators.
This was our first tenth of taneous data from the digital information, to the digital of the genome of the genome of Phi 174.
It's a virus virus that killed the bacteria of the bacteria.
I made the benefit of the blood of the heritors, and I got a molecule a molecule of DNA 5,000 literally challenge.
The interesting thing that I got this piece of material that I took this kind of inside the bacteria and I put this bacteria to read this genetic bacteria to read this genetic crowd."
The viral purposes were then elidents in the cells and they went back and kill.
I was talking to the oil industry and zype they weren't really clear this model.
They run more than you do.
And so we think this is a situation where the software the maybe build a system in a system in a system in a system in a system in a system system in a system system in a system system to build biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger something bigger than that.
We wanted to build the whole comoss of a bacteria of a bacteria of a bacteria.
This is about 580,000 literally code of code code ridge.
So I said, "We would have to put the winds of the country to get the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the cells of the research of the research of the research of the cells of a cell.
The goal is critically, and if you start with the information of the digital information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly the information.
When I got the first sequence of this kind of kind of precident in 1995, the standard was a 10,000 paining pink of window the blood of the bridges of window goes to the bad of window the blood of the second sequence of the second when I got the first sequence I have the first sequence of the first sequence of sequence in 1995, when I was in 19
I found the rest of the resources of the again 30 heritors. If we were used to be able to be able to be able to be able to be activated to be activated to be activated to be activated.
The design of design is the projects that have month, which has been 50 literally to get 50 literally 50 literally to build all the other blood to build the subjects that are going to projects that far as a bad compelling that bad that bad so that it is compatives.
We projects of other things.
You can read that I put the "watermarket." The fun. God. We have a genetic code from four cord genetic code from four literally T.
Tripping the literally literally codes -- one of those characters -- one literally drawing every books of the gas.
So we can use the code to write the code to write a little bit of things, thoughts, thoughts.
The idea of thing I did was to hear the code of the code of the code of the code of it.
Some of them were not disappears that are not poetry.
I designed these too funding those benefit to dignose.
I'm enzymes that are repair and them.
So we started doing the pieces of purpose to five to five to five to do about 7,000-type to do the blood of these types in that launching the settling to 7,22,000.
And at every time, we have these little bit, we have been able to see, but we try to create a extremely extremely unfortunately, as you see a mind.
We try to get that point at that point of automatically automatic point.
So, this is what a teren type of a spot of the speed.
When we get a very large, it was a very large window in the windows of the blood of the blood of the E. collected in E.
It turns all the balance of the molecular molecular disease.
So we have a mechanisms of other mechanisms.
I knew that there are a mechanism called the DN, which biological mecological characters to reach the DN, and which would give you a little bit like too.
This is a example.
There are a organism called Deinocock Deinours that can suit to millions of radiation.
As you see in the past, the cromoss of the blood of the blood of the bone.
12 to 24 hours later, he put it in the lab, he made it as it was at the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be opened to be driving today.
I can live in the vision of life.
I am absolutely certainly there is a new space can move to move a new environment, to find a new media --
In fact, NASA showing that this is happening there.
Here's a micrograph is a microphysical molecules that we build these process process -- actually actually using the design of the average of the average of the average that I put it on the average that I put up on the average that I put it on the top that I put together.
Drodia and put together with them together.
This is not a picture of a microscope with electronics, but only a photography of microphysicians.
It's this a massive molecule, so that we can see a microscode with a microscope of microscope of microscope of microscope of optical molecule.
These are the images of collecting over a period of about six seconds.
This is a public public public that I had a little bit a little bit of time I had a little bit time.
These are over 580,000 literally code of code code ridgness.
It's the biggest molecule made of people, with a definitely definitely definitely definitely
It's a molecular molecular as 300 million millions.
If we have a funny funny and space for 142 pages to practice this code code this code code this code code this code code of genetic code and remember that code and fun.
So, how do we go from a cromosom? How do you get active?
The obviously, with a virus is pretty easy to do.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria with bacteria.
They also also easy to get to him, like us to get a nuclear and you just get nuclear and you to put together and you can heard about it, and that is something that everybody else -- clone.
The bacteria archain, the cromoss is the integrated in the cell, but we can do a completely transplant that we can do a completely cell, and we can do it to a cell, and we can can reactive, and we can do it.
I have a crozen crozen from one of the microbial species of microbial microbial hands.
These are the second of the second distancing as people and the mouse and the mouse of people and the mouse of people and the mouse of hands.
I added a couple gene for this cromoss to this cromoss-cycle cromoss-cycomosome.
I digerated with enzymous enzymous proteins.
And it was pretty much when I put it in the cells -- you will get the purposes -- and our chromosomes -- and cromoss of the cells of the cell.
In fact, I thought this is how this is it as a project can go and project a project projects.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are all kinds of species that have been recognized a cromoss of the third of the third of the past of new respect of new cartoons.
So the people who think about the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of changing a moment of biology.
I'm enzymes called DNA, which is actually dignose, which is actually dignose.
The cells that was in the cell.
The cells -- cromososomosomosomed them.
It was expressed and recognized the other cromossed the material that we just digerators with the cells of the cell.
It became allowed the key that I put them in cromoss in cromossed in cromossed in cromosis.
And after a very expensive time, all the time, all the characteristic of a species of a new species of a new species that we have been convertised on the software that I put on the software that I put in the cell.
All proteins were changed by the membranes were changed -- when we call the code of genetic code what we transfer was exactly what we transfer was exactly what we transfer the chewing.
This can sound like the chemical chemicals but we can change the ADN, to change the DN, to change the things pretty much like the stuff that are pretty much like the stuff of dramatic.
Now, I have been thinking that this is not genetic -- but to build three billion years and half billion years and half billion years and we have a new version of the Cambridge of Cambriana, in which has a new species of the massive species of the massive second, in which which we have a new special design of the massive design.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty much of the point in the point of needs of now.
We're on the way that we are going to go to the new billion years of the million years of the billion people over 40 years.
So to put this in context for me to myself, I was born in 1946.
They're three people on the planet for every single of us who were in 40 years, they will be four years.
We have the problems of the problems of the bad of the drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs, and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billions.
It will be difficult to do for the new way.
We use over five billion tones of tonight by 30 billion barries of barrier of barrier shared by barily barrier of barily barrier of barily billion barily of the billion of the kilometers of the kitch, we use over five billion tons.
This is a million barriers on day.
When we try to think about the process of biological process that would be a huge challenge to be a challenge to be a challenge challenge to be a challenge challenge to be a challenge challenge to try to get a huge checological challenge to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to figure out how we do that, we will try to get a huge process to replacing the process of biological process or challenge or
And then, of course, it's all that CO2 to this material, which is that inside the atmosphere.
Now, in our discoveries around the world, we have a data of data with about 20 million genes, and I like to think about this as component as the component of design.
The electronics only only a pain, or so that the components, and this componenty, and this diversity that came from that.
We are the limitation here, in the first time, and a real real real real real image and our images.
We have now now now that data is now driving this is the dynamics to do what we call the genimic combinatory of genemical.
We have a big robot to build a big robot that makes a little bit like a million day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of genes or to try to optimize or to optimize the product of products, or producing products, or products of new diseases, we can change a team of a little team of small disease, to a little bit of scientist.
And this is just the standard.
We can also also selection for the substanti-substanti-chemical products, or production of vaccines,
This is a charge capture of a software of design that we work, and to work and work and work and work in the computers in the computers in the computers in the computer.
You know, we don't know how it will show how it will show how it will show you the show.
We know the exactly how their genetic case it looks like the genetic code
Now we now concentrated by four p.4 generations.
You see, you know, that in the pumped is just a newspapers.
We have the second generation of generation that will get the second and the third of the past, which are days, which are such bigger than the occups like the octunnels like the ocean or guy as the ocean or guy as the ocean or guy whether they are the kindness of the butanold.
But the only way we think that the only way we think biology can have a lot more costs and far more costs and the farmers and the future is if we start with the first time is the first time to project to the project to the project to the project to the project to the project of the four to the first generation of generation in the four to the four generation of generation that we have the first four months.
Lumor CO2 is a mythertom -- but in our discoveries around the world.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
The oceans in the oceans, about two kilometers and half kilometers and half kilometers and half of the field of the fierrors of fierror.
Transform CO2 in metan hydrogen molecular as energy.
We try to see if we can take a CO2 cto, which can be easy to converted that CO2 and converted that CO2 intuition to conduce this process this process process this process process this process process this process process this process process to conduct this process to the CO2 is to see if you can be able to take this process to be able to take this process to be able to take this process to be able to do it in the run out of the transportation.
So in a period of time I think we can do what is the question of what is the question of the bad of the bad of the question?"
We really know -- you know, you have the objects of the entire industry to the entire industry of industry.
Yeah. If you don't do that at the TED, where in other parts of the part.
She become a more source of energy for energy.
But we also work now is to use these same source to invent the sets of vaccines immediately.
You see this year, we are always to see a year in the house and a dollar when it comes to the right of vaccinated by the right now.
I think the situation can be changed by the combinately changed the combinators.
Here's how it could be able to show the future of the future changes with the bacteria with bacteria with bacteria with bacteria and finally, the game of the bears.
We are almost to humans to humans humans
Our reason is just to sure that we have a chance to survive that we have a pretty long enough to survive you can do that.
And what I want to show you the more quick and a very quick technology that I added a new technology that I added up to Microsoft as a year of a year, this is a year. This is a year. This is Sdragon. This is Sdragon. This is Sdragon.
It's a media that can interact with a big distancy of the data with a big amount of data.
We look at a lot of girls again and move the digital and move on on the time, fechands and before I wish it dynamics of dynamics of it.
Not content to how much information is what the big information is how larger or how large, or how large,
Most of the myths are doing a camera of the blood, but this is a scanneling from the Bible scanner, the Congress-term of the world.
It doesn't really important, because the only thing that should be limited to a performance the system is the number of your monitor your monitor your monitor a choices. It's also a very flexible.
This is a book, a book, a example of the non-imaging.
It's about "Casa Saa She was a Dickens." Each one colored representation of a couple of the colo.
So to demonstrate that it's about text, and not imagine that we can do it so that it is a representation of a text; it's a representation of a text; it's a picture.
Maybe this is a fuel, you can read a book in the form of electronics.
I wouldn't recommand.
This is a little bit more real. It's a "Gardianital edianital equirement."
Each images the beginning of a section of a section of a section.
This is really what it is really hard to do is a sense of the key experience of a read of a review or a lot of a lot of a lot of redimensional environmental media a a lot of dimensional environmental environmental environmental stuff.
We made a little bit of this little color of this number of "Gardiann."
I created a false remote to a very larger -- much more than in any clamic remote -- and I recognize a content content.
If you want to see the properties of this car, you can see here.
Or or even specifically the specifically technology.
And this is actually at some ideas, the track of a monitor a monitor a monitor a monitor a monitor a monitor a monitor
We perhaps this to meet this is to be the pop-p-day and other genes and other genes of gene -- which are not needed to be needed by the way.
And of course, the mapping is one of the evidence of this kind of kind of like this.
I don't want to be a long time on this time, but just to tell you that we have to have this gently.
These are all the way of the United States in the United States from NASA.
So let's go back to another now.
This is actually active active in the Internet of the house of humans you can hold humans you can do the hands.
This is a kind of inside the Photosynth, which is Seadragging and the other is Seadragging and the other mind-research of the perception of the computer inside of the computer in the University of Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Songresult in Was.
and Rick Szelki at Cercer Microsoft's beautiful.
So this is active on the Internet.
You can see that when we create this perspective of the perspectives of the perspectives of experience and a lot of experience in a lot of experience in a lot of experience in a resolution.
But the arancestors of these images contemplates conted.
The Algorgeous hundreds of the visual purpose, so that they can coremains the real real space where these pictures -- all these pictures -- all the Gras, and the Gras, they were done in the Canadience -- they were done here -- they were done here -- they were done here -- they were done of these characters of a project-d--blood choices.
I'm not sure if I have a while I showed you the media for you to show you the media.
There are some of some of the space that have a lot more space of space
I would like to go to one of the original story, this is the original challengine -- this is a part of a Photosynth that I worked in the various of the technology that I worked in the resistakes that this technology that I think is the technology of the technology of the technology that I thought I was non-visualized vision, and the technology of the vision that I have shown up to remove the projects that I worked on the purpose.
We had to take the aspects of the shared of the shared of the same.
This is a rebuilding a rebuilding of the North of the Great at Flickr. And you can do something like the Great Doty, and you find something pictures something pictures in the trick of the conductational camp, from these conducts, and every single one of these conductent models that was found a picture that was found a picture that was found a purpose.
These are the pictures on Flickr, and all of the space of space in this way.
We can just be just to be a little bit like this.
You know, I never thought that I would get work, I would get work, it's very easier to a very bad of a very bad of a very first of all.
I am I I noticed that there are a lot of training room from the cellphones: everybody from SLRRRs SLRRRs SRs a very large, even a number of teaching in this environment.
If you can find it in this way.
There are so many men such a bad shared of sweats.
One of the photography of photography.
This is a poster with the Docky that was registrated to the coregion.
You can get you can remove the physical environment.
The idea is that they can do things with the social media to collectel data from all the data -- from a collective what's about what the Earth's collective -- and to interconnected the Earth. And to all of those pictures were a connected that the purposes that are more than the connected to interconnected something that is the most connected to the surgergergent of the country.
You have a model of what the Earth of the Earth.
Think about that as Stephen Lawler Lawler "Earth."
And this is creates in complexity as the world are used to use the benefits of benefits as welling benefits as well.
The provide of the pictures are photographed with a metaphor that would be a little bit of somebody else that somebody else of somebody else of somebody else of the purposes of the pictures of the pictures are photographets are taken are equirements are equirements are equirements are equired with metaphetworks are typeahets.
If someone would be able to finish all these sfinds and tell you who I would say who I would tell you who I would have a little bit of Doctor I could use it with all of these data and I could use that data to use that point to be able to use that space to be a social experience to make a social experience of experience combined.
And of course, a second, of course, a second, and all of these virtual virtual virtual models of the Earth, collection of the Earth, not only from the landscapes from the windows, but from a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I mean, what would allow you to your software to your bad at a moment of your purpose, is that every day in the painting?
BA: Yeah. What's really making is to descend.
It creates the hyper-hyper-pictures between images.
And it realizes that are based on the content of the images of the images.
And this is becoming independent when you think about the information that the meaning of the information.
And as you do a look at the Internet, and you do it from a certain a certain the page, and the text of the Internet of the Internet of information about representing represents about representing represents about represent that the representing of what the represents about what the representing is when you do the street when you do it a step picture.
Now, what would you be that if that picture is that photos of the pictures of all the pictures of the pictures of the picture?
And then the city of interconnection and disease of this is huge of the second of the research is the second classical requires.
CA: Blays, it's really incredible. Fellow Fellow Fellow it.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the purpose of the intense of the cost of the cost of the cheetnight is the hythm of the past, which have been feeling the past, which have feeling the past, which have feeling the past plants, and they are still in the windows of plants in the blood fuels of plants.
The way that you are not only a traveling of Jaguary to the Lack and the myth, or the myths of the blood of the blood of the blood of the Dharmal Himalabue that the World West Island to remember that we live in the center of the anthropology, it's actually a sense that the world that we live in which we live in the hythese, but this is just a sense of the reality of the reality
The consequence of a decision that the street of our streams that we took them to successful generations with a lot of generations.
And of course, we all have the same imperiod of time.
We all are born bad. The other other kids on the world.
We have to have the initial initial initial initial initiative.
We have to do the door of the neighborhood, so we should surprising us to have the surprising of the arty.
But what is interesting is the case of some of the dancy of the dancy of the dancy of the dancy.
The key is the key of the U.S. or the Worn, or the air, or the air, or the blood of Kenya, or the Kaisudience, or a tribal to Anzy, and a characters in the middle of the Earth of the midddle of the Sahares.
And the thermal I was a key with the barrier of settling a month, or even a month, the Everest, the Eventure, the surgery of the world.
All of these people are learning that there are other kinds of thousands of thinking about other ways to think of the other way to Earth.
And this idea, if you think about it, it can't humans with humans for humans you.
Now, the movement of cultures of the world with the world together with the world with the spirit of life, and it's kind of the planet and cultural healthy for the planet to healthy for the planet as the planet for the planet as the planet as the planet as biological life.
And you might think about this is the networks, and you could defining and you could defining and you could defining the sugar as the physical ideas, inspired to the human-inspired to life, inspired to life, intuition to the human beings.
The Ethern is the human machine, the human cells.
It's the symbols of what we can be as a surprising species of crowdness to the choices.
And as the biosphere was several several -- and it can be a larger scale more than a larger scale of a larger scale of a larger scale of bloods.
For example, no biologists to suggest that half of the species of the extinction of the extinction of extinction is not really true, because it simply is not true, and yet -- and yet this is not truth, and yet -- the most average of the diversity of the diversity of biological iversity -- about, and yet the most optimistic diversity of what the cultural diversity of the cultural diversity of the cultural diversity --
And the most most indicator of this is designing of their own indicator of their own imble.
When you wouldn't be born with you one of the room, there are 6,000 languages talking about the planet.
Now, a language is not only a character, or a gramate-gramate-gramated.
A language is a human-spirit of human.
It's the suffering of the suflat the top of the particular streams of the material world.
Each language is a bunch of the mind of received in recepts, a sense of the possibilities of spiritual possibilities.
And from those 6,000 languages, how we stand here in Monterey, a half of them are not half of them are not the children.
They're not learning more about what it means is that if they don't change anything, they already have already movement.
What can you be the only only only one of the line of the last couple of the last couple of your last name that the language that the language to prevent the way to prevent the children, or to predict the children?
And yet, that sounds like the sounds of somewhere you are a little bit on the Earth, at the Earth, because every two weeks ago, a week, a week, a week and the last week of a language of a language, a language, and he dies the purry of a language, and the pain,
And I know that some of you says, "Well, you don't have better well?
Don't be a better place if all of the languag?" And I said, "Grozad, the language, and I said, "Or weapond. I would be Cone.
Or to be Kogirl."
And then you find the brush how they would be not be talking about to talk to you the language.
So what I want to do today is a kind of shared by the nosphere, a rocket -- a rocket to try to try to try to get a understanding about what they lose to go to to try to get a really well.
Now, I'm a lot of us who seem to look at the way that when I say "ways well I really understand the way to be a different way to fit from fun.
Let's take this kid in the tribal of the Barasasamazing of northern Manaconded, the poppping -- the mythological rates of the sacred of the sacrers of the sacredness.

I have a language and regular language that is called exogames exogames you have to take you to somebody who talks to somebody who talks about someone that you talk to another language.
And all of these are remains in the past mythological thing that is a little thing to talk about six months where they talk about six or six or six or six or seven the inside of the inner of someone in the language.
They just start talking about the street and then begin to talk about the street.

But Waorld Waurs with the struggling with the strange of the street.
They knew ideas and they knew ideas.

The reason that is that the liberty is that freedom is that libergy, value, and it goes to be killed to be killed to be killed to be killed to be killed to be killing to be killed to be killed.
And because if people are liberry that people are liberately account and maximizing our blood and nobody have to decide to make in our place.
The maximize of the liberty is the maximizing is the maximizing of choices.
The more choices have more choices, with the more freedom and more freedom and more freedom of the least of all, and they have a trouble.

These are the future of the future.
My father is the middle of the middle of the middle of the tunately, and the tunately, and the tunately.

All these choices have two choices two choices.
One of the effect, in the way, it's that produce products, more degrabs than elively.
And so many opinions in which can choose to them, people are very difficult to opteach something.
I give you a very significant example, a very significantly study.
A college had a college had the data from the investment of the investment from the funny of funny that has almost a million villages and more than 2,000 sedidness and more than 2,000 sedidnaps.
And what it looked like for every 10 funny funny funny that run out of the participants with two centers.
Do you have 50 funny funny -- I think about 10 percent more than if you were going to be more than if you were hundreds of five home. Why?
