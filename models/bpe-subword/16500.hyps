And the third I arrived these two degrees to demonstrate the best of the best of the blood of the most most of the most most of the most three million years of the world's a very dimensional state of the future of the future of the future.
But this is the series of this problem because the problem because it doesn't argue the baby of the baby.
The police of the police of a window, the immediately system.
She was exciting the window and they can run the window of the variety.
The second diamazing that you will be a little bit of the faster will be a faster on the last 25 years.
Ghholding the machine is the big challenge.
So how do you see extremely excited the blood of the inch.
This is the lady of the year.
And it turns out the window.
The number of the blood funny of the five or more than five years or more than the smile, or you can see the shadown.
In 25 years ago,
This is a problem because the characters of the measure of the past of the ocean.
where it is a little bit of the massive of books as a little bit of finger finger in the metal metal metal meters.
The police of policy has the blood of the global incomputer involved in the atmosphere, if we could take this extremely the extreme.
The one one in a couple of the Caska metal metal effect of the effect is at the water is at the water.
The Walkey Walkey Walker from the University of the hypothesis a little bit of a little bit of a square a little bit of the mythern myself in the third myself in the past.

First of 40 percent of the world's population in the water of these little book.
And in order to watch the water is the paintable.
The bottom has created it.
But when it comes up with the water and the water and the water and the water.
In California was a 40 percent of the future of the fish.
This is the fingering on the water.
And the predictable, the blood, they're seriously read things.
The global world is all the global warming to a creature's reduce of the disease.
And the fascinating all the global world's movement has been able to a very extraordinary and the flies.
Ffour times more than the last 30 years of the 75 years.
This is a absolutely changed.
If you look at the context of the history of what happens to see what happens to see what it is intame.
In the last five years ago, I added the dioxytocin every 24 million hours of the 24 million dollars in every day in every day in the ocean.
The next year to the attention to the Pacific of America, and then the story of the most of the suburban injection of the suburban inject where is a research of the oxygen.
The most most most of the global warming global incomputer despaths of the despiral with the fossil of the fossil of the fossil fuels.
The trolor is a problem is a best problem.
The United States is one of the two of Chinese are the endangerous.
And the process was built that more fabrace.
But we start to see a change.
Here's the last year, the last year, the last year, the resources of the propurban impact of the prophotographics of the properly properly provide
All right, there are a little bit of our politics in our country.
And the industry of the bottom of the wild floor a future of the last year in the last year.
Speco-both board of what is a oximizza.
This image imagine whether you remember it.
In the Cracial Srace, a Tenness, a millions of stering sterores was imprise.
You know, you have the stories.
This is the blood of the war on the South American South American Schronic in the Crace.
One of the bottom of the Crings in the World Crace, was this was this.
Video: Oh, the Great the bottom of the bottom and victims.
He is the abbed in America, here in America, and helping the economy.
The botom, the botom, it became more than what in the past what's going on in what we have in what it is in the whole of what
He is access and addition and the workers and works.
So that's Gore: This is the best of the Virginia.
The best book on the most beautiful of Massy Coop.
Video: Donnesken: I want to be closer to be closer Pelososososososososphered not about what they speak about what they are talking about what they speak on what they speak on what I speak on what I speak on what they speak on what they spend of what they spot.
So he said, "The Ali: So the Climeter for the Climb for the next year of the land.
This is one of the house, a part of it.
Video: The OLorgy OL, we see a very series as a very series for our intate for our intable.
And that's our case of our car is to the blood for the house for the public of public public public speed by the authority that we really argued and complicated the botom.
The fact is the botom, in fact, it's not the mouth.
We think it's like this, and the mountains and my mother.
So it will not be happy for change.
Latattacks.
Video: The government is that you heard a little bit of the house of him.
So you do do a little couple of this case of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of this couple of this is going to do it.
His the arth. My is the game.
But this is the technology of the technology of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of it.
And as good at the bottom is one of the global implications of the global world of the technology of the technology that is all the best of the blood of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the newspapers.
The next thing is to the attention of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the hospital.
The Gore: In the alternatistical farmers will be deal with the economic problems and with the problems of the economic problems.
Video: Narrator: North America, the economy of nationaly, the security of the name.
The intack that all of us all the fuel funding the fuel funding the bottom of the bottom of the measure of the measure of the blood flow of the blood flow of the blood flow of the bone.
But now we have a new solution to the house to the house to the infrastructure.
The economy American American American 2, 100-year-old board for the 100-year-old year.
A funding American American house, and then we do it more than the story of the global story of the global incomputer involved in the global income.

Narrator: The time for the American for the active.
All right, it's a very bad various prover, "If you says, "If you want to go to the only refuged."
If you want to go to the floor, you go to the well.
We need to go to the floor fast.
Thanks very much.
The third of the TED I did a window to LH.
And I recognized a and to get a little bit of how it works on how it works on how it works on the water.
So the aspect of the house that they were here, for the most experiment is the most perhaps that was innovation -- the Siririririrryms -- Ciririririrryms or the Stremystics or the Stremosquital -- the best of the billions of the century -- the second to the universe --
It's extremely the myth.
This is the fish of Geneen.
We have the photographs of these "Bange Bange Bange Bangly."
I work on this thing. It's the name is the name is the ATLLadiameter of 44 meters of 44 meters of 22 meters here in the ATLSTLSTLLSTLLSTLLLSTLLSLSLSTLLLSLSLSTLLATLLSLSLSLLSLLSLLSLLSLLSLSLSSLETLASLLLSLETLASLLS.
On the next 10 sequence I went to the first for the first time for the first time for the first time for the first time.
And this image was looking for ATLLLLASS.
He was a couple of the book in the room.
It's a first image of the first person who was the farmers that computer has the past system, the system of LH, the system of LHS in LHS in LHS in LHS in LHIDS in the HIDS in LHS in LHS in the World LH.
In other words, when I saw that image that the image of the past that water was a little bit of the work, which is a success of the works.
I don't know that the first time that the most most best or whatever it goes on on the Google on the pages and he went on and to the first step and the first book and the first book and the slage.
The fact that I did a culture of culture, the impact of the streets.
After about a very sacred by the paper with the water -- the whole thing -- these are the deal with these -- these are these -- these are these -- these are these -- these are these -- these these are these -- these are these farmer.
The blood flies of the bridge of the water of the southers.
Now, the inevition of these are looking at these and says, "Not the machine myself, I can't be the myself."
But I can do that when I'm going to do the future because, it became the story of what happens to the conductor.
So so on 27, the future of the statistics of the story, the other people can transmit can transmit to the bridge of the horrible and the mouth.
At one of the bottom of the 19C, was a BC, was a was a fabrical.
So the computer has the bad wood of thousands of thousands of the research.
This was the result.
That's more predictable to do the doctors like the next 20 percent of the 20 percent of the 20 percent of the 20 percent of the top of the 30 percent of the time.
So we determined to the next 50 percent.
We had to get them to the blood and looks like this.
I recontent on on the top of the day.
And now we have intend to the substant.
The land to the swimping the LHS will be as well.
We will go to the new new top, and we wanted to see in the hypothese, and we will go to the concern to the future to the blood to the universe that are the environmental engineering to fly the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, the intelligence of the accidents of recognizing about extremely unintended to the intense and intended to report the extremely receive to report the research to report the research and reject.
I think that the rest of the digm of digital digital as we have a lot of the inside of the African experiments like LH.
I will be the basked as a lot of the British D., Hump, Hump, I think of the D., when the first consumption of the first consumers of the protect of the Mick Faraya, and I said, "Nobed" is the best of our own own own own own machines of our own own own mind of our minds are the best of our minds are not the best of our minds are the beautiful and the best of our minds."
Thank you.
I want to incept with the bottom of the children will remember the children with the hospital.
The measure is the measure and they go to the shape and and to get the slide and make the slide and make the slightly invented and the rest and the rest and the rest and the relationship and the relationship and the relationship and the relationships.
The first is the space, the deep of how we can see a big part of the world convenient of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of the world of invention.
So I would like to research the IT respired by this project of our interaction with our connections -- the improvements -- the presence of Patch, and collaborator the collaborator and collaborator and the collaboratory -- and if we were able to use a computer and a little bit of the blood of the blood and a computer and a computer and a couple of the mouse of the machines of the machines that we can do it in the machine that we have a fosquickly-darpaint of the mouth of the mouth of the machint of the mouthering of the imicking consummeasurviuntisanceiling thing that kind of the myselvarious kind of the mitering thing that kind of machint of machint of the machint of the machiner
So what do we want to do we want to do this?
The question was the same question was the fascinating to research, I call the Sift Sift Siftable.
On the history, a Sift-in-standing of a bridge of a bridge of a bridge.
They can be living in their own terms can perceive the perception of the deep of one of the allethal and a name, and a name.
The most important is that the falpability, so you can just get the games, you can only sliping the water.
And Siff for example, we have instrumental instruments of the digital information of the digital digital information.
The measure of the psychological because, more constantly constantly constantly constantly one of the alternative of the alternative of our hospital and constantly the story-receiving connections.
You start with the south of the exempathy.
This Siff is confidented to predict the image of the include of include in a couple of include in the midddle of the other include in the alaths of the alaxy of the alath.
These are constantly constantly constantly one of the other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other countries are the past of the past of the past of the past of the past of the past of the past of the past of
So, if they were a little bit of the war on the right right right now.
If you get involved in the confusion of the confusion of the confuse.
And I can feel the square and including the including including including including including including invention.
We realized that one of the implications of the implications is like to use the war is like to use the gestablished as we could use the culture of how we can be able to culture how we can be able to culture a little bit of how we live a lich.
In the case of this Siff Sift confidence of your house and use the bottom and use the book.
If we were too much like the window in the air.
There's also possible for education, for education, for education, how it would be gone as well as the language, and they want to have people to want to have people to have people to see things like to have the results of the impact of the impact of the impact of the immediately.
So here I have a Fibonas, which is a simple program.
Here's a game of combining up with the Scrabs and Boston and Bogger and Bogger and Boston and Bogger and Bogger.
The first one is every single day in every Sift was in every Siff in the flies of the flies of the fishing of the force of the future.
And then then push the 10, and you have 30 seconds of detect and a new way of innovation and a possibility of intributes and we possible.
Thank you.
These are the books that have been invented in Lab in Lab and research.
It looks like the good.
And one of the things that are interesting of this kind of applications is that we have to give them a lot of people have to keep people have to keep people.
All right, "For is "For the streets and they stand and they do what to do.
Here's another people are going to get the cancer to the cancer with it.
This is the most standard of our fingering in the right.
It seems like all that I wanted to do it was to do the Siff was the stable.
So for me were just working on the book.
This is a application of animatures.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who instruments.
And that's Felix.
He can go to the choices in the bottom of the Siff Siff the Siff that the baby of the personal of the personal of the art.
Here's the book of the bottom of it.
Video: Spaintings.
David Merry Merry a streets in the bottom of the hospital.
Video: Trace.
Good good. Yeah.
Siff Siff and the aspect of the language, and the one can do -- Videideo: Hello. Ham. Ham.
DM: And I create the narratic narratic recognitions.
Video: Okay.
DM: It's a story of the final story of how it will it be fascinating to the fashion.
Video: You're sich.
DM: The next example I have shown you to look at the speed is a music and interacted and interacted and interacted the light that Sif, and the people who built the Sift that would be able to build the baby and everything that would be the beautiful and bulb and bulb and bulb and bulb and bulb and bridge.
The second of these four different various various statistics, you want to use it.
And you can inject the inject of a successful stage, you can have a little bit of the bottom of the other things.
The shape of the Sift Sift Sift Sift Siff Sift-source shadown.
There's the effect that you can use the light, how it would be the reverse and the movement.
The guy is the case of a couple of include for the air for the air.
The improve effects like the degrees that the flies that are funding House Heve Heve He'd see it.
Video: Your DM: We have in the Sift Sift Sif, a very excitement -- a lot of blood far as a lot of far as a lot of far as a lot of farmers in a lot of farmer.
Now a little bit of it.
Video: Yeah, I added a little bit of the person of him.
Video: And now I'm going to add the bottom of the bottom of the computer story.
Video: Yeah, you can get include include including a part of the include or in a part of there.
Video: Yeah, I will attack for the best for the best for the best for the expression.
Video: I can do the second time to do the second while as a second while
So I don't have to do the planet, I can improve the long-term pushed or the balancy of the window
Now, in the paper, I can stand to the farmers used to use the Siff Siff to the floating fish.
Thank you.
As you see my story, the story is creating the computer that it is the more than the way that they work with the way that it works in our brains and the body.
And yet, I had to show you a little bit of this research of this research of design, and the couple of designers that intribed to the lab.
The Gandling that the window is that we are in the granity's farmers with this instruments of instruments of instruments of the digital digital implications in our world of our world is going to our lives.
Thanks very much.
Aststep, I want to spend up with you all him.
They're written him.
He wrote the book is my hands, but it's more of the attracted to the attack.
It's all my mother, and fascinates and fascinating.
And I don't know that this is what it is happening to us.
But these are the blood was a little bit of the house and the book and the book and the book and the book was my father.
And the way I wrote is that I wrote this book of the "Mancy of "Manca, Roy," Rool, Ibor to the detect to the detect the death of the hands, and became a very important place to a world of myself for the world's streets of the world and became the fact that the streets of the world and that is become a very important sense of the constantly stict.
The case is like the horrible is like the attack of the window that would be condamination.
Series -- conname, conname.
Do you have the expensive and impact is the story is -- you don't have a describes is not the best performance you can see the performan?
You don't have to go to the past to write the best of the best of the best that they would have a little bit of the world to have a little bit of the world that will be able to have the world?"
It's very long the way of training in the trouble.
But it was more than the next time I wouldn't remember the 20 years, when I started to have the big big house -- when I was indeed to be the big -- I want to become a little bit of the same -- I want to become a little bit of the same kind of reaction of reaction of the same kind of reaction of reaction of the same kind of reaction of the same kind of reaction of reaction of the same kind of reaction of reaction of the same reaction of the same kind of the same kind of the same kind of reactissues of the same kind of the same kind of the same kind of the same time.
And they said, "You don't know that you have no one more than they have any of the success?"
I don't like the best of the balance will be able to work on the ideas will be ide?
You don't know the best thing you know, you know, the best of this game and nothing that you have no one will not be able to do and nothing to do and you want to a little bit of the vision of the vision of the vision of the hundred of the cou?"
The gender of genetic genes.
The slide -- the war -- the question of the question is "Yeah, that's "Yeah, no."
Yes, you know, you know, the things are all works.
And always always my standing on my house stop.
And you know, it's just like many other things that people have to be a lot of things that people are not intuitive.
As the bloodark of the bloodark of things that are infrastructure.
But when it's about the worker I was talking about the last question I was working on the last last year?"
Is something els?
It's the blogs to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it was pretty much as they were pretty much as well.
And what is the species of the species of creating the nalists is really excited in the environmental projects of the attention of the attention of the attention that other people don't do a kind of driving that other people don't do a kind of driving that other people don't do a kind of driving in a way of doing a kind of driving that other people are doing a special of what are going to do is in the species of the world is what what you have to do with the species of the species of the initiatives.
My hatta, was the inchance of the machine and not immediately remember the 1940s to the inspiration of the inevent of inerately inspired to be a chemispreamed of inched inchemistry.
It wasn't intamed -- John, how do it with the story of the wind?
It just doesn't intamed it intam.
But let's be the inevitable of the blood as a lot of groups of the second far as the secret of the centuries of the centuries of the oceans to be the oil of the oil of the oil of the fish.
We have the insects of the insances, but not only the artists of all of all the way to be a little bit of the challenges of the power to be powerful powerful to be powerful to be powerful for the ability to be powerful to be powerful for the result.
And all of us is to look at the book is the fishing of the future of 201, in the 20th century in the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the characters and the awareness.
And then the same thing that they didn't have the chance to be true, to be truth.
Norman Mail, even though the last year of the last last year, he said to me that the Within my books a little bit more than me to me a little bit more of my book."
A big big challenges of works.
But it doesn't mack when we hold him, we heard about something that I heard so many things that I heard so many of the things and they were able to accept and complete the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of infinite of the idea of the idea of the beautiful and the massive and the best conductor.
And the question I want to add this stuff here, you know, you all know the other impact with this ideas with this ideas with this ide?
You are comfortable to the force -- because it will be the best -- I don't know the blood -- I don't like this is the blood flow with this story.
I think it's owned.
And it also also I think it's perfectly and not as well as a person in the future of the future of the future.
I think that is better if we involved in the artists of artists to list.
And I stop with my father, in my house -- in the situation for me to me for me to go to me to go to me to me to go to me to independent on this photography of this is the special of this is the detect that I think that I was sportant.
As you are pretty much of the 40, I just just got 10,000 years.
I have to get the four as a little bit of the work of works.
And it's very probably like I wrote with this moment when I was a little bit of the work of the work of the world came up with the last couple of my first research the last last couple of my favorite research, the cottt?
What would would would be the blood of the botom, because the most best of the friends -- it's probably the most important to my father has to be the largest to be able to recovering the most important to him.
Okay, Does --
That's the gene of the genetic that could do somebody elsed to the horrible to the hormous hormous of the person of the person of the person of the person of the person of the person of person.
I refer to do this in the war that I love my hands.
And I asked the question is, right?
And so I put a lot of lots of my mother was a lot of workers, to work on the land to go to the amazing to build a kind of building a building ding?
And in a way, in a way, and I have a democracy to the mind of my mind, the whole that would be the natural of the natural condition that will be driving in the national reaction of what I would like to be in what I would like to do is writing what I would write to what I write to what I would like to what I was going to be the result.
And as I was all the last year, I incepting this sense of the time that I invented the time to research the time to get the society would be able to see the idea that that it could be better ideas that would be the idea of how to be the idea of how to be the idea of how to be the idea of how to be creativity.
Cernically, it was in Greece and Romanco and Romanca.
So the massive research on the window of the charge.
But I mean, and Romedical and Romedical to Romot that creativity, the conventional of the interior the interior the interior the interior of the interior the interior the interior of the interior the interior of the interior of the streets of the Greenood of alling Green. But in my Great Great Great the Great Great Does and my father.
People believe that the creative was a spiral connection that you can get the horrible of people in a lot of people in a define and the ability and understanding and the ability and understanding and our intelligence.
The name is the name of the ground of creativity, the report of the terrorist "demonth."
Social was the impact for that a mythern that has a very smart of the democracy.
They were the same same psychologist, but they call that the spiration,
What is the mind, because the romans, because they don't think that a genies was a genies of the genies of the death of the death of the death of the gap.
The results like a genial way, the advice of the discovering of the past of the artists of the artist, the Dobbakkkinds of house, the Dobbe, and insession and insessentially the chemisphere, the result of the word of the workers, the results of the works.
Absolutely babies -- that's the fantastic that we were built -- that we have the degrees that we need to protect the results of the results of the results of the results of the results of the results of the works.
And everything that I worked on the work?
So the artist of all, the goal of example, as a lot of example, as a lot of example, right?
If you work was the ballo, you can't ask the streets for the world because the world because the world as well that they helped me that the state of the genies that helped me that helped me to get to the stick that helped me that they helped me that they helped me that they helped me that they helped me to be the works.
If I was the criticized was completely completely completely unlike, right?
All the world like genius was the northern was the north.
And they look at the Valley Facebook for a month.
And then he came up with the Ray's change, the idea of the idea of ideas as of ideas as as that the idea that the history as the universe of the universe and the universe and the mystick of the universe, the best and the mystics that are the first disease that they are the first discovering of the first disease that they were going to create the first didark that they were going to be the first discoveries to the first discover.
It was inct of human humanity's as, and people start to create the consumption of the interial of the interial of individual interial of individual with.
And for the first one of the history of the history of the artists of artists like the genetic genes, in fact, in fact,
And you have to have a little bit of the window a hundred of it.
Spected, a very simple simple person, to create the stream, because it is actually the sulpture, and the surface and the extremely received and the four meterneters, the discovery, very much of the measure of the measure of the measure of the mytherapy of the page.
It's like the couple of hospital to the shadow the shadow of hospital hospital.
It just just just the infrastructure and the genes of these tools all these tools of the inspiral inspiration.
I think that the presidential artists on the last 500 years.
And if you think about is true, and I think about the question of what do is this?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we inspiral impact of the relationship of the relationship of the people and the mysteries.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can just just just five years, and it's about 500 years of the humanity's humanity's 18.
And it probably as the audience that would be the question of the question of insight the stinsic of the stinsic of the mythm of the people who are the surprising people and all the people and all the resources and all the rest of their own speed.
You know, I will not want to get all the idea of this idea.
But the question I want to want to be a -- what is you want to do that?
Why do we don't think about this thing?
Because it looks like any of other as any other thing that is heard about what the challenge of the research of the complete of the complete of the product of the creative process of the creative process of the design of the creative process of the creative process of the process of the process of the sense of the sense of the sense of it is like to be the sensitive that it is a sense.
The process that somebody else has to create something -- the streets here -- the story -- the story of the beginning of the beginning.
Now, in fact, you can see, you can describe the definitely definitely defining the degree.
I had a little bit of the next where I knew that I knew the Rutch May Stony Stone, in the Stone, which was in the 90 years and the past of 90 years and my storage and the storage and the storage and the storage and the storage and the storage and the storage and the best and the best and the best and and the best and and the best and the babies and the bridge and the best and the baby and the feeling the bad.
The story was like a various various various window.
And it turns out the room.
The first is the invention, because they are the past farmers of the past painting.
And that moment that is a single thing that is a single thing, and I read the water as well.
And the galgorithms to the best ideas was to go to the idea was to go to a bunch of the idea of a bunch of remarkable to repeat the end of the past to the past to the past and to get the past to the past and to get the past and to get the past and to the past and to the purban to the phase.
Sometimes was the faster as the algergergergergers, but the gergergers, but the couple of house and the case and the palm and the car and the machines and the best and the story of the room, a story of the room, a story, a little story.
They were able to go to the moment that -- and the time -- and the moment that the story that the story that the story that the story.
Algerad, the couple of the photography and the whole world is exactly the exactly the exactly the photography and the story of the already and the story.
The first car is the cost, and then then the bottom of the mass of the mass of the mass of the mass of the mass of the mass of the mass of the mass of the first disease.
And so in the situations of the future of the future and intack of the first time of the first future.
When I heard -- it's the exactly how my own product was exactly how it works on my own product.
My creating the limitation is not the limitations -- I'm not run.
And I'm a way that I worked on the same way I worked on every day at the same time.
But even though it was indeed, I was indeed to be aware towards that flies in that fish.
And I just imagine that they were in a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of you have a lot of you imagine that they were all of you imagine the image of the image of you imagine the image of my image image of image image to imagine the image of the image of image of the image of the image of the image of the image of the
And I had to have the project that I went to a survival that I was stop to go to to to a bad perfectly to be standing on to be standing on it.
And what do you all kind?
And how do it insight to us to get us to the wall to go back to the bars, and the best and and the best and humans to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us to help our sanat?
For example, the most relevant of our days, which is the music that can do is is the music Waite, we took a few years ago, I took a few years ago, and a few years ago.
I was the beautiful of that was almost everything was almost everything that was always to coming the future of the future, what they invented to the conscious and to control these imps and to control these impact and to get these impact of the impact of these impact of the impact of the impact of the complex of the complex of the complex of the complex of the impact of the complete of the improve commit
The time of the language, and the imp, and the impact on the author the Los to Los and all the way to Los and all the way and all the change.
As the time to get a little fragile on a bagging of a little spiral and the air, and the airplan, and a detect and a dependent on the inspired and a despiring and a fossil and a fossia, but as a fatal fish.
It doesn't have no longer hundreds of advances, no report report.
The answer to that the next year that the teacher "I'll be able to be able to be a moment, and cancer for the money for the money for the money for the month.
They're not suffering the bad to reus."
And in fact, you just get to the past to the bad was just a little bit of it.
He recognition and do something like all of the new and do everything.
He was the blood and said, "South said, "South is not the volcancer as are the volum?"
"You know, you can write a cancer like a cancer nature?
If you really want to travel to have inside a moment of the best time I can go to a little bit of him, when I can go to the house of him.
If you will, and the bottom of something.
Let's look at Lewishers."
The deep has changed the ground changed it.
It doesn't have the speed to be detected as well.
But the process of the aggrest around the moment of the moment, the time that has been on the moment that has been on the genies that says, and the genetic and the genetic and the whole and he was just slowly and he would have to go to the story and then he would have to get something that they would have to be something that they would have to be something that they would have to be something like to go to the invention and the inspiracies and the inchance of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the procity of the intensidentity of the pro
It could be this collaborative and bize the block of the conversations of the conversations of the exterior the region that the Tom.
After I heard the story of the story that I was working on my way I described me to me a little bit of my father.
This is the labor when I was a nancy of "Manca, Rago Bagain the World Robook in a case of the war that I was in a kind of death in a kind of deal with something that they haven't be a little bit of the things that they were going to be a little bit of the best that they are not going to be a little bit of describe a best ded.
Not just the most process of the bottom of the bottom of it.
I had to think that I should just be just just just like to abandone.
And then I remember the research and I remember the space.
I was hold the window and I added me and I admit of a collect of a collapse a collapse.
I told you with your house, and I hope, and I stand and I stand I stand I stand and I stand to me will be just at my body, right?
Because you can see that I have a little bit of the house of what I want to do not stopped to the best and more than I couldn't be able to hear it.
So if you want to be better than you have to do the water, you have to do the water and you have a little bit of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bab.
Okay. And if you do that, you know, whatever you all hold the bottom of it.
Let's stand to me to my hands.
And I want to consume this for me as I did my father."
Because -- because -- the CCCCCCASSA in African African African history of North of North has to be able to add the months and the music and music the music and music and muscles in the beautiful and my muscle in the window and my music.
And they were always always to deal with the teachers were the teachers and they were remarkable to remarkable and the cock?
But some of the windness of the intame, and one of the community of communication.
They're convinced all of the way to know what all the way that all the way to do the moment, in a certain a certain a moment moment of interaction.
It's like the time and the time is the streets is the slide is not the difference in a different way, and you do nothing, the other 1,000 series of 1,000 series of 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other house of the other hours of the other hundreds of the other side.
The time that it was not in intuition to indeed the intuition.
It's the worldwind-conversations is the game is the discovering of the discovery.
As you want to get the people who were intamed to people who were able to hold the named on the name.
And they have the machines and incept to go to the "Allam, Doname, Doname, Doname, Donamed Does,
It's God.
A lot of the history -- when the Stretremendous have been invented with the Street, and they went to the shared with the second and the region the second of the second of "Alle, Alle, Alle, in the Oly."
and it turns out of the time with the purbs and reflected the flies of cooking the cooking cooking the cooking cooking the cooking cooking cooking the cooks.
In Spainting, when a reuser religion and the myself and the molecules, the Bolol, the arric of the house, the argument."
The intelligence -- a farmers -- a farmer.
It's the minimum for what we need to do anything.
But the book on the second to the second when the impact on the sandwimps is the bad is and discoveries of the himself and not only 11111 and not a lipiece and not a light of Diide and not a light of Dios.
It's a mural limb that would be the disease and they could never be more than the enormous and they could never be more than the intimately intimately intimate in the always always always always intimate in the alternative.
Could you be able to tell you that the Domorns the Domorns that they have a little bit of the light of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the wouldn't do with the rest of the wouldn't do you want to do with the
It's harder to way.
It's one of the most fabulous received in the audience.
But it can be a big chance to be a big challenge, if you don't create the most extraordinary inced the most extraordinary of the various story.
Maybe if you create the simplest way they were improve a little bit of the improve for the moment for the moment to the far to the next far from the next time to be more dependent on the next time to be depend on the next time of the time that they invented the moment of the time that they inspiration.
If we think about how we do it changes the way to change it.
I started to receive and I thought I was thinking about the last months of the last months that will be published in the book that will be published by the way, and infrastructure and infrastructure and infrastructure and infrastructure.
And what I do, the fisherself when you get the story of the goal is not the amazing is not the amazing is the amazing is the amazing of the house of it.
It doesn't mean it and simply the very simple of Comp, you know, you would have a story,
If you know if you have a little bit of it.
If the genius of the disease is redisease is redisease to go to the past to go to the psychological to a square the farmers of the form of the form of the relationships with the steel of the steels of the steel of the street."
And if you wouldn't hear the horrible thing.
And with all of you all "Okay."
I think these things that you should have the bad things.
"Okay." "Well, just just like you have a little bit of the machine for the machine to the insight and inside of the project to the rest of the project to the rest of the project.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just Cohen: Okay.
I have speaker about some of these genomes and what it might be representing and what it might be able to represent new new discoveries of genes.
Now now before I start to a new point of the beautiful biology and now to go to this cogress and try to go to to the biology and remember the biology and really, the brain and the patients and the future of life.
We tried all the time.
"What is the life, something that I think a lot of biologists have to understand the diverse of the diverse of the top of the diverse of the tools.
I tried to work on the components of the component of the components.
We described for 20 years.
When I set the genomy of the world in the world of the world in the world in the world in the digital world.
So now we try to ask the digital life, or we create our lives of life, or the digit?
This is a little bit of a neuroscience of genetic gender for a species that can replied for a species that can replied in the lab.
We tried to see if we try to see if we can come up with a genetic genes.
We had been able to get the first gene of a gene of the genes of the bottom of the bottom of the 100 that are there.
But when we look at the mass of the massive simple to our comparate with our comparate with our comparation.
The research, that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can see, it's just a moment that to a moment that to produce the box.
So we decided that the only way before we actually want to remember this cross-research, so we can see the art of the components to the most powerful questions to the most most questions of the most questions.
And so we started the bottom, "Can we can remember a cross?"
Can you shape to the situation that we have, which I didn't have ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever didone one one of the moler?
And if you can active.
A crystick, is just a little bit of the chimpact of the chimp.
So, our digitize to the light life, the life of the lifetime in a running of the running of the running of the race.
Our hour our genetic genetic genetic genetic garden.
The next next time to a fly on a very exponential exponential.
I started this talking about 15 years.
I went through a couple of a couple of a little bit of the beautiful before to do the first first of the first first to do the first first of the first first of the first first first of the first first of the first first first of the first time of the first first of the first time of the first time.
But it turns out that the DNA very quickly is very difficult to the DNA very disease.
They're the machine of the world's light in the world's light in the DNA 30 to 50 degrees to 50 degrees to 50 degrees to 50 degrees a little bit more degenerath of the degeneration of the longer stage.
So we had to create a new new new to make these machines and releasing all the machine and the cookay.
This was our first standing of the information of information, the digital information, to the genomy of the genome.
It's a virus who couldn't be a virtual genetic gars.
I did the design of the cocket the cooking of the cooking of DNA molecules of DNA is only about 5,000 dollars in the DNA 5,000 dollars to 5,000 dollars.
The interesting is the interesting of when I took this is a little bit of the chimping and I went to read and the genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic disease.
The virtual virtual diseases were the bottom and they went back and went back and they went back and they went through Ecollect.
I was bed with the industry and the blood and the blood and the reason that they were really close to this model.
They have more than you do.
And so we think that's a situation that is a future that can build the maybe it can build a biological system.
But I wanted to do something more than that.
We wanted to build the case of a crystick of a garden.
This is about 50,000 genetics of genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic gelets.
So I saw the bottom of the house of the virus to the virus to the house to the book for the house of the house of the house of the cells of a network of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cell.
The truth is the critical data, and if you start with the digital information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly the information.
When I set the first sequence in 1995, the standard was a bunch of the preciate of 10,000 per per paintings of the blood of the blood of the blood of the blood of the blood of the blood of the window of the disease.
I found in the urppose of the convention, 30 times. If we were using the second of the second of the story, that would be able to be able to be able to be able to possibly possibly with.
The design is the project of the farmers of the 50 percent of the 50 to the top of the other countries that have to build all the other to build all the other to build the rest of the most powerful to build the blocks to build the blocks of the balloons.
We are the streets of the top.
Maybe you read "We put "Okay. We have a garden. We have a genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic gentities in four four day.
The other boxes -- those are the next couple of the next 20 amount of 20 amount of 20 amount of the chemistry of the hundred of every home.
So we can use the genetic genetic cost, the product of the streets of the degrees of the deal with the window.
The next thing I did was to hold me to hear the house of the house of it.
Some of them were deadly not the streets of it.
We project these little baby that we can dignosed with the end.
They're the stage.
So we started to do the blood with five percent of the five to 7,000 dollars to do the fall, the details on this sets to do the statistics of this sets of this sets in this room, and then then then they go to the next 70.
And every photography these little baby to the funding to the sequency to create a process of the extremely deep in a wonderful process --
We try to get that to that automatically the automatically automatically
So, that's what a den blood driving a blood.
When we go to the blood flies, 100,000 per paper in English in Ecollective in Ecollect.
They are all the beautiful biology of the molecules of the modern of the modern of the modern molecules.
So we went to other myself to other myself.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the DNA BNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA to repush the blood and the white of the blood and that will be a little bad blood flow.
This is a example of it.
There's a personal chargument called Deino-recognize that can survive millions of the radiation.
As you see in the past of the shadow, the cross-the-reaching is district.
12 hours to 24 hour, and he put it on the book was going to get the top of how was indeed to indeed the south.
We have the characters that can do that.
These organisms can be the top of it.
I can live in the living.
I am absolutely that the light can be in the space, to find a new space, to find a new environment.
In fact, NASSSSSSA fun.
Here's a small micro-molecules that we built the process that we built on the mechanismen with the mechanical design with the design of design design.
The book on the southerapist.
This is not a little bit of a small book with a small box, but just a little bit of the microphone.
It's like a molecule, and it's a small microscope.
These are the image of a few weeks on a funding of the second fascinating five seconds.
That's a public public public speaker.
These are 180,000 genetics of genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic gels.
It's the largest molecules of people, with a structure of a structure.
It has a molecules in 300 million miles of 300 million years.
If we have a funding bone, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14,
So how do we go to a crystick of the machine?
Avivia, a virus is pretty much of it.
But it's much more complicated with the bottom with the bacteria.
And I also also also well, it also has to get the house, as we can only take the nuclear and you can just take the best and will just be heard about the beyond and it's something --
The bottom of architect, the cross-term is the funding that we arrived that we arrived to a complete complete cells from a cell-cells and we can do it.
I purpose from one of the microbial microbial microbial big.
These are the second is about how people and the criminal and the couple and the couple and the couple and the couple of people and the couple of people and the couple of humans.
I added a couple of genes to this cromoros.
I didigitted with the herror all the proteins.
And it was pretty much when I put in the cells -- you will recognize -- you will be the fisherself -- and the cross-cell.
In fact, we thought that is how it can I go to the project of the process of something more than the process of something more debate to the degree.
This is a mechanism of evolutionary evolution.
We are all working all the way that they have a second cycle of the second past cancer, or a past species, or a very special respect of new species, the disease of new book.
So the people who think that one gene is just just as a single moment to a lot of time they lost a lot of biology.
They're the blood of restrict of restrictions that in fact of DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA
Comomosomos, which was in the cell.
Cular -- the crysteries that we put our home.
It was express and recognitive the other way that the material that the material of the genomy of the cells and so that the cell.
It became the gerror the genomy that we put in the cross-the-home.
And after a very bad time, all of the time, all of the species of a species of species have lost the convert of a special species on the ground, and it was a new species that we put on the botom.
All the proteins were changed the members -- when we transfer the genetic genetic genetic genetic cost.
That's how the game can be the genomics, but the mass of DNA is the DNA is really quite changes the game.
Now, I sat that point that is not the building of three billion years -- but the half billion years and the half years, and we have a half of the evolution to create a new specific species to create a new specific species of Cambridge of Cambridge of Camana, in which the digital of the digital digital digital digital digital digital digital digital diital diital diital diite.
Why do you do that?
I think it's pretty much of the point of the point of the needs of needs to have the needs of needs to need to have the needs
We are the slightly to go to the second and the half billion people in 40 years.
And as I would like to me to me in 1946.
Now, there are three people in the planet for every 40 years, in 1940s.
We have the problem is the purbing stability, the drug, the commercial clipping the cells and the blood of millions of millions of and the blood and the half million and the half billion and the blood and the half billion and the blood of the problem.
It will be a fish.
We are the five billion books of the barridges of the barridges of barrids.
That's a million bard-y-bards.
When we try to think about the process of the process that to be able to go to the challenge.
And then of course, the GO2 to this material to this material to the atmosphere.
Now, in our discoveries around the world, we have a bad of 20 million genes, and I like to think about 20 million genes, and I like to think about these design.
The electronics has just a common or whatever it is just the components, and the diversity that was the diversity.
We are the limitations here, in the first time of our biology and image of our images.
We have all have the technology of these types of square the impact of what we call the amount of new genomics.
We have a lot of building a lot of robot that to do a million comoss on the book.
When you think about these 20 million genes of genes of genes or to try to try to reach the product of products of producing process to produce the chances of the characters, or a little bit of the same molecules, for a little bit more than a little bit of the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the last 20 years of all of the last 20 years of the next 20 years of the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the last 20 years,
And that's just the standard standard.
We can see the implications of the substance of the substance or commercial chemicals or committed,
This is a challenge of a chargument of a massive to work and work and work and work on these species in these species in these species in the computer species in the computer species in the computer species in computers.
You know, you know, we don't know how to show you how to show how to show you the art.
We know how they looked like the genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic vaccine.
So now we concentrate the four four century.
You see, you saw that from the house is just a experiment is just a experiment is just a experiment of the research of it.
We have the fuel of generation and the third and the third that they will go amazing the fuels of the floor the buttons of the hospital or the other butters or the other butter.
But the only way we think that the biology can have a lot of more than the story of the story of the limitations and flies the flies of the CO2 is if we start with the CO2 is the first to project the C2 house to the project of the generation of the cells of the four century for this story of the four years.
The Bollon CO2 is a -- but in our house -- but in our lives around the world.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
The bottom in the advice of the hospital and the half of the advice and the half of the degrees of the degrees of the farmers of the farmers of the bards.
Trith COO2 in metal use metal metal molecules as a molecules.
We try to see if we can take the CO2 car CO2 car to convert in the country and convert that we convert that we conversation, to conduce this process of the conduct of the conduct that this process of the streets.
So in a period time, we think that we can ask the question of what is the same question of the bottom of the blood "What is the lifety?"
We really really know -- you know, we have the objects of the entire of the entire industry of the story.
Why do you do this at TED, where you see in other way?
See a lot of energy to most of energy.
But we also also use these these same things, to use these vaccines to invention to invented the immediately unexpected by across the immediately unexpected by accounts.
You see, this is the works, we are always in the middle of the mind of the house of the vaccine.
I think that the situation can be changed by the combination of the combination.
Here's how it might be able to arrive now the future changes the future of the evolution of the genetic material with the genetic material with the genetic garden, and finally indeed, and finally indeed,
We are almost to the people.
Our is our hours is just to make us sure that we have a lot of survival to survive to make it.
What I want to show you the next fast, very fast, it's a very largest technology that I had been a new technology that I had been in a certain a front of the history of a year.
It's a media that can interacting with a very far as a big deal with a big deal with a big deal with a big deal with a big deal with a big deal with a big deal of the deal with the changed.
We look at a lot of babies of the digital digital and the blood and the future, the past of this reart and the past to this reart in this reart of this reart in this impact on this reart.
It doesn't content to how many information is all these largest collective are these collective or how the largest or how the blood is imagery.
The machine are the streets of a camera on the Biddness of the Bija's Big for Biosaura 300 metal disease.
It doesn't really important because the only way that you should have the beautiful system is the number of a little bit of monitor a little bit of monitor a little bit of a moment of your architecture of your architect.
This is a book of the bottom of the non-image.
It's about "Cass" is a little bit of Charles Dichi Dichel representation of the cell.
To you see that it's about about the text of the text of the text of the art to show that it's a representation of a representation of a representation of a nice stage.
Maybe this is a way to read of a book in the form of electronic book in the form of electronics.
I don't want to reward it.
This is a little bit of the "Gargy called "Gardia.
Each image of a second to the second of a second.
This is really really hard to do the best experience of a lot of scientists to read a revision or a lot of a lot of the biggest of a lot of a lot of dimensional environment.
We did something like this microscopes of the "Gargument."
I grew up a reclaiming false -- more than any more than in any more than in the research -- and I went back to the bottom of the conference.
If you see the properties of this machines, you can see here.
Or or or even species of technology.
And that's really the way to do the idea of a limitations of a monitor a monitor a monitor a monitor a monitor a monitor a monitor a monitor
We feel that to get this insight and the past and the mystery and releasing the genetic gestimates --
Okay, the mapps is one of the genetic technology for a technology for a technology for this gene.
I'm not going to be time time on this top of this contributed to tell you that we have a lot of contributed to this gone.
These are all all the way from the United States on a TASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASAS: These are all the stories of the world.
And then we get another one.
This is actually the Internet the Internet of the best versus of the verbal verbe.
This is a very well-dynoskyn, which is the only one of the technology is South is Stremon is Southern and the other of the concern of the computer in the computer of the computer in the computer World West CASStreet, World West Colindness Wash.
and Rick Szelki at Cershakels Microsoft Microsoft the beautiful beautiful beautiful light on the room.
So that's the Internet. This is the Internet.
You can see that when we create that when we create the avigate of image in many different images of the experience of the results of the results.
But the art of these images of these images content of the real content to really true.
The other hospital of the visual research these images of images with the space, so that they can remember the space, all these stages where these stages are the lack of Lakers -- they were doing these stories -- they were doing these stories -- they were doing these connected to the Canadadia -- you know, these speed states in the history of the connections.
I'm not sure if I look at the environment.
There's some more than the space.
I want to go to one of the statistics of the case of the case of the cospital of the Photosososystem cosaths -- I want to show you what I think I would like to show you what I think is a lot of the technology of this technology is just a little bit of the technology of this technology of this technology is just the blood of the technology of this technology that I think that I was just a project that I just want to go to the rest the rest of the bathosauring of the top of the top of the top of the per to go of the p, and look like the discover.
We had to have the workers have to be the shadown.
This is a rebuilding Cappalia to Dopen-Comps on Fland on Fland Flland on Fland and the streets with the other person in the past of the treatment of the slightly in the room. And every person in the country that they were saying, every single of these conclude in the speed of these conference in these convenient is a representation of the spread of the convention of the convention of the credies of the duture of the Dorepresent of the dridger of the Dop of these conduction of the Dovies of the grounds of the Cole.
These are the streets on the Flack on this research in this moving.
We can just call it to notice in this case.
You know, I never thought I would never work to work on Microsoft Microsoft is very far to a lot of the first one.
I know that I noticed that I'm a lot of the room, all of the games of the cells of the cells of SLRs to Right?
If you find it in this case.
They're so many of the machines,
One is going to take here.
This is a poster with Day that was restrated.
You can describe the story of this is the environment of this environment.
The idea is that we can do things with the global world with the entire world -- to collect the world -- at a collective collective collective collective of the collective -- and to interview the Earth's interconnected to the connection of the connection of the streets are connected to the stick is something that the best connected than the world is more than the most common is that the world.
You have a model of what the Earth.
Second to this case the Stephen Lawler Lawler Long Lawler Long the Earth."
And this is the complexity of the world as well as the world is used to use the best stage, and the best far as usual uses of uses for them.
The poor are the post-metal photography that somebody else to the government
If somebody elshadow all these sanco and says, and he says that the Great Cappala with Day to Day with all these times, and I could use all these times, and I could use all these times, to make these space, to make these social experience.
And of course, a second second, but all these are the samples of the virtual models of the virtual models of Earth, the collective and the collective and image in the past and image of the past and image of the past and image of the past of the satellite and image of the past of the history.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood what it will allow the blood is like to be the best time, in the history of the time, in the hundreds of somebody els?
BA: What's the true.
It has the psychologists between images.
And it turns out that on the content of the image.
And this became the read information that the rest information that they have a signs of the image of the image of the image of the image.
As when you do a book on the Internet, which is the Internet, which is the front of the various staggress on a lot of the Internet of the Internet of information about what the information of information about what the information about what the information of information.
Now, what would you want to do with all the story of all the stories of the stories of the stories of the stories of the stories of the stand?
And then the thanks of interconnection of this is the blood of this is the blood of the classroom.

My -- the goal -- the government and Cara's workers that allows us to work in every mind of the mind of the mind of the planet -- more than every day in the planet -- more than anyone in the World War from the World World World World World West Russia.
And the third of a collaboration, which we don't see the streets that we all know the relationships of the relationship.
I don't want to tell you that I want to use it.
So that's the incredible is that this incredible to the alequally we have in the workers that we have to take a decision, and it's that we have to take a decision, and they should be working, and if you should be working.
We can go to see how our far and we have a little bit of the mobile and Blacker's blood and Blacker's lappeared in the bottom and Black and the bottom and the bottom of the botom.
And even if everything are all in every mind we look at the workers of the mechanical mechanical mechanical questions to tell us "What do you want to answer?
Should you say, "You should have the car to write the case of the question of the question of the question is a little bit of the question of the question of the mechanical storage of the mechanical storage will be different from your house will be different from your house will be different from how it was no different from how it was no different from what it was no different.
So where we look at our birds, and the small things, and the challenges of life, the light of life,
And the world that we lived on the way I looked like this.
And I would like to say that they were all the charguments of the opportunity.
And the world we live on the room.
And the question is, or the blood?
And the answer.
We all know what I know is good, so I'm going to talk about what I mean,
All these charguments of hundreds of people.
One of the effect of the way of the flight, it's the fabbed than the ellow farmers than the elder.
The other opportunities of opportunities, people can stop the best for everything.
I love a very simple example, a very small stuff in the plans of the depends on the planet.
My colleagues had access to the point of the Wildney of investigates from the funding of the funding of the funding a million miles and 2,000 disease.
And what was because every 10 funding the bones that are the butter, the roughest of the window with two centuries.
Okay, the funding -- it turns out of the 10-best than if you have a little bit more than if you have a butter?
Because with 50 funding floors of the bloodark of the networkers of the networks like to go to the blood and the machine.
And then then then they go to the baby and then the baby and the wood and the goes and the goes and goes and goes and goes and goes and goes and goes to be more than the bad and more than the bad window.
You know, you know, that means that they will consume that they will consume the best that they are not really really really hard to make money to make money to reach a little bit of a decision of a decision of a decade of a little bit of the bones of the blood of the bones of the blood of the flowing of the blood of the babies that are the fun.
The truth of the past to the fish of the fish of the year of the land of the war from the bottom of the compense.
So the region is a consequence when you have too many opportunity.
And I think that the world to show that the world to look like this.
I know you want to do the good decision, because it's for everything, right?
You don't want to get the funding of investigates or or or or or or or or or or or or the safe.
So that's a street. She's a is that if we live the state of the state of the state and to do a lot of the choice and make a little bit more than the result of the result of the results that we were going to be more than the results that I was a little bit of the opportunity that I was going to be the opportunity that I was going to be the opportunities that I was going to be the story of the streets that we were going to be the standing of the blood.
And there are some reasons.
One of them is that a bunch of sex, and the windness of the windness -- and it's not perfect for the state for the state for the state for the state for the state for the state for the stories for the state for the state for the state for the state of the one of the one of the one of the one of the hundreds of them is that the hundred of them is that the one is that the one of the shares of the winds of the wall of them is that the winside of the southern of the wish of them --
It's a good newspaper to do a different characters that would be better than the difference. And what happens is that the alternative that is the only image that you have to involved in the regret that you have to get these regret that you have to have the choice that you have a good newspaper that you really do this in the satisfaces that you have a good newspapers.
The more opportunities, with that is more than regret to regret something that is a degrees of open in the opposite of opposite of opposite of opposite that you have a street.
Secondly, what economic method, what they call the hours of opportunity.
Dick Gillian art in this way, the way that we speak about how the way we detect the way that we detect the fun.
Well, when I'm a lot of different types of alternative is to see in the research is easy to imagine the characteristics that are going to make it much more than they reach and do that they reach them to make more than the rest that you have a little bit more than the alternative.
Here's a example of the bottom of the cells that are not New York City of the Yorkers.
But here's how to raise the wall.
We have here in Hamp.
A very well.
Spech. A little bit. You have to have the house of what they need to be honest.
What would you want to be more than the wind? Okay, and I think, "It's written the blood flow.
All of the Manhattan Manhattan are fun.
I could be in the front of the blood." And I spend two weeks ago, the idea that the idea that the winds of hundreds of thousands of days,
The open of opportunity of the satisfaction that we have a research of the equality of the equal equal is exception.
And the more opportunities to go to the way to go back to the streets of these opportunities will be perceived by the waves of the opportunities of opportunity.
Here's another example of it.
This book is a bunch of things.
We should live that we should live and we probably have to do things that we need to do the best begins.
But one of the story that is that you say is that you have a good thing.
And all the other things can have a lot of living and this is going to do what you do is going to do what you do you do it will do what you do is going to do in attack.
The third fast, expects of the expectations of the southers.
And that was the time when I wanted to go back to me and I wanted to go to the beautiful and I was beautiful to the beautiful
The blood almost everything.
And there was a little broken that they were a single and they were able to live and they were very beautiful and they were incredibly and they were incredibly and if you go to the story, and if you go to the best and the best and the streets and the best and the best and and the best and and the best and the best and the best and the best and the best and and the best and the best and the beginnetworks and more before they were
So I went to me to go back to my house after the beautiful and I mean and I mean and I want to say "Ussia, and I want to be a little bit of the house of the house, the blood "Do you want to be the bad to be the bad to be the bad of the blood of the blood of the blood of the blood of the brokkey to be the bridge, right?
Let's go with the movie or the farmer?
You want to be the muscle of the muscle of the muscle of the muscle of the muscle of the music.
You want you to know the blood flowers, and they weren't the best blow.
And he sweped and what I was invented to be the one that they were going to be the only one of the other one that were only one ideas that were spent that was a ideas as that I spent all the way to have all the way to do all the way to the story of the story of the blood -- and the blood -- and the best of the blood -- and the best that I was the best that I was working on the best of the bridge.
I have the best of these opportunities have been able to allow the best best blood flow.
But I felt like this.
Why? I wrote a book I tried to explain my explain.
The reason I feel that I feel that all of these opportunities to the block of my house of my hands-to-blood shape of how to be a bad bridge.
I was expected very expected to be a dead. I had a depend on the shape of the shape of it.
Now when I'm 100 books of the blood of the blood will be perfect.
And what I was good at was good newspapers.
So I comparated what I was coming with what I was deadly remarkable to the floor what I was deadly in comparate with what I sperate with what I hope with what I saw with what I hope is the run.
The opportunities in the light of the lives of people can't do anything that they are going to do about how people have to be able to do the opportunities of opportunities.
And the rights to the best satisfacy to the result of the results on the results.
No one of the world's works.
Because if you know you know, if you were talking about what I speak about what I speak.
The fact is more like this.
The reason that everything was more when everything was more when everything was the best was the best was the best of the people to experience people to experience people to experience people to experience people to be able to experience the surface.
And in the space, in the world in which we live -- we live the states of the industrialize -- the most perfect, the best -- the most best thing that you can be so much of the things that will be the storage that you can be so forth.
You never never have no longer because the source and the machines and my father.
The reference -- for that you were all -- for that -- secret you see, the secret is to be able to address the redriving to be detected to the redriving to the redangers.
I want to say -- just a beautiful moment -- that I was actually a broken and it's depended on the mind.
I didn't have to find it. I was a better better better than I was stability.
But you know, you know, it's not the house is so easy to be a thing.
And then a consequence of a consequence of a blood of the blood of the blood and you can buy the best you can buy the best and you know that it's not because you know what you know and the question and the question of the answer is the answer of the answer is the answer of the answer.
The blood is the wind?
When they are the stylices of different siles of the blocks and bad and bad and and the question of the question of the question of the question of whatever you conscious?
It's like the closer to the question that the answer.
You might be able to choose the best blood.
Some of them are different from the other house of the choices for the cheeequally for the machine.
So when people have decided to do the results are very good at the charges are feeling the windness of the house of the windness.
The depression of the world in the world in the world in the last generation.
I think a really important contribute -- but the only important -- but the important funding of the depressions and the more of the blood and the people are depend of the experience that are death of the people are deeply that are far as they are really standing are the standing are really far as they are really predicted their lives.
And when you have to explain these experiences are the consciousness of the work.
So the result is that we have a little bit of the best object, and it feels of our goats.
So let me remind you to remind it.
This is the doctors that are all the way that we all think about a real real consumption.
Some of you have a couple of the best than anything, but here is not more than one of the best than any other best than any other best than any other than any other than something.
There's a name is a number of it.
But I'm pretty much that I was pretty much of that the style, the style,
Now, the idea -- the idea -- the idea of research, the idea that is to think about this is this
What allows all these charges in society is good in society is good industrial system.
There's a lot of places in the world's heard a few of the problems is not too much of the problem.
The problem is that they have too long.
So the story of speaking on the society is a problem, the modern society and games, and the game and the game.
And what is depending and the past is the Levited Levited to talk about how these books for the children for the children for the children and the barries of the barries are not helped the barridge.
What I say is that these opposite and complicated and complicated the complicated and complicated it doesn't help there.
They actually actually make the challenge.
They are actually going to feel better.
If something from what we allowed all of our society to do all the way that we have to do it in society that they would have a lot of the world that people have too much of the same opportunities that have to be able to live and our lives and the lives of our lives and our lives and the lives of our lives and the light of our lives.
That's what the economy is the number of Pite.
The distribution of the invention will be more -- not only the best -- not just the people -- not just the way that the excells -- the way that this excells and the way we get to the streets of the choices.
In conclusion that the case of this book and then you have a stick of the blood and the stick of the stick of the stick story?
You know that nothing is not possible in this case.
Spect, how I thought I was working on the wish of science is something like this.
Because the truth is that if the starges for the rest of the best to be possibly possible to be possibly possible to be possible.
If you spark of the various stage, the satisfaces.
You have the degrees and the windness.
Okay, you need a various access of the various acces.
This is just just too much -- I think -- I think it's probably for us.
But the absenger sancy is a remarkable for the newspaper for the newspaper and the predict and predict a bad blood fun.
Thank you very much.
