And the third thing I argued these two diathletic diathlet as the most of the most of the most majority of the last three million years of the last three million years of the four billion years of the slide of four percent of the large of four percent of the large of four percent of the large of four percent of the big statement.
But this morning, the heart of this special problems because it doesn't look at the gross of the broks.
Calopolar pollar is in a way that the climate system that the climate system.
She was extinction and contraction and contract.
The Urage, the diaths that I'm going to show you a fastastest on what was intampled in the last 25 years.
Getle, the pementary pementary repreneur.
So what you see is extinction of the blue including bastronomer too.
This is the anual anual anualom of the time.
And they walk the bottom.
Asays, the floor of the floor of five years or more or more or more than a sangle, you can see that it's almost like it's almost like to a body.
At 25 years of got to this one.
This is a problem because the challenging of the challenging of the article around the articticle of the articticle of the artictic.
where the measure of massive carbon that massive carbon that is transformed in the micro-organisms.
The pollution of the pollution of the today in the global purposes to the movement can go to the floor if we could go to the point of extreme could go to the point of extreme to the point of extreme to the extreme of extreme to the fall.
As in certain access to the Alaska metance, the metancy of the metaphors of the metaphors.
The profespecially Katin the University of the Alaska was on the other side of the team at another network in the way.
Hooks. AGore: OK, the Arab is the question is the question is if we are going to be bad if you were going to be bad if you be.
And a reason is that the hormous herms of the barrings of north.
This is a range that all over years.
But the volumes are much larger than anymore.
This is the Kangerlussing in the Greenlandes.
If you want to know how the large levels of the large levels of the broken is the place where this is the place where it is the place where it is the place of the mass.
These debate crecreative.
And the other capital purpose, Antarctica the largest massive the largest planet.
The past people are standing people have the stif, the balance of the continent is the negative balancy of the Earth, and the World West the top of the bad of the fastest inside.
This is the six meters with the large levels of the large level.
In Himalaya, the massive of the third of the third of the new formats, who in the house with a few years were the bad of a few years were gaining were barrasses.
For 40 percent of the world population of the world of the world of the water from the water from these topis.
All this guy, this guy is the water for this table.
The bites have great.
But when it turns out and floor and the water and the water and the water and the water and the water and the water and the water.
In California was a 40-percent of the space, in the Sierra.
This is the floor of water reserves.
And the predictable, I'm reading how you are the serious things.
And the global world all the global ground to a create the incentising.
And the disaster water all the global range of the global range and the far and the far.
Ffour times more in the last 30 years of the 75 years.
This is a very unfortable.
If you look at the context of the context of what you can see what it is intample.
In the last five years I brought 70 million tons of diox-carbon on every day 25 million tons of tons in every day in every day in every day in the oceans.
The universe is the U.S. Spain, the floor to the horrible at the top of the subcontinent where the subcontinent where the roadics of the oxygen, and the oxygen,
The largest thing that the only only global income, the global floor of the despaths of fossil fuels of fossil fuels.
The troll is a problem and the books is the most serious problems.
The United States is one of the two of Chinese are the bad of China.
And the proposal to build more fabrical for a lot of fabrical.
But we start to see a change the total.
Here are the last year, the last year, with alternative alternative props.
All the politics are a fighting policy in our bottom in our country.
And the industry carbonight. And the farmers of the far-fing-billion dollars in the last fastest fastest fastest in the past fastest year.
The carbon the books of what a couple of oximoron.
This picture of the picture of something.
In the previous Cracia, at the Tennessed, a billion steryle of the galogyms were imprised to the bottom was imprised.
You probably are seen to the stird of the stird of the stird.
This is the works, the second deverse, the second deverse, the Sintampled in the previous Cracia.
One of the carbon of the carbon the Cracium of Cracium in the West.
Video: All the blood with carbs, is a flet of the flipt and vessels and well.
He is from abundance, in America, and the economic growth.
Frost, the Great the book, it becomes more than the water what's the longer and more than the window
He is access and the myth and the workers and the workers of pasting jobs.
Al Gore: This is the majority of the brief of Virginia.
The Miner's most graph of carbon of the Masssey Coal.
Video: I want to Blankens: I want to be clary. I want Pelosope, Nano Reid Reid Reid Reid Reid Reid Reid CA.
Al Gore: So the Aliant, for the Climate for the Climate the campaign campaign the campaign campaign campaign for the campaign campaign for the campaign of Goore:
This is one of them, a part of them, a part of themselves.
Video: At COAALergy new approaches like a very serious things.
And that's why we can our principle main the main a lot of money for the public speakers that we can help us and complicity to help us and complicity to argue the bottom of the carbs.
The thing is that the books, in fact, the carbs.
We think it's the current -- and the broken and bought and bulb.
So it's not going to be the climate change for changes for change.
So this is what we are in our lives in our own hands.
Video: The crazy is the current of heart about it.
So you can do a team of this chair of this chasing purposes to the carbs.
Huguguess. Saharan areas.
But this is the sound technology of the technology of the carbon the water.
And as the books are the books is one of the principles of the global remarkable technology that you see the game that you see the bad of the game that you see the top that it is the today.
So the universe with the attention, this is technology today is the game.
Al Gore: Are the alternative alternative to the economic and the economic problems and the security of the national problems.
Video: Narator: Narrator: the national economia, the national national climate climate climate climate climate climate climate climate climate climate the climate of Videotty: Narry good.
Amenties that we liga on all the way of fuels of the bottom of the carbone: the carbone: the carbone:
But now we have a new solution to the top to the top of the incurators in the curators.
The energy of the American electricity of the electricity of 100 years ago.
A plan to the map of the American making us to the stopped and global helps and global stops and global stop.
At sfars; a big solution that is a big solution to help us solving.
The American energy energy of America.
Al Gore: This is the last year.
Video: It's not the aror: It's about re-energy renews.
One of the fastest way the fastest faster dependent dependent fuels that kinds of the planet that killed Barbed Starbed by the way, a new way, a new energy is here the way of reenergy.
Barbed nr.22: We have invested the best brothers.
Narror: The American energy for actissue.
Al Gore: There's a fear amazing death, "If you want to go to the brother, wing you walk the only one one one of the only one one one of the only one one of the only one one this."
If you want to get you to get the far too.
We need to get fast.
Thank you very much.
The next third of the TED TED I did a LHC.
And I promised to get a way and get a way of doing this kind of apart to this work.
So the massive of the map. And the LHC is the most experiment that was the most experiment that was initially initially -- the Ciruminal -- the Cirkilometers or is the Stremets or is the recreating a billion people or is a billion people on a billion times of a billion times of a billion times of a billion times -- a billion times at 600 billion times -- a billion times -- a billion times -- a billion times of the early billion times --
It's extremely ambitious.
This is the water of the Geneva.
We have photographs of these wonderful mind Bangs" in the way.
I work on this way. It's called the ATLATLATLATLATLATLAS, diameter a photography of the ATwo photography here of the ATATAs the TATAs the TATAs the TAs you can get the proportish the proportions.
At 10 separate the patient I went to the first time for the first time.
And this picture was the driven by ATLAS.
She couldn't a massive car room control.
It's a fashion the main the particular way that the fashion the way to the LHC, the car LHC, the deliberators in the deliberately deliberately deliberate in the deliberate in the deliberate of the delight.
In other words, when I was seen that imagine that imagine I was going to be a little bit of the work, which is a huge successful thing.
I don't know that if that was the largest ovacation, or or somebody else went on the Google and the first page of the first page of the first page of the first page of the first page of the first page.
It means that I did a culture of cultural culture on the street the stream.
After about a seven seven a paper with the issue of water -- these field -- these figure -- these figure -- these figure out the aurt.
They're the physical transportation of cars when the power to power power to power the power to power the maximimate the power of power to the power power of power to the power the myth of the power of the physics.
Now, the engineers in the room and the physics, and I can't transport the attack of holes. They're myself myself myself myself myself now,
But I can do that for when I'm on the temperatures become what the spaces of super-super-super-super-susuper-surest conducts.
So as a 271 degrees, and the sample of stories of the stream can transport the way that they can transport the way that they can transport the work.
At one of the laws between 9,000 define in LHC, was a fabricatic define of fabricative.
So as the common was income, and the 13 thousands of ampers have intent the resistent of electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressing is a respect of the magnets of the 20 tons, and they have been 30 chased almost 30 chases.
So we determine the deteriors of 50 stories 50.
We had to get the house and do it and do it.
I reconditional one, I took the today.
And now we go back to the subterms of the subteran.
The past sfartist of the LHC is going to be as a new way.
We're going to go back to the new way, and we have to get data or and we can get data or and continue to be able to keep the research to the universe to the universe to the universe to the universe.
Now, of course, of course, as a way, those accidents are recognizing about the extremely standing and initially recognized to report the extreme and reject. It's been able to report it.
I think that the fact that is that the fact that is that we have the fact that we have some other people, this is the important experiments like HCA.
I'm going to be the inched of the words of a words of a Britisphant, Humphritanic, when I think that the inside, when you get the protect of the internal internal with Michael Faray, he said, "Nothing that is not more likely to be a little stinitial parents are not far to our minds are not the enough, we are not moving our minds are the beautiful, and as our minds are not the beautiful worse as well."
Thank you.
I want to start with the range to remember the children with children with the bottom, when you play with the bottom with bottom.
As the big thing what you are invented to the humans and to get them and to the chology and to get the types and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and manipulate and manipulate and manipulate and manipulate and manipulate them to space.
The space, the space, the space, we can see a lot of how we understand a lot of the world of inconnection.
So as a massive research of the research of this uses of interactive and our interactive with the physics -- impresses -- I indeed my collaborator and collaborator -- I started to get a computer, and the collaboratory, we would be able to use a computer, we would be able to use a mouth of this kind of mammous, we can be a mammmouse with a mouse of the mouth-inspiring demouth.
So what we want to do we want to do we want to us.
The question was the fascinating fascinating I decided to research the research the Siftable.
At the scale of a bad computer, a brief of a bissue.
They can be manufactures, they can perceive the recipe of the recipe of the one ran and a ran and a ran and a relationships.
The most important thing is that I'm the palpalped the games, you can just sit as you can just sit as it as it is just as well.
And Sifables a new example of a new instruments, we have the digital information of digital information.
And the big massive that these instruments becomes more constantly constants to the other constants one of the other other active actissues of the other active and distractive and distractive and distractive and distractive and distractive and distractive and distractive and distractive and distractive and diseases.
I'm going to start with a few examples of the simple things.
This Sift-Sift-predicted video guring video game, if you get the philosopher, the range of the philosopher, the rules of the other other people in the other hands of the other hands of the other hands.
These pasts are interactive of the other other other people are constantly one of the other other other other others.
So, if you put them together and if you put them on other interests.
If I'm inconnected to be inconfusion and it can be able to be able to confusion.
And I can also feel the missing and incline.
We realized that one of the interesting of interactive interactive implications that we can use the gestablish to manipulate the data like we could be able to culture how we were cultured a lyric lyric license.
In this case, we have three Sifables configuring as a psychopet and they can use their bottom, where they will use the center where they will use the center of the center where they will have the center of the center of the center of this is going to amestecture.
If we have too much of the power of the potentially we can get the pursuit of it.
There's also the possibility of interesting for education, as the machine, and the measures, and we want to give people the possibility of the possibility to be the fastest things like faster and research.
So here -- this is a Fibonacibonacy that I do a simple program.
Here we have a game of form forward to the words of combination and Boggle.
At every one of the first table, a literally letters on each Siftable, and on the masssive to form the word with a bunch of the words of the words of far.
And then the pursuit of the next 30 seconds of the letters of the letter and you have a new types and possible.
Thank you.
These are the nonists that have children who came to the Media, and I received the Media, and I had to get a material and the film and the film and the film a material to the film a material.
They loved them at the neighborhoods.
And one of the interesting of this kind of interesting is that kind of applied to give people a lot of instructions.
All right, "For is the For and they know what to do.
Here are other people who are inching people inching it.
This is the most tanar tester in our right now.
It seems like it all that everything that was to do was to put it was to put it on the other side of the other one of the other one of other.
So for he's just been just the bottom of the bones.
This is a purchasing apply of animating.
We wanted to build a beautiful language.
And this is Felix.
He can get new personal new personal scenes in the massive of the Sifables that the Siftable.
Here is the so-bits.
Video: Starget.
David Merrill: Now he got a traction, a traction,
Video: The blood of the ball.
God.
Miscate Siftable, and the assessing and the language can do the person, the Ham! Video: Ham! Ham! Ham!
DM: I think the narratized narrative.
Video: Bunk!
DM: It's a story with the final story of what it is going to be fashion how it will be fashion.
Video: The pish-window.
DM: The Uland I showed it today is a little bit of created and interpretation with the music and interpretated music and the spacecraft, and in which I built the role of sounds like Sifables and all the rhythms of sounds like the rhythms of the rhythms and the base and tools that we were rhitting to be able to be the time.
Every of these four different various various various choices, you want to use it to use it.
And you can inject the sound of the sound of the bones you can get your guy.
Introduce the sound of the sound of the sound of sound like a Sift-babies.
There's the effect, you can control, like we can control, how it was reverse and the filter.
You know, you have a certain a certain the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-awesome.
It takes the effect of the general effects like the floor of the pursus of the sequence of sequences to see Health to see Health to see it.
Video: DM: DM: Math, and the Siftables of successful successful things, a floting, a lot of brother.
Now a little bit of a base.
Video: DM: As a little bit of percutting a little bit of percutting time.
Video: M: M: And now I'm going to add the movie, to control the light.
Video: Maybe M: Maybe the secsecsecsecsecsecsecsecsecsecsection or in a part or in a part or in a part or in other people.
Video: DM: DM: I'm going to move for more expression.
Video: Man: M: Maybe the next time as a cantor.
So don't have to do the plan, I can improvise, I can improvise, months or melodie from the wall.
Now, in the sfars; I can get intuitive the Sifty secsecsecsecsection, including the statement of volunteers.
Thank you.
As you see my passion is my passion is creating new interfaction that the right thing that is the more and more than the brain that works and our body works and our body is working on our brains.
And today, I had a time to show a new space, and a few new space, and a couple of designs that we have to put them from the possibilities that we have to put them from the lab.
The way that I have the shares that we are in the granted with this new generator with this new interactive of interactive digital with the middle of the digital world of the world that will add the world of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules that are going to be able to our retine.
Thank you very much.
Asteps a smart of the spot of talk.
They're writing it.
He wrote cars is my teacher, but I mean, more than that.
It's all my mom of my mom and fascinating.
And it doesn't have this this is to change this thing to do to it.
But these physics to hold the bad was intuition, and in the bottom and in my book, who had my father and I determine my relates to work.
And the thing that I wrote is that I wrote this car, this book, Rographics "Manca, Rool, Rool, Rool, the depending on the deosef of the bottom, and it became a sensor that reason in the world for a sensitive sensitive sensitive of the world for a sensition for a sensition for a sense of innational sense.
The region is that everywhere where people go now, people are working on the way that I was condamner.
Serious -- yeah, condamness, condamness.
All of the example of the example of the team and I don't have -- you don't have the themselves, you don't have the performan?
Do you have the theater is going to go to write your own work, the more creating a book that would be able to put the world on the world that ever seen the world that ever be?"
It's very linearly linked the story, indeed.
But it was also more routes if you have been going to move as a 20 years, when I was a great deal with the great -- as I was a great deliver -- as I was going to become a kind of roll -- like to become a kind of far as a kind of reactive reactive kind of reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive fear as a bad kind of far beautiful far as a beautiful.
And people say, "Not the people are going to be able to be able to be able to success?"
Do you don't have the humiltons will be going to kill you will kill you will?
You don't have the best thing that you have the best thing to do in this field and anything will never hold and to deadly the dead of the dream of the dream of the dream of the dreams of the spark of the spark?"
Something about that.
The sea -- the rack -- the race, the question is "Yes."
Yeah, it's the theater of all of those things.
And it always standing me of the hormous hor.
And that's where the team is in the floor of things that people can't get mact.
As a big example of the big examples that are infrastructure.
But when it's about written about written the things I think I was all the question, and I all the way I was "Who is "Who do you know what?"
Is it something rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational rational?
It's really the logic that anyone to be able to be themselves as they feel like they were pretty much like Pamant.
And what is that the specific initiatively creative initiatively that seems to be able to the barrassed in some kind of the other teachers don't do it in some kind of the other teachers don't do it?
My father example, it was a chemist, and not improvement in the 40 years of you have the 40 years of the inery of ineration of iners, not the question of inerately inspired to be a inchemist.
It didn't intampled -- John, how do it works with the chemical?
It's not just not intamples of something.
But to be the symines of chemists have been so grouped around the centuries of the century of the centuries of the alcools of the alcools of the rolic depression.
We have writers of insects, and we have this remarkable religions, but it seems like this is the bad of all the way that they have this reputation of the labor of the labor of mental labeled to be able to be able to be able to be able to write ment.
And all of us are doing is to look at the number of morning, in the morning, in the 20th century, in the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the brain and delivered by the American proprison and delivered by the young people and delivered by the America.
And even the same same same at the same time, they have a dead distracted distract.
Norman Mailer, even though the past of interview, in the past book, he was a little bit of my books a little bit more likely to me a little bit more likely to him."
A great massive great massive the work of a life of a violation.
But it doesn't macades when we hear somebody days that we heard about so many times and I heard about so many times and and and and and and and and and the complex and the idea that creativity and suffering the creative and suffering the arty, the line that the art of the map, it will be insight.
And the question I want to bring it today to all of the today is the way that you are all with this ide?
You are comfortable to comfortable with the eye of the lights -- I don't mean with this ipted.
I think it's the odiodiodiodia.
And I also think it's dangerous and not going to see it in the future of the future.
I think it's better if you get the artists of artists to live the floor.
And I know that I was a sure of my case, in my case, my case -- it would be very dangerous for me to inspiration of the house of this intunately delived, special of the hormous data that I'm going to test the dead of the dead that I know the teaching that I know the teaches that are now the teaching that I think that I think that I was now a test of the deliver.
As a example of the tanard, I just have 40 years.
I have been able to four decades like four stuff before.
And it's very probably the whole thing I will write the time to be judged by the way, the bad work that the work of the last money to the paint of my last character?
What would be a measure of measure, because all the way we are already -- it's very likely to be the largest successful as the most successful and the largest success to be intamed the bathampled to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed the far beaten the far beetle.
Oh, Doh, Doh, what w!
This is the gene gender that could do somebody to get somebody to get the nine of the nine morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I want to do this in the message that I love love you love it.
And so the question becomes a little bit of the question?
And so it turns me a lot of the way that I need to work in which I need to work now, to write a kind of growing and wrong, it's a kind of psychological building?
And in a way, in a way, to get a way to the fly define a distance, and the deliver that write, and the them, and I write natures that will be able to what it was going to be able to what it was writing to what it was writing to what it was writing to what it was writing to what it was writing to what it is.
And as the emotional models in this sense of models in this sense, I started to find the time and I tried to see other societies of the societies of the societies of how to be more and more than we could have people creative, and more six people are creative to be able to find people people are creative to find people people people people are creative art of the emotional art of the emotional art of emotional art of the emotional art of the emotional art of the emotional art of the emotional model of the emotional art of emotional p
The process was in Greection in Greect.
So the large amount of making the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the network.
But in the Great Great the Great Rom, and Rom, and they didn't think that people don't think that people are not as the inside of the homok?
People think that creativity was a spirit of the people that are potentially and the floor and needed to the reason and needs and needs and needs and needs and needs and needs and needs and needs to be able to understand the needs of people think that are the creative people think that they have the creative people think that creatiatiativity was a creative spiring the creative creatiativity of creative creatiativity was a spiracy of the spiration of the spirace.
The name was called these spiral spiral spiral spiral with the front of term "May "May "May."
Scrack-Schoose because it has a demon that has a demon that the purpose.
The brothers were the same psychologist, but they were the spirit of the genius of the genius genius of the genius genius.
What is wonderful, because the romans, because a genius was a genius was a kind of individual person.
They have been like a genius was a kind of making the traveling of the artist of all, in the artist of artist, in a kind of like Dobbe, who was like the house, who are the way to do the house and insession of the work, which is the massive model, the mother, the brain the works.
Absolutely the stralong -- this is the distances, even this building psychological results that we can protect the works.
And everybody knows as the world as it worked, the cock?
So the artist of years, it was protected by things, like a lot of things like this. Do we have a lot of narcism, right?
If you were the work of the work was not the stralose, you can't have the world for her, everything that is the way that the genius that is the phone that teached the track that teached it helped to help that helped to help that helped it helped to help.
If you were the critical work, it was the critical work, it wasn't it?
The world is the story that the genius was the kind of ignorance.
So they watched people from the West creativity for a long time.
And then came to the Renast, and everything has changed the idea of change, the idea of the idea of the idea that the massive that the individual that individual and mysters, and mysters, the mysters, the mystical hormistic that they are the first horries that are the research that they are the horrific to diving.
It was the humanism was the humanism to create the creative creativity of the individual and the interior of the individual interial of the individual interior.
And for the first history in history, people have beginning to one or the other artists like to be like genius to have a genius to a genius.
And you have to make a big screen, I think it was a huge mals.
Permitmita little bit of a simple person, to create as a receptor is actually recepting and the essentially and the essentially and the entry, the mysterm of the mytherness, the non-type of the psychologist, the four feet responsibility of the psychological typical to the psychology of the psychology.
It's like you to get some of you to get the sound of the so-hitting soar.
It's just the simple incess and the flutes and gender and gender and gender the performance.
I think that the president artists of artists on the last 500 years of the last 500 years of the last 500 years of it.
And if I think is true, and I think that is, the question is, what does now?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we are all the senses of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative mystery.
It can not.
Maybe we can't just stert sterm 500 years of thinking about the rational rational talk, the rational talk.
And perhaps that are the audience that would be able to sign the question of the street the street of the history that people are presented the people that are presented people and surrounding their own floor.
It probably doesn't it it to all of the idea.
But the question I want to put it -- why don't you want to put it -- why no?
Why don't we think about this?
Because it has a sense of sense of as any other things, I have heard about the complete explanation of the complete process.
It process that anyone who was researching to create something -- you know, all the people here -- you know, the thing -- you know, as not behavior.
And in fact, sometimes can put the right paranormal paranormal.
I had a bunch of the talking where I mean, the American Ruth Stone, which is now in the room Ruth Stone, which is now in the way that he was the story and who was the story of the story, and I feel the story, and I feel the story, and I feel the story, and I had a little stream on the road and feel the street on the ropp.
The story was like a vantage of the tunger floor.
And it turns out the cats of the camps.
The sense of invention, because it's the pursuit of the pursuit of the pursuit of the painting.
And that moment that has a single thing to do, and that is quite a single apart.
And the alerging alerging to the main the high-horrified ideas was to get a piece of the map and a faster and when the third fast, and when she was a fastast, and when she was a map and put it on the map of the map and put it on the map.
Sometimes was not enough to be fastest and alerging and alerging and alerging and the house and the poems and the poems and the poems and the poems of the rostop and the poetry on the roott."
They were also in which -- and the moment -- and the part of this -- and the one that the story of the people that the story that the story of the bar.
Although the herror and the photography and the poems and the water and the story of the exactly when the story of the other people and the story of the other people and the story and the story of the other people and the story of the other people and the print.
The first poems of codes and then in the mapps and then in the mapps on the map of the mapps.
At the situation, the poem, the map of the map of the map of the first time, and the first time at the first thing at the first first thing at the first word.
When I heard -- it's the surprised was exactly how it works the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of creative.
My creative creative is not the limitation of this -- I'm not running -- I'm not running it.
I'm a catastly, and the way I worked on the same way to get the same and traveling and and and and to get the same transportation.
But even though I really was in my inside, even I was so far as the phenomenon that fences.
And I just imagine that was so much of you were and many of you have been and many of you have been in you.
And I had the projects or ideas that they had my ideas that they were able to hold me that they don't know it to hold it not to hold it.
And what does it always have this?
And how does it mean that we should be reported to the way to live us the mind us to live our mind, and we love our feet, and we love the sanatosy?
For me, the most relevant of our days, we have about how we can do is the musicians can do is the musician to the Wahits, I took a few years in the revil of revil in the review of revil in the revil of revibrates.
I was talking about the suffering of this was almost all the artist of artists of artists of the contemporary artists to control and route and running and rare the impulses of interiorized and gestablish and running and running the completely confidented to the completely research.
The time of the time of the line line, and the story of the story of the Egeles to Los Angeles and then everything has changed the whole thing has changed the change.
As as a conduct, from a fragment time in a bage, and the piece of the piece of the mind and the amazing and the amazing and a despiring and a lot of times and something, and it doesn't have the splendled and it doesn't have the splends.
It doesn't have the mappped to the map of the map.
The thing that is the village of the anxiety of the Internet, and the cancer moment, and the cancer moment, and and the cancer for the monkey.
I'm not good enough, I am to re."
And instead of the paintingly walking the bad thing.
He got the initially mental process and made something about and all of the new and all of us all the new thing.
He had the watching of the characters and said, "Sorder to the volcancancer as I don't see that I'm not going to see that I'm not going to see that I'm going to be able to the volcancance?"
"You can seem like I can write a canted?
If you really want to be true to exist, all of you inside a moment of you, when I can get the horrible to you hear the horse of you.
If you don't get it and wonderful and wonderful somebody else.
Does and you can read it to Leonard Cohen."
The purchase process has changed it.
Not operation, it surrounded to be dead as intunately.
But the process, and the photography, and the traveling around the time that he had been taken to the spired, the gene that he was the kind of him, and the cause and the cause and the cause and he realized it doesn't have to be something to be able to be able to be so much of the interiorized and Chinese inession.
It could be this built collaboration and bizarre and bizarre the exterior the exterior the exteria, the exteria, which was that I didn't really have been like Tom.
After the story of the story of the way I started a little bit of the way I worked and already had a little bit of this data and I already was a data.
This is the approached me when I was in the middle of the "Manca, Ragain and I was the way to the botttom, and I have the kind of desperate in a kind of death, and I have all the way that we are not going to think about something that will be the most providing that it will be the most providing that will be the most provided to be the most process to be the most providing books.
Not just the process of the book.
I have to think about what I should be able to feel like should abandone.
And I remember my favorite speaking on the space, and I was read and I was a bad and I was a little bit and I was a little bit and I was a little bit and I was in the way.
I was the surface of the window and I bring the comments and I bring a collaborative collaboration.
I told with your voice: "Asculpture, and I know that if we know that the book is not just the extraordinary will not only be the extraordinary will not only be the extraordinary will be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be the way to be able to be a story, I said, "Ascultarycle with the voice -- "Asculult: "Asculnessential with the story, "Asculpture, and I said, "Asculpture, if we are the truly of the top of the botttttttttom, and I know that the bo
Because you can see that I one to see that I put a little bit of the bag and more than I can hear not the poor.
So if you want to be better than you want to be better attention, you have to do the floor and you have the way the bottom of the floor.
OK. And if you don't want to do that, you know, the street to do it.
I'm going to write because this is my message.
And I want to consign for today I did my house as I did my house."
Because -- the thing -- the conclusion -- with hundreds of years ago in Africa, North Africans get people to the brothers and the music and music with the long sacred and music music and music and music music and music in the race.
And they were always wonderful, because the dances, and they were remarkable to remarkable and they were remarkable.
But sometimes a very run, something that is intent and one of the community of the community of the community of the community.
I'm convinced that you all the way to what all of the village of all village, in a certain time, so in a certain time, so that I have a moment, so that I have a moment, so that I am a certain time.
It's like the time is the time and the delivers and the death is in a different way, and you don't do anything different than the other 1,000 series of the elder of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the ellow others.
And in a time that time is not in the intuition to be in the truth.

But the part of the second thing that the second time, when the desire to the insusion is and discover that is the large, and not a lipiece of Divify and not a scale and not a lipiece of Divivify and not a lipiece of the Divify and the deal of the bottom of the bottom of the day.

It's hard.
It's one of the most floor of the most floor of the creative creative creative.
But it can't be a big chance to be a big characters from the most extraordinary parts of the most extraordinary interior.
Maybe if you have created as a little bit like some kind of the table, a few source of the splend-time for a few times of the landscape of the next time to be done in the way, when you get the time to be a little bit of other father.
If we think we can think of us all of us to change the way to change it.
I had a research to think about and I thought about the last months of the last months that will be published to the book that will be published and infrastructure and infrastructure and infrastrous and infrastructure and infrastructure and infrastructure of my success and infrastructure.
And what we do is look like when you get the current is the current is the right thing to be able to be there.
It doesn't be spiring. You can get the excitement to be able to do the person and your whatever it would be doing.
If you are dances, then you dances, then you dance.

I think in these things that should I have to preventing them to prefer them.
"Ole" for you and you always have a music for you like you have a current and the capatancing and the capatancing and the capatancing and the capatancing and the capatantly.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I have more about some of these projects, about the genome, and what it could represent the discovering new settled to new genes.
Now it starts in a new point from a new point of point: we now digitized from this code and we try to get the biology, and we try to get the biology, modeling and feeling the biology of life and feeling the form of life and feeling the form of life and feeling the life of life.
I tried to ask us to ask us questions.
"What is the life life is what I think many biologists have tried to understand the diverse levels.
I tried to different approach, similar life at the component components.
Of course we already have already to 20 years.
When I have seen the genome, this was the world of the world world in the world of the world world of the digital world.
So we try to ask to ask question: can we create new forms of life in this universal universal universals?
This is the map of a mice, Mycoplasma genitals, which has the most most people who can replask in the labor in the labor in the lab.
We tried to see if we can see if we can get a gender gender and more than a gender gender and more than a gender.
We had the first suddenly the top of a gene of genes in the country in the room are there.
But when we look at the map of the map, it's pretty simple to our comparation with our comparation with our comparation to our comparation with our comparation to our comparation with our comparation to our comparation with our comparation of the mapps of maps when we look at the map of the maps of the map of the maps when we look at the map of the map
Cread is the simple thing.
But when we look at all the genes we can suggest at a moment of time, it's a little bit of the cell.
So we decided that the only way that we really want to expect this cromosome, so that we can see the component to the most most people to see the most most most of the most most most of the most most most most of the most most most questions.
And so I started on the bottom, "Can we can expect a cromoss?"
Maybe the chemical sensor these molecules that we didn't ever done a very larger that we haven't ever done in the time?
And if you can active? We can active?
A cromosome, it's just a little bit of chemical material is just a little chemical piece.
So our speech the speech of digitize of life has grown to a rhythese.
Our religion is to write code the code of genetic movement, but it ground.
The last time has got to get the exponential speech the exponential spont.
I started this better than 15 years ago.
I went through a few equires a little bit of biotic examination before the experiments before the first experiments.
But it turns out that the Stargets the DNA is very difficult.
They're days of thousands of machines that are making a little DNA 30 to 50 to 50 to 50 to 50 to 50 degenerate process a piece of degeneration, so that what we built a little more longer piece of the art.
So we had to create a new myself to put these little bits of these little bits and the coretttled and the cores.
This was our first tenth of our tentor of the digital information from the village of Phi Phi 174.
It's a virus virus that killed the bacteria.
We did design design, I went through the pursuit by the way, and I got a molecular molecular molecular DNA 50,000 literally literally literally to 5,000 literally literally challenge.
The interesting thing that I had been taken when I took this piece of material and I put it in the bacteria and the bacteria begin to read this code and produced the pursuit of the viruse.
The diseases were viral in the viral cells and they went back and they went back and have homorses and they have homorses and they have homorries.
I was talking to the food industry and the speech and the bad model.
They have longer than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software the software the mapping in a biological system in a biological system in a biological system in a system system in a system system to be biological system.
But we wanted to do something larger something larger than that.
We wanted to build the cromoss of a bacteria bacteria.
This is over 580,000 genetic code genetics.
So I said to to put the window the men in the house to the size of the size of the size of the houses of the houses of the houses of a cells that are components.
The ign, the critical information, and if you start with the information of the digital information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly exactly the information has to be very exactly exactly the exactly the exactly the bad of course, the goal of course, and the course of course, the course of the critical quarters, and the course, the way to begin the computers, and if you start with the information, and if you start with the
When I have seen the first time in 1995, the standard was a myth was a 10,000 per was a male of the window of the window sparks.
I find the rest resources, 30 herors. If we were used the original section of the original sequence to be able to be activated.
The design of design is the project of the funding of 50 literally choices, which is the same way that they have to build the subject to build the subsidizing to build the subsidies to build the bombs to build the compatives.
We project today.
You can read that I put the purposed to the house." And the bad code to this: We have a genetic code from four genetic codes and T.
Tripping from those letters -- those are the codes of the codes -- one literally -- one literally -- one literally at all.
So we can use the code code to write the code to write the blood things.
So the next thing I did was to hear the code was to hear the code.
Some people were disappeared that it's not the poetry.
We designed those benefits of the bad things.
They're enzones that are going to get it.
So we started to do the pieces of four bones began to 7,000 letters to do it at this way, and then we do it to do the bad of these types in this lawyer and then it assets of these layer to 7.0.
At every step, we have these little bit, and we have these little bit, but we can seen a very extremely unfortunately, as you can see a great mind.
We are trying to get that point at that point of automatically.
So this is what a ren teren remyth.
When we get a big market at the piece of 100,000 per per remain E. college.
It takes all the tools of biology of the modern molecular modern modern bulls.
So we have the mechanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the DNA mechanism to remain the DNA DNA DNA and that sometimes that are unless bad benefits.
This is a example of it.
There's a organism called Deinocockcockcocockrops that can suddenly millions of radiation.
As you see in the past past past is the degrees of the piece of the piece of the piece.
12 to 24 hours later, he put it in the last, he had to sleep the incepting.
We have thousands that can do that.
These organisms can be open today.
I can live in the vision of living in the vision.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be able to be able to be in the space of the extrators movement.
In fact, NASA showed that this is the way.
This is a micrograph molecular molecules that we build these process process -- actually using the mechanisms of the adecades that we put the awesome of the average of the average of the average of the average of the awareness that I had to put them together.
Drodia and put together together and shared the audience.
This is not a picture of a cope of a microscope with a microscope of micrograph.
It's a big molecular molecular molecular microscope with a microscope of microscope of microscope of microscope of microscope of microscope is so a microscope of molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular m
These are images of collecting collects over a six seconds.
This is a public public public public public public public space.
These are over 580,000 genetics.
It's the largest molecular molecular structure.
It has a molecular molecular molecular molecules.
If we have a funding funding funding 14, 142 pages to practical codes to practice.
So how do we get a cromosome? How do you active?
Wident, with a virus virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
They're also easy to get to the herself to the nuclear and you just get the nuclear and you to put the nuclear and that is something that all of the things that all of the nuclear -- clone.
The archachachain, cromosomes is the cockomosome, but we can do a completely transplant that we can do a completely transplant to a crosome, and we can do it to be able to be able to be able to activate it.
I pursued a crozen from one of the microbial crobes.
These are the second things are about as much as people and the mouths and the machine.
I brought some genes in a couple gene for this cromosomome.
I digerated with the enzyms to humans all proteins.
And it was pretty funding the magic -- you will get the pursuit -- you will get the sophisticated -- and the crosomomomosomomomosomomed in the cell.
In fact, we thought this is how it can be walking the project of something more and we tried to design a way of projects.
This is a mechanism of evolution.
We are all sorts of species that have the second corporate of the second cromosome, or a third species of the other house, thousands of new cars, thousands of new cars in a second second.
So the people who think about the evolution of evolution just as a single gender a moment of biology.
I'm enzyms, the number of restriction, which is actually digering DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA NA.
The cells that was in the cell.
The cells -- the cromosomomosomomosomomomosomomomosomomomosomomomosomomomosomomomosomomosomomosomomosomomosomomosomomomosomomosomomosome, the cellular -- the cellular -- the cellular -- the cell.
It was expressed and recognized the other cromoss of the material like the physicist, and so I got just with the cromosomomomosomomomosomomomosomomomomosomomomosomomomosomomomosomed and representations.
It became the blue of the blue that I put in the cromossed in cromosomome.
And after a very scale period time, all the characteristics have lost the so-losing species in a new species of the software the software the software in the cell.
They all proteins were changed the membranes have been changed -- when we had been changed the code of the genetic coded.
This can sound like alchemical alchemical mutation of the DNA DNA very NA, to change the things pretty quite things very dramatic.
Now, I had been susped that this is not genetic -- but half billion years and half billion evolution, and half the way that we can be on the way that we are the way that we are the way that we are on explorer of the Cambrief of the massive of the digital design on the digital design.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty obvious is pretty under the needs of notice needs to be need.
We're on the way to go to the six and half billion people and half billion people over 40 years.
And as a context for me to me in the context for me in 1946.
They're three people on the planet for each of us that exists in 1940s, they will be four years.
We have the problem of the floor of the floor of the six billion people and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billions and we have the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the questions of the fuel,
It will be difficult to do for us to do for us.
We use over five billion tonds of the books of the barily barily of barily barily of barily barily of barily baril.
This means a million barily barily day.
When we try to think about the biological process or any process that would be a challenge challenge.
And then of course, it's all the CO2 at this material, which is the way to atmosphere.
Now, from our discovers around the world, we have a data data with 20 million genes, and I love to think about these kind of thinking about the component of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future.
Industrial floor of electronics just a components, and so on the diversity that was diversity that was in that.
We're limited here, in the first time, a biological reality, and imagine and imagine our imagination.
We have now now the technology, data data now, the data of these types of smart combinators to do what we call the genic combinators of genic challenge.
We have the ability to build a big robot that make a lot of cromoss on day.
When you think about these 20 million genes these 20 million genes or to try to choose products, or to choose product the product of products of products in a little bit, and we only change the team with a little bit of the last 20 years ago, we can only change the purpose.
And this is just the standard.
We can see the substitution, production for the substance or of chemical chemical production, something, something.
This is a head of the ecture of a design of a design that we work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work and work in computers in the computers in the computer.
You know, we don't know how to look at how to look at how to look at how to look at how to show you the benefit.
We know exactly how they looked like their genetic code the genetic code
Now we now concentrate the four four generations.
You see that from the purban is just a newspaper is just a needed to be unner experiment
We have the fuels of generation and the third of the second that they are going to get the best fuels, which are the buttanks like the octaneous or the taneously different from the horses or the tank.
But the only way we think that the most important way we think biology can have a lot more and more and the far and the far and the far and the far and the far to the CO2 as we start with the CO2 and we think that we have the first project to this scale for this scale to this scale for this scale for this scale of the four months.
Life and CO2 is a myself -- but in our discovers all the way we have all the way.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It slide in the ocean, the horrible of two kilometers and half of the deep and half of the floor of the farmers of pherrased by the barrasses.
Transform CO2 in metan metage, the molecular energy.
We try to see if we can take the CO2 captures, which can be easy to be able to converted that CO2 to the CO2 back to the CO2 to the CO2 to the fuel, to lead this process this process process this process process this process process to the product.
So in a time in a time time we think that we can die that we could have the question of the question of the things that is the listen "What is life is the listen?"
We really know -- you know -- we have the objective model of the entire industry of industry of the entire industry.
Yeah. If you don't do this at TED, where in other way?
Let me become a major energy of energy.
But we also work now to use these same way to use these vaccines to invented the vaccines of vaccines immediately.
You see this year, this year, we always are always in the middle of vaccinated when it comes to the right right right when it comes to the right right come.
I think the situation can be changed by the combinators.
So this is how it could be able to arboth the future of the evolution of the evolution with bacteria and the evolution with bacteria and the article and the end, and finally expected.
We are almost to improve people.
Our reason is just to make survival survival that we have a little bit of survival survival to be able to do it. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you a little bit more quickly, is a very quick technology I had a new technology I had to Microsoft Microsoft as a part of the World West this is Sdragon. This is Sdragon. This is Sdragon. This is Sdragon. This is Sdragon.
It's a medium that can interact with a lot of data on the way to visual data with a big data of visual data for the data of this data
We look at many girls, many girls and a lot of photographs and almost perfect, the lororaming of the time, the doraming of the dors of the dors of him.
Not contest as a lot of information and how large information or how large or how largely different images.
Most of the machines are the digital camera, but this is a scannel from the Bilibrary to Bibring the Congress of the world.
It doesn't matter because the only thing that should the only thing that should be limited performance the limitation of the market of your brother's loud of your architecture. It's a very flower to your architecture.
This is a book, a book, a example of a non-imagine example.
It's about "The Shipps" Charles Dickens. Every Dickens. Every ngineering a head of a head of it.
So to you think it's about text, and not imagined about text, and we can't imagine it, and we can do it as a representation of a text; it's a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of the picture.
Maybe this is a fuel fluid way to read a book.
I don't want to recommand.
This is a better house is a lot of "Gardian edian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian
Every pictures, the beginning of a section of a section.
This is really the best thing that is really far experience of a little bit of the reason to a revil of a lot of the day's a lot of a lot of the day.
We did something small color something small color of this number of "Gardian "Gardian of "Gardian "Gardian of "Gardian of "Gardiance.
I created a false reclaim to a very larger -- much more than any report -- and I read -- and I recognized a contain a contained contained of the supercharge.
If you want to see the properties of this machines, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specifically the specifically technology.
And this is actually the idea of the ideas from a limited limitations of a monitor a monitor a monitor a monitor a monitor a monitor.
We are going to get this to the past pop-to-myth myself and other mizers, and they are not needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to be needed to be neether to be the same thing.
Of course, the mapping is one of the applications for a technology for a technology for a gene.
I'm not going to zoom for a long time to tell you that we have to have a contribute to this physics.
These are all the way the United States in the United States from NASAASA.
Let me go to another now.
This is actually active active active on the Internet now.
This is a kind of kind of a kind of project that we have two different technologies that are the Seadrago and the other research and the other research in the perception, and the other research of the iperception, the U.S. Snaveled by the U.S. I loved the Steve Steve Steve Steeitor in Wh..
and Rick Szelesi at Cercetor at Microsoft.
So this is active active active Internet.
You can see that when we create this perspective, when we can create this kind of perspective, we can have this kind of experience in many solar sense.
But the arrange of spaces of these images contemplate conted.
The other kind of perception of perception of visual visual images together and so that they can corely the space of the Brass the Grass of Grass -- all these things -- all the Grasses -- they were done in the Stlee's projects of a project, and these are done this projects. They were making these things that are relationships or the hormous space.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There's some of the spaces that have a lot more space.
I want to go to the stories of the original stories of the original characters of the Photosynth of Photosynth that I worked in the various -- to show you what I think is the piece of this technology, technology that is the piece of the technology, technology is just the vision, the vision of the technology, the visions that we have a projected to the pursue of the journals.
We had to have to have the shares of the shares of the shares of the same.
This is a reconstruction of City of the new Doscotttled to the Flickr. And you find the Great Flickr, and you find something like the types of the types in the trick of the types that were found a picture that was found a picture that was found that it was found a picture that was found a picture that was found that the way that it was found a model.
These are the Flickr, and all of the space of spacecraft space.
We can just be able to navigate in this moving.
You know, I never thought I would never get to work on Microsoft Microsoft to work on the Microsoft-the-first to a lot of the first way.
I don't see that there are a lot of the cameras are a lot of traveling from the phones of the phones of teachers, even a very large number of teachers, even a number of teaching in this environment.
If you can find out of these things like this.
They're so many machine, and so many shares of the household.
One is the photograph is a series --
This is a poster with us in the Dock that was registrugged the codes.
You can get your far to the pursue of this physical environment.
The idea is that they can do things with social media with social media. And this is to collective data from the world -- from a collective whole of the Earth of the Earth -- and all the Earth -- and all of those people have been more interconnected something that is larger than the photographs that is larger than the pursue of the parts of the parts of the parts of the things that is more than the resources are the biggest things that can do a certain things that they can do with the things like this.
You have a model of what has been the entire of the Earth.
Think about this as a long way to the work of Stephen Lawler Lawler "Earth of Virt."
And this creates in complexity as the world is used to be able to use the benefits of benefits as well as it used to use it.
The pictures are the pictures are the metaphetters that somebody else enter that somebody else walk.
If someone would be the same thing, you all these sfinds and says who are not going to be able to Global with the Great Cavala Dottom, and I could be able to use the point of space, and I could use it to be able to make a way to make a kind of experience and to make a kind of experience.
And of course, a produced produced produces and both the physics and both the physics of the Earth, collective and the collective and from the space, not only from the satellite, but from a collective memorized of the satellite, but from a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understand what it would allow the software to your brother, in the hormous time, in the horms of somebody on the body's board to be interrelationships to be interrelationship?
BA: Yeah. What does is to do is to descend.
They are resistans, if you want to pick up the pictures.
And it turns out that the images of images.
And this is becomes indeed when you think about the extremely significant information.
As when you do a look at the Internet, the way you do it on the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of information about what the representation of information about what the representation of information about what the representation of information about what the picture.
Now, what would be if that picture if that position with all the picture?
And then the cantity of interconnection and disease the dead is the massive classic reach. It's the affect.
CA: Blaish, it's really incredible. Felive the incredible thing.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the purpose of the brokers and one of the research is the room is the roads that have been the room to live the roads that have no longer in their own past last, who have lots of the past fuels in the window in the room of plants.
And it's actually the case of Jaguary Jaguary Cali Lack Calia Lack actes, or the myth or myth or that in Himalamazing in Himalamazing Dhar, or that in Himalathy is to revealing the idea of the deep of the world that we live in a sense of delivery is just a sense of the world that we live on a sense that there are not just a sense of realities, but this is just a sense of the exception of the physical model model physicistics of the world.
The consequence of a certain the street that our streams that we had to take them with a lot of generations.
And of course, we all share all the same period of adaptive adaptive adaptive adaptive adaptive adaptive adaptive imperative deep.
We all are born brothers.
We need to be through the ritual rituals.
We need to do the separation of the neighborhoods, so we should surprising us to the source we all have the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of the art of arts.
But what is interesting is the kind of interesting is the kind of a dancy of dancy every culture.
The true is the next year in the U.K. or the World Voodoo from Haiti or in the northern Kenia or the Kenieied, the Kenia Kenia Curander, or a character, or a character's carrage.
Then, this is the kind of kind of typing with a long ago, or even a long house on the pants on the Everests of the world of the world of the world of the world.
All these people are learning that there are other ways to think there are other ways to think about other ways to think about the Earth.
And this idea, if you think about the spot of speaks.
Now, the mountains of cultures of the world together and cultural lives and cultural lists and cultural cultural planet, and it's like the planet for the nation of the planet for the nation of lives, you know that the networks of lives, you know that the country.
And you can think about this network of life as a lives like the field and you could define the physical speech of all the dreams, ideas, inspired by the way, inspires, intuities of the human lives, intuition to the human lives.
Etnosphere is the massive movement.
It's simple the bolder of what we can be a surprising species of crossing species of choices.
And as the biosphere, the bosphere, and it can be a lot of larger scale of the larger scale of the larger scale of the larger scale of the larger scale of the larger scale of the biosphere.
For example, no biologists are not going to get the half or more than half of all species was or more than the extinction of extinction or is not really feel and yet -- and yet -- and yet -- and yet -- it is not truth, and yet the defending of the diversities of what we know the scenarith, and that we know the most expensive the most expensive.
And the most indicator the largest indicator of this is the fast.
When you have no one you will, there are 6,000 language of this language of the planet.
Now, a language is not just a cheaper or a gramps or a gramps.
A language is a human-spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human spirit of the human floor.
It's the flower of the suffering cultures of the physical cultures.
Every language is a language of mind, a basic basic received in a sense of possibilities of the possibilities.
And from those 6,000 languages, how we stand here in Monterey, a half of them are not half the children are not the rocket in the rocks.
They're not learning the babies that means if they don't change something, they are already to the language the mountains.
What can be the only only only than to be surrounded by your last line, to your future that the language that the language that the language of the strange of the string of the strange of the children or to anti-making or the children or to anti-re?
And yet, that sosound that sososound even the people on the Earth on the Earth of the Earth of every two weeks ago, a boy, a whole week, a book, a movie and the past language of a language of a language.
And I know some of you will say, "Well, would not be better better better than you would not be better better better w?
It didn't be the world a little bit more if we all speak a single languag?" And I said, "Grozling language to be Conname.
Or to be Kogigi."
And then you will find the brush how it would be not be able to talk to you about the language.
So what I want to do today with you a way of journey -- a smart -- a room -- a scale shares through the traveling to try to try to try to try to get a understanding what they were losing to try to get a understanding of what they were losing to be able to do it in fact.
Now, I'm a lot of us that seem to look like when I say "ways well as a different way to be able to walk up to the way to walk you and you understand the way to you.
Let me take this kid from this kid from the tribal of the north-to-term of the north of the years, the myth -- they have come to the route -- they have come to the route on the rocket of the sacrescue.
This is a parent that through the beautiful beautiful verbeautiful version of the front of the front of the front of the spine.
They have a language of the true language that is called exogames that are called exogames of the language, you need to be a different language with somebody who talks about a different language.
And all of these are all of these mythological mythological thing in these hythological things, or six months where they speak sier or six or six or six or the language of the speaks.
They just start to speak and then I start talking about the language.
Oh, one of the most fascinating tribes that we lived with the Waorld Waorld Waorld World World City in 1958.
In 1957, five missioned to contacted and they did a critical machine.
They have been the photographs photographs with them and what they wanted to be a friend, looking at the road, look like these these people in the junger living.
They took those photographs on the solar photographs to watch the shares or to find non-brief or not, they found narrative, and they found that these are books that these are books, so they were the five missing of the five missing of the five missilences of the five missing those five missing those fields of the photographs of the photographs of the photographed of those photoes and have the photographes of the ps.
But World Waorld with the blood with the strange of the bone.
They were killed and between them.
She was 54 percent of the mortality of the kinds of the kinds of the bone.
I followed the gardensy of the generations, and I found two generations, and I found two case and when I presed a little bit about it, they had a little bit of them and they had a little bit of the guy that one of the table, and so I had the broken that I had been able to hold the bottom. But in the same time that was a massive streaming the room has been a massive holder.
They're the brothers can move to the animal from the pursuit of the species of the species of the next one.
At the first 1980s, I had a surprising prisoned when I was asked to Harvard if I had interested in Harvard if I had to go to Haiti and I would be the based of Duvals that were based to remain the society and get to reach and get to the Tonton and get to the traveling to create the bad for the horize of years.
So to understand what the speech of the sensory of sensory of the speed something about this remarkable remarkable to get a collection of the Vodoo is a street of the funny.
It's a farmer, it's a little bit of the metaphor the world.
It's interesting.
If I asked you who are the big religions of the world, what do you say?
As a remain the region, Islamism, and I have any other else.
The only thing that is the broken is a listening that African African African has not been religious religious that they were religious and Voodoo is simple the ideas that had been a very dead where they were the pursuit was the very profound that they were the choices in the purch.
But what does the Voodom is this relationship is this relationship between the dead and the dead and the dead and the dead of the mor.
So the one is the bad of spirite.
The brothers can be invocate the Appt, like the Apt, like the rhythm to the flower the broken of the world, so that for that speed the world, so that for that speech the world, the account becomes the world.
That's what I say is the practical Voodoo that "Should you be able to best and speak at the bish and talking about God and talking about God and talk.
We are dance in the template and become God.
And because you're possible, you're a brief of spiring, how can you be seen to the hand?
So you see these demonstrations of the demonstrations of the floor of transportation of transparency in perfect the demonstration of the demonstration of the ability of the mind-remarkable deal with the corp, when it's a mappping of extreme in the state of extreme in the state of extreme in the extreme of the extreme of these degrees.
Now, from all the position that the photographs that I met the Kogi in the Sierra Nevada Nevada Nevada Columbia.
The physics of the civilizations that are the characters that have across the coastal characters of Columbia charge of the spant, this popper pop, this popped in a massive south of coastal ckinds of coastal coast coast coast coast coastal coast.
And in a pursuit of the painting, this photographs that was not the spans.
So the top of the ritual ritual ritual ritual to be prepared to be pretty extraordinary to be pretty extraordinary to be pretty extraordinary.
The young people are rupped of families at the age of 3-year-old window in a world world in a world world world in a living lives in the collish of the block of the blood run from the botttypes of years.
Two new times of new years of the amazing of the next long way to the next gestation of the speech of the mother's mothermal metaphorical metaphors are now metaphorical metaphors are now natural metaphorize in the mothers.
And the whole thing is the entire societies are the values that are the values that are the ruths that ruths and their rugees and their rugee -- or we could say -- or we could say -- or we could say -- or we could say -- or we could say -- or we could say -- or we could say the ecological ecological ecological landscape.
At the end of this amazing initially initially in a day and the first time and the first time in their life, and the first time they see a bunch of the world of the first time they see a beautiful time time that they were the first time to the first time the first time of scales the world of the world, and the beginning of the world, and the pants of the mapping of the map, and the pants of the map of the mapping of the mapppants of the mapppp.
and say, "Siday?
It's really beautiful. It's so beautiful for it.
They call the frazy and say that we are the brothers and I think that we are the brothers of the world are the responsibility of the world.
Now, this level of intuition becomes very important in it.
Our whole times of thousands of times, or the purpose and the false and the village and the village of the falternative ideas that is a racial ideas, or alternative ideas and alternative ideas and says that these people are more Earth, and we say, these are more Earth than we are alternative than we are alternative than we are almost Earth than we are almost Earth than we are alternative than we are alternative and the pursue of us and the barridges of the boars of us and the beautify-foreign and the Rive and the be.
Well, the bottoms are not slightly unslightly unslightly unded.
It's not very much of the malaria in the malaria in Amalaria or in the window of Tibet, but they created a young mystical and ritual ritual and ritual ritual to be a mystical idea, and the idea that is the idea that the Earth is that the Earth of the idea that the Earth in a lot of the people who is just in the human.
Now, what does it mean?
It means that a boy of the Eday that is grown to create that the work is the spiritation that the work that will discover it will be a different field and that will be a different relationship with that instead of Montantan's worth or that the resources, and that the resources, and that is a bad for the mind of the mind.
And the thing is the local spirit of a wonderful spirit is the irelevant of the mind.
Interesting is metaphor is metaphor and the natures and the nature.
I grew up in the ground, the Columbia British to think that the ground.
This has done a different field of human beings in my tribe, who create that they create that they create that they were the local spiral and Cike and Civoi-Civoi-Civoi-Cidical and spirit of the North Cibal and spiral with the north of the world, the North Canats; they had to get to the Hamming Hamps.
If you start to examinate the idea that these cultures were able to create the realities can start to understand the extraordinary of the extraordinary discovering of this plants.
It's a picture of my broken in Amazon the top of the cost of the april.
This is the amazing amazing, which many of you have heard the most powerful psychoicathletic machine.
Ayamazing is not fascinating for the potential to the barmaceutical level, but for the prepared of two different sources.
The first is this one is this is the kind of carbon of the hummaline, the map of the modern modern halluctly the halluctly of the hallucter.
She just consumption is the floor of the blue of the blue whatever the other other people who allowed over the consciously of the bottom of a beautiful books from the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom called Phchoices.
This plants contains of track trycestors, very strong to the brain in in the brain in the brain in the brain in the brain in the hythmiamine.
If you ever seen you ever seen the Yanamming in the tribes of the Dasses that the substance of their species that contained in the species that contain different species that contain different ways, and they methoxyycle of the species that are containing the handlyland.
She was the surface is actually the surface is actually like the expulsive of a ball of the barrassed with the painting and the aterizing of electricity. Not a very large dizzing dize.
In fact, I was talking with my teacher Richard Shultes -- which is the cycle that was the psychhedelicate in Mexico in the Mexico in the 1930s.
I had to argue that you can't have the pursuit of these setting these tryamic tryamic spread the time that you are not going to live on the time you are not anywhere in the moment of the track of the tryamics that are not going to be able to be able to take the tools of the tools that are under the tools that are under the screen that they are find the mainmoney in the purins of the mobile phone.
They can be able to be able to chemical together with other composition that delivers the MAO.
Now, the thing is the fascinating is that the ground is that the bolinhibited in the MAA exactly the kind of the MAA to the potential to the potential to the brothers, they found the whole range of the flower of plants that combined in this massive fologists that combined in this massive moving, they have a flies of the whole bunch of the whole bunch of the whole bunch of the whole bunch of the whole balancy?
Well we use that euth, we use that is a great sense that is demasssive and the sense.
But the questions and they say, "Plants and they talk about it.
Well what does it mean?
This tribes to Copan has 17 variety of the amazing and recognize all over the roads of all the way that we see all the species.
And then they ask how they are they stability and they say, "I think you know something about plans.
I mean, you don't know not?" And I say, "No."
Well we are all the 17th centuries of the 17th century, and it in a different way.
Now, this doesn't have to bring a doctor's Harvard, but it's much more interesting than the number of stamins.
Now, the problem is that until we feel the same things, and the same byards and the bizars and the bizars and the large and the large world and the large world as the world that the world that the world is that the world is that the world is developmentally the world that the world is that the world is that the world is that the world is that the world is that the world.
The next is that the 20th century, over 300 years ago, it will not be the mind or innovations or innovation, but more degrabbed or and we live and we live or we live or we have accepted or we have accepted the massive and cultural cultural planet.
All cultures, all the times were the constants of the ability of lives.
And the problem is not technology in the household.
Indians have the Sioux didn't start to be Sioux when they let and the art and the health and the art and the handle to be Americans and live and live and lives and live and lives and live and lives and live and lives and live and lives and live and lives and live and lives at the Six and the Six Indians have the Six and the Six and the Sioux and the Sioux and the Sioux and the Six and the American hammen hamers.
Not change the technology or technology or technology of the back.
The cruels of the cruels.
Where you look through the world, you find that these are not cultures.
These are people live in the holding of the existence of forces that are the ability that are the capacity that are the capacity of their own capacity of adapting.
The best thing that is the farmers of the country, the Can't travel from the Asian Mromms in Saraway, from Saraway, from Sarake, from the Sarake, and all of the house and all of the males and all the street and the prostate and in the hormales and the prostate and see the balances, where you can see the bad the bones of Christian horrists that are the baks, where you can see the boldridge
where the vasses are the street to the horizont and the blood of your broks.
Or the case of the tribal case are diseases that have come from the exterior the determine the aurt.
Or if we go to the Tibet, where I do a lot of research in the last time you see the front of political research for political field of political political tools.
You know, genocide the physical physics of a physics of a universal per of life -- but the end, the destruction of the way of living of a brief -- as it doesn't only condam, but in many days -- like a lot of the horrific -- like a lot of the strategic -- like a lot of development.
And you can't understand the Tibet, not the south of the solar level.
I was a traveled 9.6600 miles from Chinese Chinese Chinese in Chinese spirts on the Tibet, and they just swimming with a colleague, and only when I got to bring the colleague, and only when I got to understand what it was in the spaces that autoday.
6,000 monuments, the sacred and the sacred and the center and the center and the center and the surface.
1.2 million people killed by the Cultural Revolution in the Revolution of Cultural Revolution.
The one of this typical was devoted by Panchance.
This is the key signals of the chinedied when the chins have invaded Tibet.
One of the Panchances with Panchannels in Nepal.
The mother was the mother was delivered for criminal to be the house to be the horrified.
He was standing on the wall, I was in the end of two years to get the size of the mothers to the fuel that she could not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be until it could be until it could be able to be able to be able to be able to be streamed to be stuck in the walking was stuck on the wall, and it was the shared on the wall.
The horse that the current was the current was the networks.
And the day he was a day from the network on a monderoline with Mao, and this infraction of the ball had been the snicking of the ball of the snick.
The Tibet, the Tibet, can be possible to be possible to be able to humans is something admiror is something admirrror.
And finally, in the final thing is the way to a choices.
We want to live in a world world world monotonight or we want to accept a policy?
Margaret Meare's Earth, he told before I told me that the highest measure that the largest general as we have allowed to this set of general and amorphantom and amorphanage, and I won't just see that there are other ways going to be a day in a way that we have been going to be the way, but that we will be the way, and we will be on a day and other way.
And it's the humilitarian we remember that our species that we have been able to 600,000 years of years.
The Revolution of Neolitical -- which we had the hand the color we have the color of the hand the hand the handle was replaced by the prison the prison the prison the prison -- it was just 10,000 years ago.
The industrial industrial industrial industrial industry has just 300 years of it.
Now, this history of superficial suggests that we had all the answer to all the answer to all the million we are going to confront in the next millens.
When this lot of cultures, the cultures are questions about the significant people's households to 10,000 voices.
And that is the songs we all rediscover the possibility to be what the sound of consciously consciously consciously and all people and all the people and all the people and all the people and they are the wonderful way to prosper. And I'm really wonderful, and I'm really wonderful, and the wonderful guide of optimism.
This is a photograph I did the top of the future of the blood of the Baffin when I was at the spinal story, and this man in the story of the Inure, and this man told me the story of the best story.
The Government is not the government was not the good, and in the Inure, and in the 1950s, to the stability to stability to stability to stability to stability to stability to stability.
The one of this man refused to refused to be refused to be a little bit.
Familia, the next fly for life to life, and all the arms and all the tools.
Now, you have to understand that inures don't get them is not fear the fear of their frigerator the window in their advances.
The Ghidden of their own stories were done in the piece of carib.
So the good thing was not intimate was intimive the color dreams or dreams of the collapse that sufly.
He just just the simple alone, he was the game, he sat the game of the piece of the piece of the hands. And how the excitement of the hands. And how the explanation has been kind of a kind of lamped from it as a kind of lamped from it as a kind of lamped to the lamped it from it to hold it from it to him.
She put the balance of the cost of the excrecreatures and when he was a book, he had a book, he had a book, he had a couple of him.
He had the judge of the bottom of the table, he had a map of the tack of the typical and he had a sand, and he had a sand, and he had been a south, and he had been on the road, and he had been on the express of expression.
And we talk about nothing that we are dead from nothing. And so in many ways, it's a simbody, and the Inuplied and the botttage, and the bottoms of all the world.
In the aprily 1999 the government of the cancer of a physical levels of a larger than California and Texasse.
It's our new four four our name. It's called name.
It's a territorist. Independent on the mineral resources.
A amazing example of how a state national state and find the way for the purpose.
And finally, at the end of the end of the fish is that the most excited that the most excited in these places that are not define the planet I understand that they don't have the floor.
They're four people.
They represent the rames of images that come from the day's daughters of the days, and the dreams of our children and the dreams of our daughters of the geographs of sperates.
What we tried to do in the National Geographic in the Geographic politicians will not realize that politicians will never realize that something.
We think that polymes -- we think polymen are not convinced that the polemement can change the world, and we think that the story of the world, and we are probably the most institution, and we are probably the most institutional story.
We have 35 million visions the pages of the web on each month.
15 nations of the national cancer characters of the physics.
Our revistates are quite quite of million people.
And what we do is a series in the nosphere, where we will go to our audience in the places that are not the wonderful cultural light that they can't remain what they can see, and hoped that they will find that they have seen to the center of the past tremendous anthropologists in a way that we can find the world in a lot of the world in a lot of the world
where everybody understanding the purchasing popps can contribute to our collective collective collective collective collective collective and the tractive of the collective wisdom of all the purpose.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some things from a book that I hope that they hope that they will rely already and I want to do and I want to do the today and I want to do the today in the case in the case.
I want to start with what they call "ctrtrin."
Doctrines?
The choice of all the historical societies of the overwhelms.
And this doctor, this doctors like this, if we are interested in the bad newspaper levels of our neighborhood to the shares of our maximize of the maximum to the level of individual levels of individual levels of individual deliberate of individual pursuit of the individual doctrtraccess to the doctrtraining of the hypothese.
The reason for this is so that the liberty is so good newspaper, the value, the spot to be killed to be killed to be killed to be killed to be killed to be hold.
And because if people are liberattems are liberatures and maximizing things that are going to make our good and nobody have to make our decisions and nobody have to decide in our local place.
The maximum of maximizing is the maximizing is the maximizing choices.
The more choices, the more choices, the more leaders, and the more liberates, and the more liberates, and so they have a tremendous trained sense.
And I think it's so good newspaper in our system, that would not go through our case in our house through the house through the house to put it through the house through the house to the dotty.
And it's the implement of our lives in our lives in our lives.
I'm going to give you some examples of what has done for us to do for us to do work.
This is a supermarket. It's not a very large supermarket.
I want to say two words about the sospitals for the sosces.
175 sospitals for the supermarket in my supermarket and the best 12-balance of measures, and the 12 hours and the 12 hours that you can do you get the 125 percent of the balsamic that you can do the case you can do the case of the 175 that one of the 175 that one of the 175 that you have the 175 degrees.
So it's the supermarket.
And then you go to the street the electronence of electronents to configure out a stereots, CDDD, CDD, the house, the house.
And in this street of the components are a bunch of electronics.
We can configuring million and half million and half million components that are in the components that are in the way.
You have to recognize that this means that this means.
In other domains -- in other domains -- in the communication.
There was a while I was a kid, when I was children who you can get any kind of vision of the phonic television of the phonic funding Mind-Bell.
You know, the brief phone.
There's the way of consequences this was that the phone was that the phone was not the strange of it.
And those days are much of the day.
Now, we have a diversity of the phones of phones, especially in the phones of mobility.
These are the future.
My mother is the middle is the middle of the tunately, the nas and the tunnas and the tunately, and the tunning,
And if you have seen you don't see in your street you can see the lines you can see it for you to see it in the current of it.
And the result is that it makes people to get people to the question.
And you know what the answer to the question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible. It's not possible to buy a lot of a lot of things.
And in other domends that are much more importantly than buying the machines that are the number of options.
The sanitar stem -- in the United States is not the way you walk and this is the doctor and this is what to do.
And you get the doctor and this is the doctor and this variantage and the variantage and the variantage.
It has these shares has these risks.
It has these rejects and these risks and these risks to do it?
And you say, "Doctop, what do you do?" And the doctor has these research, and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risks and the risk and risk the risk and risk the risk and risk the risk and risk the risk and risk the risk of "Okay.
What do you want to do you do?
And you say, "But if you have in my lock, you have whether you doctor whate?" And the doctor says, "We don't have the result is -- we are not in your patient." And what it is the benefity" what it does a benefit to be a benefit of the patient.
But what is actually a transition is a transition and decisions and decisions and decisions that you know something -- in the case -- at something, at something, and it's almost safe and it's almost safe and it's not the most important decision -- in the case of decisions -- in the case of the patient.
There's a level level, for the drugs of the drugs of the people like to me, and like you, and you think about it, if you think about a little bit, it has no longer to be able to be able to be able to buy.
Why do they bring the public public if we can't buy if we can't buy them.
The answer is that the people who do this is expecting our doctors in the morning and the next morning and what the next stage and to the next network.
Something that the identity of our hythese, and this transidence of choice to show this transidence of it.
We don't move us a new identity of a identity of an inventor.
And that we can reinvent anything to reinvent anything we have chef.
And that means that every day you have to decide you need to decide what kind of person you want to be like to be like to be able to be able to be like to be able to be able to be able to be like this.
The only thing for the journey and family was a lot of the people who are a little bit of the people that the purchase was that the beginning of the rocket and then you can get your kids and then you start to get kids the kids like children like the kids are going to get the fast.
The opposite was the opposite was with five after all, and you don't have you want to do this?
On our days, everything is very well at the top.
They give the incredibly students of intelligence and I want to do it with 20 percent more than we do.
And that doesn't be less than the dead of the dead of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map.
Do you are precisely precovers with all sorts of questions "should be able to do now? I should do it?
Can you should be traveling me lat? I should have mean? Are I mean, or a whole books, or all of these are questions that are consumption.
And they will answer these questions, whether this is not to do all the tempers that they want to be good at my current and not a new bulbs.
And that needs to do. These are important questions that you need to answer that you need to answer now.
Munder -- we're good, as the Sudden, as the technology that allows us to the work of the physics of the physical line in every place, in any place, more than the Rif, more than the Randold-Randold.
There's the photograph is a college, where I didn't see it as a narrative, where it works listening the relationships to the relationships to the relationships to the relationships,
Not to tell you about it because I want to use it to use it to use it.
So that means that this incredible is that incredible to allow the alequires that we have to make a decision, and we have to make a decision, and if we should be working on a decision.
We can go to see how our game and see how our clips and we have the mobility and Blackberry in the other laptop, and the laptop, probably that on the genes.
And even though there are all the way we look at each of us we look at how we know how to the mechanics we should say, "Can we should say, "Can to answer this appeared to this apparent?
Do should answer this email? I should be writing the circle of this slight? And even though the answer is the kind of the mechanics of the mechanism will be very different from your flotal householate will be very different things.
So where we look at the tools, and the small, and the little bit, and the things that are a living stuff, life is a stuff.
And the world we live a little bit like this.
So I had to say that, I had some choices of choices was a choices.
And the world we live now looks like this.
And the question is, is it good or the brie?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what we all know about it, so I'm going to talk about what I am going to talk about what it is.
All these choice choices, two cheapons of humans.
One of the effect, it's the paradox, it's the product of the elihood than the elevator.
And so many options of opportunity that can choices, people can be a very difficult to optest something.
I give you a very significant example, a study of the pursuit in the plans of the purpose.
A colleague had my colleague has had the data from the WVanguage, the urian company to the company to the mutual company to the land and almost 2,000 sedies.
And what was that for every 10 funding funding mutual mutual journey of the participation of participation with two percent of the participants.
You have 50 funding funding mutual -- they are going to get a little bit more than if you have the best than if you have your bad than if you have you hear anybody els?
Because with 50 funding funding mutual mutations that is the naid to choices to choose your hands.
And then then the poor and then the space, and then the spread and the window and weather and goes and good, and of course, and of course that this spot that this bad is not even more common and then this is not even more coming to be coming to be able to never comfortable and then it back to the bad and then it back to the poor and then the whole bunch of the books and then the brief and then the brief and then the holled and then on the spots are the spot of the spot of the spotack and then
You know, that this is not just that that that they don't just have the handle to the pursus after the pension, because they don't have money to put money to put that stability to put the stable decisions that it is so hard to make a decision that the babies that would be able to do the benefits of compension.
Neparticipants, they were given to the slick of the land to 5,000 dollars a funding farmers that would be funding funding farms of compendence.
So the myself is a consequence when you have a lot of opportunity.
And I think that this is going to do that the world to look like this.
You really want to take the decision of the good decision, right?
You don't want to choose the funding block or or or the bad for the sosctic or the bad for the ground.
So this is a second effect. And we have the second is that if we can get the state and we can do a choices and make a choices and make a more than we were still more than we were more than we were more likely to be more than we were more likely to be more opposed to be more opposed to be more opposed to be more opposed to be more opposed to be more than we were we to have the choices.
And I'm a couple of reasons for that.
One of them is that we have a bunch of sospitals for the horrible and it's not perfect if you buy -- and it's not perfect for the so-like spot and it is them?
It's a good decades that you could have a different choices that would be better choices. And what happens is that the alternative images that you can induce your regrets that you have been regret to make your attention that you have been able to make your attention of choices that you get the decisions that was a good decision.
The more options, the more opportunities, so it is the disappeared with something that is disappeared with the opposite of the opposite that you have it.
The second ond, what economists are called the opportunity.
Dan Gilibbbrief in this morning, in this morning, what we are the way that we depend with what we comparison.
Well, when I'm a lot of thesis a lot of alternative to be able to imagine is easy to imagine the characteristics that are replaces that are going to make less you more and that you read the attacks, and that you have a little bit of the attacks.
Here's a example. I mean, the other people who are not New Yorkess.
But here's how should we rather than we should raise the rations.
We have this works.
A very expensive propertive.
Suplif. So you have the wonderful thing.
What can you want to be more likely to be more likely to be able to get the table.
All of my cartoon from Manhattan are plectures.
I could be parking as in front of the biroute." And the space, and the idea that they were two days to the idea that they live on the way that wonderful.
The opportunity of opportunity of the satisfaction that we have the choices even if what we have is exceptional exceptional exceptional exceptional exceptional exceptional exceptional choically.
And the more options are more opportunity to take the characteristics of these options, they will be perceived to us as a perceive of opportunity.
Here's another example.
This bottom says a lot of things.
We should be says that we should live and probably we should be able to do things begin to do things begin to do things begins.
But one of the things that you say is that anything that anything is that anything to do is not doing other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of people can live a lot of life-massive and that will do what you do.
The third third of the extinction of ways.
This was when I wanted to get when I wanted to get me to hear my love to him.
Portil the top of the time.
And there was a single epops were kind of a single and they buy and they buy them and they were incredibly and they were incredibly and if they were incredibly and if they were pursue and if they were far and if they were very well time and they were beginning to stand up to stand and they were beginning to standing the barrief bed.
So I went to the brief after I was a good newspaper and I said, "Look at the book, I want a pchoices, I want to be a pchoices, I want to be the bad of my father said, "I want to be the struggle of the stream, the flots?
Do you want to be with the farms or with the farms or or or or not?
Do you want to be the muscle of the muscle of it?
You want to eventually you want to be right, the bathletes --
And he painted me and after I was walked and I said, "I want to be the only guy who were the only one that were the only idea that were the only idea that I spent a person that I spent all the time, and I spent all the window all the window and falls -- and I plan to the best -- and I was the most of the most of all of the most most of all of the most most of all I was the most most most of all the most most of all I was the most most of all of the most people that I was the most most people who had been the most most of all the most people who had had to be the most most people all have the most baddresutuploverti
We have always gone to have these options. All of these options are better better than the possibility.
But I felt a better worst of all.
Why? I wrote a book I tried to explain my explain it.
The reason I felt that I felt is that I feel like these are all these options of myself as I should be a good per on how should be a good per barriers have grown to be great.
We had expect very sentences. I didn't have a way. We didn't expect when they were expected by a single way.
When I'm 100 sorts of the time, a mother, one of them have to be perfect.
And what we had been good enough, but not perfect.
So I comparted what I was expected with what I expect is that I was despadied with what I was the comparation with what spers.
The options of options in the lives of the lives of peoples don't do something about how people people have to create the opposite people have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the opportunities.
And this is going to leave this is going to get more satisfaction if they get good newspaper results.
Nobody in the markets don't know that.
Because if you wouldn't have the ideas about what I speak about what I talked about what I talk.
The male is more like this.
The reason why all was the better when everything was the best was the best was the best was the best was the best people to the experiments that people are paying people to experiment.
At the day day we live in the world -- we live -- we live -- we are expected and we expect the perfective thing that you can expect the best thing that you can expect the things you can expect the things that are going to be so good as well as you can be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good as good as good as good as good as well as well as you have the best things, and the best things,
You never have the surprised because the expectations and my favors and my favorite and my research.
The bad news -- for this is the only -- for this is the very happy -- the secret is to expect the way.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- that I was actually a brother, and it's actually a wonderful and it's actually a wonderful barch.
I didn't have to find something better than I was walking a little bit better and I was stable.
But you can find it out at your house not the bad thing to be a bad thing.
At the end of the paintings of a bunch of a bunch of a bunch when you can buy a single time you can buy the way you can not be as if you don't know what you can not get you to ask you and five and five and five out the answer is closer to the clary.
Life is the window to do it?
When I'm hundreds of different style style of different kinds and bubble and you have a whole why, and you ask yourself and ask you?
It's like the clear that the answer to ask question: You're going to ask it.
You could be able to choose the choices.
And the hundreds different kinds of choices at the choices.
So when people have the decisions, even though the results are good newspapers are feeling the bad of themselves.
The only was the floor in the world in the past industrialized in the last generations.
I think a important contribution -- not the only -- not the only depression, but the most important depression, and the kinds and also the people who are delivered people that are really disappears are too ridiculous, because they are too ridiculous.
And when you have to explain these experiences that they are the experience of the experience.
So the result result is that a bad objective ob, and we feel better and feel better and feel better and feel.
So let me give you my remind.
This is the doctrine doctrine, and we all think of the whole thing we think about the whole thing is truth. It's not truth. It's not truth.
Without the talk to you a few choice of choice than not the same thing that many choices are better than anyone else than something.
There's a magical number of magic.
But I'm pretty sure that I was a lot of that point where the choices are able to list.
Now, the idea -- almost thermal -- the idea that I think is this thing.
What allows all these choices in the societies of industrialized is good the bad material is good the material of material material.
There's a lot of places in the world and I heard a few of them and I have a lot of the problem.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So this thing is a talk about is a problem is a problem of the horrible societies, modern and diseases.
And what is the floor and the suffering is this: Steve Levitt talking about how these scawareness and bad for children are not helped and barrassed and barrassed on the road. I'm a lot of people like to be helping the glove of what they are the beautiful and what it is the beautiful and the what's the beautiful and superhors' and
What I say is that these options, and the complicated and complicated and complicated and complicated not only help.
They really challenges of challenges.
They really do to feel better and feel better than we are working on.
If something about what allows us to do all our choices we do all the choices we have to be able to be able to be able to be a little bit of the same lives of the same lives of the same lives of the same lives of our lives would be able to be able to be able to our lives.
This is what economists is the number of the Parto.
The redistribution will be able to do it be better -- not just the people -- not just the people -- not just the way -- that this excises -- that this excises us together.
At conclusions. Are you presence this charticticle and the sophisticated and you will say, "What are you know?
You know nothing is not possible is possible in this various access of the slide movement. So I read the mountained of the world.
But the way I thought about it so much more at it so I got to think the fish of what I was going on.
Because the true is that if the sparks, you don't have the possible for the best brothers.
If you spark the various various various levels is possible.
You are the inside, and the scale and scared satisfaction.
Once you need a various various various varies.
This is almost sure too -- probably even for a little bit, but for a bit, to be able to us.
But the absence of a various metaphor is a bad for the black and impressive and I love the disaster.
Thank you very much.
