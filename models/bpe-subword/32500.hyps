LHC. I did a TED I made a LHC.
And I got to get a and I promised to give a lot of the apart that it works that it works that it works
So here's the next one. And the people who haven't been here, LHC is the most experiment is the most experiment that was researching -- Cirkilometers of the Stremeters of the Stremeters of the conditioning of a billions of times a billion times of a billion times a billion times a second-shared second.
It's extremely ambitious.
This is the apart of the Geneva.
We do photographs of these mines Big Bangs."
I work at this time. It's the ATLASTLAS -- Lung, Lung, the diameter of 22 meters of the ATwo photographs here detectors here detectors to build the proportion of the ATSLATALS to build proportion to proport.
On the year last year later we started the first time I started the first for the first time.
And this image was making a ATLAS.
He cause a huge celebration in the room in the room of control.
It's a picture of the first fascycle that was the fashion the intreatment of LHC, the cycle LHC, the cycle deliberate in LHCC, the thankly, the therapy in the detector in the detector in the detector of the first fascycle,
In other words, when I see that when I was sepeak that image I stood on that the apart that is a huge process of a huge successful and a huge successful and a huge successful for the other way that is a successful thing about a very successful in other words, when I see that I was seping that image, when I see that image that image that image that image on that image that image on the time I was seper that image of the water that image on the water
I don't know that if that was the largest opens or that, when somebody went on the Google and his Google and the first page of the first page of this way.
It means that we did a cultural impact on the impact of the stiine.
After the seven a seven a sappeared with the apart, which actually had a problem with these fields -- these fields -- these fields -- these fields of aurt.
They're figured out 13 thousands of both that it works at the power to the power to the power of power to power to power to the power of power of power of power of the power of the power of the field of the field of the field of the field transport of the field translation of the 13 thousands of 13 thousands of box and transportation that you were giving a little bit of a machiners.
Now, the engineers in the engineers and says, "I can't transsport the attention of America's attack."
But I can do that when they're at temperatures are becoming the superconductor of superconductor.
So as a 271 degree, as a team of the street and the space, those are the field can transspace.
In one of the laws between 9,000 of the people over 9,000 in LHC, it was a fect defect of fabricatic future.
So as the company was inforward and the 13 thousands of both of both of electricity.
This was the result result.
This is more impressionate that they have the magnetic cants over 20 tons, and they deploy over 20 tons, and they deploy about 30 cities of the crowd of the crowd of the city is more impressed in the way to be presented to be presentially impressionate that you prepreprepresenting the food, and they prepresented to the foundation of the region that those those retirement of the magnets of the magnetworks.
So we deteriorated about 50 magnetic magnetighly magnetigh.
We had to get affair, what we have and do and do is and doing.
I reconted it all reconfidenced it out.
And now we go back to the magnetism and then the subteran.
Pana at the sfarm of the LHC will be like a new land.
We're going to go back again, and we have to take us to get in the ify or hyund, and we will continue to the research, and we will go to the unique of the universe.
Now, of course, as a way to a way, those accidents recognize about the important sense of the important engineering and engineering to the extremely reject.
I think that the fact that the fact that is so difficult to the fact that we have to do you have to be the HC.
I will let the words of a words of a Britant, Humphrage, Humphrage, and the water experiments of the protect of the protect of the protect of the protect of the protect of the protect of the death is not more dangerous for our minds of our minds are funny to our mind-inch, we are fine in our mind and our incherish is not as our lives, as well as well as well as well as well."
Thank you.
I wanted to start with the range to remember to remember when you play with the bottom.
And then you invite what you invite them to the water and they have the water and they have the catches and they are actually prepared and refigure out how to understand how to solve and resolutely intelligent and the relatively intellected and manipulate and manipulate and manipulate the spaced of space.
The space, the space, is the profound a big deal with a big part of the inconjured world of inconjured world.
So as we can figure out the IT inspired by this use, and we can get the inspired with the objects of the Pattant, and my collaboratory -- my collaboratory -- I began to the Jeevan Kalanthers, and what we would like to be used to be a computer, instead of this mouth of this mouth of the mouthern fuel, and we can be able to a flow of the mouth-inspiring of the moutheraphern and inspiring and the mouth.
So what we want to do we want to us.
And the question was so fascinating I decided to try and decided to try and decided to try to build Siftable.
On the short Sift is a computer a computer of a bisure.
They can be manufacturned out to perceive the recivil can perceive the food of a wife of a relessential reless.
The most important is that they're palpable is like the game as the bottom, you can miss like just the water.
And Siftables a new equally ecosystem of a new ecosystem of the digital manipulation of digital information.
And the money that these instruments becomes more constitute and constitute constantly constantly one of the other active ancestors of our active active active active ancestors and destruction to explore new and destruction to explore new and destruction to explore new insects and destruction.
I start with a few examples of example.
This Sift is configuring is configuring video gurns in a direction, and if you including the film of the philosphere in the way to the other parrace, and the rule of including the inades.
These portraits of interactive are constants one of the other.
So, if you put them on the other way to the other interest, it becomes interested in the way.
If they're inconjured and that, and I can get to confuse.
I can also feel and inclinical and incline.
We realized that we have an interesting involves of interactive interactive interactive ideas is that we can use the gestures of how we might be able to a shared lyme.
In this case, we have three Siftables that configuring as a galets and I can use them to hold the center in the center in the center where they will be ames.
If I was too much, we can get a little bit of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of it.
There's also interesting possibility for education, as a game for education, mathematics and loggical jobs and logical people, and to try to see things that we want to see the results of the results of the results of the results.
So here we -- this is a Fibonacial of the equipper program with a simple program and I do with a program
This is a common of the words of combination and a combination of combination and Boggle.
Finally, every type of the first intimate in the intimacy, and the massh and the mother I try to form the moment that I try to form with a dictionary.
Then, after the 30 seconds of the letters are reset of the literally set of literally square and new possibilities and new possibilities and new ways of research.
Thank you.
These are the children who came in in the Media Labor Media, and I had to try to the Media, and I had to try and movie a material.
I love it to the neighborhood.
And one of the interesting things that are interesting this kind of application is that you don't have to give them a lot of instructive.
All I have to say, "For work." And they know what to do.
Here you have some other people incancerate people.
This is the most tanar tester in our right now, the game in the right right now.
It seems like everything that I wanted to do was to put it was to put the Siftable.
So for him there.
This is a interaction of animature.
We wanted to build a instrument for the people who invent languages.
And this is Felix.
He can go to the argue of the project, just the ridical Siftables that affects the characters.
Here is the so-called sound.
Video: The mistake.
David Merrill: Now he went to a traction in the stage.
Video: The Tractor the beginning.
Good wooo! Yeah.
Miss Siftable, and Siftable, and the language can do the characters -- Video: Ham!
DM: I creating their narrative.
Video: Bunay!
DM: It's a final story with the open story of what it will be able to draw the way it will draw it will draw the baby.
Video: Zarara, the sick of the sick of the sick of the war --
DM: The last example I showed you today is a time to show today is a living instrument and the music and the music and the Siftables that we built the role and the role and the role and the whole role and all the role and all the role and bas well as well as and the babid-time and the benefit that I showed you and time to be a time and the one-
Each of these four different variations, you have different variations, you have to use it to use it to use it.
And you can inject sound in a successful that you can assembly you can assembly the typical down.
You go to the sound sounds like Siftable-Siftable Siftable to be successible.
There's the effects you can control the live and the filtrack and the filtry.
And you know, you get a certain and then they are and then include it sounds to help it to help it
It is the emerges like the tempt and volume the effects that are apply and see the second sequency of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the street the machines of the emergency of the emergency of the emerging of the emergency of the emerges of the emergency of the emergenc
Video: DM: Make with a Siftables in the Siftables of successful red, a series, a series, a lot of remore, a lot of remost.
Now a basic line.
Video: DM: My weapons I love a little bit of perceived one.
Video: Ma: Make the filter to the tobe, to control the effect of the trading of the trading of the listening of the lives.
Video: Maybe M: Maybe the inclinical inclinical inclinical or in a part or in a part or in a part or in a part or in a one.
Video: DM: May: May: May: May for more expression.
Video: DM: Maybe I can do the second time as a little bit as a little bit as a little bit of while the amount of time.
So I don't have to do the plan, I can improvise, month, months and mass in the window in the window in the window in the window in the window in the window of the window in the windn't.
Now, in sfars," I can throw the intreat the Sift of Siftable-volume, including in the stangle of volume, including in the stangle of the ganga.
Thank you.
As I see my passion is creating new interfact new interface, and the way that are actually working with the way that it works better with our brain that works are working on our brains and the body of our brains.
And today, I had time to show a coordination of this new space, and a few of design, and a few of the possibilities that I wanted to take them from the lab.
The Gand's that I would retinent it is that we are at the grandmother's new generation of instruments of instruments of the digital world of delivers that will add the world of our world in our world of our world of our world in our world of our world in our world of our resides of our rule that we would reach our retinier that I would reach to our world that we have to retiny the world that we
Thank you very much.
Asteppt with you to talk to you to talk to you to all the way to you all tie the tower.
I'm writing.
He wrote is my career is my teacher than I was like, but it is, of course,
It's all my landscape and fascinated love and fascinated a violation.
And I don't have the astepishing thing to do about it.
But these fields said, something like a little bit like a quote in my life, and in my book, which was my career, which has determined me of my relationship with my working.
And the things that we wrote is that I wrote this book, and the Mancy Rographically, the Rographics -- the Iube" that categories of all of my books in the world for a little bit of the world for a little bit of the world for a little bit of a bad mega-in-snational mega-in-in-in-seller international mega-innational wrote and a sense.
The region is that where people go where I go now, people go back and condamn as I would be condam.
Seriod, condamnature, condamn --
At example of ingrijors and say, "You don't have the themselves, you can't get the themselves?
Do you don't have that you will go to write your life on your life, you can create a little bit of the world that will be able to the world that will ever have a little bit of the world that ever be?"
It's very links, it turns out the insight.
But it would be more running if I had not remember that I had to remember 20 years, when I was a big story -- when I was a great deal with the same thing that I wanted to become a writer in a reaction of the same reaction of the same frict of the basic reaction of the same frict of the same friction of the same frick of the same thing.
And people said, "Do you don't have you have never never never have to successful as success?"
I don't have a jobs of the jobs will kill you will kill you will kill you kill you?
Do you don't have worker worker in this field and you will be in this field and nothing will be here and nothing to deadly the dreams of the dream of a dream of the window of the center of the center of the middle of the middle of the mirrror of the mirror is the fear of the intreat the end of your own degree of the worker and you will work in this area.
Something like this.
The answer -- the race shaped on the short answer to all those insects are "Yeah."
Yeah, you know, it's themselves.
And he always stop my food.
And you are themselves in in the way that people can never get a lot of other things that people can be intuitive.
As a big example of the big algorithms that are infricks.
But when it's talking about writing and I think about the work, and I still think about in the last time I was in the last time is "Why is I said, "Why?"
Is it something ration?
It's love to the love to the land to be the themselves, and they feel like it was enough to do it was a little bit of the Pamant.
And what is so specific initiatively initiatively that seems like our own own own way, the way in a way that other professionals in a way that other professionals in a way that other professionals are not doing it?
Matal example, for example, it was engineering and not reminded me of the engineering of the engineering of engineering that if you have a chemical inerging to be a deliver.
I didn't come -- John, John, John, how do the chemical engineering the chemical engineer?
It's just not just not happening to the same thing.
But to be honeybeekeepers as the sentence of the footage to be able to be able to be able to be alcoolic to be alcool-depressive and alcools.
We write a writers of insects, and we have this remarkable requires of all kinds of all kinds of all kinds of all kinds of the labels of the labor of the labels of the labels.
And all we have to do is to look at the number of moral dead the number of morning only in the mind of the mind of the mind of the creatively creative, which have died by the brain and the degree of the product of the prisoner-based and the degree of the neighborhood.
And even the same thing that didn't have hear that they didn't have a really shared destruction of the provide of your own talence.
Norman Mail, even though dirty to die, in the last interview, she said, "Each one of the books had a little bit more than my book."
A great tours of a great deal about a viature.
But we don't mack when we hear when we hear someone saying that I heard about that I heard of things so that we have absorsorbed with a lot of time, and it was a collective ideas and suffering and suffering as a collective ond, and it will be inherent to the art and the art to the art to the art to the art to suffer on a fine inherite.
And the question I want to add it today to bring all of the today are you here is: Is you are all with this idea: Is you have this ide?
You are comfortable with it -- because it is the living with the eye of the light -- I don't have the eye of this hypothese.
I think it's odiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodia.
And I think it's dangerous and I wish and I wants to see it in the future.
I think it's better if we incure if we incure to live the artists of artists to live it.
And I know that I was that because my case in my situation -- my case to me -- it would be very dangerous to me to my indeed to my caring to the indeeply of this hypothese, especially in which I am now in which I am now learn.
As a young example, I just have a 40 years ago.
I probably probably incent decades before the work before the works.
And it's very probably that everything I will write and with this moment to be judged by the process of my work that came to the street the land the last last last last last last year?
What would it be saying to tell the far from the way to the one of the one of the friends -- it's very likely to be a big successful to me to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be intamed to be a little bit of the far.
Oh, Doh, Does you know.
This is the gene gene that could do somebody could do somebody to get the nice to the nine of the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I just go to the work, I would go on that message that I love it.
And then the question becomes indeed, right?
And so I put a lot of meditatively meditatives, to work now, to go to the work, is by writing a kind of building a kind of building a kind of building psychologicals that are the protective protective, right?
I needed to a way, to find a way to the pastrally to be a safe of a safe, and my father and my father absolutely unfortunately, and the reactive that will be able to what it is.
And as we all look at the last year model, I started to the last year of time and I tried to the time and trying to see the other society and I tried to see that if you could have better ideas and more and more and more and more sanity-created art of how people creatively helping people creatively to the risk of art art of art art in the art of art in the risk of art in the risk of art in the last year of the art of the art of the art in the risk of the past year,
And this was this story to Greece and Roma and Roma ancient and Roma ancient of the ancient of the ancient of this ancient and Roma
So the mass of the mass is inched the city is inchance.
But in the Great and the Great and Rome, and Rome, and the creativity of the income from the homoks?
People belieativity was a spirit was a spirit of a help that people in a source of a source of a source and neighborhood, and needed to be able to understand the newspaper and neighborhood.
The Great these spiring spirit of creativity, the term of creativity.
The springs was the faimos because it has a demon that the shares of the shared departs.
The relief had the same shared and the sample, but they called the creatively creatively and aterial genius.
What is wonderful, because the romants didn't think that a genius was a genius was a critical individual that was a little bit of a little bit of enough.
I think that a genius was a kind of a divince of the divince of the wall, which is the way to the Dobby, the way you had the Dobby, and the insession and insession and insession and insession of the worker and the insession of the works.
Absolutely really, really -- this is the distanct that I was talking about -- that built the psychological result of your works.
And everyone known as working, right?
So the year year was protected by certain things that are really narcism, right?
If you could work was strallucky, you couldn't shared all the worker for it, everyone in the story of the world that you had helped to help the help.
If you were criticismed to your window, it wasn't completely complet?
Everybody knows that as the genius was about the genius was about it.
And they watched people in the West creativity for a long time.
And then came from Renast, and everything has changed and everything has changed the idea of the big idea, the idea of the big idea of the universe of the unique of the universe and mysteries and mystical inner for the creates that they get to divince the divince of divince that they get from divinced to divine.
It was beginning to the human beginning, and people have began to creativity as creativity of the individual inside the individual internet of the individual interior of the individual incer was beginning to the humanity was beginning to be the human beginning to the human beginning of humanism beginning, and it was the human beginning of humanism beginning, and people have began to creativity of humanism began to creativity in the human beginning, and the human begin
And for the first people in history in history, and the one of the artists of the artists of the artists of the artists of the game of the genius.
And you have to big street that it was that a huge error was mass.
Permite, a little bit of a simple simple person, and it is actually recepting and she is actually receptoring and source and the source and the ingern, and the ingern, and the insight is a little bit of a little bit of a lot of the psychologist.
It's like you you have a couple of someone who you have a so-hitcha so-
It's just incovocation and deforms and deforms of equiet and genuine all these inimages inimages of the performance.
I think that the pressure of this pressure artists one of the last 500 years of the last 500 years old.
And if it's true, and I think it's true, and I think is what we do right now?
Can we do things else.
Maybe we can go to the senses of the relationship between the brain of the creatively creatively and the mystery.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't just stand and we can stand and we can stand of humanista by a hundred minutes.
And it probably as the people in public public who would be asked to sign absolutely unknown to the testering people in the teacher and the people pre-based people in fact, which is that they reach their own flies and all of their own and all of their projects and all their own and all of them and all of their own and they are affected and they have affect the audience of people in the audience of the people in the audience of the people who are affected to the affect that we were affected to the outcomes of the outcomes of the people who would be affect to the outside of the outsidents of the outoutside of the aff
It probably not to go to the right to cooperate on this idea.
But the question I want to put it -- why not?
Why don't we think about how we don't think about it?
Because it has sensed to have a lot of the way we heard about the prosthetic explanation of the creativity of the creatively inner of the creatively inner of the creatively creatively inner is the creatively because it has a sense of sense of sensing in the sense of sense of sensing to the sense of something else of the sense of something else of something else of something else as any other than any other people.
And to anyone who tried to create something -- I met all the way -- I mean, they always have always been coming here -- you always have always shared the behavior rational behavior rational behavior that anyone rational that anyone rational for anyone who was trying to get a rational that anyone else of the beginning.
And in fact, sometimes can put together the right part of the anormal.
I had a lot of intently where I met the extraordinary of American Rush Stone, which now has been a 90 years ago, which is now the story of his life, and that was story and that was story and that when she story to the story of the wintample, and they had to work on the wall of the state and feel and feel and feel and they feel and feel and they had a state in the rops.
The story was like a vast antage of the air.
And they call it the catches over the roads.
The symmetry is the sense of the floor the floor the purpose of the leg.
In that moment that he has a single thing that is a single thing is, "To be the apatt."
And the alerga is the big appeared to the house was to get to the idea was to get to a little bit of faster and a faster and a faster to the fast, and when they were to get to the fast, and then he wrote on the map to the map to the map of the map.
Sometimes it wasn't enough to the alerga and alerga and alerg, but not the stood and the baby and the poemisolation and the poemissions and the poemissions and the poemissions of the road on it on it a "other poet."
They were and pointing in which -- and the point I will never forget -- moments that you have lost that story of loser that almost lost to lose the degree of loss.
Alerga home, the map of the map and the poem, and the poem, and the story of the exactly when they prepare and the story of the other's story and the story of the other's defense and print.
The poems of the poems and then the poems and then in the massshape on the massh of massh the masssh masslide on the massse.
And so in situation, the poemed of the map of the map of the map of the first door at the first year at the first of the first quest to the first quest the first quant.
When I heard -- it's surprised -- it's surprising my own creatively creatively creatively creative.
My creatic process not to this -- I'm not driving -- I'm not driving it -- I'm not run to the bridge.
I'm a catching way, and the way to go and go to the third and swimming and transitive and to travel and slide and slide it and stream.
But even me, even I was in indark in my indark and I was attacks.
And I mean, I was also like the same people were also also in many of you were and many of you have.
And I had designed and I had designed from a source that they had designed from a source that I don't know a hydropping to be a identified of the hydrop.
And what do you always have to do you this?
And how do we have to report us to report us to the mind we wouldn't lose our mind to help us to help us to help the sanatosy?
For me, the most relevant days, which is the most relevant of the Waits, which is the musician Waits, we took a couple of years ago, I took a revide in the brain in revider the revide in the brain religion.
I was talking about this suggests that and everyone else was almost all of the artist, what he was the Chinese artist, what they are trying to control and running these impulse impulse of creativites these impulse inably interrupted inably international inably interrupted to the interiors of the inably inably inably inably and the tools of the inably inabsolutely and all of the inabsolutely
In the time of the stuff has been linked to the story of a day driving on the autopic and then the Los Angeles and then everything has changed the change.
As the time I hear from a short of a short that comes from a mind that comes in a mind and the aircraft and the aircraft and the inspiration and a desire and a weapon of the splendy, but it doesn't have the water.
It doesn't have to food mapper map, it doesn't have the report reportofon.
And the one thing that is the old that the old anxiety growth of the moment, and the canner, and the can, and the canner, and the canny for the time.
I'm not enough to reach a good enough."
And instead of the painting, it just stop.
He reached the process of process and made something with all of the new and we all have a new way of us.
He says the catching and said, "Sorry, you don't see that I'm not going to be volunteer?"
"Do you know, I could be write a cancer in a theat?
If you really want to be really exists, you really get a little bit more right now, when I can get a little bit more than you can stop you can stop the way you can stop you can stop you want to give you a little bit of yourself.
If you don't have and driving and drawing somebody else today.
Two and deranjobs and you leave it on Leonard Cohen."
His his process process has changed this.
Not opera, operated to be the way to be as intunneling as intunning.
But the process, and intrend, and the agnosed around his way around his moment in the moment that he took the spired and he had been saying the way to his deal with his degree, and he had to come to where he came out of the non-income, and then he realized something that it doesn't must be a chinner and then it has to be a chinner and
It could be this collaboration and bizarre and bizarre and bizarre and the exterible conversation that it wasn't too much of the exterible that was not too was like to Tom.
And then I heard the story I heard a little bit of the way I was working and already had been working and already had a data.
This is what I saved to his middle of the middle of the romancy of the romancy, and I was a kind of a kind of a kind of deal with a kind of desperates that we all were all of you haven't be able to think about something that they haven't be the most progresrest and think it will be the rise to be the most process to be the rising that you will be the rising of the rising that you haven't be the most process to be the most process of the risk that we were the risk of the rising of the rise of the rising of the risk of the rising of the ris
Not only progress, but the most progress that book
I had to think that I should be able to think that I should abandon,
And then I remember all I remember all of the space, and I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried to me.
I went to the future on the manuscripped and I brought a collapsed of a collapse.
I said with voice to the voice of the voice and I know that if we know that the book is not just the extraordinary is not just the extraordinary is not just the window?
Because you can see that I put a battle at all of the way I had to take a handle and more than so I can do not me.
So if you want to be better than you want to attack and you have to do the fall of the way you do the fall of the way you do the fuel.
Okay. And if you don't do that, you know, you stand in the naid with all of it.
I'm going to write because this is my message.
And I want to consend that I did my father because I did my father was my way to my job."
Because -- the conclusion -- with hundred years ago, hundreds of years ago in North African people obesion to sarber and the music and the music and music and music and the music and the music and the sack of the race, and the sack of the rasar.
And they always were always because the dancy and they were teachers, and they were remarkable to remarkable and they were remarkable to remain?
But someone else, very rule something happens, and one of the interpret of the common from the common from the common from common from the common from the common in the common
I'm convinced to know what I mean, because I mean, all of you can all see all of the interpretation of a certain time, and in a certain this moment, like this is what I mean,
It's like the time is the time and the dancy is by a kind of a different kind of being, you open nothing than the other than the other hundreds of other people, in the other ones of alinia.
And in a time that it doesn't seem to be in the truth.
It's lighted light and light is the game is the game is the game of the divince of the divinity.
As you get the time when they were intamples that were and they said.
And I have the maintain the maintain the digns and they said, "Allah, the Doamname, Doamname, Doamname, Doamname, Doamname, Doamname, Dogame, Doamn, and they prepretend to the maintails and impresses and presented the maintains and they were the mainceived and the mainss and the

In Spain, when a interpret and report a myself and magic and the magic and the Great Allah, the Guels, the arm of the arm of the arm of the arm of the arm of Spain, the arm."
And we understood -- a farmer -- a God of God --
It's wonderful, because we need to need to do something like this.
But the game comes to the second day when the inequire when the inequally it is and discoveries are also a 1111 degree, and it's not a lipiece of Dield the Dield the window of the Dield the wine.
It's a dirty that I died and that the danger and that would never get to the same thing that never followed to the intimate of intimacy.
Could you be able to not be a little bit of the Dome, and he call it the Domes that they should be asked to his life,
It's hard.
It's one of the most long states accept in the life of creatively creatively creative.
But maybe not a big chin actually that if you don't believe if you don't believe that the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary parts.
Maybe you have created that you just create that you were improsed by a source of the deep of a few moments of the moments of the time of the way, when you get out of the way that when you get to the point of all, when they ineither inside the moments were inched to be called the time when they ineight times.
If we think about this way, we all start to change the way to change it.
So I started thinking about and thinking about and I thought and I was sure in the last months of the last months that will be published to the book that will be published to the fashioned and infrution of my father and infruit of my father successful and infruit
And what I do, what I do, when you lose the course is the courage is: you don't have themselves.

Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I still talked about some of these design, about the genome, and what he could represent the genome.
Now in fact, in fact, in fact, in a new point of view biology, and now we try to go from this code and try to go to this code and go to a new flight and pushing and symbol and symbol and symbol and symbol force and synthesis is in fact,
I tried to ask us to ask us questions.
"What is life life I think that many people have tried to understand many biologists have been trying to understand the diverse levels.
I tried to different approach different approach to the components at the basic components.
We already have already about 20 years ago.
When I was the genome, this was the genome, this has been on the world of the world of the digital world of computer.
Now we try to ask to ask to ask or we can create new form of life forces of life in this universe of this universe of this universe of this universe of this universe of this universe of the life?
This is the map of a little organism of a little genitalist, which has the small gene of the small gene of the labeling of the lab.
We tried to see if we can come with a gene genome, and small.
We had to receive a hundreds of a hundreds of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of the map of the metabolic is pretty simple to us to our comparish with us to us.
I think about me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can suggest at a moment we can suggest moment is a little bit of a violence of the cell.
So we decided that the only way we decided to be able to actually speak this cromosome, so that we can see the components to the most fundamental components in the most fundamental components in the most fundamental questions.
And so we started on the catch, "Can we set a cromosomosom?"
Maybe allows to the symolecules that we haven't done that we haven't ever done more of the datab?
And if yes, we can active?
A cromosome, by the way, it's just a chemical piece of chemical material.
So, our speed speed to digitize on the exponentially.
Our wrote to write code cognize movie and it grow up, but it grows up.
The last time he got to a close exponential curve in a curve curve currently currently in the line of the last
I started this 15 years ago.
I went through a few stage, I start with a bio-examination of bio-examinating experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult to the DNA is very difficult.
There's thousands of thousands of machines that do little little little DNA for DNA to 50 literally a process of DNA process process of building a longer piece of longer than the building longer piece of machiners.
So we had to create a new way to create a new way to put these little little bit, and it turns together and right all of the herrors.
This was our first tenth our tenth from the digital information to the digital data, to the genome of the Phi of Phi 174.
It's a little virus that killed bacteria.
I made design the broad of the training of the track of the DNA and we got a molecule of DNA four-degree molecule of DNA far.
The interesting interesting came when I took this piece of material material and I put it in the bacteria and I put it in the bacteria and read the code of the virus to read the virus to produced the viruse.
The viral articulates were then released and the cells and they came back and they have come back and they have the cells.
I was to go with the oil industry and saying that it was really clear and saying this model.
They run laughter than you want.
And so we think that's a situation where the software in which software maybe built a biological system in a biological system in a biological system of biological system of biological system of biological system and we think that's a biological system is a biological situation where this is a situation where this is a situation where this is a situation where this is a situation where this is a system where is a system where of the softw
But we wanted to do something bigger to do something bigger
We wanted to build the entire cromoss of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 little, in 580,000 genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic genetic in the genetic is the genetic is the gentlemen. This is the gun is over 580,000 literal is over 580,000 literally in 580,000 lets of the genetic in 580,000 literal literally in 580,000 literal schools.
So we said, "We have to put the walls in the house in the house to the size of the houses of the house of the house of a house that are components of a cell.
The person is critical critical and if you start with the computer, that information has to be very exactly the exactly has to be very exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly the exactly of the innet is critically, the critical is critically, critically, and if you start with the information is critical critically, and if you start with the information is critical to the digital information is cr
When I was the first sequence in 1995, the standard of the precise of a precise of a heroes of a wall.
I found the rest resonate resequally 30 of errors. If we were used to be used to be used to be able to be activated.
The design is design is design is designing that has month, which has long 50 literally surprised to the other other other solution to build the subject to build the subject that little little bit of the little little bit of the bars that are compatients with others.
We project too.
You can read that we put the "watermarkets in the house in the house code with this: We have a literally choose to the letters of the letters of the gangers: A, and T.
Triplef from those letters -- those are the literature, about 20 amino acified -- one literally a theory acid.
So we can use the code code, to write work, to write work, thinking.
And the initially, everything I did was to hear the code.
Some people were disappeared that it's not poetry.
I designed those broken that we can digggame with enzymes.
There's the enzymes and they repair and play them.
So we started to do a little little bit, began with five to 17,000 literally literally to 7,000 literally choices to do the babies of these sets in the lawyers in the lawyers in the lawyers in the rool.
At every ethwater, we have these little babies in abundant to have a lot of seven, and we try to create a very extremely removed to create a mind.
We try to get that point to that point of automatically automatics.
So, this is what a baskets of a baskets.
When we get very big piece of the market in 100,000 per purposes to the basic in E. collapse.
They are all the tools of biology of biology of the molecular molecule of molecular disease.
So we went to other mechanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the DNA and recombination that biology to the DNA DNA and that inside the DNA and that inside the DNA beneath that you had to be a little bit of broken that we knew that we knew that we knew that there is a mechanism and I knew that there is a mechanism called the mechanism called the D
This is a example.
There's a organism called Deinocockrocket that can suddenly suit can suddenly suit can suddenly hundreds of radiation of radiation.
As you see in the square in the square in the piece of the little bit.
12 to 24, to 24, he put it in the land he put it on the beginning.
We have thousands that can do that.
These organisms can be drawn as a total.
I can live in living in the living in the living in the living in the way.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the extra space of extraters, to find a new media and find new media and find new media and find new media new media and find a new media
In fact, NASA showed that this is happening there.
This is a micro-molecule molecule that we build these process process -- in fact, the mechanisms of the adecisions that we put the adequate of the athletic piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of a little bit of a little microro-molecule micrororographical microroro-molecule micro
Droja Droja together automatically,
This is not a picture from a microscopy with electrons, but only a future of the micrographics of the mouth.
It's so big molecule molecule, so we can see a microscope.
These are images in a collector over a hundred of about six seconds.
This is a public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public is a little public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public public
These are over 580,000 little, 50,000 literally cheese.
It's the biggest molecule making a definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely in the fine of the biggest molecule is the biggest molecule molecule molecule was the biggest molecule of molecule molecule making molecule makes people ever ever did.
It has a mountain molecular molecule of 300 million.
If we print a funny funny 142 pages and without space, 142 pages to practice this code code this code code this genetic code of this genetic code of the genetic code with a genetic font of a funny funny funny of a funny funny funny funny and without space, and without space, and without space, and without space,
So, how do we begin? How do we active?
Edenttivil with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to go with bacteria.
And you also also easy when you get to ekay, you can only get the nuclear and you can just get the nuclear and you to hear -- and it's something you heard about -- clone.
In the archain, the cromoss is the integrated is in the cellular that we can do a completely transplant that we can do a completely transplant it to a cell, and we can do it.
I pursued a crozen crozen species of microbial microbial microbial microbial crobial crobis.
These are the second is about as people and the mistake, and the mistake.
I added a few genes in a few genes that we can select to this cromoss-comosom.
I digerated it with the enzymes to kill all proteins.
And it was pretty amazing when we put it in the cells of the sophisticated -- and our cromoss-sophisticated cromossed in the cell.
In fact, we thought that this is how it can go to design can go and try to design the project process.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We find all kinds of species that have a very high a third of the cromosome, or a third of the field, and the other new cars, thousands of new characteristics.
So those who think about evolution is just like one gene is just like one moment they lost lost a lot of people who had lost a lot of biology.
They're enzymes called DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA
Cromosomosomes that was in the cell.
The cells -- the cromosomosomosomosomes --
It was expressed and recognized the other cromoss of the street material, and so I got only with the cellular cellular with the cells of the cells of the cell.
It became blue blueprint that we put in in the genes that we put in cromosom.
And after a very short period, all of the time of a loss of a species of a species of a new species of a new species of the software in a new species that we put it on the software in the cell.
All proteins have been changed members -- when we have been changed -- when we had the code of genetic code, is exactly what we transfer transferring the way we transfer transferring the farmed of all the proteins.
This can sound as a genomically, but we can mutual movement of DNA to change the DNA very change, to change the dramatic.
Now, I had been told that this is not the genesis not the genesis -- but to half years and a half years and a half of the evolution of the Cambridge of the Cambriant, which has a new version of the Cambriant, based on the digital raise, based on the digital design is a digital species on the digital design is not the genesis, in which it is not the genesis, we have been building of the massive of years old.
Why do we do this?
I think it's pretty obviously obviously in the point of needs to be a needed to be the needed to be the needed to be the one.
We're on the way to go from six and a half billion people and a half billion people over 40 years old.
So to put this in context for me to myself, I was born in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each one of 1946; in 40 years will be four years will be four years will be four years will be four years ago,
We have problems of hundreds of potable to shape the potable of hundred billion and half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billions of the six bills.
It will be difficult to do it for us.
We use over five billion books, more than 30 billion barrier billion barily barily of oil birth.
This means a hundred million barily barily on day.
When we try to think about the process biological process that makes it replaced to replace that makes a challenge challenge.
Then, of course, it's all that CO2 from this material, which is that the atmosphere.
Now, from our discovery our discoveries around the world, we have a statement data with 20 million genes, and I love to think about these designs of the future.
Industrial electronics only a paper or so that something, and this is the diversity of the diversity that came from this.
We're limited here, in the first time of a biological reality and our image and imagine and our image and image.
We now have now data and dated this technology of the sense of symtop of the genic sense, to do what we call the gene of genome.
We have a big robot to build a big robot that to make a million cromoss a day.
When you think about these 20 million different genes of different genes of different genes of genes or to make a product of the octor to produce the octor products of the octor of our little degree of our small biology than we can change more biology than the last 20 years of biology than the last 20 years of the pursue than the last 20 years,
And that's just standard standard.
We can select for viability, production for viability or the chemical production or fuels, or production of the vaccines,
This is a screening of a software of a software we worked on these kind of works, and to work and work and work to work and work to work in computers.
You know, we don't know how to show you how it will look at the time.
We know exactly how their genetic code the genetic code.
Now we concentrate the fueling of four generation.
You see that recently read that from the ethanola is just a very unned.
We have the fuels of the generation and the third that they have enough fuel that are amazing the fuels, which are the bigger or the key or the tant, or the killed or the tanm or types of disease.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without a lot of the cost, and the far away with the limitation is if we start with the CO2 men to the design of the project to design the project of this scope, and we think we will have the first fuels of fueling in four months.
Light and CO2 is a male and CO2 is -- but in our world of other ways we have all kinds of other ways of different ways.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
She likes in the deep of the ocean, about two kilometers and a half of the floor half of the farmers of the field of the fibers of the fibers of the fibers of the fibers of the farmer.
Transform CO2 in the metan molecular molecular as a source of energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 captures, which can be easy to be able to be able to convert that CO2 back in the fuel, to drive this process of this process of this process of the process of this process process that process if we can take a chase.
So in a short period, we think that we could be able to die that is the question of the living lives?"
We really know -- you know -- we have objective models of the entire industry of the entire industry of the entire industry.
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where in another party?
Let's becoming a poor energy sure energy.
But we also work now is to use these same thing to be able to invent the sets of vaccines to invented the vaccines of vaccines
You see this year, we always have a year with a year in the minus when it comes to the right comes to the right comes to the right comes to the right comes to the right comes to the right now.
I think the situation can be built built vaccines before combinators.
Here's how to arrange to arbored, the arbores, the arbores, and the evolution of the evolution with the evolution of the evolution with the game of the symbridge.
We are almost to improve people to have people to have people to have people
Our state is just to make survive that we have a chance to survive that we have a lot of far to survive to survive very long to be able to do this.
What I want to show you a little more quickly I want to show you is a fundamental technology that I had to Microsoft Microsofism to Microsofisy is now a year. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon.
It's a media can interaction that can interact with a big amount of data.
We look at a lot at many of the broad pictures and smart and dries and driving through this one, and by the perfect of the driving dden rearrange of the wish.
It doesn't matter how much information we look at the big information are these big collections or how big images are these images or how big images.
Most of the photos are the digital camera digital camera from the Bibrary of the Congress, is a 300 megapixels.
It doesn't really important, because the only thing that should limitation that should be limited to a sea system is the number of the monitor of your monitor at a very flight at a very flight.
This is a book is a non-example of the non-image example.
It's called "The "Casa a a Saa Dickens. Each Dickens. Each one cology.
To demonstrate you that it's about text, and not imagine, and we can do it so that it is a representation of a representation of a representation of a picture.
Maybe this is a artificial way to read a book in the formed electronics.
I wouldn't recommend.
This is a better case of Gardian edian edian edian "Gardian "Gardian
Each image represent a second-seconds.
This is really a little bit of a little bit of a little experience of a read experience of a research of a review of a very dimensional issue of a very dimensional media a a lot of dimensional environment.
We made a little college with this is a little colleague in "Gardian in "Gardiannel."
I created a false reclaim to a very big resolution -- much bigger than any clamic research, and I recorporate a contained content of a content content.
If you want to see the properties of the cars, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specifically and even specifically technological species.
And this is actually printed ideas from some ideas of the limitation of a monitor a monitor a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor that even a monitor this is actually getting to this right from this right from this right to a little thing really printing.
We hope to be this to meet the poppper pop-ups and other mizers, and the gene of this -- which are not needed to this -- which are not necessary.
Of course, the mapper is one of the applications for a technology for a gene of this gene.
I'm not going to fall for this time on this is just a long time to tell you that we have to tell you about this field.
These are all the drumes in the United States from the NASASASASA.
Let's go to another now,
This is actually active on the Internet now, you can do the verified of the verific --
This is a non-design project that Photosynth, which is the Seadragon between the other research. And the other research, and the other research, and the other visual research, absolutely inhabit of the computers in Washington, and the Aslog, waiting to the U.W. Washington, and the U.W. Wash. Washington, and the U.W. Washing of Wash.W.
and Rick Szelki at Cercer Microsoft. A collaboration collaboration --
So this is active on the Internet.
You can see that when we create that when we create these kind of perspective, when we can have this kind of experience in many resolution in many resolution in many resolution.
But the arrange of space, contest of these images really conted.
Algggentle perception of visual visual visual images together so that they can do the very very highly where these pictures are the Gras, all these people -- all these are -- they were taken and from the Canadience of a Canadience or the city of a projects of a project-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-visible relationships.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other media and environments.
There's some of the things that have a lot of space.
I want to go to one of the sets of the original sets of Noah -- this is a prototypical prototypt of Photosynth that I think it's a little bit of the rest of this technology that I think it's the piece of this technology is non-flight technology that we have a projected vision, is not only visioning visions that we have a projected vision.
We had to have to have to be worried by the slap of the shared to the weapons.
This is a Cattack of Cattack in the Domb in Flickr. It's just the Good on the Good on on Flickr, and you find something pictures in the rock of these conditions in the rocket in these conditions that was found that that was found a picture that was found that that the cores that was found that the cool.
These are the pictures on Flickr, and all of this kind of relationship in this way.
We can just be able to be swimming in this way.
You know, I never thought I would never get to Microsoft to work to work to work to work with a very measure to a lot of receiving here.
I guess that observation that I think they're a lot of camer: all the gama camer: all the gama very big number of teachers, even a very big number of teachers, even a very big number of environment.
If you can find out of these little bit,
There's so many male machine, and there are settle.
Something in here is a series -- here's a series -- here's the one.

And that's not less than it would be less defense because it would be less mapper the map of mapper map.
Would you be prepared with all kinds of asking me to the questions "Would you be doing now?
Should I go back later later I should have before? We should have me? Everybody els?" And the other questions that are the questions that are the questions that are the questions that are the questions that are the questions that you should be the questions of must be the question.
And they will answer to these questions, whether this question, and they don't have all the things that they give them a good note to my current and not a good note to my current in my currents.
And this is what they have to do. These are important questions that need to answer to answer to answer.
Mwork -- we're good, as well as the Carl and Carl with technology that allows us to work on the planet every single place in the planet -- less than the Right in the planet -- less than the Right from the River from the Right from the Resol.
Then, there's a colleague, there's a colleague, which I didn't have to devail, where it works are the relationship of wife relationship to the relationship of the wife of the wife of the third of the third of the then,
I don't want to tell you about it because I want to use it to use it to use it to be used to use it to me.
So this incredible means that this incredible is that incredible to choose that we have to do in the work, is that we have to do a decision, and if we should do it.
We can go to see how we play our photbball and and we have the machine and Blackberry in the other and Blackberry-in the other side, and the other one, and the other samtop, probably that the genes.
And even though all the prison every mind we look at the mutily mechanics of the mechanics we should say, "Are we should be answer?
Would you answer to this email? It should write circle of this short is the answer is the answer is the safe of the mechanics is safe that your mind will be very different from what was the very different than it was not differently differently than it was without it.
So where we look at where we look at and small objects and small objects and things that are a living stuff is a stuff is a stuff is a stuff is a stuff is a stuff of the opportunities.
And the world I showed that this like this.
So to say that, I had this kind of choices that we had some chestive thing, but not all of the option.
And the world we live now look like this.
And the question is, so what is it or bad?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what we all know about this, so I will talk about the question.
All these choices have two effects of hundreds of people.
One of the effects, it's that produce products, it's that produce products, more degrabband and fabulation.
And so many of the options that can choose to people who can choose to be very difficult to opt for something.
I love you very significant example, a study of investments in the world of private penses in the future.
A colek of my coleating data has access to the Vanguarian investment in the Vanguage, which has almost a million uses that has almost about a million use.
And what was that for every 10 funds of mutual mutual that they offered the weapons of participants.
You know, 50 funds of mutual funny -- they are getting less than if you have a little bit more than if you have a little bit more than if you have you off?
Because with 50 fonds of funding funding funny of the navigs that are going to be able to choose you have to choose that you have a shared and the hand.
And then the post-st-swimming and then the hands, and then all the hands, and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course that the road of the shared and it never comes to be never recognize the shared and then it him.
You know, that means that that that this is not only people will consume that those people will consume because they didn't have a little bit of the money to put money to put the stable to put on a decision, which means that it would be so hard to the funded of compensation that would help the project.
Neparticipants, they give the land to 5,000 dollars a year in the weapons of the beach, which would pay funded funny of compensation.
So the consequence is a consequence when you have too many options.
And I think that that makes the world to show that the world to look like this.
You really want to take your decision if it's good for everyone is for everyone is for all the sterity of the steel it?
You don't want to choose the investment of investing or or the sosystem or for the saving for saving a wrong wrong.
So this is a effect. And this is that we can do and if we do it and if we remains and make a state choices and make a little more choices than we were less to be more than we were going to be more than we were in the satisfy of choice that choices to option than we were to have a little bit of choice.
And there are a few reasons for that.
One of them is that we had a sospitals for the saving to the sospitals that are not perfect and it's not perfect to save the one for saving to the save to the save it?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choices that were better choices that would be better choices that you have been regret to imagine your own choices that you were regret to the satisfaction that you get the satisfaction that you get the attention that you get the attention to the arm that you do this is a good decision.
The more option, the more options, the more option, and it's define to regret something that you have a death,
Second, which is what economists called the opportunity.
Dan Gilmonstrategy in this morning, in this morning, what we have to be the way to the things that we depend on what we do.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative to take a lot of alternative is easy to imagine is easy to imagine the characteristics that you have a little bit of alternative that you have a little bit of alternative that you have a little bit of alternative that you have a little bit of alternative that you have a lot of alternative that you have a lot of alternative that you have a lot of alternative choices that you have a lot of alternative alternative alternative to be a lot
Here's an example. I mean, I am New Yorkers who are not New Yorkers that are not New Yorkers
But here's how to raise it should rather than that.
We have here in Hampons.
A very scaled properties.
She listen to the beautiful. They had to have it.
What could you want to be more than the dracuis? "Well, I think about the dracuate of the gust.
All of my neighborhood, in Manhattan are plecture.
I could even be as a broken brough." And the space of the idea that that they had the idea that they were writing the idea that they were a lot of days, and to have a wonderful place in the mind.
The opportunity of opportunity that we have a satisfaction that we have a choices of choices really have the exceptional choical.
And the more options of the options of the options of the attack attack of these options will be perceived to be perceived as a perceived costs of opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon says a lot of things.
We should be living clipped and we probably should be able to do things begin to do things begin to do the things that we should be began to start the things that we should be able to live things that we should be able to live the things we should live the clippt we should live the clippose that we should live the clipper we should live the clipper we should live the clipt and we have to liked.
But one of the things that you say is that while you have a choices of choices to be able to do not do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of stuff can have a lot of living and that will do you do what you do you do you do what you do you do you do you do you do it.
Third land, expanded, extinct waiting for the way.
This lovely lovely when I wanted to replaced me when I wanted to replace to replace my broke.
Port the fingerprint.
And there was a single story that black and they were also a single and they buy it and they were incredibly coming out of the common and they were incredibly coming out of time and they were very much time and they were very long time and they were beginning to stand up to stand up to stand up to the best beginning.
So I went to replace my brown to replace when I put my broki and I said, "Look, I met my old and I said, "Look, I want to measure the "I met said, "You're going to be the streets of the streets of the street?
Do you want to be with the death or with the farms or death?
Do you want to be the game of the mus?
You want to avoid them to the ball eats, you want to be, you don't termine.
And he photographed and after I said, "I me." I said, "I mean, I said, "I want to be the only idea that the only idea that was the only idea that I spent a problem that I spent a problem of the walls of the best ones -- with the best ones that I had fall of the best -- with the best -- with the best -- with the best -- with the best one.
I chose the opportunity. All these options have made these options have been able to choose the better and check that is better than
But I felt I felt me.
Why? I write a book I tried to explain it.
The reason I felt that I felt is that I felt all these options that we had this degrees of how to be a good ones of how to be a good ones of good news.
I had expectations very love to wait for a way. I didn't have a dependent on a single way.
Now when they're 100 sorts of his mother has to be perfect to be perfect.
And what I got was good for was good, but not perfect.
So I comparted what I got to was waiting with what I was waiting and the result is that I was defined in comparison with what I hope was delivered to what I hope to hear what I hoped to the floor that I had comparison what I met was comparison what I had to comparately comparished with what I was waited with what I was waiting with what I was waiting with what I was waiting with what I was waiting with what I was delivered with what we were dered with what we had to was thish with what I was thish with with what I was waited with what I dom
The options of options in the lives, in the lives of people can't do something else than to grow something that people have to grow about how people have to be the good needs of the option.
And the right thing that will go to less satisfaction will go to a little bit more result results.
No one of the markets don't know that.
Because if you knew you didn't know what I speak to me what I speak me.
The male is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when everything was better when everything was worse when everything was worse when it was a best surprising people who were worse in fact,
In the day day we live in the world in we live -- we live -- we have a way that we wake and you have a way that you can expect the best thing you can hope it is that you can hope it is that you can expect the way you can be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good at the time.
You never enjoyed because you wait for yourself because you wake up and the region me to my region.
The extraction -- this is what you all come -- for this secret -- the secret is to wait is to wait to have a reduse.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- I actually have a husband is actually a great husband is really a great husband is really the wonderful right now.
I couldn't have been able to find something better than I didn't stop anything.
But you can sit at your house is not so broken a thing like you walk out of the bad thing that you will.
And then a consequence of a bunch of a bunch of black that you can't get a single when you can buy a single way you can not be a single way that you can ask and ask you why that certain case and ask you how to come, and the answer is the clar.
The world is the windows. What do you could be able to do it?
When they're hundreds different from different style of different style and bubble and bubble you can be a disappeared and you ask yourself and you ask you?
It's as a clear that the answer to ask the answer to the question.
You could have been able to choose better choices.
And with a hundred different kinds of different kinds of choices for the equire for equiets.
So when people were decision, even if people were doing the squares are good at the defense are feeling of them, they are feel disappeared by the way.
Depression, the Depressed in the world in the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not alone, but important to this was not always to be depressions and also to be disappeared, is that people have disappeared because they have the standards are too right.
And when they need to explain these experiences are being being able to explain these experiences.
So the general result is that we have a better objective objective object, and we feel better and feeling more and feeling more and feeling the worst of all.
So let me remind you to remind you
This is the doctraining doctra that we all believe that we all believe and it's all truth. It's not true.
Without of the talking about a few choices better than not that many choices are better than you are not really really really better than some of the other than some of the one.
There's a magical number of magic.
But I'm pretty sure that we went to that point where we went to improved that choices the style of life.
Now, the idea -- almost most we ended -- the idea that you remember that is this guy that is this day.
What allows these choices in society in society is good in society is good.
There's a lot of places in the world and I heard some of them and I heard about their options.
The problem is that they have too little too less.
So the thing about the stuff about is a chestence of Western society and disorders, modern society.
And what is frustrating and paper is this: Steve Levitt talking about how these amazing the amazing for children and hard not help. I'm brown not help.
What I say I am I tell you is that these options, and complicated and complicated not only help.
They actually provocate the painting.
They really do feel better and feel better at all.
If something in what allows us to our society as we can do all choices that we have to be able to do a little bit of the people who have too little to be able to be very good for that people have to be improved but and our lives, the lives of our lives.
This is what economists they call the Paretype of Paretype of Paretype of Paretype of the Paretype of the Paretype of the economists that economists the economists you know what economists is what economists economists you know what economists you know is what economists the economists of the economists you call economists called the Parezero economists.
Redistribution will be income, it will be better to do us -- not only people -- not only people -- not only have to be able to distribute our choices that this excess excess us together.
In conclusion. With that the cities that the cities of sophisticated and you will tell you you yourself the fishers?
You know nothing about this is not possible in this various various various action of the poor a research on the world -- so I read the first time -- so I read the first time and I read the shot of the art.
But the more I thought I was more about it with the more I got to think that fishers.
Because the truth is that if you spark the various to be possible to be possible, you don't have the freedom of the freedom of the lemnife.
If you spark the various so that everything is possible, the satisfaction of the satisfaction.
You think about the confidence and satisfaction and satisfaction.
Anyone needs to a various across a various across across across across across across across across across a across across the across a across across a across a across a across a across a across a across across a across a across a across a across across a across a across a across
This is almost certainly -- probably not even for a fish for a fish for us.
But absence a metaphor is a metaphor is a retain region and it define and it defense and it defense deliver.
Thank you very much.
