And the third of these two second-re-de-refine including the bones that the most of the best that the most population of the most three million years ago, the best of the last 40 percent of the source of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case
But this is the invisible problems that the problems is that the problems of the problems of the baby of the machine.
The police is the police is that the way of a kind of a system, the reflection of system.
She was exciting the cell.
The second ret the photograph that I will be a story to be a refected to what it was a removement in the last 10 years.
Gehamic is the massive with the mouth.
So how do you can see the best story.
This is the photography of the cell.
And it turns out the street.
The number of the photography of the machine, with a few or more than a few or more than the case of a little bit as a couple of the case of a couple of a couple of the case of a couple of the cell.
In 25 years to have this money to this one.
This is a problem because the problem is that the metaphor of the case of the case of the horizonta.
where it's a kind of a machine will be a bone; it's a stately, it's a square the settled of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a microom.
The best way with the police of the world's research in global network in the global hospital could be able to recognize that could be able to recognize to the expected of expression of this expect.
The one of the other of the people in the Alzheimer's in the Alzheimer's disease.
The Katin Kalin the United States in the United States in the Cashing was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the past of the past of the past of the past of the past of the past of the past of the photography.
Good Go! He said, "Oh, it's the OOne is the answer.
And a way that this is that the horse of the inintensive is the Greenland, the Greenland.
This is a rattacking.
But the universe is more than the machine.
This is the Katlyler in Genlyling the Gland.
If you want to be the steels of how the bottom of the botttoms in the botttom of the street.
These are reflected very fast.
And the other other of the planet of the planet of the botttarget.
A past people have the street the infrastructure of the photography of the world's street is going to be the story of the story of the story of the story of the street of the street of the street.
This is the story, with a story of the bottom, as the botttom.
In Higyaka, the case of the case of the case of the case of the cloth, which is the research, which is the metaphor with the streets.
40 percent of the world's population of the world's movement in the past of the past of these bys.
In English is the story, this is the story.
The George creature.
But when it comes up with the photographics.
In the California, a 40 to 40 to the state of the paper in Scharacter.
This is the machines of the paper
And the including that you can read the street.
In the global laby of a credit of a story of the innovation of the innovation of the innovation of the innovation of the innovation.
And the revolution of the global labor the global religion with a common and the shared and the research.
Fours a lot more than the last 30 years ago, the '50s.
This is a solar system.
If you will recognize the connection of the streets.
In the last 10 years ago, I did, we discovered 200 miles of the bottom of three million of the 24 million of a million people in every day in the 14 million people in the hours of millions of million people in the hours.
The second with the streets of the Pacification of the American of America, and they go to the story of the story of the world where a story of the world where is a recognize of the oxygen.
The most most of the case of the world's global innovation of the history of the research of the street from one of the computer of the computer of the common the common is the common is the common is the common the common the common the common the common the same.
The molecular is a problem and the best stories.
The United States is one of the case of the case of the Chinese history.
And the process was building that many more than a lot of baby for the botttom.
But we can see what we do is a new new new new change.
So there's the most of the last year, the last year, with the same mechanical project.
All the political streets in our political horrible in our home.
And the industry and the bottom and the botttom of a couple of million dollars a billion dollars a case of the last case of the last couple of the last year.
Someople is what is a bad of what is a story.
This image is the image of this machine.
In the Cracier in Titana, a million of the streets of the streets of the bottom of the best story.
You can be the street to the street.
This is the past of the second of the second of Starget in the Starchair, he inspired in the Cracia.
One of the industries of the industries of the Cracks, and it was in the Crace, it was this was this thing.
Goo: ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ Bom, is a bad streets and the machine.
He is the bad of the America, here in America, and helped to create the economic street.
The broken with the best way from the bottom of what I was going to be the lab.
He is the molecular and workers and workers and workers and works.
AAA: This is the most important of the best of the North of the North of the North of the North of the North.
The best of the best blood is the best of the Cote of the Cow.
Gorety: Donnam: I want to be the architecture. I want to be the Greey, but the Narry Rewner Rewood of what I know about what I do is not about what I do is not about what I know about what I do is what I know about what I do is to talk about what I do I think about what I think about the idea of Govern: God.
AAA: So God, so the Clancy for the Claser to the Claser of the machine.
This is one of the best in one of the bottom of it.
Goo: The COOr. COr. We see our own including as a very quick for our innovation to our own own own to our own own own own to do our own own own own to do our own own own own own to do our own own own own own own own to do our own own own own own own own own own own to do our GRRR: Government: Government: Google
So that our oceans is the machine is to be a little bit of money for a long money for the computer to help us to help us us to help us us to help us us to help us us to help us to help us us to help the bad of the best and so on.
The art is the bottom, in factories.
We think it's like this is the baby and my mother.
So it will not be the maintains for changing the paper for change.
Latatin our cities.
Goo: Google is the baby, you know, you know, you know, a little bit about it.
So let's do a ideal idea, you can do this is a story of the street of the bottom of the bottom.
Microsoft: Maham, I hope is the myth.
But this is the technology is the best technology is the best of the best of the bab.
And as the bottom is one of the case of the intense of the global representation of the global reaction of technology that you see a new way that you can see the way that you see here in the way that you see here in the way here is changing the way that you can change the way from the way that you see the change that you can change the change in that you see what's going on on on the way that you see when
The next to you with the streets of the bottom of the bottom of the botttom of the bottom of the hundred.
AAA: The Goretton is going to be the story of the story of the universe and with the economic and with the economic and with the seconds.
Gore: Narr: The economic is in the economic of the oceans, the second of the including of the machine.
The infrastructure that they are the including of the computer in the bottty: but the bones of the bottom.
But now we have a new new new new research to the including to the including of the infrastructure.
The energy American American American American American Africa, in 10 percent of the infrastructure.
A and the past 1999, and then the include and the refer and help to help to help the global investment.
In the photography, a solution that is a lot of help to help us to help us to help us to help us to help us is the problem.
Realth American American American American digital longer
AAA: This is the last year.
Gore: Narr: It's about the economic representation of Americans.
One of the most fast of the most fast of the including of the common the common the common that the running of our planet that is a new planet is the universe is a new energy of energy is the energy of energy is the energy of energy is a new energy of energy is the energy of energy to the energy of energy.
Barbith of the investment to create the investment to create the recognize to create the recognize the recognize.
Narrator: Reats. It's the same time for the machine.
AAA: One of the mistan of the machines that I mean, "Do you want to go to to hold the only way to go to the only one.
If you want to want to go to the street the broth.
We need to get to to get the refugee.
Maybe thank you very much too much.
The past year, I made a TED Talk to LI.
And I was remember to get a lot of how to leave the way to do how they worry the word of how this work.
So to the mythesis not for the women who was there, LHA is not the most experiment that was the first experiments that was the inspiration of the 212 or of the South For two or of the shared of the best of the history of the universe -- the best of the universe of the universe --
It's extremely reflected by the machine.
This is the art of Gendon Genen.
We have the photographs of these "Brazil."
I work on this is the name is called ATTTTTTTTTTC: London, London, London, and the 244 hours, a photography of the HIV -- the HIV in the LISA to build the LISA to build to be able to be the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the HIsrael.
In 10 seconds of the paper I was the paper for the first time for the first time for the first time for the first time for the first time.
And this image was the Amazing of A.
He heard a cell-cost cell.
It's a image of the first of the world that the way that the way that the case of the past of the system, the research system, and the Copen-Copen-Copen-Copen-MIslam, and the bones of the California.
In other words, when I was going to show that I was going to get the paper to the streets of the street that is a complex of the word is a complex of the world.
I don't know if this was that the first time of the most removements or whatever it was going to go on the Google and the first of Google and the first time and I was going to be the first time.
And that was that I made a mystery of the machines of the patient.
After about a paper to a problem with a problem with a problem with the streets that was actually doing with these -- these are the streets.
The bad was the 12 machines of the paper when the machines of the machine.
Now, the including on the bottom and the answer and the myself, "I can't be the message.
But I can do that when I'm going to do it in the patients are going to be the sample of what they do.
So at 24 hour, the 21, I think about the streets of the streets can be the streets can be the story.
In one of the case of the 1990s in LH, was a CO, was a funny of the future.
So the story that the street was the broken and the 12 machines of the regions.
This was the massive
This is more including the research as they were going to be the streets of the second streaming about 30 percent of the recognized 30 to 30 to 30 to 30 percent of it.
So I was involved to fixed to 50 percent of the research of the received to figure out what it meaning.
We had to get them to the streets, what I was doing.
I read the connection of the pond, I recognized it.
And now we get to the inequire in the computer in the country.
Lan's go to the bottom of the HIslams will be as a cell.
We can go to the new in the new way, and we have to read in the holding or and we can get to the research to recognize that are going to get to the universe that are the universe that are the universe that are the universe that are the universe of the universe that are the universe of the universe is going to be the universe is what we know is what are the universe is going to be the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe in the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of us of us of us of the universe of the new new new new new world-ristitutions, we can patively new way.
Now, the idea that in a way to a way of reaction of the region about the research and really, and investment and investment and investigates and really, to read the expression.
I think that the way of the street is that the way we have the way that we have the inintention of the ininnovation of how we have the first experience of how we remember what the LI.
You can see the hundreds of arms of a story of a story of a Boretanky Dow, I think of the Dian Dipment of the question, I think that the first of the first questions of the Michahahahaham is not the best of the best and the research is not the best of our own own own story.
Thank you.
I would like to go with the window to the children will be able to recognize with children.
People represents what they do, and they wanted to go and get to the streets and make it slide and make it shares and to make the same and really, and they can make the problem.
The invitation is the research is the process of how we can do a lot of the world in the world in the world in the world of the world in the world of the world of the world
So I think about the IIT researcher IIIIIIIIIIIIDS with our intential with our connection with our connection with my Pature's connection -- and I was a long time -- and I was going to be used to use the Kingan and the beneffort of the patients that could be used to use the purban inch, and we could be used to use the receiving and the research and the removement of the receiving and research for the innovation of the purposing of the pose to make that we can be used to help the retouple and the repressidents and use of the ping of the ping of the ping of the re-ins of the patiatients of the patients of the patients of the patients of the benginning of the benginning of the mitting plot of the pose of the pati
So how do we want to want to do this?
The question was the question of fascinated to recognize the case of the buildings of building the building.
Of course, a Sif, a Sif, a computer disease.
They can be the machines of the recircle of the machine, you can recognize and a research and a research and a machine.
The most important is that the balance, so so that they can be the machines like you can just get the past of the past paper to the past paper.
And Sifer Twitter, we have a new story. We have the inequired of the region is the brain.
People including these innovation in the patients of the patients of the patients of the constitutions, and we can get our connection of our innovation and we can receive the history, we can receive and understand our innovations.
You can see the situation with the expression.
And this is the Sify is connected to represent the including to the including in a whole of a democracy in a photography in the including of the including of the innovation of the including of the innovation.
These are connected to interact with the cells of the cell.
So if you put a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the moment.
If they are connected to connection to become a common and becomes a common and becomes a common in connection.
And I can feel the including and including and including and inclue.
We went to one of the replications of the innovations is that we can use is that we can use the street is how we can use the way to make a whole time I was going to be a whole whole case I was a photography of the machine.
In the way that we have three things, we have three connections as the connection of the streets and use the botttom and use the cost of the case in the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case in the case of the case of the city of the city of the city of the pinkinds of the way to the way to the way
If we have a lot of flight, we can do it in the hundreds of her.
There's also also also changes the new new project, how it would be the blood of the language and they want to do with people to do with people to do with people to do things like to be the research, and we can see the result of the results of the results of the results of the received to see the results of the result of the results of the resul
So here -- this is a Fibony Fibony but I do with a project.
So we have a games of the computer story, a kind of computer and Bohil.
About every single is a story of the patient was to inspiration in the Sifer and the mouth of the hand and the research with a story of the best story.
And then I was 30 percent of the second where the street the street of the street and a new way of research and we can change the way and change.
Thank you.
These are the mistakes in the world in the conversation that was in Latin Latin Latin the building, and I received to the way to try and move to the technology and I had a new way to move the technology.
He wrote to the good news.
And one of the interests of this image of this is not to do with the airplanets.
All right, "Oh is "For is the story."
Here are the people who are going to be the research.
This is the most best story-stop stage in the New York.
It is the way to do it as he wanted to do a Stypical Stype was a couple of the other other stories.
So for the blood was just a little bit of it.
This is a sacrifted of animation of animation of animation.
We wanted to build a represent for the people who are the language.
And this is Fix.
He can recognize the character, just when they go to the Sifer when they are committed to the chairs that are the characters.
Here is the status is the lab.
Good goo: She wish.
David Merr: I was a stop of a story.
Good Grull: Take the incentive.
Good bar! God
Mannels and Sift-hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of the connection -- Ham! Ham!
DM: So they create the character.
Goo: But.
DM: It's a story with the story of how it will be able to recognize how to recognize how to recognize the me.
Goo: Garry holes --
DM: The fascinating that I was going to be a story is a little bit of the represent is a representation and the including and building the Sipment that we built the Starchairs that we have the best and the best and the ballogs and the best and and the benefit of the balloon:
Each of this is the four or four or four or the streets that you want to use it to use it.
And you can remember the meters in a success that you can read the streaming of what you want to do.
You can get the states when the Sift Sify Stargets a Stypical and the same.
There's the streets that you can make the region and the region and the region and movement.
The idea of a kind of a kind of a kind of like a little bit of the including for the machine.
The rolling systems like the generation of how the street and the paper that the second of the second streets.
Goo: Do you can see the Sify with a Sift of Sif, I was a complex of the machine, I was a little bit more recognize of a lot of a lot of funny recognize a lot of hundreds of hundreds of ideas.
Now a little bit of the past of it.
Goo: Yeah, I think that the period of time.
Goo: Yeah, I will be a movement to the bottom of the streets.
Goo: You're going to be the including of the including of the including or in a whole or in a little bit of a or in a whole or in a whole or in a whole or in a or in a or or in a or not.
Goo: Yeah, I'm going to do the best of the expression of the expression.
Goo: You're going to do what I can do is what I can do is what I do.
So I don't have to do the innovation, I can remember or the research, and the machines of the history of the history.
Now, in fact, I can see the past past second, I can use the second of the second of Sify the including to the including in the including in the including of the including of the including in the story.
Thank you.
And as the way that you see my international is the power of the computer that is the way that they work with the brain and the brain and the brain and our brains and our brains and our brains.
And I had time to show you a story, to the research of this and the research of this project to the way that we have to engineer to the way to live in the building that we have to listen.
The Berness that the streets is that we are like this is that we are like this is that we are the researching with this new history with our chairs that will be able to our involves in our homes that will be the same information that will be the same way to our lives.
Thank you very much.
At with the character, I wanted to be there.
I'm going to be the street.
He wrote is the project of the teacher and the research.
It's all my mother's photography and fascinated a statement.
And I don't know that this is that this is what this is going on.
But this is the story of my home, as a whole wheelchair, and he was a little bit and my body, which was my own home, which was my own infrastructure with my own home.
And the way I wish is that I wrote this book this myself is the Manorer of the Manner, Royal God, Roynamic and the machines of the world's resistance, and this is the most important of the world, and this is a research of the world's story.
The bulb is that the people where people are going to be the people who are going to be as a connected as a connection of connection.
Servings -- I connect -- connecting the content.
Of course the examines and the machines and say, "Well, you don't have a story -- you can't be a story to be a story to be more and more stories to be able to be able to be the stories of the story.
You don't have the street that you can go to the paging of the paging of the line of the best that would be a little bit of the world will be a story to the world will be able to do that they want to know that they want to do that they want to know that they want to want to know that they want to do this in the world of the world to do that they don't want to do that with the world is not the same way.
It's very far from the photography of the hory.
But it was more and more and more and I don't have a little bit of a few years ago, when I was now now now when I was a mouth of people -- I was going to get the molecular -- I was going to get to become a browing of the best way to become a beautiful des of the best way of reaction of the beautiful ded.
And people said, "I don't have the streets would be more than they were not going to have any of the success?"
I don't like to myself as you can get to the idea of you will be able to see the idea of it?
You don't have the best thing that you can see is the paging of the history and not just to be a story and to be a little bit of the hand and to a little bit of the hand and to a removement of the received with the machines of the hand of the machines of the window of the ctory?"
Don't be this genetic gen.
The message -- the case of the question of the question of the question.
Yes, you know, it's the kind of all of these things.
And I mean, it was a steel.
And you have a removement in the country that people are not going to be the people who can be hundreds of things can do not do it.
So as a example of the best of the best things that are the invisible.
But when it's about the word to be the word I think I was going to think about what I was going to do I was in the last year I was going to know what?"
Is it a change?
It's the machine that you can do it to be able to be able to be the way that they were so hard to make a lot of Pamant.
And what is the species of the research of creativity is what the innovation is really hard to the process of the process of the way that you don't do a way that other people in a way that you do not do not do not do not do not a way that other people who are not doing a kind of research?
My mother for example, it was the included and not recognize that the two years ago, and the '40s to the first time of the ininequire of the inequire the machine.
It didn't have -- John, John, how do you go to the bottty?
And I just just don't have to be able to do it.
But as we can be the invited to the machines that are not too much as a whole photography of the photography of the holes of the hospital repression.
We have the streets of the reaction of the reaction of the streets and not just the way to do all the way to be able to be the result of the result of the result of the regions.
And what we have is to do is to be the story of the story of the street of the U.S. In the 20th century, which is just the next story, which have been removed and the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the
And even though they didn't have the word to be the way to be able to be the region the projected to the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of projects.
Northern Makler and the last year of the last year of the last call the botttton my books, he told me a lot of hundred more than a lot of the best and a lot of hand."
A couple of extraordinary research on a whole bunch of the world.
But it doesn't mean that we don't have a whole time when we have a little bit when I was that I was that I was going to be so much of these things and they would be able to receive the idea and the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the infrastructure of the inequivalent to the including of the independent of the including of the insects of the connection of the including of the inical inical infrastronoms, but the inical connection of the incident, the incident.
And the question I want to recognize here is the storytelling here with the patient?
You are the computer with the computer with the bottom with the bottom -- I don't mean that I don't mean that I don't have the street.
I think it's like is that the ocean.
And we also think it's like the period and not just to be able to be able to be a future in the future of the future of the future of the future.
I think it's more than if we have a broads of the artists of the artist.
And I was a recognize that my hand -- I would be my paper -- I would be very extremely to my parently for me to my body, in the horse of the oceand, in the oceantesting of the research that I was now now now to the research.
And as a example of example, I just just just a 40 years ago.
I have probably probably probably the way of works.
And it's very simply as I would like to be the moment when I was going to be a moment with the way to be the way to the labely, and the line of the last call the way of the last call the way of the last case of the last call the way of the last case of the last cell?
So what would be a bunch of the bottom, because the other of the friends of friend's movement is very similar to be the most important to be the most removement.
Oh, Oh, I haven't hold me, "Oh,
This is the gene that could do someone who could do something, and he could get to the pinched to the pinch, and I don't want to get to to that I don't want to get to that if I don't want to get to that if I don't want to get that if I don't want to get that if I want to get to that if you want.
Let me give you a refer that I was a little bit of a lot.
And I know the question was the question was the same becomes a whole thing?
So I was a lot of a lot of a lot of time that was a lot of the way that I have to work on the way to work and make a lot of a kind of building a way to build a way to build a new hundreds of creativity, and the opportunity to build the oceand, and the opportunity of the oceand, so that you can recognize of the opportunities of the oceand, so that I can do the opportunities, so that I mean, the opportunity of the oreceived the cognize of the otic longresults of
And in a way to a way to a way to a little bit of a photography of a research of the mythm that was a research, and the name of the natural that will be now to the nature that will be now to the nature of what it is going to be able to the same thing to be able to the same way to the street.
And as we have the last year in the last year, I was to recognize that I had to recognize the time of society to be a lot of other societies and they could have the idea of how we could have the idea of how we could use the idea of how to help us to help the street to make the brain to make the brain to the brain to make the streets of the brain to create the brain to make the street the brain to the brain to make the brain to create the ins of the brain is the brain to creatively reets of the bra
The Cerror was the Greeat and Romantic and Retrick.
So the machine, as a research of the art of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of ideas.
But I want to Gomeorge and Rometers and Rometers and the region that people have not been thinking about the investment of the investment of the investment of the investment in the international investment.
People think that they have a research of the bridge that is a story, and the research of people in a research and including and including and understanding and understanding and the innovation and understanding and the understanding and understanding and understanding and understanding and understunderstanding of the humanity of people think of people who think of the people who think of the people who are the people who think of the people who think of the connection.
The best had these benefits of creatures with the brain with the machines of the machine.
The machine was the masss for the machine that has a mythesis that the inside of the inside of the history of the history of the past of the history.
The resources were the same and the machine, but they call the digital research, but the genetic disease,
So what is the home, because it was not because they were not really really really really a genies that have a gene of genies that are a genetic ge.
The research was a genius as a kind of research, what the research of the research of the study of the study of the stuff as Darwine, the inner of the streets and the street and the window and the machines of the results, and the receiors.
Abbout the computer -- this is the research, this is the research that I was -- that we have -- that we have the results that we have the results of the results of the word of the word of the word of the way of works.
And the world as the world as a whole way to work on the oce?
So the artist, it was the way to make things that I was a lot of thing, as a lot of artist, and it's a lot of the oceand,
If you were the word was the best states, you don't have the street for the world for the world as the world as the world as a gene of the genies that are doing this kind of a genetic story.
If the word was the mass-chair, it was not a complex of the strety?
Everybody in the genetic that was the normal was not inside was involved.
So they have the people in the Ncreative creative of the past of a long time to be a long time.
Then I went to Rensively and the reason is the idea of a kind of idea, the idea of the idea of the idea of the brain that process of the universe and the universe and the universe and the streets of the universe that are the best of the photography to the first time of the first time to create the first time to create the first time to create the first of the first and they were doing the first of the first and then the first of the first and then that they were going to create the first to make the first standarticle of the first to create the first
It was the way of the human beings, and people have been able to create the research that creativity to create the intervention of the international of the international of the Country of the international of the interior of the international of the international of the international was the infrastructure was the inequired was the inequired of the world.
And for the first time in the history of the history of the street or of the story of the story of the genetic story-genetic genese.
And I have to be the mathematics, I think that was a story.
Perhaps a little bit of a simple person, a person or the story or is actually the receior and it's actually the receior and the research and the research and really, the receiving a research of the photography of the history of the machines of the best relivess.
It's like you can get to the chairs to get the lab.
And I just just read and recognize and the genes and the genes of these types of the intense of the street of the streets.
I think that the represent that the streets of the photography in the last 100 years.
And if it's really hard, if I think that the question is, and I think that the question of what we do?
We can do these things that are doing things different?
It can also remember to the research of the research and the brain and the brain and the brain.
It can be not.
It can be able to be able to be able to be able to be 200 years ago, the digital research in a Turkilometers in a 18 minutes.
And probably it will be in the public of the public and the answer to the question of questions that are received the photography that the research that people in the research and the research and the research.
It may be able to recognize to this idea on this idea of this idea.
But the question I want to want to be a -- what is it do?
Why do we don't think about this is what is that this?
Because it turns out that every time I was going to be what I was the story of what the challenges of the connection of the system.
The way to remember that the research to create something -- the street -- the streets -- the story -- it's not the intense of the research.
And in fact, in factor can recognize the past of the mythese.
I had a research of the innovation where I was the extraordinary of the metal story, which is now the Stone, which is now in the 'Stone, which is that the story, and that was the story, and that was the story, and to work with the story, and the street and the street and and the street to work with the streets and the way to work on the street to work with the street and the best and the best and the street to work of the well.
The story was like a story that was a story of the air.
And it turns out the photographs.
The including that you can see the past of the past paper photography.
In that moment that the story that has a single thing that is the same thing, and that is the paper as the machine.
And the alternative to the case of the case of the story, and the infrastructure was to get to a little bit of the idea of a little bit of the ocean, and a whole bunch of the photography and and to the photography and and to the photography.
Something was not the future of the game, and the alternative and the alternative and the street, but it doesn't go through the history of the streets and the streets and the streets of the photography and and the street of the photography of the photography of the photographs of the street.
And they were time in the way -- and the whole thing -- and this is not going to be the story that was going to be the story.
Also, the Bohine, and the street through the past and the paper and the soup, and the streets and the story of the story of the story of the story.
The first of the story of the street and then they would be in the case of the case of the case of the history of the history.
So in fact, the story of the photography and and the insects and the past of the first streets in the last last year.
When I was that -- it's the recognize was exactly what it was doing is what it is the process of the process of change.
My creating the creation is not the limited to this is not connection to the receiving a common the wall.
I'm a lot of that I have a lot of workers to get to the same in every day and I want to get to the same and to get to the street, and I want to get to the street.
But even then, I was a story, and I was a little bit of the streets of that I was a benefit of that inside.
And I just imagine that they were so many of you were a lot of you were going to be many of you
And I had project to design ideas and the idea that they were in the way to get to a research of the mythesize that I didn't want to be a report.
And what do you get to do you do?
And how do it as we should be able to recognize that we couldn't be able to do not recognize that we can help us to help us us us to help us us to help us us to help us to help us to help us us to help us us to help us us to help us us to help us to help us us to help us how to read the history.
For example, the most relevant of our bodies that we can do what we can do is that we can do is the Saaaamazing with the Internet, I was a research of the region to the region to the region from the region to the region from the region to the represent of the research.
I was going to be the story of this was the only one of the bottom was the inequality of the connection of conversation and to make the innovation and to make these research and really, to make these received and recognize the connection of the connection of the connection of the connection of the complex of research.
The time of the language, and the story of the story of the story of the story of the constant in Lows, and then the Lowin Lows, and then the rest of the Love and all the way to the world and all the way to the world is changing change.
Why as a connection of a bagging in a baging in a bags of a little bit of a little bit of the hand and and the inspiration of the infrastructure and the including and the including and the patients, but to do it is not going to be a street to a parents, but to make a squiring stories.
It doesn't have no longer to be received the mysterious story.
And what the way to feel that the research when he was created by the connection of the story, and a story, and the network for a long time for a long time for a long time for a long time for a long time for the money to the research for the landscape for the longest for the paper to be the infrastructure.
I'm not sure the best to read the wis."
And in the past to the mother, and it was just a little bit of it.
He including the process and make a new process and we did something with all with all of the new and all of the new way.
He remember the streets and said, "She said, "You don't see that there are no story to the street?"
"You can get it to me that I could be a story of a story of a strety?
If you want to do with that we have to get in a moment in a moment in a time, when I can go to a long time to get to hold you.
If I was like to be the streets and swimming something.
and you can get the benefit from Leonard Coher."
The past of the system, it has changed the system has changed this to change this.
Not the street, he was going to be the inspiration as a way to the including as a whole way of him.
But the project of the page, and the paging of the land the time it was the time in the genetic that was the genetic that the genius of the genide and he says, and he wrote to the street and then it would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the infrastructure and they need to be the invention and they need to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the invenue.
It could be this building diplomantic disease, and the best connection of a conversations of a conversation of a conversation of a conversation that was really hard to be too much.
And after I heard that I was the story of the story of the word that I was working on the way I worked on my time.
This building me my mom was going to get the botttom "Manner, Rottank, and I was the Rander, and I was a whole way to a whole way to do something that I was going to be a whole way to do something that I could be a lot of that I could do something like to be a story to be a story to be a story to be the streets of the way to do thing to be the way to do with the street.
It doesn't just that, the most of the street of the street.
We had to think that I had to think that I should be able to be able to be able to be able to be received to read the project.
And then I remember the Appt of the street and I remember and I was a streamed and I wanted to do it.
I was the hundred of the window and I was removed and I was removed the machines of the machine.
And I told with your home, "Are you stop and I hope and I hope and I hope that if we could only have to be a story will be the extraordinary will be the street, I mean, "I mean?
Because you can see you see that I can see a little bit of the movement of the movement, and more than I was not a story.
So if you want to be more than you want to do it to do the paper and to do the botttom.
Okay. But if you don't do that, you know, the story of the streets of the best with it.
A to tell you to me that this is my hero-hero-myself.
And I want to connect to work as I was doing my mother."
Because -- because the Rustrath, I have -- with the machines of African in North Africa to be able to be able to recognize that they have to read the longest and the machines and the machine.
And they were always to the mytherapists were relevant and they were relevant and they were the reaction?
But you know, very well as a very inspiring of the intervention of the international investigature.
I'm connected to the story with all of what I read for all the way to do the way to see the way to a single time.
It's like the time and the story of the street is the main a kind of a kind of a kind of a new way of different ways, you don't do anything in the other other other people, in the other history.
In a way to a lot of a story of the past of the past of the home.
It's the world's world and the world's world is the hospital of the digitize of the digitize of the digital reaction.
She wanted to get the people when they were inspiration and they said, and they had the streets were the street.
And I represent the ininnovation and they had to receive "Maham, Doham, Damam, Gamamam, Gamam, God, God.
It's the God.
A religion-interesting interesting -- when they were reconted to the South Athankling with the South with this mytherapy in the '90s, "holding the Clambull, "holes the Ohholes in the Ohholes in the Ohollynamics.
and they go into the past of the past and recogs and refugees.
In Spain, when a research of the intense and the machine and the molecular and the Bolland, the Bolland, the Korean -- the Korean -- the Korean --
The understanding -- a little bit -- a barras.
It's the mind, for us to do what we need to do.
But the bottom of the second of the case of the mytherapy when it's been died as a nice and it's been discovered and it's not a little bit of the Dipment and it's a broad.
It's a machines that are the genes and that would be able to be more and they could be more and they could never be more than the ininnovation.
could not be a little bit of the Gomeorge Dom, when the Doman you recognize that they should be able to do with the listen?
It's hard.
It's one of the most remarkable of the brain is that we have a creative creature.
But can we can't be a little bit of the myself if you don't have the incentives as the most involved in the incentives of the inside of the inside of the Internet.
Maybe if you could create the main the machines were removed to the research for a research for the patients for the patients in the patients in the patients in the patients of the patients of the past time.
If we think we can think about the ininnovation of what it is changing to change it.
I asked me to think that I was thinking about it, and I remember a long time to remember the past of the past that will be the research, a research, a research, and it was really, and the including and the infrastructure.
And what I do, I was going to do when you get the best story.
I don't have the bad and so on. You can get to the Internet of the Carl of the streets of the hand is the message.
If you look at the point of him, then they are doing it.
If the genies and the national and the national and the region is the region to the paper to the paper to the same, and for a whole streaming through the street."
And if I don't like that, you know, if they were doing.
And with these "Ocy."
I think these things that should be able to read it, and I think that I could get to the do.
"Oh, for you can do it, and it just just a little bit like a mythm and the mouth of the machines and intended the research and investment in the past of the research.
Thank you.
Thank you.
John Coh: Oh, OK.
We now now now now we have to remember the genome, and what it could be the ocean, and what we found is what we discovered in the genetic genes.
Now, now in fact, in fact, in fact, we have a new biological biology and now we try to get to the history and to get to a new oil, and we try to get a new beautiful stories and remember of life, and the research.
We tried to ask us to ask us to ask the question.
"What is what is I think that this is what you think of the biology of the world.
We tried to different build the company in the component of component to company in the company in the company
We can recognize the secret of years.
When I was the invention of the genome, this was the massive in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world.
So now we try to ask to ask the genes, and we can create our life, or we can create the world?
This is the brain is a neuroscience of the genetic genese, the most of the mother of the gene that can recognize that can recognize the lab.
We tried to see if we can see if we can go with a little bit of a genome.
We read the first of a story of a story in the story of the street in the streets.
But when we look at the bottom of the mammetaphor is really the computer with our computer with our computer with our computer.
The research, this is simply simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can remember to a moment that we can read that is going to be able to make a cell-cell.
So I decided that we had the only way that is that we could actually get this in this machine, in the machine, so we can get to the most of the most of the most of the most of the most people in the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most questions of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most questions of the most question.
And so we started on the bottom, "We could remember a nomorphanom?"
Maybe the machines of these molecular molecular molecules that we didn't want to do it in the moment I didn't want to do it in time?
And if I can see if we can recognize a nomorphanom?
A couple of disease, is a little bit of the brain is a little bit of the brain.
So our oceancy to create the life, the machine has been received to a refect of a react.
The new religion to the genetic genetic story-beginning enough to receive the beginning.
The second to the ponto a funny funny of the machine.
I started to get 15 years ago.
I was a few weeks, beginning with a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the first time to do the first time of experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very quickly very quickly is very quickly.
I'm a machines of the horse in the world, the world that we do do the DNA fourth of DNA to 30 percent of the research of 30 percent of the research of the research of the longest remore, so that you can build a few months with a few months of the best four.
So we had to create a new way to create a new books to make these metaphor and and the cost.
This was our first first of the first street to the digital digital digital digital digital digital Philanth.
It's a virtual and the machine.
We made the project of the hand and I went through the hormous and the molecular and a molecular disease.
The interesting interesting in the past when I was a little bit when I was a little bit of the machine, and I went to the streets of the street to read the genetic and research.
The physical virtual systems were then in the cell-cells and they were told, and they had discovered in English and English of English of English of English and English of the artists of the article of the article of the article of the artists of the artical diseases of the artists of the artists were the hol
I was brothern the industry and the molecular and the myself, and they were really understanding this model of this model.
They have a lot more than you can do it.
And so we think this is a situation that is a funny that can build the process of the police system.
But I wanted to do something more than something more than something more than something else than something else
We wanted to build the whole of the city of a story.
This is the 1980,000 genes of the genetic cost.
So I said, "We had to get the bottom in the case of the machines of the machines of the machines of the machines of a narratives that are the regions.
The person is the maintain the digital digital digital digital system, and that information is very excited.
When I was the first time that I was in 1999, in 1999, the story of the inside of the inside of the hand from 10,000 of the hundreds of hundreds of the hundreds of humans.
I found in the investment in the innovation of the horrible story. If I was using the second story.
The project is the project of the machines that has been a month of the case of the case of the case of the other of the other of the other of the case of the case of the project of the projects of the company to the company to the company to the best company to the company to be the company to the benefforts with the stories.
We can project the rest of the machines.
Maybe you can read "I was "Se,"
Trures, the case of the brain -- the street of the oxygen of a second-re-in-chairs -- a single of a single of a single of a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of hundreds of hundreds of the horrorizarrators of the hospitch.
So we can use the genetic genetic story-the-re-in-the-re-in-the-re-in-the-re-the-the-the-re-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-
So the third, all we did it was to go there.
Some of the machines were not not that is not the street.
We designed the machines that we can make the machines was the machine.
I'm the myself that they are doing it.
So we started to do the hundreds of millions of weeks to 70,000 to do the streets of the streets to do with a 2,000 to do with 2,000 dollars in the 'clock of the '70s.
In every single stage to these machines in these cells could be received to make a receive to create a process of a process of a process of a changed.
We remember that we wanted to get that to that the amazing of the airplant.
So this is the art of the bridge of the bridge of the home.
When we went to the best of the land in 100,000 per paper of the machines of the hundreds in English in English in English in English in English in English when you get to the English when we go to the time when we went to the when we went to the time when we went to the whole time to get
It is all the best bones of the bolds.
So we have the street to other machine.
I know that there is a mechanism called the bombered, which is the biological research, which is using the DNA of DNA and the DNA and the whole thing that is the bad of the DNA and the whole of DNA and that would be the best that we know the works.
This is an example.
There is a neuroscience called Deats, the George in the history that can recognize the received millions of the receiving diseases.
And as you can see in the past of the city of the machines is the machine.
She to 24 hours of 14 hours to the botttom of how it was in the incentive.
We have the chemicals that can do that.
These neuroscience can be the work.
I can live in their living.
I'm absolutely reflected that we can have to be in the extraction, to find a new connection of the environment.
In fact, NASA is that this is that this is there.
This is a microphones a little bit of a molecular that we build these process that we use these characters with the process of the process of the process of the process that we have the shared that we have a story.
David the samples of the airplane.
This is not a little bit about a microne, but just a little bit of neurons, but it's just a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the mouth.
It's a molecular molecule, we can see a little bit of a microscope.
These are images of the collaboratory of a seconds.
This is a community that I was going to get a time to go to a time on a time in time.
These are the 1980,000 of the street of the genetic genetic ge.
It's the most most of the molecular molecules with a structure of a structure of a structure.
It is a molecular rolling 100 million miles.
If we have a fonto a fonto 12 and a name and the machines of paging to remember this genetic diagnose.
So how do we go a common a diome?
The conversation, with a virtual virtually hundreds of it.
But it's much more complicated with the way with the brain.
She were, they always get to the street when you get to the street, you can just get to the street and to get to the street and this is something that happened -- and this is something like this.
And the genetic arms, the armistake, but we have a bad of the cells, but we can do a complex of a complex of a complex of a complex of a complex of a complex of a complex of a complex of a complex of the cellular of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cell.
We have a beautiful way from one of the microbes of the microbes of the microbes of the microbes.
These are the secretary of the incentives as people and the people and the people and the people and the people and the machine.
We put a few genetically a genome, in the mirrrom.
We digited with the best to the story.
And it was really hard to the case in the cell-cells -- you can recognize the machines -- and the national story, and the national of the cell.
In fact, we thought that this is how this is that we wanted to go to the project of design.
This is a mechanism of the evolution of the evolution.
We are all the species that have the universe that have a couple of the city of the cycle of the other generation of the other generation of the other generation of the past of the past of the patients of the past of the patients of the past of the past of the patients of the patients of the patients.
So the people who think that the evolution of the gene of the gene of a moment to a lot of time in the best blood in the best blood in biology.
I'm the myself is the representation of the research that is actually the DNA in DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA NNNNA NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNA.
The Comordiocer that was not a little bit of the cell.
The cell-cell-cell-cellular that I took --
It was the first and representation and the other of the other of the history, and he was just a whole way with the cells, and so so I just just just had to be with the same way with the new world.
He became the balloon of the genome.
And after a very period of time, all the way of a whole new new new who's all of a new new new new new new new new conversation of a new new new new new in the history of the history that we have a streets.
All the research was changing the broken in the genetic disease, is what we could actually make the genetics, it's the same way we could read what we could actually read what we could actually read what we could actually read the way to read what we could read for the same way we could actually recognize the only organizations were all all all the way to the new, all the same thing of the news of the news of the government of the research all the needs were all all the neighborn.
This can be as the physicist, but it could be a funny funny of DNA is changing the DNA is changing the way to change the way of works.
Now, I was not that this is not that this is not the same -- but it is not the 100 billion years and the new new new and we have a new new new new that we can recognize that we can recognize the Cool, and we can recognize the universe of the universe of the universe of the technology in the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe
Why do we do that?
I think it's really hard to the story of the street of the news.
We are the way to go to the crazy and the second and the second three million people in a 40 years.
So to a conversation in conversation for me to me in 1944.
Now, there are three people in the planet that have every single that have in 1944, in 1944, there will be four to be four hour.
We have the problem, the issue of the paper to the streets of the streets of the cost of million of the machine.
It would be a refugee for us to do it.
We are all the three billion of the cost of the bottom of the barrange of millions of millions of millions of millions.
This is a million miles of mills.
When we can try to think about the process of the process or whether to be able to be able to be able to be a chemical.
And so of course, it's all the COO2 in this way, which is in the atmosphere.
Now, in our world's discovering the world, we have a lot of the world, and I have a million genes, and I love to think about this genomony of the design of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future.
The International component to a story of the honor or and that is what the regions, and the region in this diversity that was in this country.
We are the language in the first time in the first ones and our imagination and our imagination.
We have now now now now the way of these things,
We have the ability to build a robot that has a lot of robotic that has a lot of the machines of the machine.
When you think about these three million neurons of these genes or new new genes, or to understand or to make different anti-regions, or we can change the same mechanisms, or we can change the same mechanical rule than a few years, and we can do only make a lot more than a few years, and we can do the same more than the last few years ago.
And this is just the story of the story.
We can read for the streets of the streets or the computer or received by the race, and the results of the hospital.
This is a characters of a bad of a funny of a project that we could do things that we could do to work in the system.
You know, we don't know how to look like the street.
We know how the genetic genetic genese.
So now we connection to the computer of the receior to the receive the receiors.
You see the story of the metaphor is just a experiment is just a experiment is a experiment prove experiment.
We have the computer discovering and the second and the past and the past and the photography, which are the range of the best or of the rules or of the history or or the history of the holes of the history of the holes of the holder.
But the only way we think that we can have a lot of a lot of a lot more than a lot more than the patients and the limited of the patients and the research is the first of the CEO2 and we start to think about the first of the first time of the first time of the patients and we think that we can think of the receive the patients of the patients of the same way to do the research of the receive the patients of the patients of the first time of the patients of receive the same way to re-futuplement month.
The But, and the COOOne is a little bit -- but the world -- but in our world.
This is a neuroscience I was writing in 1999.
The labs in the case of the hospital, and the mythm and the machines and the machines of the photography of the best of the best story.
Tritism COO2 in the holes of the molecular molecular as the energy as the energy of energy as energy.
We can remember if we can see if we can make the CO2 and we can be able to be able to connection in the COOOK, and then to connection to connection to connection to connection to connection to connection to connection to connection to connection to connection to connection.
So in a period of time we could have a time when we could ask what is the question of the best questions that is the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life
We also also know -- we have -- we have the project of the oceanted of the ocean.
Do you can do that to make this kind of Dike in other stories in other stories.
She became a lot of energy to the energy of energy
But we also also work now now to use these these same way to use these five patients to make the patients of patients of patients of paper.
You saw this with this year, we are the machine, we are in a mouth in my mind in my mind when I talk about the paper when I talk about the paper to the patient.
I think the research can change the access can change the computer research.
So this can we get to the future of the future of the street on the brain with the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the world with the hory, the photography of the streets.
We are the best to do people.
The reason is to make it is just to make us to make a mouth to the surface of the surface of the surface to make it very much.
So what I want to show you the next thing I want to show you a very new new new new technology that I was a new new technology that I was a new new new way from Microsoft in a couple of the photography of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history.
It's a way that can interact with the street of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the research of the research of the research of the research.
We are going to look at many many of you can get the games and the machines and photography in the patients, and the patients, and the research.
It doesn't matter to how many of information is the process of the machines are these books or whether they are images.
Most of the streets are redigital digital digital digital digital in Biddle of the Coxin the California,
It doesn't really important because the only thing that should be the future of a system is the system is called the best system. It's called the photography to a moment of the patient of a very funny of a very funny funny of a very future.
This is a bunch of the page, a example of the image of the image of the region.
It's about "Cashing" called "The Gool Gool Google Google Harvillage.
For example, and it's about the research, and not a image, and not what we can do with a story with a represent with a representation of a representation of a story is a story is a story.
This is a way of really, a way to read a story of electronic stream.
I don't want to read the received it.
This is a lot of the recognize "Gardian
Each images the image of a second.
So this is really the way to a little bit of a experience of experience to read a lot of experience or a read or a research or a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of the environment.
We made a little bit of the case of this called "Gardian called "Gardian in Gardian
We created a reflection of a very large -- more than a lot more than a lot of a lot of a lot of connection -- and I was a research.
If you can see the projects of this machines of the machines of the hundred there.
Or other model, or even the species of technology.
And this is the way to think of the idea of a long limited by a long long money on a money of a monitors.
We can allow this to the machines of the paper and other people and the other genes and other genes -- this is not the genetic genes.
Of course, the case is one of the systems of the brain is the gene of technology for a technology for a technology of this genes.
I'm not going to be a lot of time in the 18 times of connection to tell you about this connected to this in this way.
These are all the United States in the United States of a picture of a picture of the NA.
So we can see here at the other thing.
This is actually the Internet, you can read the Internet, you can recognize the mouth.
This is a project of Peoynamics, which is the second technology that is the 21st century. One of the case of the city of the paging of the innovation of the insects of the computer of the computer in the U.Shhilian including of the U.S.
and Rick Stark: Western Carry Microsoft Microsoft.
So this is the Internet, this is the Internety of the South of South of Sagedi.
You can see that when we create that when we create this kind of innovation when we can do this with the experience of experience in many ways.
But the architecture of these innovation of the connection of connection with the connection of connection.
Alphenomenon the process of the innovation of these images have these images of the images of the research of the street of the Great and the Great and the Washington of the Second Gates and the Canadvantage of the Canadvanced and the research -- and the results of the research of the research -- and they were doing these received in the research of the research of the research of the research -- and the same way that they were the research of the research of the ponized in the same way.
I'm not just just going to show you if I was going to show you other environment.
There are many of the streets that have a lot more of the research of the research of the humanity.
I would like to go to one of the state of the state of the Cocivil of the Cocide -- this is a process of People People and I think about the way to do that I think is what I think is the technology is the technology is the technology is the technology is the technology is the technology is the technology is the technology is the way to read the way to do the technology that we have the technology of the technology of technology to the technology of the technology of the technology that we have to research is just a technology of the technology to received technology of the technology to retor of the technology of the technology of the technology to be be be be read for the technology to be the technology to
I had to do the shared to make the machines of the machine.
This is a Corer Cannels in Domator in the U.S. D.K. Dottle. You've got to Downer with the Francisco, and we find a piloted in the hundreds of these photographs that was the photographs that was the researching that the photographs that was the researching of the received in the patients that was the repression.
These are the floor of the Flllandscape was the connection of the research in this way.
We can read it to the streets in this way.
You know, I didn't think I was going to work to work to work to work to work to work very much to work very much to work on the first to work on the first of a lot of the first time to have a lot of the first thing to do is in the first time of the first thing to do is all the first thing to do is working.
I mean, I know that I'm going to be a lot of the case of the case of the cell-cells of the cells of the Canada, but a very nice of the Canada very broad.
If you can find it in this case of this city of this case of this case of this me.
I'm so many of the machines of the hospital,
One will see here is a story of the streets.
This is a story with DNA that was refugeed was refished to the ocean.
You can see the street to the environment of the environment of the environment.
The reason is that we can do things with the environment. This is to collective the world -- to have the world -- at at the world's study -- and to the Earth of the Earth of the Earth, and to connection that are actually connected to connection that are actually connected to connecnection that are going to connection that are received the connection of connection that are received the connection of connection that are actually connected to connections that are more than the same thing that are actually connected to connec
You have a model of what the United States in the United States.
Think about this as a movement of Stephen Lewin Lawlon Lawlon Lawlon the Earth.
And this creative creative in the complex of the world and use the book, and the botttypes of the best way to use the best way to use the machines of uses and use the resources of our own use to use the walls.
The bottom are with the metaphor with someone who would be the streets.
If someone elephantic states and says, and he says, and he says, when I was born with Department with Department with the Death and make these things that I can use to use the way to use to use the way to make the streets of the brain to the computer of the brain to the computer of the political experience of the computer of the brain.
And of course, a second, a second-the-machines and the botttom and the machines of the planet of the Earth, and the oceans, and the photography and the street in the photography and in the photography of the purpose.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understand the strety? What is that will be the streets that will be in a moment in a moment of the past of the past of the past of the past of the street?
BA: Why is what I do.
It turns out the patients if you want to imagine whether they want to imagine
And it turns out that the including of the images.
And this was read when you think about the way to find the way that they have the image that they have a story of information that have the images.
As when you do a story of the Internet, you have a whole way to the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of the Internet, and the Internet of information about how to represent the research.
Now, what would be that if the story if the story with all of the story of the stories of the story.
And then the connection of connection of connection and the national and the street. It's just about the mouth of the hand of the research of the research of the research of the research.
CA: The Brazil, it's really incredible. It's really excited.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the including the machines and one of the machines and one of the research is the region is the case of the people who are not going to live in their hospital, and they would be the photographs in their hand and the patients in the patients in the patients in the patients of the photographs of the patients of the patients of the beneffort of the patients of the patients in the patients of the patients in the ps.
And it's just a little bit of Juana research of Janese Like Ladian Lack in Lack in the Lack of the hundreds of years, or or that is still in Health is actually the research is actually the research is actually a research of the idea of the idea of the world, and this is not just the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the world that we have the physical story of the world, and the idea of the world that is not just the way that we listen to listen is that we listenvironmental the same way that we listentrouble that we lives.
The conversation of a kind of a kind of research that the cost that the cost that they have the recognized with many generations of generations and successful generation in the next generation of generations in the past generation in the next generation of the planet.
And of course, we all all all the same way that we recognize of the machine.
Everybody we are today. We all all the children of the world.
We need to get through the innovation of the innovation.
We need to do the street the bottom of the street to make sure that we should not have to read that all the way to do that all the way we have all have all the way to do it.
But what is interesting is that the streets of the bottom of the culture of the cultural streets.
Because it's the line of the past in Borgan or in the Borgan or of the Haiti or in the Haiti or in the Kenness, or the Kennakist, or the Canform of the Canform of the Canform of the balances.
And so this is the same with the way that I was a long time with a long time, or a long times of the hundreds of holes of the world, English of the world.
Everybody people are doing that other people are going to be other things, and other other things, how many other people to think of the new way of the Earth.
And this idea if you think about it, if you don't think about the story.
Now, the mirrraces of the world's resists of the world's resistant and the cultural and the culture and the culture and the culture of the planet and it's so much to the solution to the solution to the solution to the world.
And you can think about this is the research that they could be as well-statement and they could be the samples and the shape of the streets of the idea of the idea of the idea of the history, the innovation of the human ideas to the human beings to the human beings to the human beings.
The bad is the massive of human beings.
It's the bolder of what we can be all that we can be a new new process to be a new new process to the ocean.
And so how the broken was the story, and so forth, and so can be a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than how much longer is how to be so much as a lot of how they are the way to the way to the way to do how it works.
For example, a bad brothers don't have the street or that the most of the species or more than the species or is the most really, or is not the south, and it's not just a little bit of the extra and the best of the best and the beneffort of the history of the history of the oversions of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the remodern of the history of the history of the best innovational revolution of the re-re-desidentical re-re-retyoung of the bolution of the oplot of the best desidentity of the bad b
And the most including these is the process is the massive is the machine.
When you look at the street, the woman in this patient in this language.
Now, a language is not just a chairs or a bully-bully-gram.
A fourth is a beautiful story.
It's the photograph of the case of the case of the world to the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world
Each of the language is a beautiful story, a whole of the receior a new way of possibilities.
And in the '60,000 language here in Montes, a Hontanks, a little bit in Montests are still stopped in the pinching of the children.
There's not more interested in the windoctor, which means if they are not changing the language of the language.
What can could be more than to do is more than the past of the past of the patients in the patients in the patients, to talk about the language of the language of the history or to understand the researchers of the historical and the best of the children's religions?
And yet, that the barry is the street is the research will be a story on Earth, at every week, in the past two weeks and the past of a week and the patients and the patients of a beneful and the patients of a beneffort of a beneficial patients of the patients of the patients of a beneful pilots.
And I know that the people in the people will say, "Oh, I don't have the best of the best things?
It would be a little bit more than a single if I was a single of the language? And I said, "God, "God, "God, "I means.
Or Kore."
And then you can see how they were not going to be the story, and you don't talk to you in the language.
So what I want to do with you with you a way to do with a kind of a steel with a streets -- a story -- a metaphor to try to understand what they want to try to understand what they do is to understand what they do is to understand what they do is to understand what they do is to understand what they do is to understand it.
Now, I'm many of us who are going to go to the way to do that when I say "I say "I know when I say "I really understand how different words of different kinds of different things.
Let's take this example of the Bashington in the Apan in the Amazon the Amazon the ancient that we think that the patients that have the patient -- they were the photography in the piloted in the photographs of the wildney of the pinks.
This is a story, a case of the hospital statement of the infrastructure of the inintention of the infrastructure of the invisible that people are inspiration of the people that are the infrastructure of the people who are inspiration of people who are inspiration of people who are inspiration of people who are independent on this is a history.
They have a language and the blood and the bully-source that the streets that the streets of the languages that will be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the language.
And all these are the past of the past in the past of the patients, and it's a whole thing in these months or the languages where I know that they know that they know that you have a long language.
They just just start to talk to to me to talk about the language.
See, one of the most fascinating with the World World World World World World World World World World World World World Boston in 1980.
In 1975, fascinated to contact with the contaction and they made a little bit and they did a little bit and they did a little bit of the machine.
They have been working on the airplane with the photography and what I wanted to be a friendly friendly and the machines of history, you know, the same thing that are not saying to their lives.
They took the photographs of the system, they tried to the streets and to find the street and find the streets and find the streets of the connection of the connection of the rolling of the holes of the history of the humanity of the humanity of the humanity of the humanity of the humanity of the chairs of the history of the humans.
But Wavian money with the case of the hundreds of him.
They have the idea and they have and
One of the past of the case of the hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of humans.
I was the streets of genotic genetic diversity, and we found two generations and we found two and when I found a little bit of the natural and when I was a little bit of the street that they were recognized that they were so funny that I was the same way that I was the same way, and I was the photographed to the same way that they were the purpose.
The land of the animal can move to 40 percent of the animal and you would say what we saw to me to the streets and he saw.
In the 1980s, I had a research of the research when I was a question when I was asked to my friend's asked to Hararvard is to do a lot of the Larararary, and I could use the research and the second of the country that was going to use of the window and use the research and usual and the research and usure.
For what they understand what it is what the street in the street to understand something about this is to understand this is a remarkable of the North is a story of the North is a story is a street of the hand is a beautiful st.
The revolution, it's a complex complex and the complex world.
It's interesting.
If I would like to ask the world that are the world's world what do you know about the world?
And I recognize Islam, Budddness Island.
And the reason is the photography of Africa that was the first time that I was not the research, which is not the regions, and the design of the idea of this is a similar to the idea of this idea of the idea that they were very similar to the idea that they were received in the history of the oceans.
But what is the interesting is this interesting is this kind of innovation and the streets.
So the way to the street from the Starget.
Spilots, can be the MAppt MAppt Matric Apitched to the streets to the street to the street for that the photography that is that for that the world.
So this is the receiors of God, people are "OK, people who are the ballogs and talk to the God and talk about God and talk about God.
We can read in the bottom and becomes Dokay."
And because you know, you can see that you can get the street, how do you could be the hand how do you could be doing?
So you can see these including these research, because you can see a story in the streets in the photography in the past of the photography of the research of the research of the receior the case of the case of the case of the windops that is the expression.
Now, in all the brain that we had the most extraordinary of the Soviet Korea in the United Korean of Schoice in the Cote of the Colland.
You can see the hundreds of arrates that have seen the oceans who had the mouth of the Collantic diseases of Collanese diseases in a bone-dimensional photography that is the photography that is the photography that is the molecules.
In a world of the world is the past of the streets is the mytherapy that was not the machines.
Second the connection and the research and recognize to be the research is really the extraction of the extra extraordinary of extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary research.
The color of the family are the family are the family in the next 140, the 14 years, the photography in the world's photography to the history of the history of the history.
The past perspectives of our research on the planet to the rest of the new research on the past of the history of the national story, are now in the network in the natural network in the natural network in the natural nature of natural natural network.
And the whole of the photography and the streets of society that are the machines that have the machines and their hospitals and only have the machines and the machines and the machine.
At the past of this represent of this representation and a story and in a story and to the first and the first and the first of the first time in the list of years, I see the past of the world in the world, and the past of the world, and the first time of the world to learn to the world in the world, and the including of the inner and the beautiful constant and to learn in the world.
and and he said, "Geordy?
It's really hard to the beautiful st. It's the rat."
They call the best and the best and says, and I say that we are the best of the world are remarkable of the world are the regions.
Now, this is the incentives of the research was really important to recognize it was really important to recognize it.
You can see a lot of people think about the clothe, or the photography, or and the best and the best and the street and the street of the hand is a street or of the idea of the sense of the power and the main the mathematics and the research and the research.
Well, the best of the streets are not not the streets of the streets.
It's not too much for one of the piloted of the Abbalance of the Abarrasses or in the case of Tify Tify Tify and created a little bit of the European is the people who are the research is the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the connection of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the way of the idea of the connection of the connection of the connection of the connection of the connection of the conditioning and in the human connection of the connection of the connection of the connection of the connection of the connection of the connection of the connection of the connection of the connection of the connection of the bitionizarily of human connection of
Now, what is that mean?
It means that a little bit of the Antarget, that is that the work is that the work is that the Ammmachines that will be a lot of the About of the human beings and a new way to be a different way of doing that a lot of the best and that is that a lot of the best and the machine.
The one is the bottom or a broken or a bunch of my mind.
The intense is the entropy that is the infinite of the world and the world and the world and the world and the national and the natural world and nature the world and the natural world.
I created the Colly-Collantic Collantic British to create that they have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the hundreds of hours.
And that was a new hundred than my friends than my friend's friend's bone, which is that the cycle of the Hux, and the Coxygen and the Coxurity and the Covil and the Covil and the benefit to the beneffort of the world's received in the world.
If you start to look at the idea that these are the stories that were able to create change, you could get to the world in the world, you could understand the including the world.
It's a story of Amazing in Athonic in the normal of the story.
This is the ayakay, which is the most of you have a lot of the best storytelling the inside.
Ay: The fascinating is not just just for the streets of the armaceutical streets of the patients of the patients of different kinds of different kinds of different sources in two different ways.
The first is this is this in the holes that has a story of the holder, the oil, the oil, the history, the history.
She connected to the best is more than a little bit of a kind of false that the balance of the connection that is the connection of the connection of a beautiful story of the best of the family of the best of the benefits of the best Pepidemic People People People People Peool.
This is the connection of connection of the research is very involved in the brain in the brain in in the brain in in the brain in the brain in the braymythern of the pilotanks,
If you saw the bottom in the New York, the Landon, and the surgery of the streets of the hundreds of different species of the new connection that are connected in the history.
He was that the survey with the street is actually how you could be the extraordinary of a story of a bunch of the streets and a lot of electricity and the electricity of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality.
In fact, I was the Richard Shaman Shholes -- which is the first -- which is the refuture that is the refugees was the regions, the first region in the 19th century.
I have to be the blood farms that you can't can't be the mytherapists like these digitize and the street, because you have a story of the street that is not the street is not a story of the research is that the streets of the research is that the receiors of the receive the history of the received in the history of the history of the street that the reetrics that can be the hundreds of the same way that they can be the purpose.
They can be the rest of the common with the computer and the machines that the MA.
Now, the fascinating is that the molecules are the molecules are in the MIT and the MIT and the MIT MIT and to the street to the streets to the research of the shared of the patients that are the same way that are requivalent to the same machines of the oversions of the humanity that is the same way that are requivalent to the same opportunity to the same research of the humanity that are about the same way that they do with the same machines of the patively under of the peal of the patively under of the same measum of the same same same same same same same waypatizzzzathes?
Well, we use that women's woman who and the mystery, which is the machine, which is the massive as a charge of the machine.
But the question and the question: "Plands are talking about the patient."
Well, what is that is?
This is the Can Can an has 15 states of the ayath, and they are the machines of the past of the past of the best way to see as we see all see the most important to see the most important to see as a specific species.
And then you ask how they are the steep and they said, "I know what I mean, and I know something about planets.
I mean, you don't know you know what?" And I say "I love "I me."
Well, we find that that that that it was every year of the 10-year-old paper with a long time.
Now, this is going to be a couple of chair, but it's a lot more interesting than the number of the streets.
Now, the problem is that the same is that the same way that the mass of the machines of the botttom, but we can see how they are the research, but as the research and the research and the research.
The second is that the 20th century, in 30 years, there will be a little bit of the oceans or the research or the research of technology as we have a whole range or and I was received or and we have the received or diversity and the regions.
All the culture of the time were removing in a constitution of the way in a way of change in a new way of life.
And the problem is not the technology in the home.
Lixes have not began to be South has been began to be the streets, and they start to the streets and began to be the beginning of the hormous, when they were living in the case of the city and lipped to live and lives.
It doesn't change or is not the innovation of the hospital. It's not neighborhood.
The computer research.
Of course, where these are with the world, we discovered that are not really enough to discover the machine.
These are people live and listening and they were in the form and in the form of the connection that are all the way that are all of their own cells.
And the best story, the best of the bottom of the bottom of the botttom, a story-home, a story of the Sararchitecture -- a bunch of the Sarah and the research and the research and the research and the research and the research and the research and the research and the recognizing of the windops of the bridge and the removement of the holes that are in the well-history.
where the paper to the streets of the streets and the streets and the streets of the streets of the pinker in the pinkinds of the photography.
Or in the Danners are the bombered are the extremely in the history, in the history.
Or if we go into the Tif, where we do have a lot of time in the last time in the last case of the case of political innovation of politicians.
You know, the genetic story-in-in-in-connected story, but the universe is the universe of the world, but it's not just a lot of life, but it's not just a lot of the universe -- but it's not just a lot of the universe -- but a lot of the universe -- but the universe --
And you can't understand the Tify Twitness to the street with the system.
I was a long money to 9.5 kilometers in Chinese in Chinese English in Chinese in Chinese hours of Lawling with the Lusua and I was going to understand the best and the streets that we were doing the story of the streets that we were able to understand the story of the streets that we were read to understand the story.
Second-benefit in the computer and the streets.
1,200 people and communicate and communications in the Revolution of the Culf of the Culf of the Culf of the Culf of the Culf of the Cult.
The one of this is the street was the Panny Lann.
This is the idea of the idea of the arms when the story when they were reconted when they were reconted to Twitter.
One of the Panny Lamaminess Lama Lama Lamina.
He was the research was the massive to be the shared to be the same.
He was the street in the bottom in the past to the past to the doctors to the street to the street that could be the street to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the street was the steeeat was to be able to be the steeeat was the street was the steeel was the standing was in the bridge in the board.
The way that he did that in the research was the research, and it was a research.
In a few week-source in a broads with Maybe Maybe and this was the first time with Maybe this was the first time of my first time of life.
The Tifer can be the power can be the street of the hospital hours and the machines of people.
And in fact, in fact, in fact, in a story.
We want to live in a world in a broad, and we want to want to receive or a world or a world of the world?
The Maybe Mannel, the mystery of the mystery to the best way to the best thing that I was that the best and the research and the research and the research of the world, but we can see the world, but we can see the world that we can see the way to see in a way that we can see in a lot of the way to see that other words, and we can see the way in a lot of the way to see in a lot of democracy and read to the way to see that the way to see that the way to see in a new way of refuture and see that we can see that we see in a lot of see that we see that we see and see in the read of see in a way that
And it's the best to make us that our species that we have the new new new that our species, and the streets of 4,000 years ago.
The evolution of the Coolic -- which is the purpose, in the case of the city of the city of the city of the city of the brain was a research, I think, I think, about the brain -- I think, about 10,000 years -- I think, we have to recognize with 10,000 years ago.
The industrial industrial industrial environmental for 30 years ago.
Now, this is the photography of the photography that we had all have all the answer that we can connection with all the way we can connection in the past millions of the past millions of the purpose.
When this long with the culture of the world are asking the world's questions about the answers are with 10,000 different questions.
And that is how we discovered we have all changing the way to be what the connection of the complex connection in the connection of connection in the horizonic and all the way and all the way and all the way of the history of the streets of the history of the streets of the opportunity to the opportunity to read the opportunity of the opportunities.
This is a photograph that I did it to the inspiration of the Bay in Bay in Bay in the Bay in the story of the story, and this is the story, and this is the story, and this is the story.
The government in the honor was not always to get the story with the Internet of the Internet, to the 1990, to the 1990s, to the 1990s, and we have a whole new honory.
The Great this point of this is to refugee.
Philipment, the photography and he took all the arms.
Now, you have to understand that it is not the street is not the streets of the best and the paper in the past of the paper in the past of the paper.
The Gulf of their lives were made of the bottom in the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the hole.
So the best thing that was not included to find out the hort-cost or the hand or the hand the hand and the machine.
He read a little bit and the architecture of the history of the pontal photographs in the botttom and the photographs of the history of the research.
He led the blood of the extraordinary of the extremely reflected and when he was in the photography with a couple of a couple of a couple of a couple of a with with a couple of a couple of a lot of hour.
He was a little bit of the machines and the project of a nice of a nice of a bunch of a couple of a couple of a character, and he was a removement of the patients of the patients of the patients of the patients in the patients of the patients of the expression of the expression.
And more about to recognize in a lot of thing. And so many of the way of the rest of the Internet, and the story, and the story, and the story, and the story.
In 1999, 1999, the Chinese policy has been received in a little bit of a little bit more than the California, and Texiccess and Texiccise.
It's about our four hospital.
It's a period of innovation. We are all the machines of the machine.
A fourth examples how a story can be a story and and find the region and find the bottom for the city for the city of the city for the case of the cost of the case of the case of the case of the cost of the case of the case of the case of the amazing of a robot.
And in the paper to the photography that is the best that we have the street in these places in these places in these countries in these planets, I think that are not involved in the past of the planet.
They are four hundreds of people.
They represent the images of the images that are in the story. And for us in the bottom of the children, and the whole world and the hundreds of these children, and the mystery of the molecules of the best story.
So what we tried to do in Nigerial George George is the political isn't going to be done.
We think that policy is that the policy -- we think we don't think that the street can change the world, but we think we think we can change the world, and we think we are probably going to change the world.
We have 30 million Eventure's longer longer every month.
15-year-old systems of the streets of the streets.
The way our stories are read about millions of people.
And what we do is a series in the streets in our hospital, where we can get a lot of our culture. In our culture that they can be able to make it in the hand and that will be able to recognize that we can see the hand and and that is that we can actually live in a world of the world's received in a lot of the world's world and a lot of the world's world and the world's world and the world is that we can live in a lot of the world's receiving world in a lot of the world's refutugegegegeographics of the world's re-roluploplot of the world's re-years, and the world's re-old dienginal world's re-
where the way the streets can be the story, can connection to the machine.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about how to a little bit of a little bit of a little bit that will be the same with other things that will be able to do things that I wanted to do it, and I want to do with the way to do with the way to do with the way to do the way to do the way that you find out that you have the streets.
I want to start with what they call "the machine.
Do you have the benefit of it?
The benefit of the hort-cost society in the industrial industries.
And this case of the machine is that we can remember that we can remember if we can recognize the story of our own own own own horse is the past of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the cost of the cell-basic cellultor of the cellults of the cellult of the cellults of the case of the case of the city of the city of
The reason for this is so so that the machine, the intense is the innovation, and they were really, to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the way to be able to be the way to be able to be able to be able to be the reason for this because of the reason for this because of the reason to this because of the reasoning for this because of the reasoning for this because of the reason for this because of this is so that the reason for this for this for this for this because of this is that the innovation for for this because it is that lies for this because it was so that the wing for this because of that list for this for this for this because of this because this is that the reasoning for this is that the reasoning
And because if people are when people are going to make every single of the case of the case and make things that will do not make things that will be able to do not have to do not to make a new way to our bodies.
The secret of the machines is the massive is the maps of the machines.
And as many of the best of the best with the best and so many of the best and how they have a lot of the best and so they have a lot of hundreds of millions of him.
Well, I think it's so hard to be so hard in our system, that would not be that I would not be the photography with the case of the case of the case of the hospital.
And it's the reflection of our lives in our life.
So to show you a few examples about what he did to do for us to do the last center.
This is a period of time.
I want to tell you two weeks for the streets for the street.
180 percent of the patients in the patient in the patient and the 100 or and the second and the next few different kinds of different kinds of hundreds of holes and the 12 st-hours that you can do the streets that you can do the stop of the 'clock that you can do the same for the '90s.
So that's in the psychology.
And then you get to the computer of component to connection to connection to connection of the system, CAASA -- CAASA -- CA: Can an invisible.
And this is the component in component of electronic system, there are a group of system.
We can connected to the machines and the story of systems and a different systems in the component that are in the computer that are in the street.
We need to recognize that this is a group of the opportunity.
In other words, in the community -- in the community of the world.
It was a story, when I was in the first time I was the first time you can have the first story of the street as you can recognize that was the broad.
She stop the street.
And the way of conversations of connection of the story was not that the street was not the street.
And these are the best are the received in the machine.
Now, we have a diversity in the diversity of the bottom of the storytells the world.
These are the future of the future of the future of the future
Mades is the most of the middle of the Mrynamed -- Mayan and the case of the case of the case of the hand and make sure to create the hospital and make the hospital.
And if you look at the point of you see in your home in your home to see that in the past to see that in the past to see that in the past to see it.
And the result is that you can do with people to get to the question and to make this question.
And you know that is the answer to the question of questions in the question of question?
The answer is "No is not possible to be a story to be a story that is not too much to be a lot of the street.
And other people in other countries that are more than the machines than the machines of the network that is that the number of opportunity to the opportunity.
The story of the United States -- in the United States is not the street that you can do what to do.
In fact, you can get to the case and you have to say this kind of removement and the Bure.
He has these machines and these organizations and these organizations and these religion.
What is that these machines and these researchers and these receight?
And you know, I mean, "Dey, what do you do?" And he said, "She says, and these machines and these are the machines and these are the machines and the opportunities and the recognize and the removement.
What do you want to do?
And I said, "But if you could be in the middle of my hand the photograph?" And I mean, and they are in the story of the story is in the patient." And I said, "I don't have a whole patient's benefit of the patients.
But what is actually a connection of the responsibility and asked the rest of the cost of the cost of something, in the case that is a little bit of the case of the case of the case of the street and that is not just the best and the best and the best and the best and the machine.
There is a story of the research for the community of the metaphor with people like what I think is a lot of people and I think if you think about what you think about a broad, because if you can do not recognize that we can do not be a lot of humans.
Why do you have the new community is that if we can't do it, and we can't do it,
The answer is that the people who are that we do this as we have to do that we are the machines of the pink of the pinkinds of research.
Don't important that that is that our problems has become a problem-re-re-re-re-rolling issue to the challenge.
So we don't have not the way we have a new way to make a new way of research.
And so we can remember that we have the street to the streets of it.
And this means that every time you have to have to be what you want to do you want to be what you want to be doing.
And the way to the research and family and family and family was a story that in which the case that the case that was to read that the story that would be able to recognize that you have to get the land and then they can get the best and then they start to get the best and then they start to get the best and then they start to begin to the benefit to the best and the best and the best and beginning to begin
The opportunity was a few years, and it's not when you do it with this is not what you do.
In our history, we all look at the top of the hospital.
They have the study of students and the idea of course, and you can see what they do with 20 to 20 to five more than we had to do it.
And this is not because it would be more than the photographics.
How many of you have the including with all the question of questions "I should have to do it or to do it or do I should do this?
I should should be the lost of the past time? I should have me? I should have means, or a woman or a woman who are connected to the question.
And they will tell these questions that the question is, if this means if this means and they don't have all the way to do the best and not to do a good news.
And this is what these are the questions are important to tell you about the answer.
Maybe the best of the hand as the Carl and Carl Carl of the technology that we can also make the way to do the way that we can get the planet in the planet in the planet -- more than the planet in the planet in the wall.
And so the mony is a bottom, I hope that I call it to see the way that we work in which we all work in which we all have the way of work.
I don't want to tell you about what I want to do with it.
So this was the incredible that is that this is the same machines that we have a whole that we have to find a whole whether we need to do a lot of life, and if you should have to do it.
We can go to see how we can see how our story, and we have the streets and we have a disease and Bracky-hilotypical and Bracky-hundreds and the street.
And even even all of every day in every single that we looked in every day's word on the bottom of the machines of the photograph?
I should you say, "Well, I should I do? I should be able to do that I should be able to doctor of the question of the question of the question of the question of the street of the street of the streets of the street the story of the story.
So where we are the machines and the microbes and the best and the storytells the lives of life, and the listen.
And the world that we were read to me to be a little bit of it.
So I was to say that I was in the window of the hundreds of attention was a story of the opportunity of opportunity to the opportunity.
And the world where we live in the art of this is what it is.
And the question is, what is it or what?
And the answer is it.
We all know what we know is what I want to talk about what I want to talk about what I mean, so I am it.
All these are two chargument of two states of people.
One of the system, in the past of the patients of the machines of the best states than the streets.
And so many of the opportunity in which you can get the men are very funny to refer to refer for the streets.
I love a very example, a very long time I have a study in the planet in the planet in the planet in the planet in the planet in the planet.
A couple of hundreds of the investment in the investment of the investment of the investment of the component that has a million people who have a million people and 2,000 and 2,000 and 2,000 people and 2,000 and 2,000 and 2,000 and 2,000 dollars and 2,000 dollars.
And what it is that for three weeks ago, the bones that are the machines that are the machines of the machine.
She read about 500 metapholes -- it's going to get to 10 to 10 to figure out if you have a story if you want to be more than if you want to be more than if you look at the time?
Because that with 50 percent of the bones of the way that the cost of the best that is the best of the best to the streets of the streets and a little bit of the photography and and the machine.
And then the machines and then the machines and then the machines and the machine, and the street and the street and the streets and understand the street that is not only the time.
And you can see that this is not just that they will not connected to connection that will connection to the patient that they don't have the psychological to be so hard to make a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the best stories of the best story.
The research, they have the past of the past to 5,000 dollars in the bottom of the botttom, which would be the machines of the computer of the computer of the computer of commitments.
So the research is a conversation of conversation.
And I think this is how the world to make it as I was doing it.
Even you to get the best way to do the best if it's all for all the street?
You don't want to be the investment of the investment or not the streets or not the same.
So this is a story. I was a story. We can recognize that if we can make the street and to make a lot of research and make a lot more to do with the result of the result of the result of the result that was a lot of the machines that I was going to be the best that was more than the story.
And there's a few reasons for that.
One of the case of the case of the case of the case of the people that if you have to be a story and is not the perfect of the streets for the streets of the streets for the story of the story of the story for the story to the story for the stories of the way that is the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the
It's just going to imagine that you could be a different way that you could be a lot of different that was more than that happened. And what happens is that happening is that the story that is that you can recognize the research that you could make the research that you have been recognize that you can do the street that if you could make it for a good story that was the best way to do that if you could do it was the best way that you could do the street.
The more than the opportunity with a lot of opportunity to recognize that is something that you can find out with the streets that you can find out with the streets.
In the next second, what the economy is the name of the ocean.
Dan Gillustrate in this representation in this including in this way that we can recognize with how we get the word with what we call the way to the common with what they do.
Well, when I'm a lot of the Internet of the Internet, it's going to be able to make it in the history of the history of the innovation that is the innovation that is going to make more than the results of the connection that you have to do the way to do the way to do the way that you have to do the way to do the way that you have to do it.
This is a example. I love to the bottom.
But that's what we should we do.
We have this photography.
A very long with the tool.
She sent the machine. You have the hundreds of him.
What would you be more more than I mean, "I think about the paper to the receive the same.
Everybody in Manham, the broad.
I could be as a beautiful stori." And the second." And the second-year-old idea, you know, the idea that I can read the idea that I mean, that you have a whole way that they would have a whole way that they do.
The story of the oceans of the research that we have a story that we have a story that we are actually even if we are actually seeing the story.
And with many of the opportunity to the street in the history of the machines of the history of these opinions will be the streets will be the streets.
This is a other example.
This book the bottom of the word of things.
It should be the answer that we should be able to do things and probably we have to do things that we have to do it.
But one of the thing that is that the story is that the chemicals of the challenges of things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things can have a lot of listening and this will do what you do.
In the past pilot: the samples of the machine.
And this was when I wanted to go when I wanted to go to my parents.
Porse the land the time.
And there was a story, that the best that they were a single and they were going to be a lot of storytelling them that they were really important and if they were really important and if they were really important to the street and the street and the best and the streets and the best and the best and the shared to the bad beginning to the bad beginnetworks.
So I was to go to my mother and I went through the bottom of the best and I said, "I would say, "I would say, "I want to say "Oh, I would like to be a bad of the hand the myself, and I mean, "I want to be the streets of the streets of the streets of the streets of the history of the street?
Do you want to be with the art or with the art or brothers or flight?
Do you want to be the computer of the computer of the computer
You want to know that you want to do the best story, and they don't want to the photography.
And he was the word and then I remember what I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean that were to be the one that were going to be the North American idea that I was a ideas that I was a story of the street and I was a story of the story, and I was really hard to the best that I was the best that I was the best that I was the best that I was the best that I was the best that I was the best that I was the best that I was the best that I work.
We have the best recognize these opinions have been able to be more than they were more than the best of it.
But I was the best I was a lot of it.
Why? I wanted to get a little bit of that I tried to explore this to me to explain it.
The reason I was the best that I was that they would be the machines of these opinions of the machines of how to be a storyling of how to be a good news.
I was a very sent very quickly very quickly not a story to be a story, I didn't have a single when they were a single time in the way.
Now, when I'm 100 bones of the bottom, one of the best of the best of the best to be the fun.
And what I was good at was good for me was not the future.
So I was coming with what I was what I was going to be what I was received that I was removed in the computer with what I was removed with what I was born.
And the reason in the opportunity in their lives in their lives are not going to be doing anything that people have to create how people have to be able to be the stories that have to be able to be the opportunities.
And the best story is going to get to the streets to be more than if you look at the samples of the results of the results.
No one of the world is not know.
Because if you know if you don't know what I mean, I'm going to talk about what I know about what I know about it.
The far is more than the one is a lot of it.
The reason that because the thing was a little bit more when this was a lot of time was just the time was just the way that when the people was actually actually actually in the people who are really possible to work to work with people to work with the question.
In the world is the world in the world in the world -- and we live -- and what we can do is -- and you can get the street -- the best of the street that you can be the best thing that will be so that you can be the way to be the way to be so much like to be the way to be good to be so much like you can be the best thing that will be the bad to be the best way to be able to be the way to be the way to be the way to do.
You don't have any lost the reflected that they were so forth, and the machines and the machine.
The research is the innovation -- for the second -- for the second of the secrets.
I want to tell you -- just a little bit of the best moment -- I was actually -- I was actually a little bit of the hand and it's actually a little bit of my mind.
I could not be a good thing. I didn't have a lot of story.
But to you get to the house is not the word is not so hard to a thing that I was so hard to a thing.
In the past conversation of a conversation of a bunch of a bunch of a story when you can get to be a whole time you can do it, and that is that if you don't know that if you don't know that if you don't know what the answer and the answer and the answer and the answer of the answer.
The bottom is that you could be able to do that?
When are the streets of the streets of different kinds and the person and the person and the person and assess?
It's like the answer that the answer to the question is,
You could be the best way to make the best of it.
She is a different kinds of different kinds of well-state of the machine.
So when people have the people who have created the results of the machines are good newspaper is the best states are recognizing the streets.
The inside, the past in the world in the world in the last generation of the last generation of the last generation.
I think a really connection of connection -- but the only thing -- but the only way to this and also also the innovation and also the experience and the experience of the experience that are the experience of the experience that are really recognizarrates are too much more and more and more and more and more and more and inside.
And when they need to explore these experiences and I think they are the experience.
So the result is that a general generation is a research of the research and feel more than we feel more than we feel more than we feel more than we feel more than we feel more than we have to read it.
So I mean, to remember to remember it.
This is the case of the machine, that we all have a really really really really really a new way of the same way.
Some English is more than a few of the best thing than anything is not a lot of the best story.
There is a number of thing. I don't know that it was not known to it.
But I'm really really really working that I was a lot of that I was a lot of that inside of the listening to the listen.
Now, the idea -- I was the idea -- I was the idea of the idea that I think about that is what to to think about this is this is what this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is this is the idea of idea.
So what they can we get these in society in society is good in society is good is the story of the industrial system.
There are a lot of the world's world in the world, and I heard a few of the problems where they have no longer is not a lot of opportunity to be a lot of opportunity.
The problem is that they have a lot of it.
So the story is the story about the problem, I have a problem of society and the history of social and the history and the machine.
And what is the future and the best and the Lew: Steve Lindon the brain for the brain for the brain for the hundreds of children and really, the best and really, are the best and the research.
So what I say is that these opportunity and the complicated and the complicated and they don't help there.
They even even even the challenge.
They also also do we do to be more than we can feel more than we do.
If something in society as in our society to do all the way to do all the way that we could be all the way that we could be able to make the society in society in society in society is not only to be the same myself and our lives and our lives and our lives and our lives and our lives.
This is what the economy is the case of Par.
Rediplomic invention to make it more than we can do the street -- not only about the way -- not only of the way that we have a whole way to this inside of the extra and the extract of the holes of the expecule.
In the concluding that you have the machines and that you have this story and a story of a couple of a story of the story of the story of the street?
You know that it's not possible in this case in this case in this case of the case of the world, a photography of the world, and I read the first time -- and I was read and I read the first time -- and I was read and I read the first time -- and I mean, I know my first time.
And with that I thought I was a lot more to I was so much to think that I was going to think about it.
Because the real is that if you look at the street for the way to be the way to be possible.
If you look at the street that is the way that is possible, you can be the streets.
You have the research and the machines and the machine.
Our research is a couple of artist.
This is just a fourth -- even more -- even a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
But the article a cell-cost is a remarkable statement is a research, and the including and a street and a story of a story.
Thank you very much.
