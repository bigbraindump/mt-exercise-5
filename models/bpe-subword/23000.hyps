And the third of the second diathletes to demonstrate the future of the polar polar that the big polar of the last three million years of the last 48 percent of the four men in four mice, the little slide of the four percent of the slide of the four percent of the southern of the third of the third of the third of the second to the second to the be.
But this morning, this is the special problems because of this problem is that not argue the broken group.
The police is that the heart of the climate system, the heart of the climate system.
It turns out the soul and they control and the degree.
The next diathletes that you look at the top of what it was going to show you in the last 25 years.
The pemanced is the big piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the pemancy of the pemancy of the pemancy pumpemancy pementering psychemannels of the pemanced pumps of the psychemath.
So as you see the blue of the blue inched the blue inch.
This is the aware on the analyzing one.
And they walk the heart of the windows.
Asay's name is the broad, with a five years or more than five years or more than the same, you can see that it's almost like a body.
In 25 years of this year, at this one.
This is a problem because the incoming the challenges of the oceans of the oceans of the oceans.

The pollution of the pollution of the times of the global income, the future of the future that we could take this point of extremely extremely extremely extremely extremely extremely extremely extremely extreme that we can take this point.
And as a certain in a little bit of the Alaska metand, the metal metapholes of disease.
The Kator Katter of Katter Walter from the University of the Alaska a another long always to another law of the network.
Here is the Gore: Al Gore: He's going to be new to us.
And a reason is that I said, "The city of the incoming out of the normal intense of north.
This is a range that all the ancestors.
But the volumes are much larger than anything.
This is the Kangerlussed in the Groenlandes.
If you want to know how the large level, you want to stand on the piece of the blood on the top where it is the place where it gets inside the main the main the main the main the main the main the main the main the main the main the main the maintain you want you to know how to know you want you to know how you want you to know how you do you want to know how you want to know how you want
These debate creasses very quickly.
And the other capital capital of the planet, Antarctica largest piece of the planet.
And one third people have streaming the past of the continent of the continent of the continent is the negative of the Antarctics on the Etarcticle on the winds of the insular insular insully.
This is the choice of the southern level, so that in Groenland.
In Himalaya, the main the third of the third of the third of the new forward of the new forward of a few years were were bakers.
For the population of the population of the population of the population of the water of the topirrace.
In English is the water of water to this town for this city to this order.
The bites have created it.
But when it was such a little bit of the water and water and water.
In the California was a 40 percent of the four in Sierra in Sierra in Sierra.
This affected, the water reserves.
And the predictable as you read it as you read it.
And the global was the global growth of the resistance of the incentises.
And the deaths of the global land of the global rabsolutely received the far and the preceiver.
Ffour times more than the last 30 years of the 75 years.
This is a absolutely sleep.
If you look at the context of the context of what it is happening.
In the last five years of the last five million tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons of tons in the oceans in the oceans.
So the next one-th-aware of the Pacific, and the Pacific, and every part of the subcontinent where the subcontinent where the region where the oxygen recognize the oxyge.
The biggest thing that the only way the global income, the global despairs, which represents 20 percent of the fuels of fuelse.
The troll is a problem and the best problems.
The United States is one of the two of the him,
And the proposal to be building a lot of fabrical.
But we start to see a change change the total.
Here are the people who have anulated in the last year.
All of the political policy in our politics.
And the industry and the bottom of the landscape of the future of the last few dollars in the last future of the future of the future of the future of the fendaristic left of the fendaristic industry.
The promote both of what is a oximety-oximetying.
This picture of the image of whatever it is.
In the teacher Cracia, at the Tennessed, a billion stery's sterm was the imprise.
You probably see the windows.
This is the right thing is, in the next few works, the second South American She intampled in the prison to the Cracia.
One of the classrooms of the bottom of the Cracium in the Western of the Cracium was this.
Video: All right, the homeless of the bottom, and you see the flight and ves.
He is from abundance, here in America, and help the economic growth of the economic economic economic economic growth.
Frost, the case of the bottom what happens to the water.
He is access and adorably and workers and workers of shape slass.
Al Gore: This is the great newspaper Virgine.
The biggest one of the largest book is several of Massy Coal.
Video: Don Blankens: I want to be clarric clar. I don't want to be Pelosaurban Reideight not what I talked about what I talked about what I talked about what I talked about what I talked about what I talked about what I talked about what I talked to talk about what I talked to the idea of the ideo:
Al Gore: Asuch as Aliant, for the Climate Climate the Take of the campaign camps.
This is one of them, part of one of them.
Video: ALergy COALergy new climate change for a very serious to make a very serious to business our business.
That's why our except is our principle, we are going to spend a big deal of public speed to help us to show us and we are really helping us to show about the charge of the charge of the charge of the charge of the car.
The thing is that the bottom is not the best of the bottle.
We think that it's the current -- and I was a good and my morood.
So it doesn't choose to change the climate change for changing the climate change the climate change
Lask this in our time.
Video: The cook: The cookay, you heard a flight of it.
So as a hazy-to-team of this guy for the water installation of the bottts.
Haim: Masinarly is like the zromots.
But this is the sound technology is the sound of the bottom.
And as the bottom is one of the incomputers of the global incoming to the global remarkable technology that you can see the bottom of the newspaper that you see the change everything.
So the next one-thick is technology is technology to the bottom of the bottom of the bottle.
Al Gore: In the sfars; the only only positive the economic challenge of the economic problems.
Video: Narrator: Narrase, the economies, the economy of nationality climate climate climate climate climate climate of the climate of the objects.
Amazing the league that they live all the new fueling fuels on the bottom of the bottom.
But now we have a new solution to the innovation to the innovation.
Right?
A funny of the American remaining in the above and sure it makes us to help the global stopping of global income.
In the south, a solution that is a big solution to help us to help us solve problems.
The energy energy of America. Aflu than America.
Al Gore: This is the last last year.
Video: Narrator: It's about re-energy re-energy re-energy of America.
One of the more faster way to including the dependent of fuels of fuels that killed our fuels that killed our energy is here in our energy is the energy is the energy of the energy is the energy is the energy of the energy is a new energy is the energy of the way of ways of ways of ways of ways to the future of ways of ways of wa
Barbed nr.2: We are investing to create the shape to create the platforce.
Narrator: Right? It's time for the actissue.
Al Gore: There is a degree of the degree of the African that you want to go faster, you want to go fast, you go to the only only only one of the only only only one of the only only one of the only one thing."
If you want to get you to get your far to go away.
We need to get to the fast.
Thank you very much.
And the third of TED I did a LHC.
And I promised to see a bit of how it works a little bit of how it works.
So the attack attacks. And the people who were not here, LHC is the biggest experiment that was intiful, that was intiful, the winds of 27 kilometers, or is the conditional to the present of a military second, a million dollars on a second to create a second to the universe -- the size of a seconds.
It's extremely ambitious.
This is the water is the city of the Geneva.
We have photographs these minds of the Big Bangs."
I work on this way. It's called the ATLATLATLATLSSS -- Lungim, a four meters, a fourth photography of the detector's building the detectors to build the building of the building to build the proportions.
In the 10 sequence of the third of the first time for the first time.
And this image was the driver,
He asked a huge case of control.
It's a little bit of the first fashion the particle of the particular system, which is the intuitive system of LHC, the circle LHC deliberately deliberately deliberate in the HC democracy in the particular particular in the particular image.
In other words, when I was a 10 sequence of the picture of the picture of the spike, which is a successful for a successful thing.
I don't know that if that was the first first of the most openness, or when he went to the page, when he was a wage, they were going to come up with the first page.
It means that I did a culture of the culture of the streets of the streets of the streets.
After about a seven seven a sappeared with the issue of water -- these fields -- these fireflies -- these firefer -- these fields -- these fields -- these fields of the aur.
They're the physical translate the 13 miles of the bottom works.
Now, the engineering of the engineering and said, "I can't transportation. They're not transport."
But I can do this because when they're in the temperature of what they spend is going to be slightly superdely.
So as a 271 degree of the space, and they can transport the sports, they can transmit so that they can transmit so that they can transmit so that they can transmit so that they can transport the horrid.
At one of the weight of the 9,000 of the website, was a fabricatic define define define define define define define define define of fabricative.
So as the computer has the first time of the 13 thousands of American electricity.
That was the result result.
That's more presentially the retirement of the streets of the tone, and they deployed about 30 times more than 30 cases.
So I determine the average of 50 percent.
We had to get them to the affect what I was doing and do we do it.
I reconditional one, I repaid.
And now you go back back back to the subterran in the subterran in the subterran.
The farm of the sea left of LHC will be new that we are going to be new as a new thing.
So what we're going to go from the new way, and we have to get in the hythese, and we're going to keep the research to the research to the unique that are the elements of the universe.
Now, of course, as a way from a sense of recognize talk, and those engineering and engineering to extremely extremely to reach to reach to reach them to reach them to reach it to reach them to reach it.
I think that the data, I think it's been attached by the fact that we have a good thing, this is important to experiments of experiments like LHCHC.
I will not be our inched to the inches of a streets of the British Davy, I think when I think about the incidents protect science protect is safe the incentive of the protect of the protect is not more dangerous to the deliver is not more than the samples are not going to the best of our minds are not going to make our lives are not moving our lives, as our lives, as our minister to our lives, as our words, as we are not loss in our mind,
Thank you.
I want to start with the range to remember the kids' worth of children's going to play with the body.
And as you invent what you are teaching them to the ridicates and they are to the choices of the colo, in fact, you actually learned how to figure problems and figure problems and shared how to solve the relatives, and you can also solve relatives.
The space is the space is the profound is a big part of the world of course,
So as a computer research of the IT inspired by the interactive of our interactive objects -- impressults, and the collaboratory -- I was trying to start with my Pattty -- I was trying to start -- I started to start begin -- I would be able to a computer, and we can use a computer, and we can use a computer, and we can see a little bit of a little deeply and the fish of a little deeply and the funny of a little deathrothright.
The art of how do we want to know how do we want to want to think about it?
The question was the question was a fascinating fascinating to try to ask the Siftask Siftable.
And in the scale is a computer, Sift-bish computer.
They can be able to be a range of the recireceive the miscing of the other, and they have a networks.
The biggest thing is that I'm a palpable of the palks, you can just watch it as just watching them as a water.
And Sift-flow examples of a new instruments of the digital information of digital information.
And as the masssive that these instruments becoming more constants of the other constants of the other constants, and constantly our active active actises, we can start exploring us to exploring new styles, we can start exploring new interactions.
I will start with some example.
This Sift-Sift-presented to predict in a video of including in a direction, if you get the floor of the other as, if you including including including including including inics including ine.
These are the interactive of the other constantly.
So, if you put them on a whole language.
If they're inconnected to the confusion and they can become confusion.
I can feel the missing and incline.
We realized that one of the interesting of interactive interactive interactive is that we can use the gesture's going to be able to manipulate the snake, how we could be cultural license.
In the case, we have three Siftables of the configuring and you can use them to hold them to hold them in the center where they will be in the center where they will have to die in the center where they will die in the center of the center of the center of this is going to reach this case.
If I was a lot of lot, we can choose the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inclue.
There are also also interesting to learn for education, as it would be played players and logical logical and logical logical and logical to be to to be able to see the result of the result results.
So here I have a Fibonacy of Fibonacy that I would make a little bit of ecture.
Here we have a game, a combination of combining to Scrabs and Bogglle.
And the first time every street every Sift is at the intimately to intimately the broke, and you try to form with a bridge of the blood of the blood of a dictionary.
Then you the 30 seconds of the second sset of the task and you have a new set of changed.
Thank you.
These are the nistakes who came to the Media, and I had to take the Media, and I had to try to make them a material material.
I love them to love to the negs.
And one of the interesting thing that is that the kind of applicators is not to give them a lot of instructive.
All of you have to say, "From the word of the word of what to do to do to do it.
Here are you going to have some people intriange to them.
This is the most tanish is our right in our right right in the right right right now.
It turns out that all of the Siftable, he was to do the Siftable.
So for he was just a little bit of the botts.
This is a animal applicators of animating.
We wanted to build a instrument to build a language.
And this is Felix.
He can go to the charge new books in the scene of the Sift-Sift-field charguments.
Here is the sound soar.
Video: She feels it works.
David Merr: Now it turned a traction,
Video: The Trace.
Good well. Yeah.
Miss Siftask and assing one language that it can do the charge -- Video: Ham!
DM: creating the narratives.
Video: OK.
DM: It's a story of open story, and he decided to deal and decades.
Video: Zara, the fish.
DM: The next example of the example I showed today is a instrument of created and interpretated the music and interpretation that I built the Sift and in which Sifables and in the Sifabs and the blood and in the blood and wood and the blood and broken and the blood and the blood as well.
Every one of these four various various various choices that you want to use it to use it to use it.
And you can inject the sound that sound that you can ask you you can ask what you might want you to ask what you would like to do you want you to kill you to the guy.
You get the sound sound that sound Sift-ft-driving Sift-slide Sift-blood.
There is the effective that you can control the live and the movie.
And you know, you have a certain a certain the business.
It is the effects of the general effects and the volume of the spiders of the second sequences.
Video: DM: DM: Well we're going to start in the second Siftables of successful successful things, a series, a series, a series, a series more and more and more and more and more useful and more useful Vide.
Now I put a link of the network.
Video: DM: As a little bit of the period.
Video: DM: And now I'm going to add the movie, to control the effect of controlling the lives.
Video: M: M: M: May grandmother including in a part or in a part or in a part or in a part or anything or whether or anything or else in a part or anything else.
Video: Your movies of the movies of the movie.
Video: M: M: M: M: I can do the exciting.
So I don't have to do the next prospitallel of the long or funny of works.
Now, in the sfard; I can tell you the top of the Sift of the Sift-flow flow bees in the streamed in the streets of the stream.
Thank you.
As the way that my passion is creating new creating new creating new computers that are right with the way that works are working better with our brain and our brain and our brain and our body is working.
And today, I had a time to show you a new space, and some of the design of design, and some of the possibilities that we try to keep them in the labeled that we try to lab.
The reason that I think that the winds of retype of this new generature's retching the new generates of the digital digital digital remote to our digital respect of our world of our reference in our rules of our new research our rules of our rules of our rules that will advance:
Thank you very much.
She was with your nervous nerably talking to you all kind.
I'm writing the wrong way.
He wrote the teacher is my teacher of course, more than I was a longer than it
It's all my mother was my mother and fascinating.
And I don't like this is going to change it.
But these physics to hope a little bit of the fish and in the vision and in my book, who had determined me of my father religion the work.
And the thing that I wrote this book this book this book the "Manca, Rography "Manca, Roadia-Iubers" -- -- -- the death of the clothing, and he became a feeling the world for a little bit of the world for a sense of the world, and it became this important sense of the world for a sense of the exciting of the world for a sense of the world.
The reult's word where the origins are working on the humans of the condamner.
Seriorists -- damnatures.
All of the example of the choices and I don't have a team -- you don't have you can not be a team, you can't even even more you can see that?
You don't have you to go to the team is going to wrote your life, you would have a little bit more create a book that you want to have the world of the whole world of the world is the whole world of the time?"
It's very line indeed in the true.
But it would be more running to remember that I was not a 20 years, when I was about 20 years, when I was a little bit of people -- as I was when I was a little bit of the same -- I want to become a writer -- I want to become a kind of the same myself in a kind of front of the same mouse of the same fricks.
And people said, "Do you don't know that you have no longer you have no longer success?"
I don't want to humility your ideas will kill you going to kill the ideas going to kill the ideas going to kill the ideas going to kill the ideas of ideas?
You don't have the front of the future is going to be a look at this field and no matter will not be there, you will not be here, and you will not be deadly in a death, and you would reach a screen of the network?"
Something that is about this.
The such thing -- the rassing on the scale of all the insects of all the insects of all the insects of the "Yeah."
Yeah, you know, it's all of all these things that are all things.
And always he always stop.
And you know, it's just in the floor of things that people don't have any other things that people can't get them to be intuitive.
As a big example of the big things that are infrastructure of things that are infrastructure.
But when it's about written about writing things, and I thought about the last time I was asked in the last time I was "Why?"
Is it something rational ration?
It's the love that anybody to have this to be a little bit of working on the work that they were pretty much to do it as a Pamant.
And what is what is the specific initiatively that seems us are really excited about the sanitation of the sanatels in a kind of a kind of way that other teachers don't do anything that other teachers don't do do anything that other teachers don't do do anything that other teachers don't do you do it anything that other teaches are doing in the specific initiatively to the initiativity of initivative initivvative to the initiativitivity of initiativitivity in the top of the initiativitivitiatives.
My father example, for example, was not immediately, and you don't have the funny of engineering the first engineering of the iner's question, if you don't have a question is not a question is not a question is a question of engineering inchemistry.
It didn't intampled -- John, how do it work?
I just don't even get it to the top of something like something.
But let's be a feeling of the chemists of the chemistry of the second faster seconds of remarkable remarkable remarkable to be alcools to be alcools of the depressive to be alcools of the depression.
We write the writers of insects, and not just writors, but it turns out that they have this remarkable to be able to be able to be powerful, they have this remarkable to be power to be powerful to be able to well.
And everything we have to do is look at the number of death the same, the second fish of the mind of the mind of the mind of creativity, which have died to be died by the way, which they died and open.
And even the same same same question that they didn't even have to be truly to be truly of the challenges.
Norman Mail, even before the past of the interview, in the last of the bottom of my books a little bit more than a little bit more longer than a little bit more longer than a little bit more longer than a little bit more long."
A big challenges of the extraordinary work.
But it doesn't even even when we hear when we hear it as I heard this is because I heard so many times and I heard so many times and I heard so that we have to have a collective idea, the idea of the idea of creativity, the idea of the creative idea, the idea is going to be a little bit of the end, it will conduct the inside.
And the question I want to add all of all of all of all them, are you going to have with this ideas?
You are comfortable to comfortable as you see how the light of the light -- I don't just hear with this ipost.
I think it's the odiodiodiod.
And I also think it's dangerous and I don't want to see the future of the future in the future.
I think it's better if it's a big artists of artists to travel to travel it.
And I know the sure of the case, in my case, in my case, in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to me to try to try to try to intuned this mythese, special data, special president.
As a example, I'm pretty much about 40 years.
I probably have probably four decades works.
And it's very probably the thing I wrote with this moment to be judges to be judged by the last time of my last success of my last success of my last success of my last choices, covered the paint?
What would be going to say is the masss of the way from one way of the friends of the friends of my friends -- it's very probably the largest successful to be intampled to be intampled already to be intampled to be intamed to be intampled to say the blood it would be to say the fall, what it would be to tell the fish the best of the food would be the best streamples of the bits.
Oh, Does you look at all.
This is the kind of kind of the gene that could make it in the hand to the network, and I don't want to get the 99 times of the person.
I want to do it in the word that I love this message that I love love.
And then, the question becoming questions?
And so I put my mother to a lot of my father to work on that I need to work right now, to go back to the right now, it's in the psychological building a kind of building a kind of building cook?
I have to do it in a way, I want to go to the pastraway to me, the floor of my father and my team, and my team, and my team, and my teams that will be now with what it would be now to be in what it would be now reactive to what it is going to be now to what it is going to be in what it would be a south,
And as I was looking for the last year, I was a sense of the time I was trying to get the time to try to find other society to see other society if you could have better ideas, if you could have better ideas, if you could have better ideas, and the people who can help us to see people create the risk of how the emotional issue of the emotional emotional emotions.
The rest of this was Greece in Greece and Romantic Romances.
So the surprising remains of the inch.
But in fact, the Great Roma Rome and Rome is doing that people don't think that people don't think that people don't think they were not working on the internal internal inside.
People thought that creativity was a spirit of the people who can get out of people in a sure of people in the future of the reasons, from the reason and needs and needs and needs and needs and needs and needs to the flies and needs to be able to think of the people thought about the creatiativity of people thought that creatiatiativity thought that creatiatiativity was a spirit of people thought that creatiatiativity was a spirit of the creatiativity, people in the divity of the creatiatiatiativity of
The name is called these these spirit of creativity to the term of the terms of the terms of the terms of the term "demone."
Scracy was the front of that has a demand that has transmitted the speed of the slide of the departs.
The same shape they had the same shape, but they call that spirit of creativity,
What is the wonderful is the wonderful because they didn't think that a genius was a genius was a genius in a individual individual individual with.
I think that a genius was a kind of a divince of the divince of the windows, the incident, the inside, which is a kind of a boy as Dobby, who insession, which is the insession and insession, which is the insessive the work, the brain workers.
Absolutely the stralong -- this is the distants that we were talking about the psychological results that we were to protect the result of the work.
And everything that the world is working on the work?
So the artist of the years, like this, like a certain things like this, for example, a lot of narcism, cook?
If you were the long strallows you could not be the losing of the world for it, all of you all this genius that they had this genius that helped them to helped them to helped them to helped them to helped them to helped them to helped them to helped them to helped them to help me to help me to the fear of the lab, if you were the strallet of the long strallows the long time.
If you were the criticizing was criticizing the critic?
All the world of the genius was kind of the genius.
So they look at the people in Very creativity for a long time.
Then came up with the Rene and all of the idea of changing the ideas of ideas of ideas as that the one of the universe like the center of the universe like the center of the universe and the mysters, the far is to create the first time to create the first research that they first receive to the first discoveries that they were the first revenue.
It was the human beings beginning, and people start creativity to create the creativity of the internal internal internal internal interior of the individual interior of the individual interior of the individual receiving the human beings beginning to the human beings of the human beings of the human beings to the human rational research of the human rational rational rational receival receive the human rational receptor or or the human rational recepts.
And for the first one in the history of people have begin to one or the artists of artists like the genuine that you can have a gene genuine genies.
And you have to have a little bit of a huge of a huge of a huge of it.
Permitor a little bit of the person is actually a little bit of the person is actually recepting and the issue and the issue and the intense and the ingernal and the intension, research is a lot of the initial responsibility is a lot of the answer is a lot of the fairly deliving too much.
It's like you like you to choose your software to choose the sound of soil.
I just just to feel incovered and deformed the choices of all these types of all these types of the inimaginable of the behind of the sans.
I think that the president of this pality has a five years.
Or if you think about it, and I think is, what is the question is, what do you do not?
Can we do things different?
Maybe you can start to including the sense of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain of the brain.
It can not be not.
Maybe we can't just stand to stering 500 years of thinking about the rational rational talk,
And it probably as the public public who would have asked the questions of assuming questions on themselves on themselves in fact, which faces are actually going to sure their settled and their sets and they are all to their own daughters.
I probably will not be going to cooptest all of this idea.
But the question I want to ask is -- why is it -- why is it right?
Why don't we think about how do we do it in this way?
Because it has a sense that any other thing else about what I heard about what you means is the best of the creativity, the inner of creativity.
The process that anybody has to make something -- because of the people who are not just -- you know that it doesn't even behavioral behavioral behavioral behavioral behavioral to begin to the rational process.
Or in fact, sometimes can put the analystering analyze.
I had a repair intype where I met the extraordinary of the Make Stone, which now has been in journey to be in journey and that has been storing to the story of the story, and when the story of the Stonield and it feels a little bit of the Virgine, and it was a little streaming the room, and it was a state rop.
The story was like a wood of antoke air.
And it turns out the roadcast.
The feeling the invention, because it is the fish of the fish of the painting.
In that moment that has a single thing that has a single thing to do, and you read the water as a aptop like the water.
And alerging the water of the house of the house of the idea of the idea was to get to a piece of the map of the map of the map of the faster and when it was a little bit of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the water and slide the water of the water and the water shape of the water as a little water to the watch of the watch and shape of the water and the water and the water and the water and the water and the water and the water and the water and the water and the water and the
Sometimes was not enough to the alerga and alerge, but not the window and the house in the house and the poems and the poems and the poems of the losing camps in the room, a room and the one room, "All right, a little stream, "All right.
They were the point that -- and the moment of this is not going to look at that time, I will be a loss.
Alerga the map of the map of the map of the map of the exactly when they get to the exactly when it was a story when it was indeed to the other and the story and the story and the story and the story and the story and and the story and to the other.
The first one of the codes and the past and the past and the past of the masssive the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map.
So in this situation, the poems of the map of the map of the map of the first time at the first first first of the first first of the first first first of the first first first of the first first first of the first first first time.
When I heard it -- it's the surpranced that workers, it was exactly how it works.
My father creatively not limited to this -- I'm not running to this -- I'm not running to leave it.
I'm a way, and the way I worked on the same way I was going to get the same way to the same way to the same way to the same way to stand and I want to stand and I stand and I stopped with hard to stand and I stopped with hard to stand and I am a hard way.
But even though I was in my inness to my father was a little bit of that phenomenon.
And I just ask that I was so much of you had a lot of you were going to be a lot of you have.
And I had the design of the design of the projects that they didn't know that I don't know that I don't know you know you don't know you know you don't know it to him.
And what do you want to do you this?
And how does it prepared to do it works, so we should not lost our mind to live our mind, you know, the right right to help us to help us to help us to help us to hear us to hear us to him?
For me, the most relevant of our days, which is what we can do is make a musician to be a Waite, we took a Waits, we took a few years of years of the review of the reviews.
I was talking about the super-to-to-to-to-contempt of the contemporal contemporal contemporal research, what you can can control and figure out what they can can we find these inably international internations.
And the time of the line line line line of a day and you have the story of the autops on the autops and then everything has changed the top of Los and everything has changed the change.
While as a long time in a fragment of a scale of a piece of a piece of the piece of the evening and athletes, and it's not a southern and a split and a split is not as if it doesn't how to get it to the watch and it has no water.
It has no photography, it doesn't have any report report.
And the thing to feel the screen of the anxiety of the desir, and cancer in the moment, and the cancer of the monkey to always to always to always the monkey for always to always the monkey to always the monkey to always the monkey to feel like the wish of all the various walls to feel the door of the vecture of the vecture of the screen to the soul the wish that you can fe
I'm not enough to walk away to remember the broken."
And in the painting to go to the top of the land it just recognize it.
He refed the process of the process and all the new thing.
He was the shape of the south, and he said, "Sorry, you don't see that I'm not going to be like I am at the volcance?"
"You know, you can see, you can write a cancer cancer to a cancer cancer not?
If you really want to really be true, you know, I was inside a moment of a moment moment when I can go to your hand to my home to you hear it.
If you don't want to be and wrong and love it somebody else.
You want to go and love to Leonard Cohen."
The returns out the process of creatively changed this.
It doesn't have it worked on the southern as intuned as intunately.
But the meaning of the meaning and the agnetwork, he was the moment that he took the spike, the geniduse, the geniduse, and he cause it to the be, and he realized it was just to get back to where he was the inside of the invenike and then he realized it doesn't have to be something that we don't have to be something that we need to get to the insurance of the interior of the inside.
It could be this collaboration and the bization of a conversation of a conversates of the terrorists of the terroristake, which wasn't too much like Tom.
After I heard the story of the story of the word of the way I worked a little bit of a little bit of the data and already had a data.
This is what he had had been told me when I was at the midle of "Manca, Royal Roreaws, and I have the kind of a kind of such as a kind of slightly in a kind of death, and when I was a little bit of what they are going to think about something that it would be the best risk to think about what it would be the best rise to think about what it would be the best risks.
Not just the most process of the book the risk of it.
I want to think about I should think about the project, I should abandone.
And so I remember my father talking about the space, and I was asked and I was asked and I was asked and I was receiving it.
I was a little bit of the manuscrowing and I adrest a collapsed of the camera of the camera goal cooks.
I told with the voice of the winds of the winds and you know that if I know that the book is not just the extraordinary is not just the right now?
Because you can see you see that I was a long to the wildly longer than I can do not run not longer than it wasn't the poor.
So if you want to be better than you want to do you do it do you do it go to your down.
OK. And if you don't want to do it, you know, you know anything to do with it.
I want to write for me to write for this is messing messy.
And I want to connect my song for today I did my book my down."
Because -- because -- the conclusion -- with hundred years ago in Africa, in North Africans to the North African to sarrasses and the music and music and music and music and music and music to the long and in the sack of what they have to let up to the ras.
And they always had always to deal with the teachers were remarkable to remarkable and they were remarkable?
But sometimes very running out of the interpret of the interpret of the interpresident.
I'm convinced you all the people who are all of you to all of you all the time, because everything else in a certain a certain the interpretation.
It's like the time is a little bit of the time and dancing is a kind of shape of silence or whole other 1,000 different series of the other 1,000 series of the other people, everything is the innovation.
On a time that it doesn't even even more seemed in the intuitive.
It's the world of the world of interior of the diventures.
As the time, when they were intamples of people who were in the names they were in the name.
I mean, they have the machines and they were "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Doh, Doamn, Doamn, Does Does Does the wall."
It's the God.
A funny interesting -- when the history of Spanish Spanish Spanish the Spanish the speed of the century Spanish Allah," Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, the one of the so-in a history of the world, a whole

In Spain, when a research interpret and a little bit of a and the magic and the Bole, Allah, Allah, the Greek -- the Gree."
And the intelligence -- a God, a God.
It's a wonderful thing, because we need to have a little bit like this.
But the part of the second day that the second time that the insusion of insusion is and discovery, the history of the winds of Divessels and not a lipiece of Dives.
It's a digitor who are the drives that they would never be the best and they could never hurry not even more to intimate in the intimately.
Can you could not be a better invoice that the number of the Dominess when he was a little bit of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest could do anything that anything that could not be anything that anything you could not be nothing to be no longer to do to do anything
It's hard to be hard.
It's one of the most froying, the most drawings.
But it can't be a big chance of the big chance of the incer is not a little bit of inceive from the most extraordinary interies.
Maybe if you create that you just think that the couple of task for a few sure of the moments of the moments of the moments of the next time you would be done more define times of the right time, when they inched their inched times have inched their inched to the point of them had inside their insurance their inside their inside to the time.
If we think about it, all of us begin to change it.
I was asked to think about it, and I thought about the last months in the last months of the last months that will be published to be published to the top of the asteroid, a continuous way, and infrastrical, and infrastructure of my success to my successful successful to my successful to my success of my success to my own successful to my father and I was a little bit of

"Ole." "Ole" for you to you, just like you just a dragot for the homends and incapatancing to the participate in continue to continue in continue.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I have more about some of these designs of these design, and what it could remember and what it could remember and new discoveries of genes.
Now now begins in in a new point from a new point of biology, and now we're trying to go from this code and now we're trying to get a new biology and to enter and to enter and shaping forward and shaping forward form and shaping form of life forward forward for.
We tried all the time, we tried to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to ask us to try to ask us to try and asked all of the time, we tried all the time, we tried all the time, we tried all the time, we tried all the time.
"What is the life life is something that I think a lot of biologists have tried to understand the levels.
I tried different approach to the component of component component to the component.
We are already about 20 years.
When I was the first sequended up the genome of the world of the world of the world in digital world.
So what do we try to ask to ask the vision of life, or we can create new forms of this universal humanity in this universal?
This is a little bit of a little organism of the genitalist, which has the most most of the most important species that can replify in lab.
We tried to see if we can see if we can come with a genome and smaller genome and smaller than a genome of the genome and small.
We were able to surely the surface of a hundred hundred of the genes in the top of the 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of the map of the map of the main our comparison.
So you think about it, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes that we can suggest moment of time, it's a little bit of the job.
So we decided that the only thing that the only thing that we can actually think about this cromossed this cromosses to see the components to see some of the most questions to the questions of the most questions.
And so I started to start the room, "Can we can do a cromoss?"
Maybe it allows these task these molecules that I didn't want to do it anything I didn't want to do anything else I didn't want to do anything else I haven't done more big datab?
And if you can ask a cromosome?
A cromossed by the way, it's just a little bit of material material.
So, our speed to our digitize the exponential rite.
Our research to write code the genetic code that I was a little bit of beginning.
The last time he was a speed at a speed exponential left.
I started this is about 15 years ago.
I went through a few task a few stepped by a future of the experiments of experiments.
But it turns out that the shapes of DNA very difficult.
They're such a little bit of the machines that are doing a little DN, months of DN, months of DN, but it's a 50 percent of the degeneration, so that what built is a little bit more than building longer longer than the building longer longer than the building longer than the building longer and the average of a little machine.
So we had to create a new way to create a new way, and he shares together and the cooks.
This was our first tenth our tenth of information, the digital information to the digital information of Phi 174.
It's a virus that the chomoice that makes you to the be.
I did the design of the piece of the cooking, and I got a code of DNA molecule of DNA 5,000 DNA 5,000 literally charge.
The interesting interesting came up when I took this piece of material material and I put it into the bacteria, and I went to read this code school, and to produce this code school viruses the genetic schools of viruse.
The viral viral viral retural cells in the cells and they were hundreds of Ecolls.
I was talking to the oil industry and zero and the best of this model.
They have longer more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software in which the software in a system in a system in a biological system in a biological system.
But I wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the cromossing the entire of a bacteria.
This is about 50,000 literally code school.
So I said, "We would have to put the winds of the house in the house to the house to the house of the house of the house of the house that are component to understand the cells of a cell physical.
The critically, is criticizing the digital information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly the information is a very exactly the obaction of the course of the course of the course of the course is the criticize of the criticisis of the criticizing is is is critical.
When I was the first sequence in 1995, the standard of precious precision was a 10,000 windows of the windows of the windows.
I found in the resource of the resources of the original second screens. If we were used to be able to be able to be activated.
And from the design is designing of the projects that has 50 literally five to the other other other other charges that we need to build all the other other characters to build a little bit more than the building to build the competition with the others.
We have the elements of tools.
You can read you to read "watermarket."
Trists from those those tools -- those characters of the code -- one of the characters -- one is a only chemical characters.
So we can use the gene of the genetic code to write a little bit of the word of thinking about it.
The next one, all of the photography was to hear the code.
Some people were deeply of the poetry is not the poetry is not the bad of it.
We designed the piece of the piece of enzymes we can digit with enzymes.
There's the enzymes that they repair them out.
So we started doing it bends to make it bends up with 7,000 literally funny to do it for 24,000 literally cheese, and then he asked them to 7,000, and then he asked to 7,20.
And at every time I was in the floor of the abundant to be able to set them to create a process of robband -- as you can see a robe, as you see in a mind.
We try to get to the automatically.
So, this looks like a team of a teren myself to the ball.
When you get to the piece of the piece of 100,000 per in Ecollect, not create in Ecolls.
They are going to all the biology of the biology of modern modern modern modern modern modern modern modern work.
So we have the right right to other mechanisms.
I know that there's a mechanism called the biologist, which is that biology that biology that are using DNAD, and which would be.
This is a example.
There is a organism called Deinocockets that can sudden million radioy-radiation.
As you see in the south, the crossed is the degree.
12 to 24 hours later, he put it in the other assed as it was long to inceive the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be open to the top of the talk.
I can live in the vision of living in the vision.
I am absolutely safe that life can be in the extra new space to find a new environment.
In fact, NASA has shown that this is going to go there.
Here's a little bit of a molecule of a molecule that we build these process process -- actually actually using mechanisms with design mechanisms that we put them into the beyond decades.
Drodies them together with the audience with the audience.
This is not a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.
It's so a molecule of the molecule of a little cooptical microscope of a little cooptic.
These are images in a paper of a hundred of the six seconds.
This is a public public public public public published a little bit of time.
These are over 580,000 choices of code code code code code code
It's the biggest molecule that I just had a funny structure of the definite.
It has a molecular to 300 millions of over 300 million.
If you have a 142 and a 142 pages of 142 pages to printers this code code this code code this code code this code code code code code this code code code with this code code of the genetic funny of a funny of a funny of a funny of a funded with a funny of a funny of a funny of a funny of a funny of a funny of the funn
So, how do we go a cromosome? How do you active.
Eighted, with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
You also also also feeling the best when you get to the tools, you can just get the nuclear and you can just put your nuclear and you will heard you have heard -- clone.
And the bacterial bacterial is the integrate is interested in the cells, but we showed that we can do a completely transplant to another cell, and we can do it anything else to another cell.
I pushed a crozen from one of the microbial microbial microbial microbial microbial house
These are the second is about as people and the future of the funny of people and the same.
I add some genes in a few genes that we can see that the cromossed for this cromosse.
I discovered them with enzymes to him.
And it was pretty much as I put it in the cells -- you will appreciate our grandmothers -- and the cromossed -- and cromossed in the cells of the cell.
In fact, we thought this is how this is it can go to design something more than we tried to design something more departs.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are all sorts of the species that have the second group of the third of the third of the third of new species, thousands of new books, thousands of new cars.
So the people who think about evolution is just like one way to change the change of the moment of biology.
I'm enzymes of restrict restrict DNA DNA DNA DN.
The cells that was in the cells that was not a little bit of it.
The Celull -- cromosis that we put them together.
It was expressed and the other cromossed the other cromossed material that they digerators, and so I was just with the cell.
It became the blue of the genes that I put them in cromossed in cromossed in cromossed in the cromossed in the cromosomes.
And after a very exciting time, all the time, all of a species of a species of species have lost always lost of a new species in a new species in a new species that we put it in the software in the cell.
All proteins were changing the proteins were changed -- when we get the code of genetically, it's exactly what we transfer transferated.
That can sound like the alchemistry, but we can can be changing the DNA to change things that we change the things that we change the things that we change the things that we can change the things that we are pretty much pretty much quite things like this.
Now, I had been told that this is not the genetic -- but it has built three billion evolution, and we had a half of evolution, and we were in the Cambridge Cambridge Cambridge has a new species of the massive new design in the digital design is a new design of the massive design diital design.
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty good at the point of the point of the needs of the needs of needs
We're going to go from the six and half of the new billion people around the new hundred years of people over 40 years.
And as to put this in context in the context in 1946.
There's three people on the planet for every one of the 1946; in 40 years, they will be four years of years of years of the four years of it.
We have the problems of the issue of the fish of the drugs, the drugs, four billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and we have a problem.
It will be difficult to do for us.
We're using the top of the tons of the books of the barrier bbarrier of barily barriums.
This means a million barily of barily day.
When we will try to think about the process of biological process that this process to replace.
Then of course, it's all the CO2 to this material that the CO2 materials, which is that it has to go into the atmospherical material.
Now, from our discovering from our world, we have a little bit of the data from 20 million genes, and I like to think about these kind of thinking about these designs of design.
Industrial Firel the electronics or so that it was a diversity of diversity that he came from this.
We're limited here, in the first time of all, and a real biological image.
We have now to do this technology is all of these types of shape, you want to do what we call the genimic charge of genimimics.
We have the ability to build a big robot that to build a million cromosses on day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of genes that are different to optimize or to optimize products of producing products of producing products of producing products of new molecular biology to a little bit of new biology than a little bit of the last 20 years of knowledge than a little bit of the pursue of the purpose.
And that's just the standard standard.
We can see the effect for viability to look at the substance of the chemicals or fuels,
This is a screen capture of a software of design that we work to work and work to work and work to work these species in the computers in computers in computers in computers in computers in the computer.
You know, we don't know how it will you look at how it will show you going to show you the shot.
We know how their exactly how their genetics.
Now we're now concentrating the four four four four of the generation.
You see, you saw that from the eton is just a needed experiment of the nereact.
We have the fueling fueling the two and the third of the past that are going to watch the fuels, which are the blood or flow as a bigger settaneous or different kinds of diseases or different kinds of disease.
But the only way we think that we think biology can have a major impact of the limitation and the limitation of the limitation and the limitation is if we start with the CO2 as we start with the first cells to design the first cells to design the first generation of the cells of the four to design the first generation of the four months.
Life and CO2 is a -- but in our world's discoveries of other works.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It takes in the oceans in the ocean, about two kilometers and half kilometers and a half of the temperature of the physicians of physicians of physicians with pherome.
Transform CO2 in metan use hydrogen molecular as energy as energy as energy as energy as energy as energy.
We try to see if we can see if we can take the CO2 captures, and they can be able to convert the CO2 to the CO2 to the CO2 to rush in the fuel.
So in a period, in a time of time we could die what is the question of what is the question of the questions "What is the living "What is the living like?"
We really know -- you know -- you know -- we have to replaced the whole industry of the whole industry of the oil.
Yeah. If you don't do this at TED, where in another part.
Let's becoming a lot of energy to most energy for energy to energy it.
But we also work to use these same thing to use these same settled to invent vaccines of vaccines immediately.
You see, you saw this with a year in the hand and a year in the minus when it comes to the right vaccine.
I think the situation can be changed by combining to the vaccines of combinators.
Here is how it could you get to arrest the future changes in the evolution, the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution, and finally finally finally finally indeed, and finally finally finally finished the final shape.
We're almost about to improve people.
Our reason is just to make sure that we have a little bit of survival survival survival to survive it very much.
What I want to show you a little bit of a very quickly, is a very quickly new technology that I had a new technology that I had to Microsoft a part of a piece of a year. This is a piece of a year. This is a year. This is a year. This is a year. This is a year.
It's a media that can interact with a big deal with a big deal with a big deal of visual data to visual data.
We look at a lot of girls a lot of digital and men and men in the continuous and myself through this one-drift, I wish it anyway.
It doesn't matter how much much information about how much much information is how big is these big pieces of large or how big is or how big is images.
Most of the picture is done with a camera of the objects, but this is a scanna scanna Congress, for the Bilibrary Congress, the Congrest 300 feet 300 feet of 300 feelings.

This is a book is a non-imaginative example.
It's about "The "Should he like Charles Dasked the Daws of the colored a represent capital.

Maybe this is a fueling way to read a book in the book in the electronic book in the electronic book in the form of the electronic way.
I don't want to recomcommand.
This is a more real. It's a little bit more requirement of "Gardian ardian hand
Every pictures of a seconds.
This is really a little bit of a experience of a experience of a piece of a revil of a revil of a day's environmental environmental environmental environmental environment.
We did something small and new a collaboration called Gardian called Gardian ardiagul."
I created a false reclamed to a very big resolution -- much more than any recognize -- and I was a content content content content.
If you want to see the properties of this machine, you can see here.
Or or or even the specific models.
And this is actually the idea of a limited of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor
We're going to feeling the pop-slices and others, and it would be a little bit of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene.
Of course, the maps is one of the applications of the gene of the gene of this kind of technology for this.
I'm not going to zoom a long time to tell you about this is contributed to this contribute to this figure out the domine.
These are all the way of the United States in the United NASASASASA.
Let's go to anything to do about whatever it is.
This is actually active actissue the Internet of the versus of the versus of the versus of the versu.
This is a kind of a project Photosyn, which allows the two different technology is Seathern and the other thing is Seathern research in the field of the visuel-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-Saveling Saveling Steve Saveling Steve Steve Steve Saveling Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Southerick at Souther's design

So this is activists on the Internet.
You can see that when we create this when we create this kind of perspective, when we can have this kind of experience in many ways.
But the art of these images of these images conteditions.
One of the space of the visual spiders have regious to these images together, so that these returns out where these types -- all the way that these pushes of the Canadience -- they have been doing these physics here -- they were made these physicists here in the environmental physics here in the space or of the city of a design space or of the space or of the space or of the space of the space.
I'm not sure if I was not a whole other environment.
There are some of the other that have a lot more space of space space
I would like to go to one of the original stories of the original settosype -- this is making a part of the Photosyna Photosyna -- to show you what I think I worked on the rest of this technology, technology that I think it's not just a visible vision of this technology is not just the vision of this technology, and I want to go to the design of the design of the design of the design that we have a projection to go to the journalist in the setwork.
We had to have to have to have the shares of the shadows.
This is a reconstruction of the Catch of the Catch of the Great Flickr. It would be Dot's Dockr, and you find something that you can find something that you can find something that you can see in the rock of the conducts, and every one of these conducts, and every one of these conductor that was found a picture of this model.
These are the Flickr, and all of this is relationship in this way.
We can just sit up to navigate in this way.
You know, I never thought I was a very exciting to work to work on Microsoftor to work a lot of little little to a lot of the first one.
I want you to see that there are a lot of the camera of the camera from the TV cameras at SLRRs SLRRs SLRRs SLRRs a very large number of environment.
If you can see it in this room.
There's a lot of such a lot of shadows.
Once this is a series of photographs --
This is a poster with the New Dork that was registrated cooks.
You can go to the pursue the environment.
The idea is that I can do something that I can do a social thing to collect the data from all the people -- from all the people -- from a whole collective what's the visual Earth of the visual visual speed something that is the innovation that is the innovation, they became more than the sustainable and the shape of the countries that are the biggest of the country that is more than the water is the connect that is a little bit of the average of the social things that is the speed to do with the envir

And this creates in the complexity of the world is using the benefits, and the benefits, and as it is using it as usually useful as usually useful as it can use it.
The picture is the picture of the metaphetettle.
If someone would be all of these types and they would say who they are not going to be with the Catidral Catch to Dockay, and I could do with all these data and I could use all of these data and I could use these times for the navigate in that space, to realize a kind of experience in the combination of the space.
And of course, a produced produced the produced of the phrases of physics and the patient of the Earth, collective paper and the peak of the daughter and images from the satellite, but from a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I mean, what it will allow the software to the best time, in the paper, in the push of somebody elses in the paper of someone in the glog of someone in the glog of someone in the glog to be interrelationships on the wind?
BAA: Yes. What's really makes it really really to describe the descen.
They reach the high-slightly between images.
And it turns out that the content of the image.
And that became a read when you think about the information that they have these signals have these images.
And as you do a look at the Internet, the floor of the Internet, and the text of the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of information about what represent is what represent is what represent is what representation of information.
Now, what would be if that stop makes it slowing with all the position?
So what's the exciting interconnection and disease of this is the exciting of the classroom. It's where it effect where it effect of reference.
CA: Blayer, it's really incredible to incredible things.
BAA: Thank you very much.
One of the pathy of the pathy and one of the types of the teenagers of the teenagers who don't have the humans who don't have the south, which they still have a little bit in their lives, and they still feel in their spike, in their fueling in their front of their fueling streams in their fuels in the floor of the plants.
And it's just a little bit of the Jaguary to the Sorth Lack Callel of the Lack or myself in Himalaths are still still still a little bit of the Himalathy to revealathy to revelent the center of Dhar, is to revely, but this is actually in a sense of the idea of the idea that we live in a sense of the world that we live in a sense of the physical model that we live in a sense of the physical model that we are light-scale model physical model, but this is is is is is is is is is is is is just a physical model physical model physical models of the physical model physici
The consequence of a decision that the strange that our strange that we took a lot of our generations with a lot of generations in the next one.
And of course, we all enjoyed the same imperadapts.
All of us are networks.
We need to take through the rituals of the ritual ritudes.
You have to do the extension of the newspaper of death, so you should surprising us to surprising us to have the arts.
But what is interesting is that the car is the dancing of the dancy dancy every culture.
It is that it's the next year of the Borney, or the details of Voodoo from Haiti in the Haiti Kenia, the Kenia, the Kenia, the Kenia, or a Currender, or a Current in the midle Sahare's the Sahare's crows.
Third the guy that I was a long long long ago or even a long southern a pants on the pants of the Evered the world.
All of these people are in the way that there are other ways to think there's other ways to think about the other way to think about the Earth of the Earth.
And this idea of course, if you think about the spot of spokers.
Now, the morifying of the world's living together with the lives of life, and cultural life that cool the planet, and it's also the planet, and it's as a planet, and it's like the planet, and it's like the planet, as the planet, you know as the planet, you know that the clothes of life.
And you could think about this is the slide of life, and you could definition and you could definition and you could definition of all the slights, intuitive to the live of the human life, intuitive to lift the human lifetime, intuitive to life.
Etnosing is the machines of human movements.
It's the simple of what we're going to be a surprising species of chisco.
And as the biosphere was several several -- and it can be a lot of larger -- and maybe a lot of larger scale of a much larger scale of larger scale of a little bit biosphere is as much larger.
For example, no biologists not to suggest than half of all species or more than the extinct or more of all the extinct of the extinct is not true, and yet -- the most excited -- the most excited -- the most excited in the field -- about, and this is about what we know is about what the diversity of what we know is about what we know is about what we know is about what the diversity of the diversities.
And the biggest indicator of this is designing of their own improve research.
When you walk you, you know, there are 6,000 language in this room, there were 6.,000 languages.
Now, a language is not just a vocabular or a grambers or a grambers of rules.
A language is a human spirit of the human spirit of human spirit of human spirit of human beings.
It's the fashion that the southern physical materials.
Every language is a blood of the mind of receiving a receiving a ecosystem to be a spiritual of possibilities.
And from those 6,000 language in the Monterey, a half of them in the Montested in the athletes' children.
There's no longer learning, what it means is that if they don't change anything else is already to the language of language.
What can you be the only only only than you can be surrounded by your last line in your last network that you don't have to talk about you, you don't have the way to do you understand the language to teach the children or to teach the children or the children or children or the children?
And yet, that sound the sound is the research is the only thing you can see on Earth, at the week, because every two weeks of the weeks, a weeks, a weeks, a weeks, a language of a language of a language of a language of a language of a language of a language of a language of the sound of a shares,
And I know that some of you will say, "Well, you don't have better better than you would not be better better better than you wouldn't be better better better better better better than you will?
It doesn't have a better place if I was a single language if I was talking about the language of the language to be Cone.
Or to be Kogigi."
And then you will discover it would be not be in your own language to talk about the language.
So, what I want to do today is a kind of a shape -- a snosing -- a scale -- a scale of the streets to try to try to try to do you go to the fact what they lose to do is actually losing you to do it in fact.
Now, I'm a lot of us that I would seem to look at different times of different different ways to understand the way to be able to do a different way to be able to do it.
Let's take this child of the kid in the tribal of the northern Masslimonded, the poor of the years, they came to the windows, they came to the room, in the room, in the room in the room, in the room.
This is a pop-st-sland of the blue of the blue of the bastrous history is equirement of the spiders of the spiders that people depended people who depend on the ground of people who depend on the streets that people depended up to the independent of the popps that people depend on the pops that are depending on the popper that is through the shares.
I have a language and the rules of the jule that is called the linguistaker's network: you need to go with somebody who talks with somebody who talks about a different language.
And all of these are released in the past-to-hyological things, yet is a little thing to talk about six months or watching the internal language or the internal languages, no language in somebody else.
They just just the lives and then the language to talk about the language.
Or one of the most fascinancers that I lived with the Wath, the Wath, the Wath, a content of the Ecuadory, a contact, contact, contact, the first steps in 1958.

They have been working from the air photographs with them in what he wanted to be a gest friends of the friends of junger friends in their life.
They took those photographs on the solar solar to look at the spinal to find out the shape or shaped name or noned noned the conclusive that these are the books, so they were the five of the five of the field of the five missing with the field of the field of the field of the photographs of the photographs of the photos of the photographed the photographers.
But Waorld Waorld World World Western the bright.
They knew ideas and between them.
54 hours of their mortality in the mortality of the kinds of the love with labs.
I always had been amazing the opposite generations, and I found two cases of mostly natural movements and when I was a little natural about it, they brought a little bit of the guy that one of the guy that I was asked to the shared with the same time, so I had a streamed with the same time. But in their time they knew land, so they had a streets of the slightly sweets have been amazing the slightly ly.
They're their pushing animal can move to 40 to the four hand and you just let it it to the next one.
And at the early 1980s, I had a surprising of the teacher when I asked my question, I asked me if I had interested in Haite, to go to Haitay, and I would go to Haiti and Tonton to Duval's a Tonton Duvaling to create the power to create the power to create the wish to create the bully.

But what it does is do is this is this relationship between the various and the dead of the death.
So the one is the right is the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirite.
Spirites can be invoted by the Apain, like the dancy to the rith to the deliver the southern of the southern moment of the world, so that the scale of the world, so that the windows.
That's why I say the practical wisdom that "You're going to go to the bright.
We are delighting in the teacher and become God.
And because you're possible, you're going to be a funny of spirit of the spirit could be seeing about the hus?

Now, from all of the position that I met the most extraordinary Kogi is the best Sierra Nevada Nevada Nevada Nevada Nevada Columbia.
The degrees of civilizations of civilizations that that just the opposite of the coaste of coastal charge Columbian imedia chemicalists of the spider, this popper shadow in a massive that the room, this popped that the ridicular code that has the ridge.
In a paint of the painting, this popper is the under that was not the excited by spans.
And so on the top of the ritual ritual rituals, but the president, but the president.
Some of the young people are rup, 3-year-old families at the end of the window in a world of humans in the college of the pirry of the pirry of the spiders of the spiders of the landscape of the landscape of the young years.
Sometimes of new years of the new years of the new months of the new long way of spread in my mother spread in my mother nature in the museum in the museum in the museum in the mother's mother's mother's mother.
And the whole whole land and they are inside their society that the tracks, values that they ruplify the rute and only rute their metal rute -- or we could say -- or we could say -- or we could say -- or we could say -- or we could say -- or we could say --
And the end of this amazing initial initiate in their life, and the first time and the first time in their life, they see a 18 years, they see a 18 years, they see a bridge moment of the first consciousness, when they start to the first consciousness, all the way they learn to the beautiful content of the window in a beautiful confirst, and they learned in a confirst, and to the end of the main a connection of the massive content connected in a content connection,
And they say, "Well you see what I said, "You see."
It's actually so beautiful. It's your protect to the top of it.
They call it the frain and they say that we are the best of the best responsibility to distractive.
Now, this left is becoming very important is becoming very important to it.
Or you think about how we think about the boy and the shadow, or invoce, or invocate Right?
Well, the kids are not not not the sentencement, no slightly new tools.
It's not too place for any malaria in the malaria in Amalaria or in the winds of Tibet, but they created a tracks, and they created a little bit of the Earth, which is the idea of the Part, which is the idea of the idea of the idea that the Party, but in the idea that the Partype is just a lot more than the idea of conscious consciousness, but the idea that the Part is just a lot of conscious.
Now, what does it mean?
It means that a boy of Anday that is created that the work is the spirit of Apt Apt the Apt of Apt is going to be a difference and it would be a different relationship to that the resource or that the resource of the resource of the resource of the Montana flight of the Montana bontal for the mind of the mind of the mountains for the mind for the mind.
And it's the place of a spirit or a broad, is the best of the mind.
Intest is the metaphor is that defines between individual and the world of natural and the world of natural and the natural world of natural and natural world of natural and the natural world.
I was created in the ground of the Columbia British to believe that the sure of being your broken to be your broken to be your eyes.

If you start to look at the idea that these cultures were able to create the real collective of different culture, you can start understanding their extraordinary plants. Let's take this plane.
It's a picture of me in Amazon Amazon the athlete's ath.
This is the ayamazing ayamazing you in your psychopical psychopathletes.
Ayamazing is not fascinating for the potential of the potential left of the case of the couple of different setts.
The first is this is the only thing that has a series of rising bolina, the mamap of the floor, modern funny of the fish of the fish of the hands.
It just consumer is more degrates of the blue whatever the whole whole whole whole of the consciousness, but the bastrks, but the best of the case of the cafin the family called Psycheks.
This plants of content content of the slices, very strong series in the brain in in in the brain, 50, 5, 5, 5-mthyland, 5-mthyland.
If you saw you ever seen the Yanomamambodies in the tribes of their nose, that survival is made from their nosophyle, that content that content and my broken and my my bondyland.
He slices through the name is actually as you have expected by a shot of a blood flow of a blood flow in a big electricity. Not a big floor of realities.
In fact, my song of Richard Evan Shultes -- which is the hultest was the psychhedels in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I was to arrive the funny of the classroom, you can not be the hallucinoxious, because in the moment of the moment effect of the effect of the effect of the issue is not no longer than their lives. In the flies of the issue that they can't be able to be enough to be enough innovation that they are not enough innovation in the money that they are not enough to be shared to the money in the money that they can find that they are not going to be in the money in the monkey in the fish in the money in the money in the monkyear of the en.
They can be taken by the way, just by composing with the compositions that are denied MAO.
Now, the thing is that the fascinating is that the inhibolinherently in that times are the inhibiters to the choices to the question to the question of the entire animal to a whole plane of the plane of the planet, they found these two species of planets that are combined these two planets that are combined to this whole fascinating combines that are more verse than the entire of the entire plann?
Well, we use that euthers, I was trying to be a lot, which is degree that without a sense of sense.
But the questions and they say, "Plants talking about it.
Well, what does it mean?
This tribes Copan has 17 variety has 17 variety, and I record them on all the south, and we see all the species of the only species.
And then they ask them how they ask them to the door and they said, "Drededen I know something about planes.
I mean, no one anything you don't know "No I say, "No one."
Well, we find that there was 17 variety of the 17 variety of the night of the night.
Now, this is not going to add a doctor's a doctor's a lot more interesting than the number of stamins.
Now, the problem is that the problem that the sympatients, and you see them as well-slices, but as a bize and the bizarre world as a bize of the world is where the world is that our world is creating the world, and our lives of the world is developing our world is developing world in our world is developed the world.
The next is that the second 20, over 300 years ago, in 300 years of technology or innovations or innovation or innovation or more and more degraduate or in which I had to actiflies or we have accepted or and we encourage and we have active diversity to the planet, and culture, and the collective and culture.
All of all the times of all the times were doing in a new dancing of life.
And the problem is not technology in the sense of itself.
Indians don't have the Sioux didn't start to be Sioux when they were hundred and the and, more than they started to be American to be American to be American to be American to be American and living in the case and living in the couple and lights.
It doesn't change or or technology or technology to the fall. It's the power of the nose.
It is a cruels of the cruels.
And you look at where you look at the world, you know, these are not living in a little bit of digite.
These are people living people living in the tools of the forces of the expensive of adapts.
It is that the blood flow of the country in the country -- a tribe, a tribe, a third of the Asia Saraway, from Saraway, from Saraway, and all of the land in the window, and all of the males and now all of the males where you can see the landscape and the product and all of the Brurks, where you can see the Brurky and you can see the Brurates in the Big of the bag that the Brural journal journal journetworker in the mols of the Bovide that the Bovies of the molololols of the Bian to be the Bike that the Bot that spenitts,
where the japped streets in the horizont to the humans with your broken and a blood of the shadow.
Or the Yanomamambodies that have came from the exterior in the exterior in the areas of the aura.
Or if we go to the Tike in the mountain in the last time in the last time you see the cruels of political inside political field.
You know, the genocide of the physical physics is condamed the universal condamed the way of life is not just the way of life is not just the way that it's not just a bite, but it's not just the universe -- in many areas, it's a universal settled -- in many areas.
And you can't understand the Tibet, you can't reach the solar level.
I was a 9.6, 9.600 kilometers in Chinese Chinese Chinese on the rutests to the Lhaving to us to sleep with a colleague of Lhaving a Lhasing and only when I was in Lhaving Lham to understand what they learn what they learn what they learn what they learn in the spinal static spaces that they were holes in spired to understand what the speed in the sports.

And one day he was a long time, from the network with Mao with Mao and this infrastructure of the first time of works.
The Tike Tike is the opportunity can be impossible to the humans is something admirrrrates of people is something admirrrrase.
And finally, in fact, everything is happening to a choices.
We want to live in a world of monotonights or we want to accepting a policystoni?
Margared Meare's mostly anthropy was that the team, he was that the biggest was that I choose to this is that we have to have this is not just about the entire of the world, and I amorful, but that we will see the entire of thinking about the world, but that we are going to think that they were going to be a little bit of thinking about how they were they were going to see that they were going to be in a day and other day and other ways to think of the wall.
And it's the behind to remember that our species of our species of time, and the species of time.
The Neolitical evolution -- which has been agriculture, the moment of his hand the hand the hand the hand the hand was replaced by the way, I created a president, we have a specialized of specialized -- it was just about 10,000 years ago.
Lume the modern industrial way, we know about 300 years of it.
Now, this history is not the superficial suggests that we had all have all the challenges that we will confront of the next millions of the next millions of the next millions of the next millions of the next millions of the next millions of the next millions of the fuel.
When this lot of cultures of the human lives are asked about the human beings of human answer to 10,000 voices of the answer than 10,000 voices.
And in that way, we're all going to rediscover what it sounds to be what sound sound like the consciousness, completely conscious, and all the groups of the best people and all the groups of the prosper.
This is a photograph that I did it at the end of the north of the Baffin when I was at the winds of narras, and this is the Inure, Olayuy, and this is the story of the Inure, and this is the story of the fantastic story of the fantastic story.
The government cannot always had been always to be so good so good, and in the 1950s, and in the 1950s, and in our colonies, we forforced in the colonies.
The one one of the deep refushing to go to the wind.
Familia, the next stage for life to life, and all the arms of all the arms of the elders.
Now, you have to understand that inure's initially not the best of their frigerates in their advanced to their advanced to their advanced to their death.
They're their healthy in their own history of the past of the piece of caries in the piece of caries.
So the good thing that is not the intimate was not the night of the night that the crash that the suffering.
He just just the along alone, he shares the floor of the pantalonies in the piece of the piece of the shape of the shape of the crements begin a shape of shape, he was a kind of shape, he was a kind of shared in a kind of shape.
He put it on the floor of the floor of the exmenties and when he was finally funny, he was a blood and he was a couple of him.
He was a little bit of the windows, and he had a map of the task of the tack and improvised a sand, and he was a sand, and he was a wind, and he was a wind, and he was deeplited by the express of the express of the express of the express of the express of the express in the express of the express of the express of the express of the express of the map of the expressed and the bit

It's our new four our four our our network.
It's a terrorist. Independent to the resources of all the mineral resources of all the miners.
A amazing example of how a national state and repair for their streets for their story.
And finally, at the end of the end of the fish that I was a little bit of the floor of these places that we were not deaths in these places are not despairing are not deeply define that they don't even detect.
They are four people.
They represent them the rames of imaging images that come from the daughter of the children, because of our children, and the dreams of our children, and it becomes a part of our geography of the hopefully hopefence of the hope of the hope of the host.
What we tried to do we try to do in National Geographic issue is that politicians don't want to realize that anything you would never realize anything.
We think that the polemicy -- we think the polemies are not convicted that the polemerging can change the world, and so we are probably the story.
We have 35 million visions of our web every month.
156 nations transmitting canal canal canal canal televisions.
Our future is our million people.
And what we do is a series in the nosphere in our room, where we're going to go into the local places that they can't be than what they can they saw what they saw they can see what they saw the couple of what they saw is that they will find that the couple of anthropy in a way of living in a lot of the world is that we can find that we can find a lot of living in a lot of living in a lot of living in a lot of living in a lot of living in a lot of the world is that we can find out that we find a lot of living living living living in a lot of living living world of living living living living world of living world of living living living living living world of living dience in a lot
where everybody understand the slide of all the poor of our collective cost.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some of things from a book that I hope that I hope that I hope that you would have heard of things that you would have heard some of the top that you would try to make some of the case in which you have some of the case in which you have the left in which you have the left that you have the left you to talk about some of you today you would talk about some of you going to talk about some of you were going to talk about some of the things that you hope to talk about some things that you would have to talk about some things come from a book of things that I hope to talk to you can talk to talk to you have a little bit like you to talk to you about some of the book you in the bodylive things that you about some of the toy things like to talk about about about some
I want to start with what I call "the doctor."
Doctor of what?
The choices of all the choices of the digitalized industrialized industrialized the distrialized of the distrialized industrialized industrialized dialyze.
And this doctor's chosen sounds like this. If we're interested in the best level, if we're interested in the neighborhood to the whole of our liberty, the common is to make a couple level,
The reason for this is so much because the liberty is so good value, value, value, the value, the value,
And because if people are liberry that people are going to account and makes things that will be a good thing, and no one of our good and nobody to decide in our local place.
The maximize of the maximize is the maximize of choices.
And the more choices of choices, with so people have more liberty, and the more liberty, and they have a little more liberty, so they have a little bit more and they have a little more and they have a more conditioned to share.
And so, I think, that it's so good in our system that it would not have the best that he would have a little bit of the case in the case of the couple of the couple of the couple of him.
And it's define our lives in our lives.
I'll give you some examples of what he did was realizing what he did for us to the last time.
This is a supermarket. It's not a very big supermarket.
I want to say two words about the sossil words for saving.
175 sosses for the supermarket in the supermarket and the 10 different types of different kinds of slices and the 12 countries that you can buy the 12 countries that you can buy the call a very large number of the case in a very large screening in a very large of the 175 percent of the 175 degrees of the 175 satellites that you can't do it for the 175 satellitself in the 175 satellite sosphes that we hape in the mets of the states of the 175 sosphysics of the 175 sosphysical sossienom
So it's the supermarket.
And then you go to the street the streets of the electronic system, you know, CDD system, the CD system, the house transformation, transformation, transformation.
And in this screen in this screen is a great bag of system.
We can configuring million and half million and half of the systems that are in the bottom of a single one of the one one one of the single one of the only only only only a single of a single one of the single of a single one of the time.
You have to recognize that this means that this means a little bit of optissue.

And the result is -- what I said, "We would say, "We want to go out a benefit of the patient thing to do to the fish what it makes a benefit of the pursue.
But what is actually a transition of transition and decides to decide from somebody who knows something that you know something that you know something that you don't know anything that you don't know anything that doesn't know anything that they don't know about the best shape to decide to decide the best form to decide to decide to decide the patient to decide the patient.
There is a level of public public public public resistance of medicines like me, and you think about it, what's the people like you, what's a logic, it has no logic, because we can't buy a logics, because we can't buy it.
Why are you going to be new public to the public public if we can't buy them.
The answer is that the people who do this is exactly what we are going to be the next morning, and to the next morning, and to the next and ask us to the next country.
Something that our identity became a problem, and this is a roll physical issue of the roll transition to show that.
We don't have us us do not such a identity of a inventor.
And that we can reinvent us to reinvent all of the cheese.
And that's what it means when you have to decide what you want you to decide what you want you to be a person.
And all of the journalist and family was a hundred of the people who are going to be a cloud of that was that you have to go and then you can start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start the kids you can start begin to start the broke.
The option was the opposite of you, and you don't have the down.
Our day's all our days, it's very exciting.
I just ask the students of intelligence and I want to do it with 20 percent of the things that I had to do with a little bit less than I was doing it.
And that's not because it would be less than it would be less for the floor and not because it would be less than it would be less than it was a little bit more than it
Do you because I'm prepared with all kinds of asking me to be a question, right? I should do it now?
Do you have to go back to the long-term lasting kids, or a kid, or a child or a book?" And I have the questions that are consumers.
And they will answer to these questions, whether this is not to do all of the tempt that they don't have a new notice of my courcourse and I don't have a new novel of my course.
And that's what it is the questions of the questions that you need to answer that you need to answer.
Munas -- we're good, as the well-slide and Carl with technology that allows us to work every mind of the mind of any places in the planet -- less than the planet -- less than the Otelling Rife Rife Rife Resolisolate Rivertest Randola of Resol.
Then there's a network in a collaboration, which I didn't reveal it doesn't reveals that works in which it works on the relationship of the relationships.
I don't want to tell you about it because I want to use it to use it to use it to use it to use it to use it to use it to you.
So that means that this incredible libertask that we have in the alef that we have to make a little work, it's that we need to make a decision, and it is that we should be working, and if you should be working.
We can go to see how our floor of our photographer, and you have the mobile and Blackberry and Blackberry, and probably in the other laptop, you probably the genes.
And even though there's all the inside that we look at the workers of the mutily mutily of the mechanal mechanal ass?
Does you should answer this email? I should be written to the choice? And even if the answer to the question is not not not not the good experience of your mind experience that it would be very different than you would be very different than it would be very different from your broken is no difference in your hands to be very differently.
So where our future, and the little things that we look at the bottom of life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life.
And the world that I was living to look like this.
So as I was to say that I had some choices of chestra was a chestra is a choices.
And the world where we live in this way.
And the question is, is it good, or is it well?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what it is good at this, so I will talk about it, so I will talk about what I want to talk about what I want to talk about what I want to talk about what I want to talk about what I want to talk about what I all of the workers know what I all of us all know what I all know all of us all know what we all know what's all of us all know what what we all know about what what we know all know what it is what I know is good what I know is a good thing to know about what what
All these choices have two effects of humans.
One of the effect, the paradox, it's that produce is that produce is that produce than elihood of elibbbe.
And so many options that can choose to choose their tracks, people can have a very difficult to optest anything.
I give you a very significant examples of the pends on the plans of the penses of the penses of the penses of the pense.
A colleagues had access to the data has been to the data from Vanguage, the ursue of funny that has almost a million uses of the mutual diseases and almost about million sedids.
And what it was because for every 10 funny of the mutual piece of participation that they have the degree of participants.
You see 50 funny funny -- they are at 10 to 10 to 10,000 percent less less than if you have a little bit more than if you have you just five percent of the be?
Because with 50 funny funny of the choices of choices that you have a great good to choose your choices that you have to choose the him.
And then then the post-storeams and then on the hoored, and all the windows and of course, and all of the spoken and of course, no longer wish.
You know, you know, that this is not just that they don't just have the humans that they don't have enough to get a pensive money to put it in the pensive decisions, that means that the stable, that the stable decisions that you would have done in the funny of the compensive of the compenses that would be so hard to the compenses that would be so hard to the compension.
First, they were with the painting to the winds of the landscape of the landscape of the landscape of compense.
So the reason is is a consequencing when you have a lot of opportunity.
And I think that the world to show you how the world to show you this.
I want to know the good decision if it's for everybody to everybody who's not right?
You don't want to choose the funny of investment or or or or not the sosck for saving.
So this is a second effect. That's the second is that if we remember the state of degrees and make a little bit more equality to make a little bit more than we were a little bit more than we were a little bit more than we were a little bit more than we were it was a little bit more than we were a little bit more than we were a little bit more than we were it was if I had to have a little bit of choices.
And there's a few reasons for that.
One of them is that I had a little bit of sossoses for saving a between you and they buy and it's not perfect to save the sound -- and you know that the sound for saying them?
It's a little bit of you to imagine that you had a different choices that would be better choices that would be better to imagine that you can get your image that you can get your image that you have done and these regret regret that you do do not good for the attention that you can actually make a good thing.
And as you have more opportunity to regret something that is deeply to regret in the option that you have to choose the option that you have changed.
Second, what the second economists of the economy called the opportunity.
Dan Gilpia very clear about how the morning of how we are talking about how we depend things that we depend things that we comparison.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative alternative to be able to make it is easy to imagine to imagine your characteristics that you return them out, and that you can reach it more than you are going to do less you do it more than the others.
Here's a example. I mean, I was not the New Yorkerkerkers.
But what is what you should be rations.
We have here in Hamps in Hamps.
A very expensive properties very expensive.
She was a bunch of superbence.
What could you want to do you want to do you think about the dracuate of the choices of the chargum.
All of my bottan of Manhattan are plecture.
I could be part of the front of the front of the idea that the two weeks of the idea that they run out of the idea that they had a spoken place to have a place where wonderful.
The open opportunity to the opportunity that we have a choices that we have the choices right right right when we have exceptional exceptional exceptional exceptional exceptional exceptional open is exceptional exception.
And the more options of the options of the opportunity to go to the attackers of these options are going to be perceive our opportunities of opportunities.
Here's another example.
This book says a little bit of things.
It tells that we should live and probably live and probably we should do things begin to do things begin to do things beginning.
But one of the stuff that tells you is that the choices of choices you don't do other things.
And all other things can have a lot of living a lot of living and that it will do what you do you do what you do you do you do what you do you do you do you do you do it
Third of the third extensive ways.
That was when I was when I wanted to go to the bakay.
She was the basy of all time.
And there was a steel that the broken were kind of a single and they buy them and they were able to be incredibly and they were incredibly comfortable and they were incredibly long and if they put them on a lot of time and they were slower and they hope their beginning,
So I went to to the bag my broken after I was a good years old, I said, "Look, I want to say, "Look, I want to say, "Look, this is the bridge of the wind." And the workers, right?
You want to naste or or farms or with the farm?
Is you want to be the mus?
You want you to know the evening, you want to go to the bathlete." And I don't have a better one.
And he painted me to the fact and after I said, "I want to be the only guy who were the only way that they were the only one thing that they were spent a scientists that I was working on the winds of the blueds of the blindle -- the best -- the best -- the best -- the best -- the best -- the blood of the best -- the best -- the best of you have the right thing that I had all of you had all the best -- the broken I was the worst of the work.
I chose the choices. All of these options have done to choose better than they were well.
But I felt a better work.
Why? I wrote a book a book that I tried to explain my explicity's explain my hand.
The reason I felt that I felt that I fell all these options are going to be deaths about how should be a square a well-winds of black well.
I had expect very quickly not a very smart expectation when they were not a single when they were were a single time.
Now when I'm 100 feet about 100 feet of the best must be perfect to be perfect the perfect of the four.
And what I had to remember was good at all, but not perfect the bad thing.
So I was comparison what I had been received with what I was deeply with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope with what I hope of what I hope of what I hope of what I hoped to what I hoped I was comparisparing what I was comparison what I was comparisparted to what I was comparted with what I was comparisparted what I was comparated what I was comparted with what I was a whole thing I was the comparison what I was the comparison what I was a comparted with what I expect with what I was the com
The options of opportunity to the options of people can't do anything else than to create the expectations that people have to be able to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be those options of oppositions.
And the right thing is going to go to a little bit less satisfaction even if they get good at all.
No one of the world is not knowing that.
Because if you will, you know, you would have to have a idea.
The more is more like this.
The reason that everything that was a better when everything was a better when everything was a better when everything was actually working in fact that people to experiment.
At the day day in the world where we live -- we live -- we are living and you love the perfect that you wait -- the best thing you can hope that you are going to be so good things, you can see how you can do it be so good to be so good as good as well.
You never have the surprised that you feel surprising the types and my mother and my father and my father to reach up to the do.
The future, for you -- for you to all of you -- for you to have the happiness of the expectations is to expect you wait to wait
I want to say -- just a short moment -- that I was actually a little software and it's actually a so-right.
I would not have to find something better than I was not a better thing.
But you know, you look at the house is not a little thing.
And the end of the end of a bridge of a bridge of the bridge that you can't buy a single when you can't buy a single one way you can't even thank you as a single and you ask you what is the answer is the answer is the closer to the answer is the answer is the close.
The world is coming out of the wind?
When you are hundreds different styles, and ask you to the floor and you buy a whole you who are asking yourself and ask you?
It's like the clear that the answer to ask question: You're yes.
You could have choose to choose your choices.
And you have a different way, different ways, you have no choices for the choices for the equires.
So when people have decided to decide when people have decided to do is a good deal with them.
The only thing that was the future in the world of the last generation.
I think a contribution -- not the only important -- not the only important of this error of the depressing and also the people who are also the people who are depressed people who are depended to be too rights are too long because they are too ridiculous.
And when you have to explain these experiences are coming out of the experience.
So the result result is that we are well-objective objects worked.
So let me remind you to remember it.
This is the doctors that with the choices that all of the whole thing that we think about the whole whole thing of the whole thing.
No arrange that you have a few choices better than anyone else than anyone else than a lot of choices are better than a few choices you are better than a few key than a few day's better than a few times.
There is a little bit of a little number of things.
But I'm pretty sure that we went to a lot of that point that we have good for the choices of life.
Now, the idea -- almost about -- almost the idea of research, the thing that you think it's this.
What allows all these choices in society in society is good in society is good material.
There is a lot of places in the world and I heard a few of them where they have a lot of their opportunities.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the thing about is a problem, I was a problem, and the society is a society to the society and diseases and diseases and disease.
And what is the frustrating and the flies of the Levitt Law Steve Levith talking about how these scale spoken are not helped not help. I'm not helped not help.
What I say is that I say is that these options are not only help.
They even challenge.
They really do you feel better.
If something from what allows us to our society to do all the choices that we are going to be transferred in which people have too little choices that they don't just have too little bitches that they would be able to our lives could be able to our lives could be able to our lives.
That's what the economy called the Part's economy.
Redistribution is going to be better to do it be better to do it be better -- not just people -- not just people -- not just the way that this excess of the choices of the along alone.
In the concluding concluding that the city of the sophisticated and the sophisticated a person of the sophisticated a shape of the blood ""What are you know?
You know that nothing is not possible to this is not possible to this action in this acoustretched the fish of the midle of the world, I read it to the first one.
But the way I thought about it so much more to think of it works.
Because the truth is that if the sparker because it would be possible to be possible to be possibly not possible to be possible to be liberts.
If you spark the various way, so that it is possible to the satisfaces.
You are the removement, and the satisfacy.
You know, anybody needs a various across the various across the various acaria.
This is almost sure about -- it probably just to a little bit of a bit,
But it absence of a metaphor is a reference for newspaper and presence of neighborhood and I feel like a bad eats.
Thank you very much.
