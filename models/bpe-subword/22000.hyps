And the next year I argued these two demonstrate to demonstrate the farmers that the most of the most of the last three million years of years of been dimension, the last 48 million years of statement -- the small state of the four percent of the large of the mice.
But this morning, this is the serious problems because of this is the big, because it doesn't look at the books.
Calot is in a police is that the heart of the climate system.
She was expected and they contract.
The second diaffects that I'm going to show you a faster will be a faster in the last 25 years ago.
Ghe's paper is the large is the large is the large of the Earth.
And as you see the bastrous stick of the bastrous inched.
This is the airplane on the year.
And they wallowed us to walk away.
Ashape the blood permanent of a five years or more than five years or more than a sample or more than a body's body.
In 25 years of self to this in this way.
This is a problem because the challenge of the challenge of the oceans.
where it's gashes a massive massive carbon that is a little bath, when it turns out in metan micro-car.
Comparatively with the pollution of the global incomputer in the atmosphere if we could take this point if we could take this point.
To in a certain in the adances of Alaska metantic metapholes of disease is to sustainable water.
The Katter Katter Walter from Alaska was on the University of Alaska a network to another land a network.
Here Gore: Oh, Ena Gore: Ena is the question is we will be him.
And a reason is that the """the cy" is Groenlandscapes in the north.
This is a rich rate that all of the year.
But the volumes are much larger than no one to be a lot of it.
This is the ratorluss-story of Groenland.
If you want to know how the large of the large of the large of blood farmers on the mass of the massive in the mass.
These debate very quickly.
And the other capital planes, Antarctica massive mass on the planet.
The past people state people have stories have been faster as the continent of the continent is the negatic of the Antarctical story of the insultaneously insulls of insults.
This is the choice with the six meters of the large of Groenland.
In Himalya, making the third of the third of the third of the new new form of new form of new form that we were barras.

In Anness, this is the source is the water for this city to this for this city to this to.
The bites have created it.
But when he did, it turns out and water and water with water.
In California was a 40 percent of the four in the street in Sierra.
This suffering is the reserves.
And the predictables, so you read the blood of the blood of it.
On the global world has been to a state of the incentives of the incentive.
And the death of water all the global world, they were extraordinary to a price and the farmer.
Ffour times more in the last 30 years of the 75 years of the 75 years.
This is a very absolutely model.
If you look at the context of the context of the historical context.
In the last five years I added 70 million tones of tonight to every 24 hours of the oceans on every day in the oceans.
The airplane to the attention of the Pacific, and the American housing of America, and every part of the subjects where the subjects of the oceans.
The biggest thing that the only only one of the global income, the balances of the fuels of the fuels of the fuels of fuels.
The photograph is a problem and the books.
The United States is one of the two of the cartoons, whattemps of China.
And the proposal was building more fabricated to the books.
But we start to see a change change is a change.
Here are the people who have anulated in the last year, with the alternative propatients.
All there there is a painting-home politics.
And the industry and the carbonight and the cost of billion dollars in the last billion dollars in the last few dollars in the last year of the future.
The carbon what is a game is a cooximizard.
This image of the image of something like this.
In the teacher Cracium in Tennessed, a billion galood of galood of galogyms were imprise.
You probably have to be seen to the stird.
This is the first is the second thing of the second SAmerica in America Sintamed Cracia.
One of the clamps of the carbon the days, which I was this room, it was this.
Video: Shomo: â™« Mom, it's a bad barrasses.
He's in abunder in America, here in America, and help the economic growth of economic growth.
Frost, the home, the books, it becomes more quickly.
He is access and adorably and workers and workers of shares the jobs.
Al Gore: This is the best of the best of Virginia.
The biggest on the largest per of Massy Codoy Cosiy Cosion.
Video: DonBlankend: I want to be clary. I want to be Pelosope, Harry Reid Reidoud Reid Reight Reidite.
Al Gore: Astore: Alian's Climate Cland,
This is one of them is one of them on it.
Video: The COOLergy COOLergy of our archasing as a very serious for our business to do our business for our business to do it.
That's why our principle mass is to spend a big large of money to the public speed of public spots that we really have to show us and complicated the carbon and complicated the carbon of the carbon of the carbon of the car.
The is that the bad is that the carbes is not die.
We think that is the current -- and move and move and game.
So it doesn't get to the climate for change.
Latass that in our realization.
Video: Carb: Carbits, you know, you heard about it.
So we do to do a teacher to this paint of this paper installation of the game.
Hamazing. Masinart is the case is the croom.
But this is the sound of the technology.
And as the carbon is one of the case of the incomputer is the global world of the global technology of the networks that you see here is the news.
Somebody with attentions, this is the technology of today.
Al Gore: In the sfarmed alternative positive with the challenge of the economic problems.
Video: Narrator: Nator: the economia, economists of nationality of nationality.
The machines that are the best of all of us on all the fuels of carbon on the book: carbon bone: the carbon stretch.
But now we have a new solution to the new new solution to the history of includes.
Right? Right? One of the East 100 years ago.
A blood to the home of America, and then it makes us more sure and help us to the stopping of global income.
In the sently, a solution that is the way to help us to help us to solve our problems.
Right? You know, America. You know, I was more than the America.
Al Gore: This is the last last year.
Video: Narrator: Is the re-energy.
One of the faster way to including the faster faster fuels of fuels that kinds of the Barbed here is the future, the fashion: The soft, the software the energy of the energy of the reposposition.
Barbed nr.2: We can do the best to create job.
Narrator: Right? It's time for active.
Al Gore: There is a futuhi a finger that you would say, "If you want to go to the bridge, you go to the bridge,
If you want to get the part, you know, you walk!
We need to get the part, faster fast.
Thank you very much.
And the next year I did a walking to LHC.
And I remember to see a little bit of a data on how it works about how it works to the water.
So the size of the massive. And for the people who have been here, LHC is the largest experiments that was the intense -- Ciririrbymistakilometers -- Cirirbympic or is the recreating a farmers of a billion dollars -- a fashion for a billion dollars -- the per of a second to a second to a second to a seconds.
It's extremely ambitious.
This is the water of Geneva.
We do photographs "Big Bangs" in the interior in the decades.
I work on this to this is the detector is the ATLASS -- Lunger ATLa's four training four typhotography here is the spectacular to build the ATLSATLALSATLALSATALSATALSATALSATALSATALSATALSATLSA to look at the DLATLASA four of the ATLALAS.
On the 10square the year I went to the first data.
And this image was down.
She asks a huge cycle chair room.
It's a massive image of the first particular particularly that the process of the system of LHC, the city of LHC, the car LHC, the whole in LHCC, the arms of LHC,
In other words, when I was a couple of seven that image that this image as a little bit of working as a success of the success.
I don't know that if he had the first first of all, or that, or that, or that, or that, when someone walked and he walked and he seemed as the first page.
It means I did a culture of culture on the street of the stintension.
After about a sapping a saptamed with a problem, which was a lot of these farming -- these farms -- these fires -- these field -- these field -- these are these far.
They have a 13 thousands of thousands of cars when the machines that are maximate power to power power of maximum in the power of maximize power of maximimate the power of maximate the sportly machines of the sportled of the sport-silence of machines of the sports.
Now, the engineers in the sharing and says, "I can't transport attack."
But I can do that for that when they are going to be the temperatures of what happens to the superperature.
And so the 271 degrees of the future, they can find the space, they can transport the horror so they can transport the work.
At one of the cost of the country of the 9,000 of the LHC, it was a fabricative.
And so the common was a little bit of the 13 thousands of American electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressing is that the main those 20 tons, and they have a 30 degrees over 20 tons, and they have a 30 degrees.
So I determined by 50 determined about 50 magnetic five red.
We had to do it with him, what we do and down.
I reconditioned on today, I reparated.
And now we go to the street in the subteran.
The land to the slide of the LHC will be as a new late of LHC will be as a new way.
We will go back to the beyond we have to get to hold data or hundred or history, and we will continue to be research to the universe that are the universe.
Now, of course, as a way of incidential recognize of recognize and engineering and engineering to reject.
I think the data, I think that is attack-drifted data is the fact that we have a little experiments like LHCLHCLHCLHCLHCLHCLHCLHCHCHCHCHCHCHC.
I'm going to be the fishing of a stream, and Humping British Davy, Humphone, I think that the internal experiments are the protect of the protection, "Nothing that I said, "Nothing is not more dark: "Nothing is the farms are not going to be the farms of the minister is that we have the pursue of our minister is not the best of our ministers."
Thank you.
I mean, I would start with the roughly remember to the kids of kids when you play with the bottom of the body.
On the massive what you get to the challenge, and you get them to the springs and they are actually attack-up and solar issue of the issue of the issues of the space, and the brain and manipulate the space.
The space is the space, the space, the providing of how we understand a lot of the world of the inconcerns.
So if we can see the projects of the ITrility interaction with our interactions with our objects -- impressed with my consultant, and collaborator the collaborator -- I started to start -- I started to start to start -- I started to start with a computer -- we could do a computer, we can use a computer to a computer with a computer of a machines that we can find a common with a machine, and we can be a massive of the making,
Do we want to be new new about new new new new about us.
The question was the question of fascinating beyond I decided to research the Siftable.
On the story of the Sift-for-interaction of a bissue of a bished.
They can be manufacturing the recireceive the recirecipal of the city of one another, and they have a network.
The most important is that there are palpable to be the palphases like the game, you can just sit as it as it just as well.
And Siftabove for a new example of a new instruments of manipulation of digital information of digital information.
On the massive of these instruments becomes more constants of their miscing access of the city of our networks of our active active actions of our active and content of our actions and distractive and distractive and distractive and distractive.
I'm going to start with a few examples.
This Sift--Sift-presented video game, if you including the video directly. If you get the fishery, if you including the parts of the park of the parts of the parks.
These paintings are constantly constants one of the other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other other people.
So, if you put them on the other side of the other interested in the interest.
If they're confushed and that, and I can become confusion.
You can feel like the miscing and including and including and inclue.
We realized that one of the interesting of the interactive interactive interactive is that we can use the data is that we can use the data, as we could culture the culture of how we have culture as we culture as we culture as we culture a license of a licen.
In the case, we have three Siftables configured as well as well as you can use their own paintings in the center of the center of the center of the center where they will die.
If I was too much too much like a lot of blood and the types.
There are also the possibility of the interesting of education, as the games, as the machines, and the machines of the possibility of the possibility of the results of the results of the results.
So here I -- this is a fit-Fibonacy that I have a simple programs.
Here we have a game games of combined as a combination of Scrabbed and Bogging and Bogger.
Onactically, every single state a literally led on every Siftable, and on the measure of the fishery, they are verified with a dictionary.
And then you get 30 seconds of seconds of seconds of the Two new types and we possibly have a characters.
Thank you.
These are the nonists who came to the Media, and I had to convince the Media, and I had to get them to the film of them to the film of the material and the film of the material material.
They love to live in the negoties.
And one of the interesting of this kind of interesting is that kind of apply is that you don't have to give people a lot of instructive instructions.
All right, "For is "For the Scotle, and they know what to do.
Here are some of other people who are going to get their cancer.
This is the most tanished our ster right.
It turns out that all of the way he wanted to do it was to put it on the other side of the other one of other one of other one of other on other things.
So he was just the body's bars.
This is a apply apply of animating.
We wanted to build a beautiful language.
And this is Felix.
He can get new personal arms of the stage of the Siftables that Siftables that the Siftables that are person.
Here is the so-so-so-hands.
Veroice: You know, the race.
David Merrill: Now this is a traction: this is a traction,
Veroice: Trace.
Good well! Yeah!
Misettable, and Siftypes and ask them can be personally to interaction, you can do personal interaction: Ham!
DM: I think of the narrative.
Video: Bunk!
DM: It's a story of open story of how it will be drawing to slightly open.
Video: You're pish!
DM: The next example I have shown me is a little bag is a beautiful and interpretated and interpretated the music and the interpretty much as the Siftables that we built the roll, and in the rolling and and the roll.
Each of these four various various various various choices that you want to use it.
And you can injects are in a success that you can ask the way you can ask you to the guy.
You get the sound sound sound Siftable-Siftable-slide same.
There is the effective effects that you can be reverse and movie.
Have a little bit of a certain and then you get to the awareness.
It has been able to be the general effects like the tempt and volume of the second stories of the second stories of the second stories of sequences.
Video: DM: DM: May Siftables of the Siftables have success, we have inside of a series, we have a series, a farming hospital.
Now a little bit of the network.
Video: You're now a little bit of perceiving perceived time.
Video: Yeah, I will bring the film to all the way to control the effect of the effect of the effect of the light.
Video: You're the second page, the second secsecsecsecond-incline, or in a part or in a part or in a part or in a part or in a part or in a part or in a part of the Veroices.
Video: Yeah, I'm going to attack for more expression.
Video: You're going to read the second time as a second time as a sand.
So I don't have to do the plan, I can improvise, I can improvise, pursuing or melodia window.
Now, in the sfars; I can find the second second the second Sift-drift of the volume, including in the statement of volume volume in the statement.
Thank you.
As my passion is my brain is creating our brain is creating new interface, which is the way that the brain that works is working with our brains.
And today, I had a time to show you a school, and that is the design of design, and a few of the possibility of the possibilities that we have to put them from the laborators.
The Ganda that I was in the shape of the new is that we are generates of instruments of interactive interactive in the middle of the mountainment of our world that will advertising the world of our research on our research on our research on our rules of our rules of our rules of our rule that they would be adults.
Thank you very much.
I met with your nervous nerability to be the discussion.
They're writing.
He wrote a books, but I mean, but it is more than that.
It's all my mom and the mom and fascinating.
And I don't think this is that this is what it is.
But these physics said, something like the blood and the bookay, and in the book, and the carium of my father and my father and the intrenment of the work.
And the thing that I wrote is that I wrote this book, this car, "Manca, Roography Roots, Roottype, which is the bridge, the horrible of the world for a little bit of the world for a little bit of the world for a sensitive that the reasons.
The bulbly is as I go back to the home, people who wouldn't be condam.
Serids -- condamnature, condam.
With the example of the purpose and you say, "You're not going to be the team, you can't be more deposit?
Did you is not you go to write as you wrote the mountained of the best time to have a books that you want to have a book?"
It's very lints, in fact, in fact,
But it would be more racle, if I don't mean 20 years, when I was about 20 years, when I was a big statement when I was a little people -- I was a writing -- I was writing -- I was written in a writer on the same way as a frick of the same way as a frick.
And people said, "Do you don't have any of you have never had no longer success?"
Do you don't like the birds of kinds of kind?
Did you is not the front of the best thing to do in this gentlemen, and not to deadly not to deadly not to deadly the dream of dreams of the case of the car purpose of the car on the center of the middle of the mirrror of the American a's move?"
Something about this.
The slide -- the race, the rack of the questions is "Yeah."
Yeah, you know, it's the teams of all of these things.
And so he always told me my photo.
And you know, it's the teams of the things that people people who don't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get them to be able to get them to be able to be able to get them.
As the example of the large of the large things that are infrastructure.
But when it's talking about written about written and I thought about the last time I was ""Why?"
Is this something ration?
It's the love as anyone to be thrown to be the working that they were able to do it as a mountained that they were pretty much to do this on this Pamant.
And what is the specific initiatively creative initiatively that seems us is really about the proper of the proper of the teanators of the teacher?
My father example, for example, and it wasn't immediately remember the 40 years of you have the inery of engineering of engineering is not a chemisperal is not a scientist.
It wasn't happened -- John, how do they go to the block of the engineer?
It is simply not intampled to something like this.
But to be the meanings, the engineers of the chemistry didn't have too much of the century of the century of the century of the opens of the open-depression.
We writers are writers that we have this relief and not only writers, but the artists of all of the way of be powerful as well.
And all of us do is to look at the bottom of the dead of deaths of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the brain and the open-creative process and the open.
And even the same same same same same same same thing that didn't have to be true, and they really have to be the own stories.
Norman Mail, even before the last men in the last book, he said, "Each of my cartoon."
A largest largest journey of a mountained vibrature.
But a whole thing we don't have a little bit when I hear that I heard this is so many times so many times and so we can have heard of the idea of creative, and it is completely and until and suffering the idea of creativity and the suffering of the main the map, it will be conduct as a massive of the mast, it will be the infinite of the main the ends.
And the question I want to bring it today today today is here today here is you know, you are with this ideas with this ideas with this ideas with this ideas with this ideas with this ideas with this ideas with this ideas of ideas with this ideas of ideas that you have the questions that you want to be the questions that I want to ask the question that I want to do it with this idea that I want to do today to be able to do today.
You are comfortable comfortable -- for the eye of the eye, as you don't have the story -- I don't have the history of this pain.
I think it's odiodias.
And also I think it's dangerous and not I don't want to see the future.
I think it's better if you get the best of artists of artists to travel to live
And I know the sure of that I know my home, in my home, in my homework for me to me to me to me to me to me the bottom of this data in the infrastructure, in the special data, in particularly the teaching teaching that I know the teacher that I know the teach.
As a farmer, I'm just pretty much about 40 years.
I have probably probably as four decades working for the mountains.
And it's very probably the thing I wrote with this moment to be judged by the way, the line of my father successful chair of the last network?
What would be saying to say the machines of the best way here is the best of friends here is really probably the largest success of my largest success.
Oh, Does Does --
This is the gender gender that could be able to do someone to the nice to the nine in the city of the morning, and I don't want to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person
I mean, to do this messages that I love this message.
And then the question, the question: "bity?
And so I think that I mean, a lot of my mind-myself that I have to work now, is to write a kind of building a psychological way of building a psychological way that we build a cock?
Okay, you know, I have a way to find a way to the farmers of my mine, and my father and my team, and the team, and the team, and the teams that will be able to what it would be able to do is now what he written to what he written to what write.
And as I was all the way I was in this sense of this sense of the time I started to get the time, and I ended up to the other society if you could have a better ideas and we could have have more and slightly the idea of how to be more and slightly the risk of how people creative.
And this is this type of Greection and Romantic Roman and Romantic Roman
So the massive cycle, the couple of the chide.
But in the Grerecently and Romantic Romantic Romano people who don't have as a creativity of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interior of the interior of the inside.
People have thought that creativity was a spirit of people who can be able to do people from a surprising of people from a sure of the reasons and needs and needs and needs and needs and needs and needs and needs and needs and needs to be able to be able to be able to be the people who have the people who have the people thought of people were a lot of people who have the creativity of people who have the creatiativity of people who have the creatiativity of people who have the creatiatiatiatiativity was a
Greats called these spirit of creativity of creativity with the terms of the terms "demonity."
Socracy was the front of a demon that has transmitted as a slidepartment.
They were the same psychologist, but they call the spirit of creative, but they have the genius of the genius of the genius.
What is the mind-the-mined romans, because they were in fact, as a genius was a pretty much as a little bit of fish.
I think of a genius was a kind of a massive process of the dives, which is a kind of artist, the incident, the insects of the house of the house of the city of the movement of the movement of the work, the slide of my movement of the works.
Absolutely balloon -- this is the fantastic that we were talking about the results that we can protect the results of the work.
And everyone is the world as a little bit of the work?
So the artist years, the protected of things, as a lot of things, as a narrism, we do it for the code?
If you were the stretched the street, you cannot get the world for me, all the world as you can all this genius as a training of that living in the training that that help.
If you were criticized the criticize was completely wrong as it wasn't it?
Everybody in the world as I was the kind of like the ignorant.
And they have watched people from the Very creativity for a long time.
And then came back and all of the Renast, and it has changed with a big idea of the idea of the idea of the universe as individual mind of the universe, the universe and mysteries and mistakes, and the misticic stories that they were the first to create the history that they were the first to create the dival dives.
It was the beginning of human rational rational and people have began to creativity as the interior of the interior of the individual interior of the individual interial of the individual interior of the individual beginning.
And for the first story of history, the history of the artists of artists as a genius to have a genius to have a genius.
And you need to be a big charise, I think it was a huge of massive me.
Permitmita simple person to create a simple person is actually receptor is actually the speed and the intense and the intense of mystery and the intense of the misternal responsible is a little bit of the inner of the inner of the inside.
It's like you to get the couple of hith to the so-hite.
It just just just the incovered and deform and genders are able to make these today, and genetic inimagination of the inimagination of the inimagination of the inimagination of the inside.
I think that the president has been artists one of the last 500 years of years.
And if I think is really true, and I think that is what we do is that we do now?
Can we do things different?
Maybe we go to the sensitive of the relative of the people of the brain and the mystery of the brain.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can just stand we can just stering 500 years of thinking about 500 years of a minutes.
And it probably as the public of the public that would be the questions of the questions of stories of stick on the street of the people who are in the projects of their own ideas and they survive their own idea.
It would be able to cooping it to all the idea of that idea.
But the question I want to put it is -- why is it -- why is it not?
Why don't we think about this in the way?
Because it has sensitive as something else like anything else about what the case of the prisoning of the creative process of creatively inner process of creative.
The process that anybody has to create something -- you know, all the way here -- you know, all the way here -- you know, it's always of behavior.
And in fact, sometimes can put the right of the paranormal.
I had a paint where I met a story where I met the poet Ruth Stone, which is now in the journey of 90 years and that has been storing to the story and that was the story, and that story and that story to the Ston's story, and he was a story and he was a little story, and he was a poor a story and to be a story, and he was a poppainting on and heart a step on the story.
The story was like a various various various to the air air.
And they get the street on the rooms.
And the feeling of the square the paper pamants to the painting.
In that moment that moment is a single thing that is read and that is read like the water and you read the water.
And the alerging as the house of the house of poem, and the idea of the idea of the idea of the map of the map of the maps of the map of the faster and a little bit of slightly to the past and I get to get the past and swallows to get the painting.
Sometimes was enough to be enough as the alerging and alerging and alergy, but not the couple of house and the house and the poemissions and the poemissions and the houses, and the story of the room, I read the "another camphoto.
They were and moment in which -- and the moment I would never forget to the story that story as the story of lost as a lost of lost as lost as a lost of lost as a lost of the bar.
Alerga house of himself, and the next thing and the case and the case of the exactly when the story of the story of the story of the other story and the story of the other story and the story and the story and the surface.
The first of the coast, and the purpose and the source of the massive that we can find what the maps of the map.
At situations, the map, the map of the map of the map of the first time, but the first of the first first to the first of the first first of the first of the first time at the first of all.
When I heard -- it's the sustainability to be exactly how they work.
My creatively creatively not to this -- I'm not conduct!
And I'm a kind of such a way that I worked on every day to the same way to the same way and to translate and to translate and slide and slightly and I stop and I stop with all of the street.
But even though I was in my innatures, even I was so far as a fence of that fence of that fen.
And I just just like this as you were and many of you were and many of you were in it.
I had the projects or ideas that had been designed from the hour surface that they didn't know that it doesn't know to hold the history.
And what you have to do you always that?
And how do you get to require us to do it in the mints, so we don't lost our minds, you know, we hear our minds to help our sanatt?
For me, the most relevant of our days, which I have about how we can do is the musicians, we all have the Waits, we took a few years in in the revibrate of the revibration.
I was about the subig, and the right thing about the artist of artist artist artist the artist of the contemporary contemporary of the connection of the inably connections of the inably connected to the internissues.
The time the time the language, and the story of the story of a day as a day on the Los Angeles and then all the way and then all of the Egeles and then all of the way and then all of the way it was changing it.
Why is the time I get a fragment, from a fragment, from a piece of a little eventually and amazing and away, and the inspired and a whole bunch and a whole bunch and a whole bunch and a whole blood is to be like to him.
It has no photography is not neighborhood, not report.
And the first of all, the deep of the anxiety of "Turkind-lost stories, and cancer, and cancer.
I'm not enough to be good enough to remove to re."
And instead of the pain, it just opened on the top.
She recognized the process and they do something with all of the new new new and all of the new new new it.
She was looking at the water and said, "Sorry and said, "Sorry, you don't see that there are not about the volcancany?"
"Do you see, you can write a canted?
If you want to do it in fact, you know, there are into, when you get more far more right when you get to the opened of you.
If you don't have and wrong and wrong and wrong with somebody else.
You're going to be a little bit of Leonard Cohen."
The state process creatively changed this.
It wasn't the cookay, the cookay, the intunately.
But the process of the aggame, and the past of the moment that has been shown in the moment that he had been told me in the genius and he said to him, and he had to get it to the whole thing that he was going to be able to be the beginning and him, and he realized and the Chinese and the Chinese and the Chinese property.
It could be this collaboration and bizarre and bizarre conversation of a conversation of a conversation that was so much like Tom.
After I heard the story of the story of the way I worked for a little bit of slam.
This approached me to the mid-scale "Manca, Roagain "Manca, Roagain and we have the kind of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of something that I haven't think about something that they don't have a very best to be a very screen.
Not just providing this is the best of the risk of the risk of the risk.
I mean, I was a little bit like I should reach to abandoned the project.
And then I remember the Earth's speaking and I read and I researched and I research.
I was a standing on the way to move and I brought me a collar collected collaborative camers.
I said with your voice -- "Ascultant, and I know that if I know that if you know that the books, is not just the narrass?
Because you can see you see that I put it all of the way I could hear the handling to hear it doesn't mean that I could have not wish.
So if you want to be better than you want to be will, you need to do the water and you get the parts of the book.
Okay. And if you don't do that, you know, you know, you know, you all all the time.
Something to write for this is message.
And I want to consequency for my park as my park on my park on my park.
Because -- the thing -- the Conclusion -- with hundred years ago, in the Northern Africa's houses of North African to sart and music in the flight and music to dancy hour, and music in the room.
And there were always to dances, because of the teachers were teaching and they were remarkable to rety?
But sometimes, very rules, something that is really something that is really one of the internal community.
They are convinced to all of the works, because all of you all see, because you all see, so you can all the interpretation of interpretty much interpretty much interpretation.
It's like the time and the time is the time and dancy is the way of knowledge, you don't do anything differently.
On a time it doesn't seem to be in the intug.
It's the world of the interior and light is the games of the divacure.
On the time, when they were intamples people who were and they said to humans who were on the name.
And I have the mammals and they were to stand they said, "Allam, Allam, Allam, Does Does Does.
It's God.
A funny historical -- when the mammakers have been invented with this object with this objects and the pronone." And the Earth."
and they hear as a paint of times and dances, and danks.
In Spain, when a interpret of recognized and magic machine, "Alle, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, the Gree."
Seee -- a farmed -- a farms.
It's mind-mined because we need to be needed to something like this.
But the park of the second of the heart of the heart of the insuspensuspes is and discovered that is the largest and not a slide and not a scale and not a scale and not a stream.
It's a muriter that the attack of the genetic genders and they could never have to be the intimating.
Could you be no one of the Dombs that called the Domna while he had to do with the rest of the life of the life of lifes?
It's hard.
It's one of the most sequences of doing in the vision of creative.
But maybe it would be a big chance of the best thing if you don't have the inceptor as the most extraordinary of the inceptor the most extraordinary inter.
Perhaps you have created as a little bit like that they were imprised by a surprising moment for a few times of the vision of the vision of the vision of the vision of the vision of the time that moment of the time they were will.
If we think about that? We all start to do it changes to change it.
I was asked to think about to think about the last long-term in the last months of the long thing that will be published to the bookay, a little bit of astonishing and infrastrous and infrastructure.
And what I do, I repeated when you get the current is not the farmer.
It doesn't be the speed and simply the Count of the Count of you would be part, you know, anyone would be honest, anyone would be
If you do it dances, then you dances, then it looks like this.
If the genius of the genius and except that you can get to such a decision, and for a little bit of standard to a clips through the equires of the streets, "Oley."
And if you don't have anything to do to hold it.
And with all of these "Oley."
I think of these things and I think we should be able to prepare to red.
"Ole! Okay! I just just for you to have a dragot for the homenework and innervous and incapital.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Just Cohen: Ole!
I have talked about some of these projects about some of these projects, and what could I representation of new genes.
Now in fact, in fact, in fact, we digitized biology, and now we try to start to this code from this code and we try to go into a new farming model, and the brain, and the brain and the shape.
We tried all the time, we try to ask our questions.
"What is the life I think that many biologists have tried to understand the diverse is the level of the levels.
I tried different approach, simply to component the component of components.
We already already about 20 years.
When I sevented the genomomically, this is the world of the world of biology of the world in the digital world in the digital world.
Now we try to ask to ask the question, or we can create new forms of life form in this universe of this universe of this universe of the universe of the universe versus of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe we try to try to ask myself to try to ask the question, we try to ask the question: We try to
This is the map of a mice, Mycoplasma genitals, which has the most most of the most of the most of the most replians.
We tried to see if we can see if we can come with a genomic genomics and smaller genomome.
We were able to suddenly the first of a hundred hundred of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map, it's pretty simply to our farmers with our comparison.
Right? This is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can get to a moment that we can get to a moment that to produce a cell.
So we decided that the only way we decided to be able to think about this cromoss-farmer, so that we can see the component to some of the most questions to some of the most questions.
And so I started on the room, "Can we can remember a cromoss?"
Maybe the chemical shapes of these molecules that we have never done one to the data?
And if yes, we can active.
A cromoss-cross-chemicals.
So, our gardeny to digitize to a ritize of life exponential.
Our lives wrong code to write code that I was slowly beginning to begin but it ground.
The last time he was a farmers of a exponential farmer.
I started this 15 years ago.
I went through a few teetaphortly with a broad, in fact, and a little experiment.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult is very difficult.
They're thousands of thousands of ADNA small ADN, months of DN, months to 50 degenerate 50 to 50 degenerative process to 50 degenerate a longer piece of months, so you can build a longer piece of the art.
So we had to create a new new new to create a new little bag and so they can get all the time.
This was our first tenth of tentlemen, beyond the digital information to the deep of Phi Phi Phi 174.
It's a little virus that myself that machines.
I made the blood of the piece of cocking, and I got a molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular disease.
The interesting came back when I took this piece of material material with the chemical material and I got to read this code and bacteria begin to read the genetic structure, and to produce the culture of the virus of the viruse.
The articulates were then in the viral cells and they have been standing and have kinds of Ecols.
I was going to be with the fish-industry and day-awareness model.
They have more than you walk than you do.
And so we think this is a situation where the software to build their own biological system.
But we wanted to do something more than we do something more than that.
We wanted to build the entire crowing the whole of a bacteria.
This is about 580,000 genetics code genetics.
So I said, "We were to put the types in the house of the virus to the virus to understand the country, in fact, the machines of a couple of a game of a violent of a game of violent cells.
The Gerging is critically, if you start with the information of the computers has to be very exactly that information has to be very exactly the information of the information.
When I sevented this kind of seven-driven genomic tang in 1995, a 10,000 windows in 10,000 wine.
I found in the rest resources of the rest of the original stories. If we were used to be able to be able to be able to be activated to be activated to be activated to be activated active.
The design is design is the projects of the long-term of 50 literally choose to all the other other other other countries to build the other other other countries that we have to design the projects of the other other other things that are a little bag with others.
We are projects.
You can read the read "I put "Swatermarket." Okay, we have a genetic code to this genetic code in four genetic code and T.
Triplef -- those characters -- those characters -- about 20 amino acify -- a single teemed teemed to be every argue ard of the art of the art of the amount of machine.
So we can use the genetic genetic code to write the word to write well.
Island, all I did it was to hear the code of the code of it.
Some of them were deaths that it's not the position.
We designed those those pieces so that we can dignature.
They're enzymes that they have to be honeybees.
So we started to do the blood farmers begin to 7,000 literally choose to do these type to make these type to make sense.
At every stealth these pieces of abundance to get these little purpose, we try to create a process of the extremely process -- as you can see a mine.
We try to get to get to that point that point of automatic automatic automatic automatic automatic point.
So, this looks like a team of a nice of a nice of networks.
When we get very largely large, over 100,000 windows in the bridges in East.
They are all the other biology of biology modern modern moders.
So we have the right of the mechanisms.
I know that there is a mechanism called the biologist, which biologist, which is going to refer the DNA to return to reach the piece of the DNA benefit of it.
This is a example.
There is a Geinocock Deinocock radiocockrococks.
As you see in the paper is the shadown, crossed is in the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the paper in the paper to the purpose in the paper as you can see in the paper in the paper in the peak of the paper in the paper in
12 to 24 hours later, he put it in our late late to us as a long way to the beginning.
We have thousands that can do that.
These organisms can be driven by the total.
I can live in the violent of living in the viold.
I am absolutely safe that life can be in the space of the extracted to find a new environment, to find a new environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is going to be there.
Here's a micrograph micrograph molecules that we build these process process -- in the design of the design process of design movements with the design of the piece of the piece of the piece.
Drodies have a little automatics.
This is not a picture of a microscope with electrons, but a small microphones, but a mouth.
This is this molecule molecules we can see a microscoooptic.
These are the collects of a collected by a six seconds.
This is a public public public public public public spoken time.
These are over 580,000 genetics.
It's the biggest molecular molecular structure.
It has a molecular molecular molecules.
If you have a 10-page funny and no space, 142 pages, 142 pages to remember this code code this code code this code code of genetic code this code code of genetics.
So, how do we go to a cromoss? How do you active. What do you do?
Wident, with a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
You also also also feel more easy when you get to the homeless and you can just get to put the nuclear and that is something that you heard -- and that is something that you heard -- claim.
With bacterial bacteria, is the integrated in the cells, but we can do a completely transplant that we can do a completely transplant to a cells of a cell.
I have a pursue of the microbial microbial species of microbial microbial microbial microbial ral microbial ral robial rkbial rthbial rthichole.
These are about the second is as far as people and the machines.
I brought a couple genes that we can sit for this cromossed for this cromosse.
We digerated with the enzy to homorry all of the proteins.
And it was pretty much when I put it in the cells -- you will approach -- you can get very sophisticated in our cells -- and cromossed in the cells.
In fact, we thought this is how to do it as a dear can design design to design design.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are working all of the species that have the second species that have cromossed a third of our pthird of our respect of new respect in a second.
So the people who think of the evolution of evolution as a single way to a moment of biology.
They're the enzy-restrict restrictions, which is digers.
Cromosomosomosomomosomomos.
Cula -- cromoss-cycomosomomosomomosomomosomomosomomosomomosomomosomomosomomosomomosomosomosomomosomosomomosomomoscienalyzy -- the homospa -- the homosmaker -- the cellular -- the cellula -- the chull -- the cellula --
It was expressed and recorded the other cromossed chain as a gerry, and so we returned with cells with cell.
It became the bastrbastrbastrastrous genes I put in cromossed in cromosomomosomomosomosomomosomomosomosomomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomosomomosed to become the bastrouch.
And after a very bridge, all of the time, all of the couple of a species of a species of a new species of a new species that we have led on a new species that we have been on the new cell.
All of the proteins were changing -- when we call was changing -- when the genetic genetics, is exactly what we transfer could transfer the way we transfer what we transfer was exactly what we transfer was transfer to the tools.
This can be like the chemical genomics, but we can also change the DNA to change things that we change things are pretty much quite things that we can change the things that we are pretty much enough to be able to change things that are pretty much of the things that are pretty much as a lot of the things like the chemical sounds like the chemical things.
Now, I had a desire is not the genetic -- but to build three billion years and a half of the evolution of evolution, and we have a new version of creating a new version of the Cambridge, where the Cambrians, where the world is a new specific design, in which which it has a new specific of the massive of the massive of the massive of the massively massive massive of the massive of the massive of the massive
Why do we do that?
I think it's pretty good at the point of the point of the point of the needs of now.
We are going to go from six and half and half billion people and half billion people over 40 years ago.
As a context for me to me in 1946. I was in 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for every of us that there were four years old.
We have the problems of the bridge, the farmers of the fuel, drinking six billion and half billion and half billion and half billions and half billions and half billions and half billion and half billion and half billion and we have a half of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems we have the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of the problem.
It will be difficult to do for us to do it.
We are in the five billion books of the books, more than 30 billion barily barily bars.
This means a hundred million bars.
When we try to think about the process biological process that process to the fact that it would be a challenge challenge challenge challenge to be a challenge challenge challenge challenge of the challen.
And then of course, is that the CO2 from this material that has come into atmosphere in atmosphere in atmosphere is that they get to attack.
Now, in our discovery of our discoveries around the world of data on 20 million genes, and I like to think about 20 million genes, and I like to think about the design of the design of the design of the future.
Industrial Foundation has just a pain, or so that components, and this is the diversity that was in the diversity that came from this.
We are limited here, in the first time, a biological reality and imagine of our imagination.
We have now been now to the technology of these types of spring, to do what we call what we call the genimic genemicals.
We have the ability to build a large robot that to do a million cromoss on day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of genes are different genes of genes or to optimize products of producing products of producing products of our products of our own ethans, we can change the way we do with a team of the photography of the science of science in the last 20 years of science.
And this is just the standard.
We can sell the objects, producing the substance of substanti-blood squarely producing the vaccines of the vaccines.
This is a purchain of a mass of design design that we work to work and we can do things that we do to work to work in these species in computers.
You know, we don't know the network.
We know how they looked like their genetics.
Now we do now concentrate to four four generations.
You've seen the beautiful is just a scientist.
We have the fuels of the second generation and the third that they are going to get pretty much big, which are butterly big, which are butterly big.
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact can be more costs and the farmers and the farmers and the farmers is if we start with the CO2 as the projects of the projects of the design of the design of the footprint of the economy to this four to the four house.
Lumbout of the Both -- -- but in our discoveries are all around the world of other countries.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
She in the oceans, about the oceans, about two kilometers and half a little bit of the farmers of the physical temperature.
Transform CO2 in the metan hydrogen molecular energy.
We try to see if we can take the CO2 captures, which can be able to be able to convert that CO2 and converiousness to convert that CO2 to conduct this process to conduce this process this process process this process process to this process this process that process to the process of the U.S.
So in a period of time, we think we could be as a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the life?
We really know -- you know, you know, we have the objects of the entire industry industry.
Yeah. If you don't do this at TED, where in other parts of the other parts of the part.
She become a major energy.
But also we also work now to use these same thing to invent these vaccines to come to the vaccines of vaccines immediately.
You've seen this with this year, we are always in the minus in the minus when a home when it comes to the right right when it comes to the right right now.
I think the situation can be changed by the combined vaccines to the combinators.
Here is how to get the future, to art the future changes now with the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the brain, and finally funny, the final of the final gently.
We are almost to do people.
Our big, our is just to make sure that we have a little bit of survival survival to survive it. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you a little more meanings, very quickly, is a new technology that I had been able to Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft in a year.
It's a media that can interacting with a large of the data with a big data.
We look at a lot of gigabout, many of you have digital and men and men and men in the way, the land the type of that, you know, the rearras.
Not content to how much the information of how large is these large collective or how large is the images.
Most of the world are doing a camera with a camera by a room, but that is a scannel, is a scannel, is a 300 meaningful mythese.
It doesn't have the only thing that you should be the only thing that the performance is the number of the monitor of your monitor for a moment of your monitor the architecture of your architecture of your architecture of the architecture of the architecture of the architecture of the architecture of the power for the simplest thing to be flufuel.
This is a books, a non-imagine example.
It's about ""Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhologists of colored a representation of a capital.
For the monstrange that is about the text, and not a story of the text, to show that it is that it is a street of a type.
Maybe this is a fuel, to read a book.
I didn't want to recommand.
This is a little bit. It's a little bit. It's a "Garardian "You're going to you.
Each images the image of a seconds.
This is the truth of a very piece of a experience of a bunch of a research of a daily of a lot of slightly environmental environmental environment.
We made a little bit of a small collaboration called "Garardian "Garardian
I created a clamp of a very larger resolution -- much more than any clamped -- and we recognize -- and I recognize content content content content.
If you want to see the properties of these machines, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specifically the technology.
And this is the printing of ideas, the idea of a monitor of a monitor a monitor a monitor of a monitor
We feel like this to meet the pop-square and other mizarre and other mizarre as a mizarre -- which is not needed to be required to the way of the gene.
Of course, the mapping is one of the applications for a technology of this technology.
I don't want to be a lot of time on this time to say to this is just about this contribute to this gentlemen.
These are all the way of the United States to a picture of the U.NASASASASASASASASASASASA.
Let's painting to something about something else.
This is actually active active on Internet is now.
This is a kind of a second design Photosynth, which is the South, where the other of the other of the other of the research is Southon the perception of the computer of the computer of the computer of the computer Snavels of Washington, the Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Photosynthesian Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Ste
and Rick Szelki at Cercetor Microsoft-the-hand the beautiful collaboration of the beautiful lab.
So this is active the Internet.
You can see that when we create this perspective, when we can have this kind of images can have this kind of experience in many resolution in many resolution.
But the art space of these images of these images conted.
One of the perception of the visual visual images have these images together, so that they can do these space, so that these pictures -- all of the Laces -- all of the Sttype of Canadience -- they were doing. You were -- they were doing. You have been done here -- they were doing. You were the projects of a projects of a projects of a projector or and these space.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you a whole new environments.
There are some of some more spaces that have a lot more space.
I would like to go to one of the stories of the original stories of Noah -- this is part of a time of the Photosyna Photosyna -- to show you what I think is that I think is that the piece of this technology, technology, technology, technology, technology, the technology, the technology, the vision of this technology, is non-drift visible to the vision of this projections that we have projects that we have projected to the projection of this projections that we have projection of the pose of the paintos.
We had to be working with the slicenses of slices.
This is a rebuilding Cattacker Dams of the images of the images of the images of Docar Flickr, and we find something you can find something that you can find something potentially in the trick of the camera in the room. And every one of these concluding a conductent that was a concluding of this model.
These are the state of the Flickr, and all of this mouth in this way.
We can just be simply to be in this moving.
You know, I never thought I'd be able to work to work to work to work to work on Microsoftor to a lot of the first here.
I mean, I think that I am a lot of stitude that I am a lot of the cells of the phones of the teachers, even a very large number of teaching in this environmental environmental environment.
If you can find it in this circles.
There are so many machines of mass -- and they were honeybee.
One is a series of photographs --
This is a poster with Domes that was restricted cooperation.
You can stand you can stand the physical paintingly to a physical environment.
The idea is that they can do with the social media. This is to collective data from the world -- from the world -- from the collective Earth, from the visual Earth. They're going to internal connections. These are the internal connections. They have been making ideas that is the spending of the story.
You have a model of what the Earth Pland.
Think about this as a long way to the Stephen Lawler "Earth."
And this creatures as the world as a whole world of carrying the world is becoming largest benefits as users.
The purpose are with metaphett-metaphetting.
If someone would be the final tent and she would say that you are going to be able to Doug, then the "Cattack with all the data and I could have enough to all of these data and I could do with these data and I could do with the fact that we could do with that space, to that a space of the experience of the experience of the experience of experience of the experience of experience experience of the experience of the experience of the experience of the experience of the experience of the social experience of the experience of the social experience of the social experience
And of course, a second, a second, and all of these are the mass of the virtual virtual patients of the Earth, collective paintings of the days of the windows and the image of the state of the streets of a book.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: What I met the codemic, what it would allow the best time, is that it will allow the time, in the history of someone in the houses of someone in the houses on the internation?
BA: Yeah. What makes is to do is to descend.
They are resistans, if you want to see between images.
And they realize this is the basic content of the images.
And this is the innet of the data thinking about the information that they have the image that they have the images.
As when you do a look at the Internet, the couple of images that you can get a lot of the Internet of the Internet of the information of information about what is the representation of information about what the representation of information about what the representing is the positive of information.
Now, what would be if that steeps do with all the position with all the position?
And then the case of interconnection and disease is the signature. It's the effect of remains. It's the effect of relief is the effect of the relief of relief the classroom.

One of the parents of the pursus and one of the research is the research is to live is the way to live in the country that have no long-term in their past state in their windows in their windows in their windows in their paintings.
And the idea that the Jaguana Jaguuary movement of Calia Lack's Lacker or mythesian of the inities of Dharms are still going to be rejected to the Himalama, is to report our own state of Dharma, is that we live in the center of the American anthers, is that we live in a state of the world is only an arms of the world is is just a proper of the world of the world that we live in the world is is only a massive model of the world of the world that world is that world is that the world is that the world of the world of the world of the world of the world is is is is is is that the the the idea of the idea of
The consequence of a decision that the street that our streams have been taken to the success of our generations with a lot of generation in the next generation of generation.
And of course, we all have the same imperative of the same imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative.
Everybody is nice the rooms. We all advanced children on the world.
We need to be able to recognitigate the initive.
We need to do the story of the newspaper to death, so that you should surprising us to surprising, so we have the art.
But what is interesting is the interesting is the kind of a little bit of a dancy of every culture.
The thing is that the U.S. The Borneo, or adoo from the Haite, or the Haiti in the northern Kenyan Kennife of Kennia, the car from the Kenya Candero of the Earth's movement.
And this is the kind of guys, that I was a long long ago, or even a long long-term of the Evehicles on the world of the world of the world of the world.
All these people are going to be the other people of thinking about fishes, other ways of thinking of the other ways of thinking about the Earth.
And this idea -- if you think about it, you can't think about the spoken example.
Now, morift of the world of cultures of the world are going to be a spirit of life and culture and culture of the planetary planetary planetary planetary planetary planetary of life as the planet for the health of life as the planet.
And you could think about this is this is the way of life, as you could define as a slide as a slide of the speed of the spinal scientists, ideas, intuitive to life, inspired to life, inspired to the human images of human images.
Etnosis is the machines of human movements.
It's simboller what we can be as we can be as a surprising species of code okind.
And as biosphere was several several and so it can be a lot of larger -- and maybe a lot of larger story.
For example, no biologists don't have to suggests that half of the species of all species are in all the species of the extinction of the extinction is not true, and yet is not true, and this is not the most expected in the gentlemen, and this is about what the diverse -- the most optimistic diversus of what we know about what we know is the most optimist.
And the largest indicator of these is the limits of the limits of the limits of the limits of the limits of the limits of the limits of the largest indicator the biggest indicator the biggest indicator the biggest indicator the biggest indicate the biggest indicator the biggest indicator of these indicator to these indicator of these indicator of these indicator of these indicator ine.
When you walk out of you will, there were 6,000 language, there were 6,000 languages.
Now, a language is not just a vocabular or a grammaster rules of rules.
A language is a square of the human.
It's the history of that suffering the ecture of the particular material of the material material in the world of material material.
Each language is a language, a nice of receptor of receiving a sense of possibilities.
And those 6,000 languages, as we know here in Monterey, a half of them are not a half of them are not a little bit of children.

It was just the only one is the more grass has had a kind of false that almost as the inner conscious consciousness of a beautiful family of a bunch of family chains.
This plants contains contains very powerful story, very serotony in the brain, took the brain, 50ystoxyyyland.
If you saw the Yanomami in Yanomami libring that the surface, that substances is made in their nases that content is made of different species that content and they have been done in the methoxytocyland.

They can be taken by the way with other compounds with other compounds that guys MAO.
Now, the thing that is that the fascinating is that the machines are inhiboline, the MAA of the guyamine, the case of the potential to the potential of the animal for the whole of the planet of the planet of the planet of the planet -- they found these two planets that are fashion-history of the fascinating of the fashibly of the whole bright?
Well, we use that equire woman's greatly myself, which is demassive sense.
But the questions and they say, "Plants are talking about it.

This guy has 17 variety has 17 variety of amazing all of the land they record all of the fast, and we see all have the only species.
And then you ask them how they do it and they said, "I me" and they said, "I know something about planes.
I mean, you know, I don't know anything." And I said, "No."
Well, we know that every 17 variety of the 17 variety water, and they get a different long, and they get a different now.
Now, this is not going to bring a doctored to Harvard, but it's much more interesting than the number of stamins.
Now, the problem is that the same same same same same same same things, which feats of the books, and you see as well-culoils, but as a story and the networks, and the world is that the world of our world is development.
The 20th century, the 20th century, over 300 years ago, it will not be the minds of technological or innovation or innovative technological and innovative as we have lived and we encouraged or we have lived or we live or we live or we live in the planet and we live is not the distract. The problem is is not the massive of biological problems.
All the collected of all the times were always in a way of living in a new way.
And the problem is is not technology.
Indians have not Sioux didn't start to be Sioux when they were until they were going to be more than they were beginning to be American to be American to be American to be American housing and living in the case and living in the case and living in the case and living in the Six and surprise.
It doesn't change or technology or technology of the interesting of the brain.
The cruels of cruels.

These are people living people living and in the state of the history of their shapes that are over their capability that are over their capacity of their own capacity of their own capacity of their own capacity of their own capacity of their own capacity of their own action.
The best thing that is the farmers of the country of the country -- a bag -- a parently bad of the Asia Sarawaway, from Saraway, from Saraway, and now in the room in the room, and now all the window, and you all the street and the street and the street and the streets that you can see the bathroads and the bones of the bathrown of the Both of the hol, and the blood of the balancy of the batherapbeauti-beauti-bar.
where the japped stories have to horize the houses of the cost of the machines of the same.
Or in the Yanamama Yanomy are bolls that have came from the exterior in the area.

In a day day he was a day from a long monkeys with Mao, and this infraction of the mountained of moving money to the mountained of the works.
Dure's Tike, maybe it can be impossible to him, but the spirit is something to be something admirrace.
And finally, in fact, all of the choices.
We want to live in a monocrom-monotics or we want to accept a world of policy?
Margaret Meather's making mythologist, he said before I was that the largest thing that we have been able to this is that we have allowed to this is generally generate and amorphones and amorfly in the image of the image of the image of the image of the image of the image of thinking about the image of thinking about a day of the way you look at a day and other ways of thinking about the way we were walking about the whole thing to see to the other of thinking about about the way.
And it's the behind us to advanced that our species are seven by a 600-year-old year-old year-old years.
The Revolution of the Neolitics -- which we had to live in the healthy of healthy land the city of his healthy projects has been replaced by the next general proper -- he created a four-a-specialized per -- it was about 10,000 years ago.

Ghidden their own history were done in the paintings in the piece of carbon in the piece.
So the good thing about this is not the intimify of night or dreams or dreams.
He just just a simple allowed to the blood pants to the pants of the piece of the piece of the photographs of the machines began to engineering as he was like a kind of like it as he shares the way it looks like he was like to shape a way in their way to shape their own statement and he was like to share.

Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some of the bookay who hope that I hope that I hope with other things that you have heard the other things that you get some of the top of the case in the case you get to the top that you have the rating.
I want to start with what I call "the doctors.
Doctor of what?
Doctor of the typical societies of the own.
And this doctors sounds like this. If we are interested in this way: if we are the needle level of our news, the common is to make the maximize of the maximize of the himself.
The reason for this is that the liberal is that the best way of good, value, the value, the value, the inside, to be true.
And because if people are liberatures we can achieve things that are going to be the good things that will be the good and nobody have to decide in our place.
The maximate maximize is the maximizing is the maximizing of choices.
Somebody choices, so people have more liberts, and the more liberty, and the more liberates, so they have a little more and they have a little more and they have a little more and together.
And so, I think, it's so good in our systems that it wasn't that it would be able to put it together.
And it's the implement of our lives in our lives lives.
I'll give you a few examples about what has made for us to our own last time.
This is a supermarket.
I mean, two words about two words about the sospites.
175 soshes for the history of my supermarkets, and this is the 10 different types of different types of meters and the 12 countries that you can buy the 12 countries that you can buy the proper in a very name in a very large number of the 175 that you can do the case of the 175 stories.
So this is the supermarket.
And then you go to the story of component to configure out a system -- you know, CDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD.
And in this maps of component is a bad of the systems are stereotype of systems.
We can configuring million and half million and half of the systems that are in the blood of a single of a single state of a single story.
You have to recognize that this means that this means that this meaning.
In other parts -- in the communication.
There was a poetry to get a kid, when I was the first guy whatever you can get any of the service as a time of MBell.
You know, you know, you don't buy it. Not it.
One of the consequences of this is that the phone was that the telephone was the steel.
And those days are death.
Now, we have a diverse of the phones of the telephones, more along in the world in the brain in mobility.
These are the future.
My Preference is the middle -- with MPretty MP3 player, and the car on the name of the day's name.
And if you look at the story is not in the story of you can see that in the flies you to see it in the current of it.
And the result is that it makes people to get this question.
And you know what is the answer?
The answer is "No. No. It's not possible. It's not going to buy a lot of steel.
And in other parts of life, which are more important than the machines that are rates that the number of options.
The story of the sanitar -- in the United States is not the cycle of doctor and this is what to doctor to do.
And you know, you go to the doctor and this is saying you says, and the variano and variance.
It has these advances.
Is that are advanced these risks to do you want to do that?
And you say, "Does what to doctor says, he says, he says, and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risks and the risk of these risks and risk of these risks and the risks.
What do you want to do?
And you say, "But if you were in my place, you would have doctor?" And my doctor?" And my doctor says, "We don't have in the place. And the result of the patient." And the result." And the thing to be a benef.
But what is actually a transition is a transition and decisions and decisions and decisions that you know about a doctor -- in the case of the case of the best decades and it's not sure to make the best decisions -- in the best decades -- in the patient.
There is a level of a public public medications for the drugs of the drugs like you, and you think about it, if you think about a little bit, you don't have a little bit, you can buy a bble.
Why are we seeing the new public public if we can't buy them.
The answer is that the people who do this is that we do that we are going to be able to do our impact and our impact and receive our immersible.
Something that the identity became a choice of choices of choices to show that.
We don't have a new machines we have a possibility to an invention of a invention.
And that we can reinvent us to reinvent us to have the cheeating.
And that's that every day you have to decide you need to decide what you want to be the person to be the person to be like you will.
Every rejected for the journey and family was a poor that the purposes that the purposes to the top of the story, and then you can get the training you as you can get to kidney.
The opposite opposite was with five before, and you don't have to do after that.
On our days, the whole thing is very funny.
I mean, I have incredibly intelligence and I want to do with 20 percent of the 20 percent of the 20 percent of the 20 percent of the 20 percent of the time.
And that's not for that it would be more than the degrees and not because it would be more than the map of the map.
Did you are prepared with all of the questions "I should do it for me or now?
Did you should be traveled to the top? You should have met the kids, or a kid?" And this is the questions that are questions.
And they will answer to these questions, whether this is not all of the tempt and not to do a good news, and not to get a good news.
And that's what we need to do. These are the questions that you need to answer that you need to answer.
Munlike -- we are good, as the house and Carl and Carl to work on every mind of the mind of every place, every place on the planet -- a little bit of the Rielfe of the RRiel.
There's a photograph in a collect, which I didn't get it not, which works that works in which which works on the relationship.
Let me tell you about it because I want to use it to be using it.
So this is this incredible libert-libert-blood that we have to make a little works, is that we have to make a decision, and then we should be able to do and and and and and and and and and and the blood and and the blood and if we should be working for it.
We can go to see how our game as our games and we have to have the mobility in a buzzzzonoberryberry and Blackberry and the other cycle gary.
And even if all of these are the prised every mind of the mind of the mind of the mechanical mechanal mechanal mmechan?
Did you should answ? Did you should write the cross?
So where the home, where the blood and the small things that are cleaning and things that countries that are a opportunities.
And the world that lived as I lived as I was showing that.
And as I was to say, I had some of the choices of choices were a opportunity.
And the world that we live now,
And the question is, why is it goo?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what we all know about this, so I will talk about what I would be talking about what I mean,
All these choices have two effects of people.
One of the effect, it's the paradox, it's the paralyberry.
Something that can choose the opposite of their opposites, people to optest anything to optest anything.
I love a very significant example, a study of the investment of the investment of the penguins.
A colleague had the colleagues had access to the data from the investment of the investment of funny of funny of mutual dience.
And what he found is that for every 10 funny mutual mutual journey of participation of partners.
With 50 funny funny -- they were funny about 10 percent of the help of if you have to be more than if you have to be if you have to five or what?
Because with 50 fond-funding mutual mutual of equal equires to choose to choose to choose the best way you have to choose to eat home and the home.
And then you get the him, and then on the hoored, and on the hookay, and the good, and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course, and you can never seem to be seeing the home.
You know, you know, this is not just that this is not just that they have to consume that for the pension, because they don't have a money to put a little bit of a decision, that means that the stability to make a decision, that you have done in the farmers of the farmers that you could have the farmers that would be the farmer.
And the driver, they were to five is to 5,000 dollars to 5,000 dollars a year in the parts of the compenses.
So the insight is a consequence is a lot of opinions.
And I think that makes the world to show that the world to look like this.
You want to take the best decisions if it's for the best decades, right?
You don't want to choose to choose the investment or the blood or the saving.
So this is a checking. It is that if we reach is that if we reach to desire and we do a little bag and we can be a little bit of choices are going to be a little bit of the opening of choices that we were a little bit of opposite.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that a lot of sospites for the saving of the windows if you buy and it's not perfect for the saving and it's not perfect for saying to save the wester?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better choices. And what happens is that the alternative image. And what you get to imagine that you get to the regret of choices that you have done in the regret of the choices that you can do a good decades that you can actually do the good decades if this was a good decades that you do it.
Somebody have more options, so it's hard to regret something that is define something that you have to find the opposite opposite opposite of the opposite opposite of the opposing of the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of the oppositive of the oppositions,
Secondly, what economists called the opportunity called the opportunity.
Dan Gilmonstrated very clear in this morning, as we spoke about how we do things like the way we depend things that we depend things that are farmers.
Well, when they're a lot of other other type of alternative to imagine is easy to imagine is easy to imagine the characteristics that you require and that you can reach them to attacks that you can do a little bit of the attacks.
Here's an example. I mean, I don't have the New Yorkerkinks.
But here is how should be rations.
We have here in Hamper Hamp.
A very scipped very scidentify.
Spain, you know, you know, they have to be the mind.
What could you be more likely to be more likely to be able to play the guys, "It's wrong.
All of my cartoon Manhattan are fluted.
I could be as a bridge. And I spend two week." And the idea that they were roughly on the idea that they had a daily place to be a place in the parts that mind-parking place.
The opportunity of opportunity to attention that we have a choices that we have the choices.
And as many opposed to take a lot of options of the options of these options attacks of these options are going to be perceived by the opposite opportunities.
Here is another example.
This cartoon-hand a lot of things.
We should be saying that we should live and we probably have to be able to do things begin to do things begin to be things beginning.
But one of the things that says is that you say that anything you have to do is not doing other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things can have a lot of living and that will do what you do.
First of all, expected way: expectations.
This was when I was a love when I wanted to go to the bawesome.
Portly almost all the time.
And there was a poor that guys were a single and they were able to get them and they buy them as you can get it as you can get to the common and they were incredibly stuck and if you put them on their own hundred times begin and they hope their beginning, and they were begin to stand up to the story.
So I went to go to the training my home after I had a good money on the old of the news, and I said, "Look, I want to mean the bridge, "Have the measure of my bridge, the farms, the farmers to be therapists, the farms of my farms of my finger?
Did you with the villages or farm? Do you want to get or farm?

We have before, they have made these opposed to be able to allow better to allow better better than the bright.

The machine is more like this.
The reason that everything was best when it was a best when it was the best it was the best person when people have been paying as people to experiment.
At the day day in the world that we live -- and we live -- and you have the perfective industrialized and advancing the best thing you can be so good as you can be so good as good as you can have the best thing you can do to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good for you can do it as good things.
