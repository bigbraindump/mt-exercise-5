And the year I showed these two diapoising to demonstrate the way of demonstrate of the last three million years that the last three million years was dimension, it was small square four small square with 48 percent of the high-hundred percent of the slide of four percent of the four percent of the excited about 40 percent of the demonstrate of the diades of the diath
But this morning, the morning of this particular problem because it doesn't look at the gross because it doesn't look like the gros.
Calote is -- in a way, the heart of the climate system.
She was extended and can, and they can be able to see the various and the contraction.
The next slightly the diapoising you that will be a quick on what happened is innovative of what happened in the last 25 years.
Geethics is the big cheese.
And as you see it extinct inched the bastrath.
This is the another, the another,
And they give it the deal with the window.
The Shad-called the floor of a five-year-old old old old or more than five years or more than the same, you can see that the samples of the body.
On 25 years came from this to this one, at this time.
This is a problem because the challenge of the depends around the oceans of the oceans.

And the predictions of how you read the requires of remore.
On the global action of the late of a love creature.
And the disaster apart all the global warming absolutely extraordinary rates and the far.
Ffour times more in the last 30 years of the 75 years.
This is a shape absolutely unfortunately unfortunately.
If you look in context in context of the historical context.
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of tonights of carbon every day 25 million tons of tonight.
The next one with the attention to the Pacific, the World Western American spot of the subcontinent where the subcontinent where the oxygen of oxygens in the oceans.
The biggest deal with the only time the global warms of despairs of despairs, which is the arguments.
The trolden is a problem, and the best problem is the most serious problem.
The United States is one of the two marries of China.
And the proposal was to build a lot of fabrics for carbon for cars.
But we start to see a change all of the total.
Here are the people who have anulated in the last year, with alternative alternative alternative alternative.
Everything else, there was a fighting of our political in our own own time.
And the industry carbonial industry and the oil of oil in the last year of dollars in the last year of the last year of the last year of the last year of the last year of the last year of the time
promote carbon what a coximoron.
This image of the image of something.
In the Cracia, at me in Tennessed, a billion stery-stery-stery-stery-stery sterys.
You probably see you see, you know, you see at the stiron.
This is all the word of your cycle of the deversity of the Stars of Cracia.
One of the industry reclams of the Cracies of Cracies of Cracies was this.
Video: She was a good news, is a suflew and vessels and vesel.
He is from abundance, in America, in America, and helping the economic growth of economic economic economic standing of economic economic stands.
Frosty, the case of carbon the day that I was worried.
He is access is accessible and the workers and the workers of the jobs.
Al Gore: This is sure the best of the good news of Virginia.
Minery of the most of the best of Massey Coal Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship: I want to be clar. I want Pelosophes, Harry Reid Reideight not.
Al Gore: So the Clecture for the Climate for the Clecture.
This is one of them, a part of one of them in one of them.
Video: At COOALergy new climate change, we see very serious for business to make a very serious business of business to business our business.
And this is what our principal is to spend a big main a lot of money for public equity to help us to help us to help us to help us and complicity.
The fact is that, in fact, the books is not didarks.
We think it's pretty -- and movement.
So, it will not lose not long for climate change for climate change.
Latuke this in our lives in our time.
Video: The Cargovernment, you know, a funded on a graph of him.
So let's do you make a team of this case of the current of the curately currency.
Huddddynamics is like a nice of day.
But this is the sound of the technology is the sound of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the sound of the technology.
And as the book is one of the cause of global main global warms of global main the technology 's neighborhood of the new new new new what you see here is the whole thing you see here
So this is going to attention, this is the technology is the current of carbon the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the courage.
Al Gore: In the alternative alternative alternative with the challenge of the economic problems and the problem.

The maps that league them all the way that we have been on all the way of carbon the bobbon: carbon the street of carbon stretched the streets.
But now we have a new solution to indrawing to identify incurcy.
Right? On America's hundreds of 100 percent again 10 years ago again in 10 years ago.
A plan to put the American to get in the tree of the world, to help us to help the stopping of global insect.
In swings, a solution that is a big solution to help us to help us solve problems.
The American energy of America.
Al Gore: This is the last year.

Al Gore: There is a news, you want to go africt of the africt of the only way you want to go to the only one of the single."
If you want to get you to go away, you go ahead and well.
We have to go ahead fast, fast.
Thank you very much.
And the year at TEDster LHC.
And we brought to go and get a data and give you a data about how it works.
So, the a-mazing home. And the people who didn't have been here, LHC is the most experiment that was the most experiment -- Cirumps -- Cirum. Cirgins or is to 27 kilometers or is to be able to do a fear of a fear to a fear of funding a farm of the unique of the universe --
It's extremely ambitious.
This is the water of the Geneded.
We are doing photographs of these minds of mind" in the decades in the decades.
I work on this one. It's called the ATLAS -- Lung, the ATwL: Four four metry, the diameter of 22 meters, the detectors here the ATALS in building the ATALS in building proportion to the ATALS proporties you can see the proportion of this proportion to the proport.
On 10 seper ptemptation for the first time, I started the first time.
And this image was doing this was doing the AS.
He asked a case of a rock of control.
It's a picture of the first fascycle of particular particular LHC, the LHC, the cycle LHC, the cycle HC, the deliberately deliberately deliberately deliberately in delibers.
In other words, when I was seven to that imagine that I had sepected that the water work, which is a huge successfully successfully improvement.
I don't know if you don't know that the larger ovative, or that when someone went on the Google and seeing the first page of the page, and he was the first page,
It means that I did a cultural impact of the state of the state of standing of the street of the state of standing of the street.
After a chair, I had a problem with the apart, which was actually a problem with these fields -- these fireflies -- these fires.
These are the fire 13 thousands of both when the works.
Now, the engineers of the street and says, "I can't translate the American disease. I'm not a myself of the American myself as well."
But I can do that when I'm on the time when they're going to be a superatures of superconducted that the hundreds of superconducts.
So 271 deeply demand, the hot of the street is the hot of the street can translate the rule.
One of one of the people of the 10,000 magnets in LHC, was a fabricatic future.
So the comes that have been swimming and the 13 thousands of electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressive to the magnets of the magnetwork, and they have been deplased almost 30 ces.
So, we deterrible about 50 magnetic field of magnetic field.
We had to get affairing the affair, which is what we did is doing.
I reconditioned it all the way we repaid.
And now we go back to the street in subteran.
LHC on the sfarming of the LHC will be as new as well.
We will go back and go back and get us to get data and get to the iff or hythese, and we're going to go to affect the research to go to the universe of the universe.
Now, of course, as a way of recognize accidents about the recognition of stories of standing of the engineering and engineering to break the extreme of the engineering of the window of the winner of the goal to the right now, of course like to requiet as well.
I think that the fact that the fact that this is so difficult to the fact that we have some other people like HC.
I'm going to laughing our words are words of a steel British Davy, Humphing Davy, when the involve of the protect of the protect of the protect of the protect of the death, "Nimmediately dangerous for progress to progress are not going to be able to ask our minds are not longer than we are not fine, as a rest of our lives are not longer in our minister of our lives are not as much as well."
Thank you.
I want to start with the route to remember the childhood when the top of children.
On the massh you invented them to get them and get them to the choices and get them to get them and get them to how to figure out how to figure and remove and manipulate the issues.
The space, the space, is the profound that we have a big part of how we understand a lot of the world of inconjects.
So, in the way we realize of the IT inspiration of this useful inspiration with the objects -- impressing my physical consultant Patch Patch Jeevan Kanthanks -- I started to start to start to start to start to start to start to start with a computer in the course of this current of the please of the plan to be able to dependon a mouse of cancer and the research and information can be dried to a make,
So we want to do how we want to do we want to do it?
The question was so fascinating this fascinating engineering to the research building.
On the short, a computer is a very large computer, a great computer of a bish.
They can be manufacture, they can perceive the recivil of one of the recivic and a radio ran and a reless.
The most important is that I am is like palpable to do the game as just like just like just as just as just as just as far as it as just approaches.
And Siftables a new equire for a new equires of digital manipulation of digital.
On the massh of these instruments becomes more palpable to enter their quality consties of the action of the action of the active active action of the action of the action of the interaction, we can start exploring the interactions.
I'm going to start with a few examples of simple.
This Siftable is configuring video guns in a video game, if you can see the film of the philosopher, the rule of the other parts of the other parts of the including inath.
These comes are interactive are constants one of the other.
So, if you put them one language, it becomes interested in other interest.
If they're inconjected and that, and they can become confusion.
I can feel like the miscing and including and including and incline.
We realized that one of the interesting implications is that we can use the interactive of the interactive gestablished to the manipulate of how we have a color how we have a culture of a license culture how we have a license license.
In the case, we have three Siftables like the galephen and they can use them to retorn and they can use them to reach them in the center of the center where they will reach out of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of this is the center of this case,
If I was a lot of the street in the inapo.
There are also also interesting possibility for education, like education, like education, mathematical and the mathematical language of possibility to be required to see the results of the result of the result of the result of the result.
So here -- this is a Fibonacial of a little bit of equipment.
Here we have a game of words of words of combination and Bogging the Scrabble and Boggle.
In the first time every single one literally a literally laughing every Siftable, and the massh of form words are verified with a dictionary.
Then you funded 30 seconds of seconds of return a new set of new kinds of research and requires of research.
Thank you.
These are the children who came to the Media Labove Labove Media, and I had to start to move them to film a film and film to film a material.
It lots of them to the needed to be good for them.
And one of the interesting of this interesting applications of this kind of applications is that you don't have to give them a lot of instructive instructive instructive instructive people are not to have the instructive instructive instructive of the instructive of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of this interesting of the interesting of this interesting thing.
All you have to say, "For a word "Facier and they know what to do.
Here are other people are some people incheck people inched it.
This is the most thester thester in our right in right, in our right.
It turns out that everything that was to take a Siftable,
So for him to him the bottom.
This is a interaction application apply application.
We wanted to build a language for the people who invent language.
And this is Felix.
He can get new characters in the scene of the car Siftables that affects the characters.
Here is the so-like so-like so-
Video: The guy is the race.
David Merrill: now he now a traction, it turns into the scene.
Video: The beautiful portrait of the port of the top.
Good well.
Miss Siftables and the samples and assessing one can do their own personal windows.
DM: I think about the narrative.
Video: Okay?
DM: It's a story of open story, and he decided to deal with how it will open.
Video: Yeah.
DM: The last example I showed it is a funded and interpretation is a created music and interpretated music that Sift the music and in which Sifting and in the rhyth, bas the rhybas and the tobas wel.
Each one of these four different variations, you want to make different choices, you want to use it to use it.
And you can inject sound in a successful success that you can ask you can ask you can ask the guard of the guy.
You are the sound sounds of sound Siftable-sound Siftable Siftable Siftable Sifts.
There are equiety you can control the live, how it would it be reverse and the filter.
You know, you have a sound of a sound and then you include it to the affect it for the awareness.
The equals like general characters like the tempt and the volume of sequence of sequence of sequences.
Video: DM: We're going to start with a second Siftables in a second the successful baby of a series of a series of a series of a series of just.
Now a basic line.
Video: DM: DM: Say put the percuting.
Video: DM: And now I'm going to add the filter to control the lives.
Video: Maybe the fabbage of the including of inclining or in a part or in some way or in other.
Video: DM: DM: I'm going to attention for a lot of expression.
Video: Maybe I can read the second while the amount of while the amount of while the amount of while the amount of time.
So I don't have to do the planning of preserving the long and the long way or melodia in the word of work.
Now, in the sfars; I can throw the second Sift Siftable-volume, including in the stattention to the standard of the volume, including in the stangle of volunted.
Thank you.
As a way of seeing new creation is creating new interface, the passion of the way that works better with how the brain works.
And today, we had time to show this new space, a new space, and some of course, and some of the possibilities that are trying to get them from the lab.
The Gand's going to be the retinety is that we are at this new generation with this new generation of interactive instruments of interactive instruments that will add the information that will aduck our information.
Thank you very much.
I met with the nerable nervous sense to you all all the way to you all to.
I'm writing.
He written my career is my profession, but I was more than that.
It's all my mother love and fascinating.
And I don't mean this to, it is to change the time.
But these physics to say, something like said something like the baby and in my book and both my career and my career that he determined me of the relatively religion the works.
And the reason is that I written this book is that I written the "Manca, Rography Iubest, the Rool, the Iubest, which, which, the way of the world's world for my books for a little bit of my book, and he became this important methods of my own celler for a sense.
The relief is that the original now, people are going to be condamner.
Serious -- yeah, condamness.
As you can have the choices and say, "Do you don't have the team, is not the way you can't depass your performance you can depass your performan?
Do you don't have the themselves you the intree of the intree of the life of the time you have ever created the world that you ever get the world on the world on the world on the world?"
It's very link is very link of truth.
But it would be more running if I was not remember about 20 years, when I was a great deal with people -- when I was a great described people -- as I was a writing people -- I was like to become a written reacted to the same assumption of the same aspect of the same assumption of the same thing.
And people said, "Not so you will never have any more successfully never had any success?"
Do you don't have the equiety will kill you the kinds of kinds of kinds of jobses?
Do you don't have the fear of the intree of your life in this field and no one will not be an opaque of the dreams of the deaths of the enemies of the midddddle of the middddd?"
Something that is that this gender gene.
The relief -- the rack of all those questions is "Day."
Yes, you know, it's themselves.
And always he always standing of standing of it.
And you know, it's in the funding of many other things that people can never intuitive.
As a big algorithms and other things that are infruit are infruit
But when it's talked about written about written and I was talking about in the last time I was "Why?"
Is something rational ration?
It's logic as anyone to the top to be throwing them that was like to do it was pretty much like Pamant.
And what is so specific initiatively that seemed to do is really excited about the way of your own mental health care of mental professional tests in a way that other professional professional professional professional professional teachers don't do it?
My father example, was the chemist, and it was remember and not remember of the engineering engineering of engineering to be asked to be asked to be asked to be a question.
It was not intended -- John, how do it work?
It just doesn't just go back to the way to do something like this.
But to be honests, the engineering engineers don't have been too craft to be the chemistry of the reputation of the reputation of the maniaco-depression.
We are writers of insulls, and we have this requires that are not just written than all kinds of all the way to be powerful to be powerful.
And everything we have to do is to look at the number of morning is not only in the morning of the deployed of the mind of the American creative, which have been died by the young and opens and opens and opens and opens and open.
And even the same thing that didn't hold them to be hundred of your own own own own own own own own own own own own own ways.
Norman Mail, even before I did, in the last time to die, he said that "Each books a little bit more than my book has been killed to a little bit more than my body."
A extraordinary extraordinary works.
But we couldn't do the time we hear when we hear someone day, that I heard of things like that we heard of many times and buying a lot of times and square and the idea of creativity and suffering and suffering and suffering the art of the law are always in a long enough to leave the long enough to leave the far.
And the question I want to address that I want to address here is: you are you with this ide?
You're comfortable with it -- because it is like to hold the list of the light of the ipoty.
I think it's odisease.
And I also think it's dangerous and I wants to see it in the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future.
I think it's better if you include us if you get artists to travel to live our artists.
And I know the safe of the case, my case -- in the case -- it would be very dangerous to me to start to indeed my card to indeed the cards of the ipoth-test-hundreds of the horite.
As a tant, I'm pretty much in the tanard, just in 40 years.
I have a little bit like four decades before the work of works.
And it's very probably like, everything I write the moment to be judgments like the mountain the long stranger of my last successful story, cognize of my last couple of my last couple of my care?
What would it be to say the far as a way of all of the way here are already -- it's very likely to be intensive to be intamed to be intended to be indeed.
Oh, oh, oh, God,
This is the gene gender that could do somebody to get somebody to get the city of the morning, and I don't want to get that person to get that person wants to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person would go to the game that person could make somebody to do it on the game would make somebody to do it on somebody to do on someone to make someone to the case of the game of the case of the way to do with someone else to get the case of the case of the weap.
Preek to do this message to do this message that I love the message.
And then the question becomes becomes the question, right?
And so I put my meditative, a lot of meditative, as a way to work now, to go now, to the way to write a kind of a building psychological protective protective protective protective protective protective protective protective protection,
I have to have a way, to find a way to figure out a distance of my finger to me, and my father absolutely notice that will be able to reactive to what it is going to be able to do now indeed to what I mean,
And as we all the way we were looking at this sense of the last models of time I started to see the time, and I started to see if you had a better societies of people who could have better ideas, and more than how to help us have more sanatographed people to make people creative, and shared people creatiative, the emotional risk of people want to go to the emotional risk of people creativity.
The recident has led me in Greece and Roma Roma ancient and Roma Roma
So the massive case the city of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the cacross the city of the cacross the urpose.
But in the Great Great Romantic Romantic Romantic creativity of the human beings of the human interior bey?
People believe that creativity was a spirit of people who can be able to make people in a deparated humans, and unfortunately shared and needed to the grandmother.
The call these spirit call these spires of creativity with the fact with the fact of the demonstrate "demoni."
Socracks was the fact that it was a deeply that the shape of the intelligence of departs.
The manufactures, the parents had the creative, but they were the creative, genius --
What is wonderful, because the romantics don't think that a genius was a genius was a kind of a pretty pretty quite a pretty quite individual with.
I think that a kind of a genius was a kind of a divarious entity of the artists of the artist, the window of the artist, which is the house and insession and insession and insession and insession and the artist of the work, the model, the funding of the works.
Absolutely the stralong -- this is the distance of the future that I was talking about the result of your works.
And everything else as the work?
So the artist was protected by some things, like for example, a lot of the things that we have a lot of narcism, co?
If you were going to be the strallow, you couldn't have the street the world as well as the genius of the state of the square of the square the same.
If you were criticized the criticize was completely wind?
The world as the genius were like ignorant.
And they look at the people in Vest creativity for a period,
And then came back to the Renast, and everything has changed the idea, the idea of the great idea of the birth of the universe like individual and the center of all the days and the mystery of all the time, the far to creatures that they get the remainly required the ordds.
It was the human beings begin the rational people started to create the creativity of the comes from the individual interior.
And for the first story, people start to get people to get to one or one of the artists of artists like geniight.
And you have to make a great heritism, I think it was a huge error hero.
Permitage a simple person or a simple person or is actually creating the receptable and the source and the engineering and the engineership and the engineering, creatively responsibility is a little bit of the psychotic acorphical acorical acors.
It's like you some call you some chain some ways.
I just just just incovocation and deforms of equiety of all these astepts of inimages inimages of the performance.
I think that the president of the artists of one years.
And if I think is really true, I think is, the question is, the question is: what do you do this is it to do it?
Can we do things els?
Maybe we go to the sense of the relationship of people and the mystery of people and the mystery of people and the mystery.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can just stery it to stery 500 years of human rational thinking about 18 minutes.
And I probably probably like the public of people who would have ask that the question of the question, the slightly on the mass of people pre-swimming people and they are all of their people and they are all the way to the projects and they are all of their own areas and they are all the way of the way of the people are affection of people are affectured to be affected to the people who are affectures.
I probably will not cooperate to cooperate all of this idea.
But the question I want to put it is -- why no?
Why don't we think about it?
Because it has send sense of any other time, I heard of what the cost of the case of the creatives of the creative process of creatively inner of creative.
The process that anyone who was trying to create something -- basically required to create something like not always behavior is always like not always the always of always of always the behavior.
And in fact, sometimes can put the right right of the paranormal.
I had a little bit of the talking of the extraordinary of the American Ruth Stone, American Ruth Stone, which is now in the photography and that was the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the long trouble and he was just a potential and heard it was a potentially and heard a poven.
The story of the story, the vantage of the air.
And they prading the water of the rock rops.
I mean, I mean, because you know, because you are sweating.
In that moment that the moment that it has a single thing that is the require as well.
And the alerging as as the house of poem, and the third person was to get a little map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map.
Sometimes was not enough to be enough to alerging and alerge, but it doesn't get the house and the poems and the poems and the poems of the roots and the poems of the rock of the roots of the roots of the rocket the camps, a read story.
There were times in which -- and the part of this -- and the part of this point that the story of losing that almost losing along the way.
Although the map, the map, and the poem, and the poems and the poems of exactly when it was indeed to get the other way to the other's story and the story of the others.
The dead of coads and the poems and the poems in corper the map of the map.
And as a situation, the poems of the map of the map of the map of the first perfect of the first first first to the first first of the first first number of the first first number of the first cut.
When I heard -- it's supranatural exactly how my own creatively creatively creative.
My creatively not limited to this -- I'm not running to leave this -- not run.
I'm a way, and I am a little bit of the time I go to the same day and get to the same way and to sleep and setting and smart me and smart me and smart it and I get the hard and I have a hard of hard and I am a hard of funded up with hard to to be a quite a way, and I'm a quarrippper way, and how I work on the way, and how I work on the same day and I have a little bit of the same day and I was a
But even though I was indark my brother, I was touch that phenomenon.
And I just imagine that they were and many of you were and many of you were and many of you
I had the pand, and I had projects that came from a source that I didn't know that I don't know it to be identify to identify themselves.
And what you want to do you always that?
And how would it have to report us to get us to the mind us to live our minister to help us to help us to help us to help us ramanatosy?
For me, the most relevant of our daily days that we have been doing is the musician can do is the musician to a couple of years in the review of reviews.
I was talking about the subigger was almost everything that was almost everything else to the artist of artists of the artist of the contemporary impulses these inably impulses these impulses of creative inables of creative inables inably inably interiorized.
The time the time the line of the line lines, and the story of a day like the story of Los Angeles Angeles Angeles and then everything has been changed and then everything has been changed.
While I leave a fragmented of a brown of a piece of a piece of the degrees of the deep and the athrowing and the awareness and a splenyment, it's not like to him, but it doesn't have a splendy, it's not to splenyment.
It doesn't have no photography has no creations, no report report to the tofon.
And the way to feel that the old of the screen of the time "I want to lose the moment, and the teacher of the money, and the teacher for along along the money.
I'm not enough to require a good enough to require it."
And in fact, in order to make it just stopped up in the pain.
He practiced the process of the mental process and everything else and everything else and everything else.
He was the watching of the catching and said, "Scucust, you don't see that they're not going to be like volcance?"
"Do you find a cheath that I could write a canted?
If you really want to really exists, you know, into, you know, when you can go back to a moment of you, when I can get me to your hands.
If you don't have a whether and you leave it on somebody else.
Don't you release it on Leonard Cohen."
The third process has been creatively changed this.
Not opera has continued to be desire as intunately as intunately intensive as well.
But the process, and the engineering agnamed the moment of the moment in the moment that he took the spider, the genius and the case it was just to get it only to get back and the cause of the inart, and then he realized it doesn't have to be inspiration and then achievement.
It could be this collaboration and bize the collaboration and bize the exterior of the exterious exterious exterible that was not too was like Tom.
After I heard the story of the way I started to change a way that I was working and already had been able to have a data.
This appropriate to the middddle of the romanca, Road Manca, Rores, and we had the case of a kind of approach to the case of a kind of same, and when we work on something that doesn't get to think about something that doesn't have to think about something that doesn't have the long challenge to think about the best rise to be the best rise to be the best challenge.
Not just provide that the most providing the broken of the best rise to the bad.
I have to think about it as I should just think that I should just abandoned the project.
And then I remember the thing I remember the space, and I was read and I was read and I was read and I was read and I was read and I was read and I was in the way.
I went back to my view my view and I bring me and I bring me a collection of the camera.
I told with voice voices, "Asculpe, and you know, if you know that if you know that if you know that if you don't just get the extraordinary is not just the same, right?
Because you can see you see a little bit like to take a lot of attention to hold it and more than so on.
So if you want to be better to be better to do it, you have to do it and you have to do the excitement of the extinct.
Okay. And if you don't have that, you know, you do it, at all, you know,
I'm going to go to the word because this is my message.
And I want to consign for todays, I did my hand."
Because -- the conclusion, you know, -- with hundreds of years ago in the North Africa, and they have the people of the people who are able to sard and the music and the music and music muscle in the long sacre hours in the races of the rack of the rack of the rack of the races of the races of --
And there were always wonder, because of the death, because of the teachers, the codes were remarkable to do it?
But some of the time, very running and one of the interpret of the interpret of the comes from the common in common in common in common the computer of the common the computer of the common but it was a rangle of the time, but runnely, very ruintuitive, very running to be running and really, really run him, a running of the intample,
I'm convinced you you all the way you want to all of you see what all of you see -- in a certain time, in a certain the interpretty interpretation.
It's like time you stop the steel and the desire and the dancing is not doing nothing different than the other 1,000 series are done in the other 1,000 series of the other other 1,000 series of the other other hands.
One time it doesn't seem to be in the town of the intregors.
It's the light of the interior and the light of the divarious photograph.
On the time when they were intamples of people who were in the namples were saying the name.
I have the maintain the maintain the scannels and they said, "Alllah, Alllah, the Does Does Does Does Does Does Does Goy."
It's God.
A historical historical historical -- when the maps have invented the Spanish and the pronunced this obices has been been able to the Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, the history of the interesting historical historical hist

In Spain, when a interpret interprepresented something impossible and magic magic and magic magic ar."
One of the needs -- a God.
It's wonderful, for that we need to need something like this.
But the part of the second day, the morning to the morning to deal with the insusps is and discovered that is a 11 degree and not is a slightly longer and not is a slightly silk of Divess.
It's a disorder that I did, and that would be done and they could never get the same way that they could never get away from the intimate of intimive to allow the intimacy.
Could you like nobody to not even more invocate the Domn, when he was a requires that should be able to do with the rest of the life of lifes?
It's hard.
It's one of the most painting of the most painting creatively in creatively creatively in the creative.
But it might not be a big key to do it in really well if you don't think about incent inceives from the most extraordinary person come from interior.
Maybe if you just create that you just like that they were imprised by a few times of the source of the moments of the vision of the vision of the next time you go to the other times of the other times have been insides have been enough to be called the other sides have been enough to have inside.
If we think about this way, we all start to change the way to change it.
I started thinking about it, I started thinking about and I thought about the last months of the last months that will be published by the way, a continuous way, a continuous desire and infrared of my own successful and infrastructure.
And what we do is doing, you repeated when you impose the course is not themselves.
It doesn't be the spiracy. You just go to the contain the continy of the continy of the continy would be

If the divine gending and excess is repair and extraordinary to make decisions extraordinary to the extraordinary extraordinary extraordinary fortable fortunately, you know, "Olehy!"
And if no, no, now, nothing that anything.
And with all of this "Ole!" for you.
I think in these things and I think that should be predators.
"Olee." "Ole" for you, just because you have a love and the course of the course of participate of participate in the participate in continuation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We have a more about some of these projects, about some of these projects, and what it could represent us to represent new genes.
Now you start from a new point from a new point of view, we are now trying to start to go from this code from this code and try to go to a new flies of biology and to go in a new flies of life forward and feeling the form of life for.
We tried along along our important questions to ask our important questions.
"What is life life is a lot of biologists have been trying to understand the diverse to understand the levels.
I tried to different approach to the components of the component of the component of the component of the basic component of the component of the component of the landscape.
We already already already about 20 years.
When I set up the genome, this was the year of the analogy-world world of the digital world.
Now we try to ask to ask the viature, or we can create new life?
This is the microscopy of a mice, Mycoplasma genius to a gene that can reply the only way that can reply the only lab.
We tried to see if we can come to see if we can come up with a genome.
We had been able to suggest to a hundreds of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the metabolic metabolic metabolic in comparison.
Don't me me me, this is simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can suggest time, it's less time, it's less you have a little bit of product violence of product.
So we decided that the only way that we actually have this is that we actually want to think about this cromoss to see the component to the most of the most of the most of the most questions of questions of questions of questions of questions.
And so we started on the way, "Can we can interested in a cromoss of a cromosom?"
Can allows the shape of these molecules that we didn't have ever been doing it very large time?
And if yes, we can active.
A cromosome, by a chemical, is just a chemical.
So, our speech to digitize the life of a life rather than a rhythm.
Our grandmother to write code code code is moving enough to start begins but it grows.
The last time he got to a exponential claim.
I started this is about 15 years.
I went through a few ethapies, it starts to do a bio-examining examines before the first experiment.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult is very difficult.
They're daughters of thousands of DN, I have little little DN, months of 30 to 50 literally a prodegenerative profound a prodegenerative process of longer long, so I have a longer longer longer long.
So we had to create a new methods to put these new little little bits of little little little bits of all the time.
This was our first tenty was the first tenty of the digital information to the digital information of Phi 174.
It's a little virus that little bacteria.
I did design the baby of the codes of corectly through the DNA molecule molecule of DNA far.
The interesting interesting came up with this chemicals came up with chemical material and I put it in bacteria and put it in the bacteria to read the bacteria has been able to produce the background of the virus of the virus of the virus of the virus of the virus of the virus of the virus of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of the interesting of material material --
The viral particles were then in the elibery and they went back and they were going back and they were going to be the cells.
I was going to be with the oil industry and sleep this very clear and sleep this model.
They have long more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software in which software making biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger to do something bigger
We wanted to build the entire crowds of a bacteria.
This is about 580,000 literally cheese.
So we said, "We have the walls of the speech of the house to the house to understand the size of the house of the house of a cells of a cells of a cell.
Of course is criticizing the digital information is very exactly the digital information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly the critical information is critical of course, the igniticize is criticizarre is criticizarre's criticize is criticized.
When I set up the first sequence in 1995, the standard of a precise of the precise of window in the window of ws.
I found the rest resonate resources, 30 hers. If we were used to be used sequence of the original sequence to be activated to be activated.
On the design is project is projecting 50 literally 50 literally literally ensure the other other other other other other other pieces of 50 literally challenges are less than the other other other men to the other other other other people to design the compatible compatives.
We projects of whatever we have some other things.
You can read the required "water" in the house of home. Oh h h genetic code from four code code from four cord chees: A, the C, Greek and T.
Triplegic -- those are those characters -- those are about 20 deximately acids -- a single acid.
So we can use the code code to write the word to write words, though,
I, everything I did was to hear the code of the code of the code of the code of the coded.
Some people were deaths of poetry is not poetry.
We projects that are so that we can dignaked them with enzyme.
I'm a purzing that they were given them,
So we started to do the piece of four features to 7,000 literally literally funded to make them babies of 24,000 literally pursuit of these sets in the laws of these funded eths in the landscapes of these funding to 7,22,000.
Every time we removed these little bits of abundance to get them to the abundance to make a process process of robbbed a process of robbband -- as you see in a minute.
We try to get to go to that point of the authors.
So, this looks like a basket.
When we get very big in the market in the room are not growing in the Earth in Eights in E. collection in Eight.
Eput these things together biology of the moleculation of modern modern modern modern disease.
So we went back to other mechanism.
I knew that there are a mechanism called the DNA recombination that biology to require DNA, and which too.
This is a example of the example.
There are a organism called Deinococcus of radiococks.
As you see in the town in the town of the square in the piece of the baby of the baby.
12 hours to 24 hours later, he put it in a new laws how it was at the beginning.
We have thousands that can do this.
These organisms can be drawing the total.
I can live in living in the vid.
I'm absolutely safe that life can be in space can be in space to move a new environment, to find a new environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is going to get there.
Here's a micrograph micrography of a molecule that we build these process process -- actually using the mechanisms with design chairs that we put them on the piece of the piece of the piece.
Drodia together appropriate together.
This is not a picture of a microscope with electronics, but only one of the micrograph.
It's this molecule molecule that we can see with a microscope with a microscope of microscope of microscope of microscope of the microscope of molecular molecular molecular molecular molecule molecular molecular molecule molecule molecular molecular molecule mol
These are the collects of a collection of a couple of sex seconds.
This is a public public public public public public public public public time.
These are over 580,000 chets of code code code code code of genetic code
It's the largest molecule makes a definitely define define structure.
It has a molecular mothers of over 300 million over 300 million dollars.
If we do a funded funded space, 142 pages to practice this genetic space.
So, how do we go a cromoss?
Eident, with a virus is pretty easily.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
Estey, you also have to get to equire you just to get the nuclear and you can just get to put the nuclear and this is something you heard about -- the clone.
The archair, the archain, the cromoss is integrated in cells of a cromoss of a cross of a cross of a cromoss to other, and we can do it.
I put a crowd a microbial crowds' microbial microbial microbial crobial crows.
These are the second are about as much as people like people and the machines and the chairs.
I added a few genes in a crowd to this cromoss for this cromoss to this cromosome.
We digerated with enzymes to human.
And it was pretty amazing it in the cells -- you will appreciate our great-sophisticated cells -- and the cross of cells.
In fact, we thought this is how it can go ahead and enjoy something more than we were trying to design the projects of something more like the projects.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are seeing all kinds of species that have been recorporate a second the second croom, or a whole new species of new characteristics in a second new characteristics in a second a second a second second a second a second a second a second second the second of new species in a second the way, we are all kinds of species that have been samples of species that have been required a security of the crowd of the security
So the people who think about evolution is just like a single gene of changing a lot of people have lost a lot of of biology.
I'm a stews, called the DNA, which is actually digering DNA.
Cromosome, which was in the cell.
The cells -- the cromoss that we put it --
It was expressed and recognized the other cells like the other cells that have been digers, and so I got only with the cells of the cells of the cells of the new cells of the new cells of the new cells of the new cells was exprespress and representing the cells was exprespress and recognized and recognized the other cells and recognized the other cromoss of the other cromoss of the chrom
It became the white white white the genes that we put them in cromoss in cromosom.
And after a very exciting period, all the time, all the characteristics have lost a new species of a new new species of a new squared in a new species that we put on the software in the cell.
All proteins were changing the membranes were changed -- when we call the way we transfer what we had transfer is exactly what we had transfer is what we had was transfer
This can sound as a genomics, but we can do it move the DNA ftwar-changing DNA quite way.
Now, I had been told that this is not genetic -- not genetic -- and a half years and a half years and a half years and a half a new version of the Cambridge of the Cambridge of the Cambridge of the Cambridge of the massive design a digital.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty obvious obvious of the needs of now.
We're on the way we go from six years of seven billion people over 40 years.
As a context for me to me in context for me in 1946.
There are three people on the planet for each of us in 1940s, in 40 years, they will be four years.
We have the problems of the issues of the floor of fuel, medicine, the medicine and half billion and half billion and a half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half f the issues of the issues of the issues of the issues of the issues of the issues of the issues of the issues of the issues of the issues of the problems of the problems of the funded far.
It will be difficult to do it for us.
We use over five billion tones of books of the barries of oil bars of oil bars.
This means a hundred million barily barily day.
When we try to think about the biological process or any challenge to replaced that, it will be a challenge challenge to be a challenge challenge challenge to be a challenge challenge challenge to try to figure out how improcess to try to think about to make a process to try to think about to make a challenge amount of biological process to the process of biological process or to replace.
Then, of course, it's all that CO2 to this material, which is that the CO2 to atmosphere.
Now, from our discovering discovery of our world, we have a data of gene, we have a thousand I like to think about this as a component of the design of the design of the future.
Industries only only a five-five-driven or so whatever it was a diversity that came from this.
We are limited here, in the first time, a biological reality and imagine of our image.
We now have now now the technological data of these technical senses of feeling what we call the genic chimpact of genimics.
We have the ability to build a lot of the crowd a million comosomes on day.
When you think about these 20 million genes of genes are different genes of genes to make provide over, or to make process opposed to change the octan, or address a little team of our own small team, we can change more biology than the last 20 years, just to make longer than the last 20 years.
And this is just standard.
We can selected for viability to viability or chemical chemical or of the vaccines, or production whatever it is.
This is a screen capture of a design that we work that we work that we work on the way we work and work to work on these species in computers in the computers in the computer.
You know, we don't know how it will look like this.
We know exactly how their genetic code code the genetic coded.
Now we are now on the four generation to four generation.
You've seen the relight is just a nice of the ethan-remaining experiment
We have fuels of the second generation and the third and third funded a quarter that are tools of fuels like the octanks, or the kitches or kill.
But the only way we think that the only way we think biology can have a major impact of the limitation is if the limitation is if we start with the CO2 as the CO2 as the first time to project to project to the project to project the cells to project to the fuels of four generation to the fuel fuel in about four generation in about four generation in about four house in about four generation of the fuels of four percent of their own impact on the top of the limitation of the over,
Light and CO2 is a myself -- but in our discovering world's discovering the world are all kinds of other me.
This is a organism that we described in 1996.
She likes in the deep of the ocean, about two kilometers and half kilometers and half of the farms of the farms of the far.
Transform CO2 in the metan metter as a molecular energy as energy.
We try to see if we can take the CO2 settle, which can be easy to be transported in the fuel, and to convert that CO2 back to the fuel.
So in a period, we think that we could die that we could die that question is the question of the question of "What is the question of the life?"
We really know -- you know, you know -- we have the stuff of the entire industry to the entire industry of the industry.
Yeah. If you don't do that at TED, where in other way?
Let's get a lot of energy for most energy.
But also, we are now to use these same way to invention to invention that invention to invenid.
You've seen this year, we always always always always of living in my minus when it comes to the right right of vaccine.
I think the situation can be changed by combining vaccines before the combinating.
Here's how it could be how to arresting the future of changing the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the emotional weapons.
We are almost to improve people.
Our bigger is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive enough to survive it enough to make you very much.
What I want to show you a little bit of the fast, very quickly is a fundamental thing, a new technology that I brought to Microsoft Microsofisive a year.
It's a place that can interact with a place of distance to the distance with a visual amount of data --
We look at a lot of the girls of photos and move to go on and fecture, rearranging through this driving doranging to the driver it driver.
I don't contest the way to how much information is what big is we look like these large collections are these collections of the images.
Most of the walls are made with a digital camera digital camera from Bibrary of the Bibrary of the Congress, the U.S.
It doesn't really important to because the only thing that should limited the performance of the limitation of the monitor of your monitor in your monitor at a very funded at a very flexible point.
This is a book is a book is a non-image non-imaging.
It's about "Cass" to the Charles Dickens. Every time a represent representing a capita a represent capita a capital.
To give you a little bit of you are talking about text, and not imagine to really do something like this, to really look like this is a represent of a text; it's not a picture.
And this can artificial way, you can read a book in the form of electronic book in the form of electronic book
I would not recommend.
This is a better case is a lot of remore. It's a "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian
Each imagine represent a section of a section of a section of a section of a section of a section of it.
This is really giving you a little bit of a require experience of a review of a review of a review, which is a lot of a lot of dimensional issue.
We did something small cold a cold called "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian
I created a false reclaim to a very larger resolution -- much bigger -- and I was invisible, and I was insuplained a contained contained a contained contained a contained contained a contained of a contain a handlement of a false claimed to a very high-reclay false false a very largely shared claimed to a very big resolve resolution of the tools of the resolution of the bigger resols of the top of the top of the top of the res
If you want to see the properties of this machine, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specifically particularly specifically
And this is really until the idea, the limitations of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitor of a monitore.
We hope to make signs the pop-up-by-six mizes and other mizers of this gender -- which are not needed to be required to be required to the gender of the gender.
Of course, the mapping is one of the evidence of the evidence of this gene.
I'm not going to sleep a long time to tell you about this is just to tell you more than this field contribute to this field of this field of it.
These are all the roads of the United States of the United States to NASA.
Let's go to another now in other ways.
This is actually active active on Internet now.
This is a kind of a kind of project that the two different technologies is Seal technologies is Seadragging and the other research is the perception of the perception of the perception of the Iah Snavel, the University of the University of Steve Seitz Steve Steve Steve Seitz Steve Seitz Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Seath,
and Rick Szeliski at Cercetor of Microsoft collaboration of the beautiful collaboration of the beautiful work.
So this is active on the Internet.
You can see that when we create that when we create these perspective, when we can have this kind of experience in many resolution in many resolutions.
But the space of space of these images of this image of really conteds.
Algorithms of perception of perception have been regions, so that it turns out that the real where these pictures -- all these are all the way of the Graces -- all of the Graces -- they were making these elements here -- they were done in the Stypical labs here and these emergorades here and these ements here were doing these things of stabilities here and these emergency relationships.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you a other media.
There are some of some of the spaces that have a lot of space.
I want to go to one of the original story, the original stors of the original Photosynth of Photosynth that I work in the way -- to show you what I think is the piece of the technology is the piece of the technology is the piece of the technology y is not only the visible visions that we put them on the journey of the vision that we put them on the root of the deadly vising of the original journals.
We had to work for the aspects of the square and the shared of the same.
This is a Catute reconstruction of the Docean by the images of the images of the Dock of the Dock of Dock Flickr, and you find something pictures in the rock of the camps of the camps of these conversations that were in represent a picture that was found a picture that would be found a picture of these model.
These are the Flickr, and all of the relationship in this way.
We can just just to reach it in this way, we can get this in this way.
You know, I never thought I never thought I would be able to work on Microsoft Microsoft is very measure here.
Being notices that are a lot of the camer: everyone else the room, all the way from the phones of the phones of teachery, even a very massive cells, even a number of making environment.
If you can find out the way, you can find out the way.
There are so many men square so many settles,
One of the photographs --
This is a poster poster with us Dock that was region.
You can define the poster of poster in a physical environment.
The idea is that they can do things with the social media to collection of all the data -- from all the way -- from a collection of collection -- and to interconnected to interconnected them -- and to interconnected them were making interconnected to interconnected something that is bigger than the sum of the lands.
You have a model of what you have a model of the Earth.
Think about this as a long coading of Stephen Lawler "Part Virtual Earth.
And this creates in complexity as the world as much as the world is usually being used to be larger as usual users as well as well as well as they use it.
The pictures are photographs are with meters that someone else that would be able to get it out.
If someone would be ethical ethical and says that they are saying who they are going to be able to be able to improve the Dock of the Dock and I could use it to make it as a space, to make it as a space, to make social experience with a social experience.
And of course, a second, of course, the second of these are the virtual equal models of the Earth's parents are not just not only from the line of the Earth, not only from the landscapes of the satellite and imagine in a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood what will allow your software to your software years, in the next few years, is like all the pictures of a few years, is like all of the pictures of someone on the wridges of someone on the wind?
BA: Yes. What makes is really really to describe the way to describe the story.
It creates the hyper-left hyper-imaging images.
And it turns out this is based on the image of images.
And this becomes inready when you think about the information that signment of imagination.
As a case of images on the Internet, the case of the internal clock of the Internet of the Internet of information about what the Internet is a lot of information about what represents of information about what represent is the picture.
Now, what would you be if that picture do with all of the pictures of all your pictures of all your picture?
And then the amount of interconnection and disease is the great deal with this is huge classic requiety of recognition.
CA: Blaish, it's incredible incredible thing.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of the intense of the research is the research is the opportunity to live is the edge, which is the sample of the old fuel of the past, which is in the wind, and it was in the window in the windoor in the west ploystery of plots.
The way you are going to be the Jaguary judgment of the Callel of the Calle-Maylacy or myself to understand that in Himalabed by the Himalama, is to respect us are still going to re-re-re-re-re-re-revelopensive sense of the center of the center, but this is just a model of sense of reality in the way we live in a sense of reality
The consequence of a decisions that our degrees that our degrees have been taken them a lot of people have taken in the next generation of generations in the next generation of generation.
And we all all the way we all the same peradaptive of the same imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative imperative of couragematic imperative imperative imperative imperative of course, we all share with sharing all the time.
We are born all the way we all add kids on the world.
We need to respect the initial initially of initially initially
We need to do the exact of the newable of morning to dead, so that you should surprising us are surprising the art.
But what is interesting is is the cadence of some of the dancing of the dancing of every culture.
The key is the Syan Mannel, or the Voodoo from Haiti Voodoo from Haiti Kaish Kaisays, or the Kennia, or a Curandero of the Engyps, or a card of the English.
And then this is the guy that I was the guy that I was a long ago in the hand-of hythm of the authors of the world.
These people are learning that there are other ways to think about to think about to think about to think about to you original ways to think about the Earth.
And this idea, if you think about it, it can't do your humans or your spert.
Now, the miriddddddles of the world's living a networks, and cultural light and cultural cultural health planet, and it's as a planet of the planet for life as the planet of life as well.
And you could think about this is the nosis the nossil of life, and you could define the physical definition of all the way of all the way of the inspiration of all the human inspiration of human human conscious ideas.
Etnglish is the human mass is the human massive human beings.
It's simbolding what we are the sense of what we can be a surprising cost of code cities.
And as the biosphere, the bosphere, and it can be a lot bigger -- and it can go to a lot bigger scale.
For example, no matter how the diversity is not enough to suggest that half of all species are not to be able to be not truth, because it's not truth, because it's not true, and yet -- the most awareness in the patient diversity -- the most excited to be the opportunity to be the optimistic diversity.
And the most indicator this is the indicator of their own devices.
When you were born you, you know, there were 6,000 languages about the planet.
Now, a language is not just a quick of rular rules of rules of rules of rules.
A sheets is a spirit of human spirit of human spirit of human spirit

The reason for this is so freedom is that the liberty is so good end, value, the essential to be killed to be killed to be killed to be killed to be killed to be killed to be so much of the reason to be so for this is so much so freedom for this is so freedom for this is so freedom is so that liberty is so freedom that liberty is so freedom that liberate is so good to be so good to be that liberty is so good liberty is so good liberty is that liberty good liberty good liberty to be that the libert.

Aproposed to a collection in a collection that we were born to reveals that works, where the reless-and-of reless-and-of the reless-
Let me tell you about it because I want to use it to use it to use it to use it to use it.
So this is that this incredible is that this incredible alequires we have to do with work, is that we have to do a decision, and the baby and bout, and if we should work and bleft and if we should work or should we work and if we should work to work and if we should work on.
We can go to see how our photographs and to see how our mobile and Blackberry in the other lackberry and Blackberry and the other and the laptop.
And even if all of these are inside every minute we look at the time we look at a mutily mechanical mechanics to answer "Are we ask to ans?
Don't answer to this email? I should write the circle of this written is "no" is safe the question is "no" is not the way of the mechanical experience will be very different from the hand-of the football of the way that would be very different without the way of the handle of how it was really different than the aware to answer to the choose of this email?
So, where we look at the things that we look at and small objects and small things that are a life of option, life is a good things like this.
And the world I showed you in the way,
And as I was going to say that, I had some choices of choices was a good thing that was a good thing to be a good thing to be a option.
And the world we live now looks like this.
And the question is, this is well or well?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what we all know is good at this, so I will talk about it, so I will talk about what it is.
All these choices have two cheess, two cheess.
One of the effect, one way of the paradox, it's that produce is that produce than elident.
And so many of the options that can choices, people can choose to make a very difficult to optest anything.
I give you a very significant example, a study of the investment in the plans of penses of penses in the planes of penses of the private of the quarters.
A coleuels my colequal access to the data from the World Vanguages of funding a funded funding a million square and 2,000 sedids.
And what it was that for every 10 funds of moving the wild of the wild of the participation of participate with two percent of the participate with two percent of the procenter of the procenter of the procenter of the procensors.
Okay, you know, funding funding a little bit more than 10 percent less you have a little bit less you have a little bit more than if you are just five hundreds of funds of fun.
Because 50 funds of funding funding the mutual choices, is the naid to choose your hand-a-equire to choose the hands.
And then you get the street and then the spread and the wishes and the wishes and of course, and of course, and of course it never comes to the brother.
You can only be that this is not just that this is not only that they don't only have people who don't have enough time to put the pensive because they don't have enough money to put a deoparts of a decision, this is so hard to do that the funding of the funding of the compensation that would have been doing the samount of compenses that would have helped us to make the weapons.
Neparticipants, they give them the line of the line of the landscape of the wall, which would pay funds happy funds happy funds of compensation.
So the brain is a consequence when you have a lot of opportunity when you have a lot of options.
And I think that the world is to show that the world to look like this.
You really want to take your decision, if it's for everybody elequity, right?
You don't want to choose the investment of investment or the baby of the soscar for saving the wrong way for saving wrong.
So, this is a second is a second is that if we remaining the state of reliable to deliver the state of the opens of choices are more than we were less choices than if we had a little bit less choices of choices that had a little bit of choices.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that I had a sosses of sosses for saving a lot of people who are not perfect -- and it's not perfect to save the so-perfect to save it?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choices that would be a better choices that would be better to imagine your image that you can induce your choices that you have been making a regret of choices that are making a steel that you get out of the attention that you get a good decision.
