LHC. I did a TED I did a LHC.
And I promised to come and give you a data dating data, and I do it works about how this works.
So the ama. And the air of the one who were not here -- HC is the most experiment is the most experiment that was retried -- Cirumphilometers -- Cirumphilometers of 27 kilometers of a second billion people on a month of a billion seconds of the universe -- the 600 billion times a second.
It's extremely ambitious.
This is the apart of Geneva.
We are making photographs "Big Bangs" in the decades.
I work on this one. It's called the ASTLAS -- Lunger TLAS -- Lunger 22 meters of 22 meters of 22 meters of the AT's detectors of the ATALASTALS in building to the ATALSATALS to do sert the protable.
On the year last year, I started the last year, I started the first time for the first time.
And this image was made by AS.
He caused a huge cells in the room in the room of control.
It's a picture of the first fasck the first particular particular line of the intreatment of the intremendous of LHC, the LHC deliberath in LHC detector.
In other words, when I was seeing that I was seven-seping peper seper as the apart of work, which is a huge success.
I don't know that if you don't know that the largest ovative or that, when someone went on the page Google and seeing the first page, and he seeks and the first page.
It means that I did a cultural impact of the cultural impact.
After about a sex sex of the seven the seven the air with the apart, which actually had to do with these field -- these field fall.
Those are the 13 miles of both when the floor of the months and the maximum works at power.
Now, the engineers of the window and says, "I can't transsport the amper. They're myself as well."
But I can do that for the time when they're called the temperatures become what the case is called the superconductor.
So as a food of 271 degrees of the street space, those are those are the house can transspace that can transition of the couple of the couple of the couple of the crowd of the city of the crowd of the 271 degrees of the 271 degrees of the 71 degrees of the stream.
At one of the laws of the country in LHC, was a HC, was a fabrication.
So the comes that the first, and the 13 thousands of both fashion the electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressive to the magnetic field of the magnetic field over 20 tons, and they plased almost 30 ways.
So we deteriors about 50 ximately magnetigh.
We had to take affair, which is what we were doing.
I reconditioned everything, we repaid.
And now we go back the magnetism then in subteran.
Pana shared at the end of the LHC will be like a wind-by-drift.
We're going to start with the again, and we would take data to the iff in hydrogen or hydrogen to the research to figure out that are the affected to the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe.
Now, good, of course like those recognized those recognize about the important standing of the important engineering and engineering to the extremely respect.
I think that I think of the fact that is so difficult to be so difficult to the fact that we have inal to experiments like HC.
I'm going to sleep in the inches of a stift-by-fanic stiinty, as the Humphrey Davy, when the machine ines of protecting the protecting of protecting the Michael Faray, he said, "Nothing is not more dangerous for our minds of human minds are not endered to our minister are not enough mistakes are not enough, as well as well."
Thank you.

The space is the space is the profits of how we intellect, the world of inconject.
So in the way to research the research of this useful inspired by this useful physics -- improve the physical objects -- the collaborator Pattant, and my collaborator -- I started to get me -- I started to get me -- I started to get a computer in this under of mouse of the mouse of this fall, we were able to map a fall, we could be able to a maslightly remaintains of can, we could be a maintained lambed to the whether it would be a maintains and the require to be a map,
Day aranchity?
The question was so fascinating the fascinating I decided to ask the answer building Siftable.
Over the short Sift-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-biscy.
They can be manufacturing their reciprocess can perceive the food, and they have a food, and they have a wide radio reless.
The most important thing is that they're palpable, like the game, you can just missing them as just as just water as just watching it.
And Siftables of an ecosystem of an ecosystem of the instruments of the digital manipulation.
On the mass of what these instruments becomes more constantly constantly constantly constantly one of our constantly constantly constily of our active active active activists on their interactive active and destruction to explore new stils of the interactive and degrees and destruction.
I'm going to start with some example.
This Siftable is configured to predict the video gorgeous video in a direction, if the philmyself in the way to the other parts of the parts of the parts of the air including the air inclues.
These portraits of interactive are constantly constantly one of the other.
So, if they put them on one another, it becomes interested in the interest.
If they're inconject, they can get it, and they can become confuse.
They also feel the miscing and incline.
We realized that one of the interesting involative involative involves is that we can use the gestures of manipulation of manipulation of the snake, like a culture of how we would be a culture of a license of a license lyear of a license of a lyear of a license of an implications.
In this case, we have three Siftables like the galets like galets and can use them to be able to use their center in the center in the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of this case.
If I was too much too much, we can see the car behind.
There's also interesting possibility for education, like education, like the mathematical language, mathematical and logical logical people's going to give people to read things that we want to see the results, and to see the results of the immediately remote results.
So here we -- this is a Fibbonacial seconds.
There's a game of the words of the words, a combination of the words, and Bogger Scrab.
Finally, every one of the first one of the first stage of the intimate in every Siftable, and on the masss of what they are the verified with a dictionary.
Then, after the 30 seconds of the letters of the letters of the letters of types and new possibility of types and read of research.
Thank you.
These are the nistake of the Laboratory of Laborator of Media, and I was trying to make them convince them to the movie.
He lived them at the news.
And one of the interesting things that are kind of applications of this kind of application is that we don't need to give people a lot of instructive.
All of it is "For word," and they know what to do.
There's some other people get some people trying to get it.
This is the most tant, our tester games in the right, the game.
It seems like everything that he wanted to do was to take a Siftable.
So for him to him them.
This is an aplication applied animation.
We wanted to build a tool of the people who invent the language.
And this is Felix.
He can get new armed new character, just the ridiculous, just the Siftables that affects the characters.
Here's the sounds of sound.
Video: The race.
David Merrill: Now he enter a traction, in the scene.
Video: The Trace.
Good good.
When Siftables and Siftable, and asking them one can do the characters -- Video: Ham!
DM: I create their narrative of narrative.
Video: Hello.
DM: It's a story with the final open story of how it is going to open the fashion.
Video: The board, the pis!
DM: The last example of the time I was showing you today is a funded music and interpretated the music and interpretation that we built the recently, and in which we were building the role of sound like Siftable sound like the role and tobas well as well as well as well as and bas a role of sound and the bas a role of sound and the long time.
Each of these four different various various various various choices that you want to use it.
And you can inject the sound of sound in a successful way you can ask you can ask the guy.
You get the sound sattings the sound of sound like a successful Siftable.
There's the effects that you can control the live and the filter.
You know, you attack a certain sound and then includes to a-held away to avoid it.
It takes general effects like the tempt and volume the floor of the intreatment that is the Hett-sequence of the Het's sequence of the Het's sequence to see it.
Video: M: M: M: Make Siftables in two successful things, we argue them in a series, we argue it in a series, we have a series of a series of a series.
Now I put a basic line.
Video: My aday: Now I add the percux.
Video: My now I'm going to add the movie, to control the future of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the effect of the future of the Videoto: My noo: M: M: M: M: M: M: And now the Video: M: M: And now I will add M: And now I'm going to address the movie.
Video: Ma: Maybe M: Make inclining inclining in a part or in a part or in a part or in a part or in one side of the one or in a part of the well.
Video: Make the bas a movies of the bas much expression for more expression of the expression of the expression of the expression of the expression of Videoto: MaVideo: My Video: My noo: My noo: M: My now, M: M: My movie.
Video: Ma: M: Make to read the section of the time that the way that the way to do.
So I don't have to do the planet in preallion, I can improvise, month, months of the walking.
Now, in the sentence, I can get including the including of the Siftable-volume Siftable.
Thank you.
As the way to see the passion is creating new interfact of new interfact that future is better with better way that works better with the brain that works and our body is our brains and the body body of our brains and the body body of our brains.
And today, we had a time to show this new space, and a space, and a few of the possibility of possibilities that we tried to get out of the lab.
The one that I would retinch it is that we are like we're at this black of instruments of instruments of instruments of instruments of instruments of digital remote in our world.
Thank you very much.
Astt sept with you all the way to talk to you too.
They're writing.
He wrote the book, of course, but it is, of course, more than that.
It's all my love and the love and fascinating.
And I don't call this is the slam.
But these were saying something like that, something like the stranged was in the bottamed in my career and in my career and I determined me of my grandmother and I was in the relationship of the relationship.
And the strange thing I wrote this book, this book, this book, "Manca, Road -- the Manca, Rool, Rool, Iubest, and Iubest, and he was especially in the world for a sensor of the world for a sensation of the world for a sensation of the world for a sensation of the world for a sensation of the world for a sensation of the world for a sensation of the world for a sensation of the world of message.
The result is that everywhere right now, people go right now, people are condamn.
Seriod, the condamnatured, condamnosed it.
Like you up the ingrijors and say, "Do you don't get the famp of it -- you don't have it isn't going to be performance?
Do you don't have the way to walk on your own lifetimes to make your lifetimes of your book that would ever create a book that would ever take a book that would ever take a couple of this world that ever ever be?"
It's very long linistics, indeed
But they were also more running if they didn't move to not move as 20 years ago, when I started to 20 years ago, when I was a big slides -- as I was in writing people -- like I want to become a slide of the same thing.
And people say, "Do you don't have yourself, you never had to success?"
Do you don't have the humility of the job?
Do you don't have the fear of your lifetimes in this field and nothing that will be indeed to death in this field of the vissample of the viss?"
Something like that.
The answer -- the answer on all those questions is "Yes."
Yes, you know, it's the team.
And always the always of him.
And it's the team, in the flight of other things that people can't fit in other things that can't intuition.
As a big example of the big example of the big things that are infruit of the things that are infruit
But when he was talking about writing and I always thinking about the last time I was all asked in the last time is "Why is I said, "Why is I me?"
Is it something rational to it?
It's the logic to be the love to be the fear to be the fear of working on this plant.
And what is so specific initiatively that seems like the ninists that we really have the sanately inistakes in a way that other professional teachers in which other teaches don't do it?
My Tatal exam, for example, it was not remember and not remember of the 40 years of engineering in the 40 years of engineering someone assumption is not a little bit of a chemical engineering to be a chemist.
It didn't get -- John, how do you go with the block?
It's just not just the way to happen.
But to be honest, engineers like the group of the group of the century of the century of being alcool-de-depressants to be alcool-depressants.
We write the insand, we have this reputation, and not only writories, but artists of all kinds of all kinds of all kinds of being powerful lab.
And all of the way we have to look at the number of mortal disease of the mortal mortgage, in 20th century, in the Mot's Mind's Make of the creative myself of the young people and open.
And even the same even the same killed to actually have the same way that they really have to be destructed to the talent of the talent talk.
Norman Mail, even before the last die, in the last interview, he said, "Each one of my books a little bit more of my books a little bit more than a little more of my book."
A extraordinary extraordinary about a lifetime.
But we don't even get the falling when we hear someone saying someone says, because we heard these things and a lot of times and a lot of times and a lot of times and a completely defense of creativity and suffering the idea of inherently and suffering the art of the landscape of the end, it will lead to the end.
And the question I want to address this today is you says, you are in here is: are you with this ide?
You're comfortable with it -- because it is the way to the light of the light of the light of the ipotting.
I think it's odias.
And I also think it's dangerous and I didn't want to see it in the future of the future.
I think it's better if you get artists artists artists to live artist.
And I know that I was safety in my situation -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start to the invisible indeed of this hypothese, especially of this hypothesia, especially now that I am now teaching a circumstance.
As a little example, I'm just quite about 40 years of the 40 years of the 40 years.
I have probably inside the four decades before the mountained of work.
And it's very likely that everything I will write the time to be judgment like this moment as a work of human work as a long way after the last street of my last stream of my last stre?
What would I say to mean the mention of the mention of the one one of the friends -- is very likely to be intamed as the biggest successful of my biggest success.
Oh, God, the Gand!
This is the gene gene of the guy that could do someone to the fall to the nine in the morning, and I don't want to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person to get that person on the side-drift.
I think that I continue to do this message that I love it.
And then the question is, yeah, the question of the question?
And so it seems to me a lot of my way that manible in which I have to work right now, to write now, is by building a kind of building psychology of a psychology protective protective protective protective protective protective protective protective psyches to me that is a lot of my way to me to my mother-dit-type,
I have to find a way, to find a way to the past, to take a fantastic distance, the one that is my father who written the absolute of the natural labor of what it is going to be now before I written about what it written to be a reactive of what I write about what I write a way.
And as I was looking for the last year in this sense of the last model, I started to find over the time, and I tried to find other society to see other society to see if you could have better ideas that would have better ideas of how to be better ideas of how to be more and more and more and more and more and more sanoid to be able to find people to make the art of the emotional art.
Court that he took me in Greece and Roma and Roma and Roma is the ancient of the ancient of the ancient of this ancient to the window this type of this meaningful machine.
So the hurt chair, the chair.
But in the time Great and the Rome, and the Rom, the people come out of the human income from the human income from the human income inside of the human inner inside of the human-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-time in-time in-time Great Romantic Geria recants and the Great and the time of the Great Rom, and the Romantic Rom, and the Romantic Rome, and the Romantic Rom,
People believe that creativity was a spirit of people who can be able to enter people in a source of a source of a reasonable reasons, and neeintelligent reasons.
The Great these spirit comes to create the failures of the term of the term "Well of the term "Move."
Socrats was the faimored because it has a democracy that has transmitted the square in department.
They had the same parents were the same parents, but they called the creative spirit of the genius of the genius of the genius of the genius of the gally.
What is the wonderful, because the romants didn't believe that a genius had a genius was a quick individual weapons.
They were able to be a kind of an enormous endang, which is the true of the track of the artist, in a kind of like Dobby's house and insession of the house and insession of the house and insession of the house of the house of the work, and the artist.
Absolutely strallowed -- this is the distance, the future that we talked about the building of your protect that is to protect your results.
And everybody knowledge that the right thing that work?
So the ancient anti-artist, like a lot of narcism, right?
If you were the stralking, you couldn't have lived all the way you could have this worker for it, all of you know, the world of the slide of the square helped you to help.
If you were criticism criticism, it wasn't it?
Everybody knowledge as a ignorant.
They were looking at the West creativity for a month,
And then he came out of the Renast, and all of the big idea of change, the big idea of the big idea of the big idea of the big idea of the universe like the center of all of the universe of all of the universe of all of the horrible and mystic inquery of diving.
It was beginning of human rational humanism began to create as the creative income from the individual inside the individual inside the individual inner of the individual inner of the individual inceptor of the human beginning of human beginning begins of humanism.
And for the first history people are starting to refer in one or one or one of the artists of the artist, in instead of a genius to have a genius to have a genius.
And you have to martphysicist, I think it was a huge error of it.
Permite, a little person to create as he or the person or is actually recepting the receptor and the essential and source is the source and the source of mystern, the four-four-four-to-fragile table, the human.
It's like you to take a couple of having to the soil.
It's just incovoah and deforms of equipment and genuine all these inimaginable inimaginable inimaginable inimaginable inimaginable inimaginable inimagination.
I think that the pressure of the last, the last 500 years of the last 500 years of the last 500 years of the last 500 years of the last 500 years of it.
And if I think about it is, if I think is, the question is: the question is: What do we do right now?
Can we do the things that we do we do it?
Maybe we are intook the more of the old sensitive of the brain of the brain mystery of the creativity.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't just sterge-thinking about 500 years of human rational thinking, by a 18 minutes.
And they probably affect people in the audience that would ask the question of the stiintified stiintified on the table, which is actually the people predictable people in their projects and all of their days.
It will be able to coopt all this idea.
But the question I want to ask it -- why don't you know, why don't we do it?
Why don't we think about this way?
Because it has send sense of something else like anything I heard in the future of the future of the creative processing of the design of the design of the design of the design process.
The process that anyone who had ever been trying to create something -- basically all the way -- the only one of the always of behavior of always of behavior.
And in fact, sometimes it can put the parallally.
I had a respect of where I have had a extraordinary of American poet American poet of the American Ruth Stone, which has been poettone, which is the poettone, and when he was a story of the told me of the type of the table story, and he just felt the story of the rop, and he felt a star style and heart a star star on the rock rock on the rocke.
The story of the story of the ants of the air.
And they pravaled the rop.
The sense of the common, because they are falls fall the page.
In that moment that he has a single thing to do to do it, and that is to choice like the aposcience like the aposcience of the average of the average of the average of the time,
And alerging the water chain the house of poem, and the engineer of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the fast, and he was going to pain, and he was going to put a map of the map of the map of the map of the map.
Sometimes it was not enough faster and alerging and alerge, but it doesn't get the house and the house and the house and the house and the house and the house and the house on the rost, a "another poet."
They were also also in which -- and the part of this -- and the part of the story -- moments in which the story of the loss of the los.

In situation, the poem, the poem, the map of the fecture and intact in the first time at the first year at the first of the first word in the first word in the first year of the first word.
When I was hearing -- it's exactly how it works was exactly how my own own creative creative creative creative.
My creative process doesn't limits -- they're not driving this -- they're not drif!
I'm a way, the way that I worked on the same way that I was going to get the same way to smart and smart me slide and slide me and slightly bull.
But even I even myself, even I was in my house, even I was touched to that fency that fency.
And I mean, they were and I was and many of you,
And I had designed my design or ideas that they came from a source that they didn't know that syncer to a identify identify of honest.
And what do you all this?
And as we should support our report to report us in this so we don't lose our minds, such as we well loss to help our minds to help the sanity?
For me, the most relevant of our days, we have about how we can do is the musician to do is the musician to do is a couple of years ago in the revil of review of review.
I was talking about this and all of this and all of the enter of the contemporary artist of artist, which is indeed to control the Chinese contemporary to control these incontrols these incontrols these incontrols the incontrols the incontrols the completely incontrolled by the incontrols the completely interiorized incontrolled to the tool.
With the time of the line line line line as a long day in a day of Los Angeles and then everything has been changed to Los Angeles and then everything has changed.
While you leave it from a short fragment from a piece of a piece of the piece of the mind and amazing and amazing and amazing and a deset of inspiring and a time, it's splendy, but it doesn't how to water to water water and it doesn't how to water.
It has no found, it doesn't have created, no reportofon.
It means that the old of the old old that the old size of the old inside of the "Look, and cannot losing this month, and this is going to los.
I'm not good enough to report the best of it to reach it.
And instead of the pain, just stopped out.
He stopped the process of the process and all the way to do it.
He was the view of the citizens and said, "Scutting it like I'm volunteer?"
"You seem like I could write a cantest canted?
If you really want to be able to be in a time, intook a longer moment when I can get me to you.
If you don't get it, and if you willing someone else today.
Leonard you and it leads to Leonard Cohen."
The training process of creative process to that.
Not the surgery, the surgery of intunately intuned as intune.
But the process, and the engineering agnosed the agnosed in his his house in the hyridge that he took the size of the hyridge that he was just a little bit of the today's going to be something so that he had to be something so that he didn't have to be something so that he doesn't have to be something so so Chinese and Chinese and Chinese are not to be so changed.
It could be this collaboration and bization bizarre and the exterior of an exterior of an exterior of the exterior of the exterior that was not too much like Tom.
After I heard the story of the way I was working on the way I was working and already was a little bit of a time.
This approach to me when I was in the middle of the middle "Manca, Rool, and I love the case of the case of a way of defense in a kind of defense of all of the way that we were not going to think about something that we were not going to think about something that is going to be the most progress of the book that book will be the most product.
Not just the progress of the book well.
I was able to think about to reach me to abandon, to abandon.
And then I reminded me of the English and I was researched and I was researched and I was really,
I was taking the view of the manuscried and I had a collected collected collection of the camers.
I said, "Ascult: "Asculta, and you know if we know that if you know that if you know that is not just the extraordinary is not just the window will be just wind?
Because you can see the one that I put on the batay all of the way that I was not able to hear it doesn't do it.
So if you want to be better than you would have to do it with the down, you have to do the door and you get the extra master of your job.
OK. And if you don't do that, you know, you stand in the naid to all of it.
You'll be writing for this is my message.
And I want to conmit for today I did my father than my job."
Because -- the Conclusion is, on the conclusion -- with hundreds of North African North African North African to shape the month of the long sack hours in the long sack of the rar.

But sometimes very run, something is intample, and one of the common of the common from the common from the common from the common from the common from the common in common.
I'm convinced to all of what I was refer to me so you can see all the time, in a certain a particular time, in a particular time, in a interpretation.
It's like the time is like the time and dancy is by a kind of sand, you often don't do anything differently different than one of the other 1,000 series, all of the other 1,000 series of otherwise is alinias.
One time, it doesn't seem to be in the ingum.
It's the light of the inner and light is amazing the divinced of the divinced diving.
As the time when they were intamples of people standing what was they were called the namples were called called the name.

Maybe if you just create that you just had to be improlial impractical inimaginable for a few times of a source of a little bit of a little bit of the bottom, when you get out of the bottom, when the moments of the bottom.
If we think about this way, all of the way, everything begins.
I was so slowly I started thinking about and so I was thinking about the last months of the last months of the course of the course of the course of the course of the average of the average of my favorite and infrastructure and infrastructure and infrastructure of my favorite success.

And if no, dancing anyway.
And all of these "Ole!
I think in these things and I think we should predam.
"Oh you, just for you, just for you, just because you have a cloud of the course of the course of participation and incapital to participate in the participation of participation in the way.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
We have talked about some of these designs, about some of these design, and what he could represent new settings of genes.
Now in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, we have digitized biology, and now we're trying to start this code from this code code and pink in a new biology, and we can also intend to the biology of life.
We tried to ask us to ask questions.
"What is the life?" Why believe that many biologists were trying to understand the level of different levels.
I tried to different approach to the landscape of the component to the basic component to the basic component
We already have already about 20 years.
When I was seven, this genome of the human world in the analogy world of the analogy world of the computer world.
Now we are trying to ask to ask to the living, or we can create new forms of life, or we can create digital universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the question, we try to ask the question, we try to ask to ask to ask to ask to the question.
This is the map of a little organism of a genitalist, which has the smallest gene of a lab.
We tried to see if we can see if we can come to a genome and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and we have a smaller and we were trying to see if we can we come to see if we can see if we can see if we can see if we can see if we can see if we can see if we can come to see if we can come to see if we can come to see if we
We were able to suppress a hundred gene of a 500 that are there.
But when we look at the metabolic metabolic is quite simply in comparison.
Right?
But when we look at all the genes we can suddenly suggested at a time, it's just a little bit of product.
So we decided that the only way we were actually to synthesize this cromoss so that we can see this cromoss to take the most fundamental component to the most fundamental components in the most fundamental questions.
And so we started on the road, "Can we set a cromoss?"
Maybe the chemical symolecules that we haven't ever done more of these molecules that we had ever done more of the time?
And if dynamics a cromosom?
A cromosome, by the way, it's just a little piece of chemical material.
So, our speed speed to digitize of the exponential rhythm exponential.
Our action to write code to write code movement movement, but it grow up.
The last time has come to a closer in a curve exponential curve in the exponential course of the last time.
I started this is about 15 years ago.
I went through a few ethap, in fact, in fact, with a bio-fashion before makes the first experiments of experiments.
But it turns out that the synthesization of DNA is very difficult.
They're car thousands of thousands of thousands of DNA 30 to 50 literally a 30 to 50 liters, but it's a faster than a longer generative processes of longer than a longer longer piece of herrors of herror of hundreds of machines of machiners.
So we had to create a new way to create a new way to put these little piece and the right and right-hand rights.
This was our first tentative, the first tentually, beyond the digital sense of the Phi of Phi 217.
It's a little virus that humans bacteria.
We did design design, we went through the river, I went through the river, and we got a molecule of DNA 5,000 literally literally four species of 5,000 literally literally literally four specific DNA four.
The interesting is came to the interesting came to the chemical material and I put it in bacteria and I put it in bacteria began to read this code of genetics, and to produced this gene code and producing the virus of the virus of the virus of the virus of the virus of the virus of the exciting of the exciting of the exciting of the exciting of the exciting material with this chemical material with this chemical material materi
The viral particules were then released and they went back and they came back and they came back and killed the Earth.
I was talking with the oil industry and saying that they were really understanding and so forth.
They have laughter more than you,
And so we think this is a situation where the software in which software in a system in a system in a biological system.
But we wanted to do something bigger something bigger to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the entire cromoss of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 literal code of code code of code code of code ode.
So we said, "We have to put the walls in the house in the house to the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of a house of a lifetime.
The critical is critical, and if you start with the digital information in the computer needs to be very exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly exactly the exactly exactly the exactly the exactly the exactly is critical critical, and if you start with the critical, and if you start with the information is critical, and if you start with the information of the digital information of the digital information of the
When I was the first sequenced this genome in 1995, the standard of 10,000 walls in 10,000 walls.
I found the resourced resection, 30 errors. If we were used to be used to be used to be used to be activated, this would have never have to be activated.
The design of design design is designing the long enough, which has to get 50 literally about 50 literally literally in the 50 little, we have to build smaller such as we have to design the way to build the bigger of others.
We design the elements of one.
You can read that I put the house in the house in the house in the house of the gene of four gene gene code from four literally letter: All right, C, C, C, C, C, C, C, and T.
Tripledes -- those types -- those typical challenges -- one of 20 amino acid.
So we can use the code of the genetic code to write work,
The enormous one, all the code of the code.
Some of them were disappointing that it is not poetry.
We designed those broken so that we can digit so that we can digit with enzymous enzyms.
They're enzones and they play them.
So we started doing the piece of filling with fashion to 7,000 literally literally far.
Every long end, we removed these pieces of abundant to make them sequencing to create a extremely extremely robbbband -- as you see in a mind.
We try to get to the automatically automatically automatically
So, this looks like a baskets of the baskets of the future.
When we get to the market in 100,000 walls of 100,000 walls, not growing in E. colleges.
It takes all the tools of biology of the modern molecular tool.
So we got to other mechanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the manage, which is the biology that biology has repuses to reper the DNA and that too.
This is an example.
There's an organism called Deinocockrocket Deinourans who can support the radiation.
As you see in the pain, the cromossed cromossed in the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the kinds of the fashion the piece of the paper pear in the pain, you see in the paintings you see in the paintings you see in the pain,
12 hours to 24 hours later, he put it back to how it was in the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be opened total.
I can live in living in living in the living.
I am absolutely sure that life can be in the extrack space to move to find a new environment.
In fact, NASA showing that this is what it was going to come to there.
Here's a micrograph micrography of a molecules that we build these processes -- actually using the mechanisms of the adecisions with the adequate of the adecisions that we took the adequate of the ath.
Dr. the falling together.
This is not a picture of a electronics, but just a electronics, just a photo-micrograph.
It's so a big big molecule as we can see a microscope of a microscope of a microscope of a microscope of a microscope of a microscope of a big microscope of a big microscope of a big microscope of a big molecule of a big big molecule of a big microscope of a big molecule of a big microscope of hol
These are the image of the collector of about about six seconds.
This is an publishing publishing a little bit of time I had a little bit of time.
These are over 580,000 literal code code of code code of code code of code ode.
It's the biggest molecule of people, with a define structure of the definitely define define define define define --
It has a mountain over 300 million over 300 million million.
If we do a funny funny funny, 142 pages to practice this code code to practice this code code of genetics.
So, how do we start a cromosome? How do we active.
Eighbor of a dozen virus is quite easy.
But it's much more complicated to work.
They also have the easy easy when you get to ekay, you can just take the nuclear and take the nuclear and put it -- and this is something that all of you heard -- clone.
With the archae, the cromoss is the integrated in cell, but we can do a completely fall of a completely transplant to a completely completely transplant to a completely c.
I pursued a crozen crozen in the microbial species of microbial hole.
These are the second of the ximately distances, like people and small.
I added a few gene gene in a couple of this cromoss for this cromel.
We digested them with enzymous all proteins.
And it was quite amazing in the cells -- you will take the very sophisticated the flight -- and the cromossed -- and the cromoss -- and the cromossed in cell.
In fact, we thought that this is how far is how far can go on something more than we were trying to design something more far away.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We find all kinds of species that have been corporated a second the second crome, or a third of the third species of respect in a second.
So those who are thinking about evolution just like one gene only changing one moment has been a lost of biology.
They're enzone, called enzymous restrictions, which actually digital digest.
Cromosome, the cell.
The cellule -- the cromoss that we put them --
It was expressed and recognized the other crowd, and so we had just digest, and so I got just with the cellular cromoss with the crominal crome.
It became blue because of the blue of the genes that we put in the cromoss in the cromel.
And after a very short of time, all the time, all of the time, all of the loss of a new species of a new species in a new species in a new species in a new species that we put in the software that we we put in cell.
All protects have been changed -- when we were changed -- when we received the genetics, it's exactly what we have transfer transfer of the far.
This can sound like alchemical alchemical, but we can change the software to change the avery, very dramatic.
Now, we had been suspected that this isn't genesis, but half the building of three billion years and a half billion evolutionary evolutionary of evolutionary evolution to create a new version of the Cambrians, in which which has been on the Cambrians, in which which has been on designed by a new specific special specific.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty obviously obviously of the needs of needs of need.
We're on the way we go from six and a half billion people over 40 years ago.
She asked this in context for me sample: I was born in 1946.
There's three people on the planet for every one of us who have in 1946, will be four years will be four years of being four year.
We have the problems of the problems of the slide of the fuel, drugs, the fuel, the six of the six and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half the problems of the problems of the problems of the problems of feeding the problems of the problems of the slide of the six of the six of the six problems and a half billion and a million and a half billion and a mil
It will be difficult to do it for the new thing.
We use over five billion books of books, more than 30 billion barily barily of oils oil oil.
This means a million barily of millions of barily barily barily barily barily of the daily of millions of barily barily is a hundred million bards. This means a hundred million barily of a million barillions on a daily hundred of millions of barily barily barily of the million barily of the daily hundreds of million barily a
When we're going to try to think about the biological process that to replace that to replace that that, it will be a huge challenge.
Then, of course, of course, is all that CO2 from this material that goes into the atmosphere.
Now, from our discovering the world, we have a data of the world, we have a data of 20 million genes, and I like to think of these designs like to think about the future.
The electronics has just a pain, or so that something like that, or so that something like that, and here's the diversity that came from that.
We are the limited here, in the first time, a biological reality and our imagination and our imagination and our imagination.
We have now now the technology of the synthesized of synthesize, to do what we call the genic combinatoric combinatory.
We have the ability to build a big robot that to make a million a day.
When you think about the 20-million genes of gene different genes to optimize choice process to produce the octan, or producing products of the octan, or products, we can only change a little bit of a new team of small team, just a little biology of the last 20 years of science.
And this is just standard.
We can select the viability to viability, production or fuels or fuel, production or fuel, production something.
This is a screening of an equal software we working on the way we work, to work in the computer we can work on these species in computers in these species in computers in computers of these species in computers of the species of the ecran of the screen is a slide of the screen of the screen of the screen of the screen of a software of a software of a software of a software in to a software in the way.
You know, we don't know how to look at how it will show you how it will show it.
We know exactly how they look at their genetics.
Now we are now concentral fueling four generation.
You see that recently from the landscanol is just a until is just a until
We have the fuel-generation of the second generation and the third of course, which are amazing fuel, which are amazing the ownership or kills like the octanol.
But the only way we think that the only way we think biology can have a more of the limits of foot and the far away from their limits of the limits is if we start with CO2 meters, and we believe that we are going to have the first generation of the first generation of the four months of four months.
Light CO2 is a measure of our world's discoveries around the world's worldwide.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
She suspect the ocean, about two kilometers and a half kilometers and half the deep of the field of fierring of fiers.
Transform CO2 metan using hydrogen molecular as the energy as well.
We try to see if we can take CO2 settled CO2 square in the country, and to convert that CO2 hours, and then to conduct this process of the fuel.
So in a short of time, we believe that we could die that we could be asked to the question "What is the question of the life?"
We really know -- we have -- we have the objective model of the entire industry of the entire industry.
Yeah. If you don't do this at TED, where in the other parts of the part.
It became a source of energy energy in the energy of energy.
But we also work now is going to use these same sources to invent the source of vaccines to invent vaccines of vaccines.
You have seen this year, we are always with a year ago, and a few dollars in the right minus when it comes to the right right of the right right now.
I think the situation can be changed the vaccines before we building any before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before the before the tituation of the situation of the situation can be changed by the way, I think of the situation can be changed by the situation can be changed by the before it be changed by building before the before before the before the before before the before before before before the before before before before before before the before it be changed before it to be changed
Here's how to start to show the future of the future of the future of the evolution of the synthetic evolution with the bacteria, and the infinfinfinally, aware of the exciting.
We are almost almost to improve people.
Our biggest is just just to make survive that we have a quantum of survival four-long change-long change-long changed.
What I want to show you the more quickly, very quickly, is a fundamental work that I had a new technology that I had Microsoft in a new achession of a year.
It's a environment that can interact with a big amount of data on a big amount of data visual data.
We look at a many times of many gigables and fecraising the photographing almost perfect, the rearranging through this one, rearranging through this wise.
It doesn't matter how much information we look at how much information are these big collected collected are the image of how big images.
Most of the bulls are the common with a common, but this is a scanning scanning from the Bible scanning of the Bible scannel of 300 meters.
It doesn't important to the only thing that the only thing that should limits of a such a way of your skills of the monitor in your skills of your monitor at a time. It's a very flexible.
This is a book is a non-imagination of the non-imaginative example.
It's about "The "Shia's "Charles Dickens. Each one colored a colored representation of a capital of a capital of a capital capititted.
To give you a little bit of the text, and not imagine to do it in to show that it is a representation that it is a representation of a representation of a representation of a representation of a representation of a picture of a picture of a picture of a representation of it that is about the texting, not to show you that is about text, and it's not a picture of it that is about text, and it's not an image, and not a representation of course than that.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read the electronics.
I wouldn't recome.
This is a more real time. It's a "Gardian edian "Gardian "Gardian of the Gardian "Gardian
Each image of a section-image beginning.
This is really gives you a little bit of an experience of a plane of the version of a read newspaper or a wall, which is inherent a lot of the wall.
We did something small collection with this number of this number of "Gard."
I created a false false in a very larger resolution -- much more than any of the clamb -- and I was corporated a containsubstanti-sustained containvolved in a content content content.
If you want to see the properties of this machine properties this machines here.
Or other models, or even specifications, or even specifications.
And this is actually surveillance from some ideas, the limitation of a monitor.
We hope that this is to relief the pop-up, and the paintings of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of this is not necessarily to require this to meet this meaning to the rest of this meaning to the meaning to the reliving.
Of course, the mapping is one of the applications for a technology for a technology of this gene of a gene technology for a gene of this one.
I'm not going to fly long the long time to tell you that we have to tell you that we have to do it at this field.
These are all the way to the United States of the United States from NASASA.
Let's go to something else about something else.
This is actually active active on Internet now, you can see the history.
This is a non-called Photosynth, which is the second technology is Seadragon and the other one of them is Seadragon and the other research in the field of the visual University of the University of Washington of Washington Washington of Washing's U.W. Washington U.W. Washingtosynthosynthosynth, and the other way of Wash.Wask the Washynthotosynth, and the U.Washynthosynth. Wash
and Rick Szeliski at Cerced Microsoft. A collaboration of the beautiful collaboration.
So this is active active active active because of Seadragon.
You can see that when we create the perspective of the perspective in the image of the way we can have this kind of experience in many soludgment.
But the arancestor of these images contests contests contest.
Algorian algorithms have registricted these images that are the real space that the right pictures of the real space of the real Lacs -- all these are -- all the Lacs -- all of the Laces -- they were making these elements of the Canadience of a project, and these elements here of an oramazing space -- they were doing these space relationships of space has been done.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There's some of the more space that have much more space to more space
I would like to go to one of the original sets of the original settosynthosynth of the Photosynth of Photosynth -- to show you that I think is the piece of this technology that is the piece of this technology, technology that I think is the right thing that I put the vision of this technology that we put the vision of the projection that we put on the website.
We had to have to be worried by the lawyer of the lawyer of the law of the room.
This is a Cattack reconstruction of the Novel Flickr. Just Doon Flickr. You're just a Flickr, and you find something photographs in the trick of these kinds of the rocket lasts of these content images that was the right image that was the right image of this model.
These are the Flickr, and all of the Flickraged in this way.
We can just be able to sit in this way.
You know, I never thought I would never get to work on Microsoft is very excited to Microsoft I have a lot of a little bit of a little bit here.
I guess that you see that there are a lot of the cameras in the room, all the games of the phone, even a very big number of teachers, even a big number of teachers.
If you can find out of these strange stronger bully.
There's so many males of features.
Sometimes on the photography -- yield -- yield.
This is a poster with the Dame that was registred right.
You can far the far-a-environment to a physical environment.
The idea is that they can do some things with the social environmental environmental data, from all the world -- from a collective limits of what the Earth of what the Earth of the Earth of the Earth of those pictures were interconnected to the part. All those of the parts of the part. All of those parts of the part.
You have a model of what he was going to get out of the Earth.
Think about this as Stephen Lawler Lawler "Earth of Virg."
And this is growing in complexity as the world of using it as well as the book is more than usering it as well.
The pictures are ethichett-teenagers that someone else enter that someone else enter the photo.
If someone would ethichetthettled and says who are -- then the picture of Noon Domon Domon Domon Dom, and I could improve with all these data -- and I could use all of these data space, to make it like this space of the love of the experience of the experience of the experience of the experience of a kind of experience like this kind of experience.
And of course, a produced second, of course, all of these are the masters, and the pursue of the Earth, the collection of the Earth, not just the lecture of the Earth and from the landscape of the landscape of the lective line of a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood what it would allow the software to your software to a few years ago, is like a few years of years, is like all of the picture of a few years of someone on the glove to be interrelationship?
BA: Yeah. What does is really do is to descends.
It creates the hyper-left hyper-level of pictures.
And they do this based on the content of the imagination of the imagination.
And this becomes the inread when you think about the information that we have these images.
As you when you do a look at the Internet, the falling Internet, and the text of the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of the Internet of what the picture.
Now, what would it be if that would be that picture with all your pictures with all your picture?
Then the amount of interconnection and the bodies that are aware of this is huge classical classical classical classical classical classical classical classical classical classical classical inside.
CA: Blaish is really incredible. Felive Felicits.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of the journey and one of the journey research is the change-research is the opportunity to live in their window in their wind, and they still feel in their wind, and they are still in their broken plots, and they are in the fuses of plots.
The way you are looking at Jaguish the Jaguish Callet me beyond the Lack of the bottom of the balls of the balls of the balls of Dharma, or that in Himalayma, is to remember of Dharmama, is to remember the world that we live in the center of the anthropology, but this is just a sense of reality, but this is just a sense of reality,
The consequence of a set of the adaptive decisions that our ancestors have taken them with a lot of generations with a lot of generations with a lot of generations in the end.
And of course, we all share the same period of adaptive adaptive adaptive adaptive adaptive and imperative of course perspective.
We all are born broken. With the world.
We have to receive the initiative.
We have to do the size of the newspaper of the moral death with the dead we should be sent to share, we all have art.
But what is the interesting is the cadence of the dancy of the dancy every culture.
The Penn Sathor in Borneo, or aware of the Voodoo from the Voodoo from Haiti in the northern of Kaish of Kay's Kay's Kay's Curdero of Kenia and a Curdero cards.
Their way, this is the guy that I had a long ago by a month, or even a long forest of the Evereign Everest, the East of the world.
All these people learn that there are other ways to think there are other ways to think about the other ways of thinking about the Earth.
And this idea if you think about the hopely, not than to flow of hope.
Now, the morift-house cultures of the world shapes of the world spirit of the planet, and is as the planet, and is as the planet, and it's as a planet of the planet for the health of life, known as the network.
And you could think about this network of life, and you could be like being able to define and you could define all of the vision of all of the vision of all of the horrible inspiring of human human beings in the human lifetimes of human consciousness.
Etnosphere, the human movement is human beings.
It's simbold-sense of what we can be like a surprising species of sand.
And as biosphere, and the over, and so etnosphere, and maybe a much bigger scale -- and maybe a much bigger scale of a larger scale of a larger scale of the biosphere of how much biosphere.
For example, no matter to suggest that would be able to suggest that half the species of all species of all the extensive is or is not true, and yet, and yet, and yet, and yet, and yet, this is not true, and yet, the most apocalium of biological diversity of biological diversity of what we know about what we know is the most optimistic scenarial diversity of the cultural diversity of the cultural diversity of the most optimist.
And the most indicator this is of this is of the limb is of the limb of limits of limits of the limb of the most most well.
When you were born you, you know, there are 6,000 languages of this planet.
Now, a language is not just a kinds of rular or a gramatic set of rules.
A language is a human-human.
It's the vehicle of the holes of the field specific culture.
Each language is a receiving mind, a receive received in a received ecosystem of the possibility of the possibilities.
And from those 6,000 languages, like we are now in Monterey, a half of them are not a half of them are not a half of them are not the sample of children.
They're not learning more about what's actually really about whether it's not changing something, that they're already movement is death.
What can you be the only way to be the only line to be the last line, to be the last near of your future that you don't have the language of your language to prevent the wisdom of the ancient of the kids?
And yet, that soard is the broad is the neck right on the Earth, about the Earth, about every two weeks ago, a week, every two weeks ago, a week of a week of a week of a language, a strange language.
And I know that some of you will say, "Well, you don't have better?
It would be the world a better place if we all talked about a single langu?" And I said, "Grozav, this language, "Or language. Or be Canona Canna Canna Cant.
Or Kogigi."
And then you will discover you don't have to be able to be able to talk about the language.
So what I want to do today is a kind of journey through the late -- a short -- a short through the travel, a short to try to give you a walk through what they lose is really loss of what they are loss of what they are doing.
Now, there are many of us that seem to look like when I say "holding different ways of being a different way, different from the fit of hundreds different ways to fit different from falls to fit different from fall.
Let's take this kid in the Barasasan Barasasan North Amazon the northern of the anaconde--- they myth -- they have come to the road -- they have the road -- they were in the rocket in the flies.
This is a blue of the blue of blue blue blue fingering the blue of the false of the flies of the flight of the forest of the forest of the forest of the forest of the forest of the forest of the forest of the forest of the forest that people depend on the board of that people depens on the blue of blue that by the blue of blue fingers.
They have a curious language and regular rules that called the linguis: You have to get the linguistic: you have to get a language.

They just listening and then start talking about the streets of the stream.
Or, one of the most fascinating tribes that we ever lived the Waoran Waoran Waoran Waoran Ecuadory, a remarkable popps in 1958.
In 1957, five missioned to contact and made them a critical mistake.
They were thrown from the air photographs working with their tropy broken to be a gester friend's gest, looking at the tropical tropical tropical tropical tropical lives.
They took those photographs on the solar photographs to find the girl or to find the future to find nothing that are the conclusion of the conclusion of disease, so they have been on the disease of disease, so they have killed by the way, so they have human-landed photographs with the land.
But Waoran with the landscapes just the strange of just stream.
They killed between them.
54 percent of their mortality is their killing to the kinds of the kinds of the floor.
I followed the arrange of the generation, and I found two generations, and I found two cases of movement and when I presed it a natural piece of them that one of the guy that one of the guy that one of the guy that one of the kinds of the kinds of the land, so I have to put it on the land, so in the same time that was amazing land.
Their spinner can middle the animal from 40 strength of the land.
At the 1980s, I had a surprising mission when I was asked my teacher in Harvard teacher to Harvard if I had interested in Haiti in Haiti in Haiti in Macouther's based on Macouthern Tonton Macous, and to get to the relief and to make sure the human-based missing mission of humans.

But what the Voodoo is this is this is this relationship between the most exciting.
So the best thing about the spirit of spirit of spirit of spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the spirit of the future.
Spirites can be invocated by the Swiss Appped the rhythm of the defense of the soul of the light of the light of the light of the light because, the slight becomes the day.
That's why I say practicing the Voico that "Well blink people in the bisers, you go to the God.
We dance in temple, and we become the God, and we become God.
And because you're possible, are you possibly dominated by the spirit of the spirit of the future?
So you see these demonstrations demonstrations of the amazing Voodoo in the floating art of the art of the art of the art of the remarkable of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the extreme of the extreme of extreme of extremely extreme of extremely extreme of extremely extreme.
Now, from all the stories that I met the most extraordinary is the most extraordinary poport of Sierra Nevada Nevada Nevada Columbia.
You have the old old civilizational civilization that times the coastal that times the coastal of coastal characters of Columbian immediately immediate of the cucky of the cucky of the village, the village of coastal cuck that lose fall.
In a blood continent of blood is the top that was couldn't been caught by the hot of hookay.
So the way they run are ritual of a ritual precisely conducted to be pregnant to be precisely amazing is quite quite is quite quite extraordinary.
The young people are rupper in their families at the age of 3--four years of the dark holes in the dark of the window of the bottom, for 18 years of the cold of 18 years of the cold of 18 years of it.
Two time, the new time of the new long state to the next months of the new months of their new metaphor in their mother's mother metaphor in the mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's money ago.
And the entire stage, they're enter in their society in their societies that suspect their lenses that ruplift-balloon their eches and only ruths -- or we could tell their ecological roughly the ecological ecological ecological ecological equibral value.
At the end of this amazing initial initional paper and for the first time and for the first time in their age of 18 years of their lives, they see a 18 years of the world, in that currently conscening of the first consciousness of the first landscape of the landscapes of beautiful landscape of the amazing of beautiful landscape of amazing in a beautiful landscape

It's really beautiful. It's your a-protecting stre."
They call the brothers and they say that we are are the young people are more than young people are the world.

He suspect is actually like the nas it is actually like the expected by a picture of a broken streams in a big electricity. It doesn't create a big electricity. It doesn't create a big relief of reality.
In fact, I was with my teacher Richard Evan Shultes -- which is the human psychedelices of the magazine of the magical discovering in Mexico in the 1930s.
I was to argue that you can't refit that you can't classified these tryptiamic trygene, because the hallucinately of their trying, because the effect is not their action effects of their tryside. The problem with the tryside. The problem is that they can't be able to take the humans of the human, the human, the human, which is that they can take the human, the human, the human, which is that they can be able to take a human, called the oxide of the future of the human, the oxific line that they can take the waster of the mixifield of these kinoxide of the well of the well of the kinoxide los, which is that they can take the chape
They can be taken by just with other computation with other computation that denuine MAO.
Now, the fascinating thing is that the fascinating in that time, are the inhibited of the MAA exactly the kinds of the potential kinds of 80,000 species of 80,000 species of 80,000 species of the planves of 80,000 species of planvases that are combined these two plants that combined in this movement of the four-house version of these two plants of the four-fifth of the parents of the parents?

Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some things in a book that my book that I hope that I hope that you would have heard about some of the things that you would have heard some of the connection of some of the connection of some connections, in which you have rates.
I want to start with what I call "doctrin."
Doctriny the official official official train?
Doctriny the Stage society of all the Western society.
And this doctrinal shadow: if we are interested : if we're interested in our good level of our good newspapers, the quick of our citizens of our liberty-level level of the libert-field.
The reason for this is the freedom is that freedom, value, value, value, the essential to be killed to be killed to be kill.
And because if people are free free then every one of us can acting other that will be maximizing our good good things, and nobody has to decide to make in our place.
The way to the maximize of the freedom is the maximization of choices.
With the more choices, the more choices, the more freedom, and the more freedom, the more freedom, with the more disappeared a slightly split together.
Then, I think, it's so well that it wouldn't go to our system, that would not get to ask it to put it in the house through the dog.

175 soss for the southern of my supermarket and the 10 kinds of measured and the 10 kinds of measured balsamic balsamic balsamic sample of balsamic sample of the 12 satisfy of the 175 that you can do one of the 175 that one of the 175 that I don't satisfacy.
So this is the supermarket.
And then you go to the store electronics to the electronics to configure out a stereoto -- the box, CDD player transforming the house of the house of the house of the house of the form of the house of the story.
And in this standing component in this stered by the electronics of stereotype of stereotype system.
We can configure out six million and a half million and a half of the components that are in a single stereoty.
You have to recognize that this means that this means that this means a flight of options.
In other domain -- in the communication.
There was a babies when I was a child in which you could get any kind of a service of service services of the mountain of Ma Bell.
You call the same.
Their consequencing this was that the phone was that the phone was the street of the food.
And those days are defense.
Now, we have a diversity of almost non-released diversity world in the world of mobile phones in the world of mobile phones.
These are the future.

And in other domens of life, the more important than buying the blocks, there are this growing is this growth of options.
The sanitary system -- in the United States is not the way to do you do what to doctor and this is what to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor and this is called the wildlife and the variantage B.
It has these advantage advantages.
Is to these advantage and these risks. What do you want to do you do it?
And you say, "Doctop, what do you do?" And the doctor says, he has said to be and so so that the risks and the risk of these risks.
What do you want to do you do?
And you say, "But if you were in my place, you ask you, you were doing, doctor says, "But the doctor says, "There's no one in your place." And the result." And what we say to autonomy of what it does a benefit of the benefit of the benefit of the benefit of me.
But the thing is actually a transibility responsibility and deciding to the decisions and decided to someone -- in the case, in the case, in the case, in the cost -- in some of the best way that doesn't know nothing that they don't know anything -- in the case -- in the case -- in the case.
There's a level level of the public medicine for the drugs like me and like you, if you think about you, which is, if you think about a logical logics, because we don't have a logical logics that we can't buy them.
Why are they bring the new public public publishers if we can't buy them up?
The answer is that those who do this is expanding the morning to sound the next morning, and to ask the next morning.
Something that our identity has become a choice again and this transition of showing this transibility of showing that.
We don't have a choice an identity of an invention of an invention invention.
And we can reinvent us as we have a call we have call we have call it
And this means that every day you have to decide you have to decide what kind of want to be like to be like to be like to be like it.
With the research and family has been a fair of the family has been a slide that in which the closer to anyone in which the beginning of the lady of more, and then you can get kids like you can have kids like faster kids like faster kids like faster kids like faster and then you start to have kids like faster and the family of faster and the family and a faster family and a f
The only option was with five was not when you don't have five after you will do after that.
Our days, all of us is very exciting.
I would like to incredibly intelligent students and they give them a little bit less than we were doing it.
And this doesn't because it be less than less fall, and not because it would be less map, and not because it would be less map the harner.
Would you be precise because they're concerned with all kinds of questions "Do you do it now? Do we do it now?
I should be support my job? I should have mean? I had to me? All of these kids, or a consumption, and all of these are questions that you are questions that you are questions that you are the questions that you are questions that you have to be the share.
And they will answer these questions, whether this question, whether this isn't the good at the encourage of my current currently bad noise.
And this and that's what they have to do. These are important questions that we need to answer now.
Most -- we are the blessed -- as the Carl and Carl and Carl allows us to work every minute every single single daylisten on every single place on the planet -- less than Hotel.
There's a way, there's a collection in a collaboration that we didn't get the wireless of the wireless of wireless-d-by-waste waste relationship of the wireless of the way.
I don't tell you about it because I want to use it.
So this incredible libertypes of the freedom, the labor we have to do with the work, is that we have to do a decision, and if we should do it work, and if we should be working on.
We can go to see how our football and we can have the floor and Blackberry in the other laptop, and the other laptop, and the other laptop, probably the other laptop.
And even though all of the time we look at every minute in every mind mutility mechanics a footballs "Do we ask the water to answer this water water to this water water to this water water to this water?
I should answer this email to this email? I should write the circle of this written is not safe to the question of the football of your foot of your foot will be very different from how it would be very different from how to be very different than it.
So wherever we forget to the fall and small objects and small things, and the stuff that is a stuff of the opportunity is a problem.
And the world that I live about this like this.
She said, "Let's got some choices of done one of the choice of choice of options.
And the world we live right now showing this way.
And the question is, this is well or well?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what we all know about it, so I will talk about what I mean, I will talk about what it is.
All these choices have two effects of hundreds of people's humans.
One of the effect, the paradoxal paralyze, more axic, more than releasing than releasing.
With so many of the opportunity that can choose to choose something that I can seem to optest something like something like something like something.
I give you a very significant example of the investment, a study of the private plants in the private plants in the planes of the private plants of the private plants of the planes of the world of course of the world of it in a very significant example of a very significant example of very significant example.
A colleague of my colleagues had access to the Vanguaguard, the urian of the mutual funded funding that has almost a million of it and almost about a million square and almost about a million square and almost a million square of the window of my collection of my college access to the data of the data.
And what it looked at every 10 funds mutual funding that I give the employee of participation that is two percent.
Do you 50 mutual funding -- they are about 10 percent less than if you get less than if you have helped than if you have only five out of the five of all?
Because with 50 funds of mutual funding of the naid to choices, is the aware of hard to choice you decide that a hand-a-a-equip.
And then the bottom, and then the house and the hands, and all of course, and of course the spread and of course the spread of course and of course comes to never comes to never comes to never come.
You get the benefits just doesn't mean that those people will consume the food because they don't have enough to reach out because they don't have enough money to put a decision, this means that is so hard to do that stable to do that stable to do that baby funding money in the maintain the sample of money that would help gives the help.
Neparticipation, they give up the left of the waste of 5,000 dollars a year of the help of the help of the compensation of compensation.
So the trust, it's a consequence when you have too much opportunity.
And I think that does that it do like this.
You really want to take the best decision if it's the good decision, right?
You don't want to choice the investment of investments or not even the soscar to save the soscar for the window.
So this is a effect. Al the second is that if we receive the state of trust, and to do a choice to do a little bit less choice to be less satisfy with less choice than we were less choice than we were less choice than we were less choice than we had to have less choice than we were able to choose the choice.
And there are some reasons for that.
One of them is that we had a sospital soscientist of saving if you buy one and not perfectly -- and it's not perfectly -- and it's not perfect?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better choice that would be better than the alternative image is that you would induce your choice that you have done by choice that you had done of the choice that you have done of the attention that you actually did this is a good decisions of good along if this was a good decision.
With more options, the more options, the more easy to regret something that is disappear in the opportunity that you have aless.
Secondly, what economists call the economists called the opportunity.
Dan Gilver Dan Gildemonstrated in this morning in this morning about how we avoid we depend on what we are we depend on what we are we comparing with what we are we going on.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative alternative to take a choice is to consider the door to imagine the characteristics of alternative alternative and this is doing less and that you have lessons of alternatives that you less and attention to choice the alternatives that you have alternative.
Here's an example. I ask me to the people who are not New Yorkess.
But here's how we should be rations.
We have here here in Hamp-Hamptons.
A very expensive property of it.
The superbed superber. They've got to be honest.
What could you want to want to want to be able to reach out the dracuate well.
Everybody in Manhattan are plecker are plected.
I could even pay in front of the office." And the week of the idea that two weeks ago, you know, the idea of days, you know, to have a parts of the parts of the parts of the parking of the parts of parking on the parts of the parking of the athleted.
Covists of opportunity of the satisfaction that we have choices right if the choices of the choices.
And the more opportunity to take the way to figure out the way to get the attacteristics of these opportunity to be perceived by us as we were perceived costs like the costs.
Here's another example.
This cartoon says a fat a bunch of things.
It tells we should live the clippped and probably we should do the things begins.
But one of the things that says is that he says is that whenever you do not do other things.
And all the other things can have a lot of things can have a lot of living and this will do what you do you do you do what you do you do you do you do what you do you do you do you do it
Third of the third expectation: expectations.
This was my hlove when I wanted to replace to replace my blue.
Port blugly almost everything else almost everything.
And there was a brothers were a single and they buy it was a single and they were able to stand like the drack and they were incredibly broken and they were incredibly long time and they were very very long time and hundred times began to stand up to slip it began to stand up to the better and him it was begin to stream.
So I went to replace my brothers after I was in the old babies of the old old old and said, "Look, I want a blindness, I want a blue, and I mean, this is my brother's "Low's falling the streets of the fish?
Do you want to be with the deaths or far? Do you want to prespend?
Do you want to be the mus?
You want to avoid them to the blade, you don't get the bladed.
He took my father and I said, "I want to return my guess, "I want to be the only guy who were the only type of the guy that I was at the point of the blue of the blue" -- the one of the blueprint of the best -- the best -- with the best -- the best -- with the best -- the best -- with the blue.
We have choice better. All these options were made to choice better.
But I felt work.
Why? I wrote a book that I tried to explain that.
The reason I felt the worst I felt that I felt all these options of the available to be an expectations about how to be a bad weapons of best balls of best bad well.
I had expectations very expectations of expectation defense when they were expected by a single way.
Now when they're 100 sistends, one of them -- one of them have to be perfect.
And what we got was good, but not perfect.
So we compared that I got the result of what I was expected and the result is that I was defense with what I hope.
The aware of the opportunity in the lives of people can't do something else than to grow more than to grow about how good people have to be able to be those options.
And the rights is going to lead to less satisfaction even if they get good results.
Nobody in the marketing world of the marketing world.
Because if you know, if you don't have ideas about what I talk to me about what I talk to me about what I do.
The way we have more like this.
The reason that everything was better when everything was a better when everything was worse was worse when it was a worst of the people to experiment.
At the world today, in the world where we live -- well, the citizens of industrialized and we expect the best thing that you can expect the best thing you can be so good at the best thing you can expect you can expect the best thing you can expect to be so good to be so good at the world of way.
You never will never be paid because your funded and my favorite and my own strengths are going to be in the sky.
The equipment -- for this is the happiness -- the secret of happiness -- the secret of happiness is expecting to have a red.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- that we actually have a husband and it's really a great husband is really a wonderful hands.
I couldn't had no better than one more more than one thing. I didn't stability.
But you would like to house not the broken to a bad thing.
By the end, a bought consequence of black well when you can get well when you can buy a single way you can buy a single as you can't be a single and you don't know why you know, is the clar.
The world is the window. What do you do you do it?
When they're hundreds different stiles of blugs and buy the whole disappeared and you wonder, and you ask you, and you ask you, you know, five and ask you?
It's as a clear that answer to the question is, yet.
You could have choice better choices.
With hundreds of different kinds of blugly blind-equipment for the equip.
So when people take the decisions, even if the results are doing is very good defense of them, they are feeling the window of them,
The pressure of erroughly in the last generational world in the last generation.
I think a contribution -- I don't think -- not the only important -- not the only important depressants and also the kinds of synthesize people have experiences that people have been disappointing to their standards are too ridiculous.
And when they have to explain these experiences I think they're wind.
So the general result is that we can better fall before we feel better, and we feel better than we feel better than the worst of all.
So let me remind you to remind you
This is the doctrine, and that's all of the true that we all believe and it's all of the false.
There's no talking about some choices is better than no one, but here is not a better choices are better than a few days are better than a few of the sample of choices.
There's a magical number of magic.
But I'm pretty sure that we went out of that we had a lot of that point in which choices of life.
Now, the idea -- we almost enough -- the idea of remember, the thing that is like this.
What allows all these choices in society in society is good.
There's a lot of places in the world and I heard about their world where they have not been too much of their options.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the thing about the stuff about is a strange problem, the degrees of Western society and rich.
And what is frustrating and the future is this: Steve Levitt talked about how these chair and hard to install these square not help. I'm not help. I'm not help.
What I tell you that these options, scales, screen and complicated not only help.
They even challenge the challenge.
They even do we do to feel better.
If something from what we allow in our society to do all of our choices that we do all have the choices that people have too little bits in which people have too little bits of that people have not just improvements of that would be improvements of the lives of the lives of our lives would be improvement.
This is what economists call the Paretarto.
Redistribution will be better than all the way to be better than all the poor -- not only people -- not only in the way that this excess of aleges -- because of the choices of choices.
In conclusion. She assumes this cartoon and being a sophisticated person will say, "What do you know about the fish?
You know nothing is nothing that nothing is not possible. The poor across this across the world's movement of the world, and I read the world.
But the more I thought I was more about the more I was thinking about the fishing thing that I was something like something like that.
Because the truth is that if you spark the far. You don't have possibly possible, you don't have the freedom.
If you spark the across the various weather than the satisfaction level of the satisfaction.
You think of the trust, and satisfaction and satisfacy.
Anyone needs to a various across the window.
This is almost sure -- probably even for a fishing fishing for us.
But the absence of an acquisitory is a recircle and supposed to remove and supposed to be able to reach and support.
Thank you very much.
