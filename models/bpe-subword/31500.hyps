And the year I showed these two diaposed to demonstrate the bridge of the polar that the last three years of years of the last three million years of the last three million years of making a small slide of four percent of the large of four percent of the same.
But this morning, this morning, because of this problem because it doesn't look at the gross of the frozen gross of the floor.
The polar is is in a way of a way that the heart of the climate system.
She was expected and contraction and contract.
The button that the diaposition that I will show you the faster will be a quick at what was happened in the last 25 years.
Ghe's funded psychology is the large of the baby.
So you can see it expecting the bastrous inched inched inch.
This is the golden anced for the same.
And they feel like it was willing to the window.
Associeties the permanent of the frozen or floor more than five years or more than a body.
In 25 years of that, in the year, at this time.
This is a problem because the challenge of the challenges of the oceans of the articular away.
where it's a massive amount of massive carbon that is transformed in metaphetting, is transformed in metan micro-organisms.
The body, the total, the total, the pollution of global inquire in the amount of extreme could go to the point of extremely extremely what we can do.
For in certain in a certain in Alaska metantic metance, the metaphor of the water.
The Katter of Katter Walter University in Alaska has been on the other left of the team of the past.
H: Oh, h! She is OK. The question is OK. The question is if we were going to be her.
And a reason is that the enormous reason "aw" physical artists in north.
This is a role that all of the range.
But the volumes are much more than the volumes that never happened.
This is the Kangerlussed in the Greenlush.
If you want to know how the large of the large levels of the large of the baby of the blood of the blood of the button.
These debate very quick very quick.
And the other capital capital, Antarctic, the largest of the planet.
The paste people in the pasted people who have reported as the continent of the continent of the continent is negative, the story of the Antarctics on the varctics of the sult of sully.
This is the equal equal equal settland of the narrative in Greenland of Greenland and
In Himalaya, the thir, the third of the third of the floor of the floor of the form of a few years were killed.
Fourth of the population of the world of the world of water in the water of the water of the water.
In Anzy, this guy is the source of water for this hormous for this hormous for this horrific horse.
The bites have growing up.
But when it was willing to the bridge and water and water and water and water.
In California was a 40 percent of the four in Sierra Sierra Sierra.
This affected the reserve water.
And so the predictions, so you read it as you can read it.
And the global world has been able to a growth of the ramic growth of the incentises.
And disastern all the global world, they grow up with a rate rate of the space.
Fours more in the last 30 years old, 30 years of the 75 ancies.
This is a model of absolutely unfortunately.
If you look at the context of context of the historical context.
In the last five years I added 70 million tones of carbon of carbon on every day 24 hours in every day in the oceans.
So this is the attention of Pacification of Pacific, walking the Pacific, and the radicated in the oceans where the oceans of oxygen in the oceans.
The biggest causes the only part of the global warming of global despads in the fossil fuels of fossil fuels.
The best is a problem and the best problem is the most serious problem of the most serious and the best thing.
The United States is one of the mathematics of China,
And the proposal was to build more fabricated for the charguments.
But we start to see a change.
Here are the most who have angry the last years with alternative alternative proposition.
Everything was a fighting of our politics in our country.
And the industry and the industry was spent and the oil of oil spending a billion dollars in the last year of the last year of the last year of the last year of the last year of the last year of the year of the year of carbonia.
The promote is a current of what is a oximoron.
This image of the memory of something.
In the Cracium of the Cracia, a billion galoes of galoes in the galood of sterytelling the bridge.
You probably see at the stird of stird stirl.
This is all the works, the second story, the second Stamplied in the previous Stamplied Cracium Cracium.
One of the carbon of the carbs, some of the Cracia, it was this day.
Video: ♫ ♫ Frosy, homely, is a happy suffering and vessels and vessel.
He is in the abundance, in America, and help the growth of economic growth of economic growth.
Frost, the cost of carbs, it becomes more than the paper that goes up.
He is accessible and adorably and adorably jabove the jobs.
Al Gore: This is the most surprising of the bright.
The biggest of the largest of Masssey Coops is sey of Massey Coal.
Video: Don Blankenship: I want to be clar. Al Gore, Harry Reid Reid Reid Reid Reid Reid Reid Reid Reid Reid Reid Videott's Don Video: I want to talk to what they speak.
Al Gore: So the Aliana Climate for the Climate of Climinal campaign.
This is one of them, part of one of them in one of them in there.
Video: At CO: At COOLergy new arms like a very serious threat for business.
That's why our principle, the principal is to spend a big shared for the public fortunately, we really have to show us and complicated the best of the good news about the good news.
The thing is that, in fact, the beautiful is not dirty bad.
We think it's currently -- and the floor and good.
So it will not ingriving for climate the climate of climate arms.
So we ask that we can do it in our hands.
Video: The Carb: The cost of him, you know, about it.
So let's do you do a team of this house of this curately installation of the carbs.
Here is a by! Masinary,
But this is the sound of the mistake.
And as the carbs is one of the principal is one of the global warming of the global neighborhoods that you see the change the best of the bridge.
So this is going to attention, this is the technology of the carbon top of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the course of the courage.

The mention that we leave all the fuel, dependent on the fuels of fuels on the bottom of the carbon and stained.
But now we have a new solution to the incurcy to ieshihip.
RAs America, the electricity of America, in 10 years ago, in 10 years ago, in 10 years ago before I was in 10 years ago.
A plan of the American handle in the paper, and he help us to help us to help the stopping stopping the stopping of global stopping in the stopping of global wars.
In sentence, a solution that is a big solution to help us to solve our problems.
RAflu re-energy energy energy.
Al Gore: This is the last year.
Video: It's not about re-energy re-energy re-energy re-energy re-energy.
One of the faster faster to include the fuels of fuels that killed our planetary four planetary is the Barbitor is the really, soft, the same, the new really, the new review, a new really, of the energy.
Barbat runs investment to create the jobs of the job.
Narator: Reeeever. It's time for active. It's time for active active.
Al Gore: There is a bad arrow of the african who you want to go fast, you go fast, you go fast, you go to the only gam."
If you want to get fun, you go far beyond the well-walk!
We have to get fast, fast.
Thank you very much.
The year at TED I did a cloud to LHC.
And I promised to come and go to a data and I get a data that works is how it works.
So here is the 19th century. And the people who were not here, LHC is the most experiment that was intentially intense of 27 kilometers -- Cirkilometers and is the recreating a billions of Strems and is a billions of the world's confidence of the universe -- a billion times on the ground of the universe.
It's extremely ambitious.
This is the city of the Geneva.
We do photos "Big Bangs" in the decades in the decades.
I work on this way. It's called the ATLASTLASTALASTALASS meters a four-training photos of the ATASTAT's detector's detectors in building the Diff.
On the year of the year was the last year, I went back to the first time for the first time.
And that was made the image was made by ATLAS.
He was the cause of a huge celebration in the camera of control.
It's a first picture of the first fascycles that the fashion the inside of the state of the system in LHC, and the LHC, and the deliberath of deliberator.
In other words, when I was sepatient that images 10 sepatient in the speed that the apart working, which is a huge successful success.
I don't know that if that was the largest over, or the largest of the largest page, and he was seeing the page of the page of the page of the page of the way.
It means that I did a cultural impact of the cultural impact of stiff.
After of about a seven, I had a seven, I had a problem with the issue of aurry -- these field -- these field -- these fires.
Those are being transport of 13 thousands of miximately maximum works.
Now, the engineers in the research and say, "I can't translation and says, "I can't translate myself the myself as a myself."
But I can do that for the temperatures are spending of the temperature,
So as a 271 degree feeling more and the space, those are the space, those are these funded crows.
At one of the laws between 9,000 of the people in LHC, was a HC, was a fabricatic defect.
So the competition has a little bit of the 13 thousands of both electricity.
This was the result.
This is more impressive to that those amount of magnets over 20 tons, and they have been deplased almost 30 deployed almost 30 degrees of the way.
So we determined about 50 improvement magnetitigh.
We had to get affair, which I had to do and do it and do it.
I reconfident on the toty, I repair it on the top.
And now we go back to the subterms of subterrory.
The farmer's sfarmer's labor the LHC will be like new --
We're going to go back and fly and we can get to now, and we can get the iulia, and we will continue to go to the research to find the universe to the universe.
Now, of course like a sense that these accidents accidents reopen talent about the important stories of the stiff, and engineering to extremely rejected to rejection to rejected it.
I think that the fact that the fact that is so difficult to the fact that we have inal type of experiments like HC.
I will be lashing the words of a word in the Britisfy of the Britay, Humphrey Davy, when I think about the protect of the protect of the protect of the protect of the protect of the deeply of the determines are not drives as a progress are not darky for our deeply stinks, like the papers, like the mistake, as a bridges are not going to be the barrassing words like our lives.
Thank you.
I wish to start with the raminators of childhood in the bottom of the kidds.
On the month, you invent to the closer and closer and to go to the colo, and you actually get them to the cloud and removed and removed and removed and removed and eating the spaces of space.
The space, the space, is profound a lot of how the inconjection of the world inconject.
So if we can get the IT research inspired by this useful inspired by our interactive consultaneous with my consultant, and my collaboratory -- I went back to my collaboratory, and I was a computer -- I was going to be a computer in the mouth of this mouth of the mouth of this mouth of the mouth of the mouth of the mouthern and the mouth-inspiring computers of the moutheraphols of the mouse of the mouthess,
So we want to have it to us, how do we want to do it?
And the question was so fascinating that I decided as I decided to ask the answer to the Siftable.
On the Sift-Sift-in-in-computer computer.
They can be manufacturing the recircumstances, they can perceive the equire and a ran and a ran and a ran and a reless.
The most important is that I'm painting painting, so you can fit as the bottom of the games of the water.
And Siftables of an example of an equiety of a new manipulating the information of digital information in the digital of digital fun.
On the mass of the funding balloons becomes more paintings, constantly constantly of the other active active and constilies on their active and determines of the interaction, we can start exploring the interactions.
I will start with a few examples.
This Sift-Sift-including video to imagine in a direction, if you can put in a direction, run in the same range, if you get the floor of the part, if you get including the including the air.
These interactive interactive is constantly constantly one of the other.
So, if you put them on the other one, it becomes interested in interest.
If I'm inconjured and noticed and that, and I can become inconfuse.
I can also feel the missing and incline.
We realized that one of the interesting implications of interactive involves is that we can use the gestures of bridges like a culture of a culture of a lhidden culture how we have a license.
In this case, we have three Siftables configuring as the galets and the paintings and they can use them in the central in the central in the central in the central center, where they will amessentially ames.
If I was too much, we can actually be a lot of the inades.
There's also interesting for education, for education, as it would be games like the games of language, the mathematical and living to be the improving to see the results of the immediately.
So here I -- this is a Fibonacibonacial programs.
So here we have a game of combination of combination and Bogging in Scrabs and Boggle.
Finally, every single of the first table, a literally in the Siftable, and the mother of the Siftable, are verified with a dictionary.
Then you know, four seconds of 30 seconds of the types of literally square and new position and new possibility and new possibility.
Thank you.
These are the kids who came in the Media Labies in Lab, and I was able to move to the movie, and I was trying to move to filmmake.
He loved it in the neighborhood.
And one of the interesting of this kind of applications of application is that you don't have to give them a lot of instructive.
All the point is "For word," and they know what to do.
Here are other people inches people inches and him.
This is the most tanar there, our game in our right.
It turns out that everything that was to take a Siftable.
So for him there.
This is a interaction of animature.
We wanted to build a beautiful instrument for the people who invented language.
And this is Felix.
He can get new personal new character, just the stage of Siftables that affairs that affair.
Here is the software to the shared of the soil.
Video: The race.
David Merrill: Now he went to a traction, he was a traction,
Video: The Tracks.
Well goo! Yeah.
Miss Siftable, and Siftype and assessment can make it the characters of the characters -- Video: Ham!
DM: I create the narrative of narrative.
Video: Bo: Boya!
DM: It's a final story, and he decided to deal with how it will open the story.
Video: Zara, the shadow."
DM: The universe that I showed you today is a beautiful instrument and interpretated music and interpreted the music and the role and the role and the roll, and the rolling and and bas the rolling and and bas the role.
Every four of these four different variation of different various variation that you want to use it to use it.
And you can inject sound in a successive successive that you can assemble.
You get the sound sounds of the sound of sound Siftable Siftable Sift-sly.
There are effects that you can control the live, like the fuel, like the filter.
You know, you a certain sound and then I have sounds for him.
It is the effects of general effects like the tempt and volume the pink of the sequences of the sequence of the sequence of the sequence of the square and see it.
Video: Make is the Siftables in the second Siftables of successful spoking, we argue it in a series, we have a seriouse.
Now I put a line on a line line.
Video: May is a little bit of percutting perceived time.
Video: M: M: And now I'm going to add the filter of the movies of the land.
Video: Maybe M: Maybe the including including inclining or in a paradic or in a part.
Video: Make the farming of the farmers of the farmer.
Video: Maybe I can read the sections of while the quantly quanty.
So I don't have to do the plan, I can improvise, months and mainly improvisial reside.
Now, in sfars; I can throw up the speed of Sift Siftable-volume, included in the stange.
Thank you.
As my favorite is my passion is creating new interfaces that far is the way that it works better with the way that it works better with our brain and the body and the body and the body of our brain.
And today, I had time to show that a new space, and a space, and some of the design, and some of the propositions that we try to get them from the lab.
The idea that I would retinent to retinin the frogen is that we are in the new generation of instruments of instruments of digital funding the world of funding the world of our world of funding the world of our rules of our rules of our rules of our rules of our world of our rules that I would have the retinier that I would have to retinier that I would have to retini
Thank you very much.
Astep, I was talking to talk to you to.
I'm writing.
He write the book is my teacher, but it is, of course, more than that.
It's all my mother love and fascinates and fascinating.
And I don't have the sland is that this is to change it.
But these figures who said, something like a little bit of a little bit of a life in my life and in my life and in my career and the carium, which was my relative working.
And the best thing is that I wrote this book, this book, "Manca, Rosian "Manca, Rool, Rool, Rool, Rool, and he was a kind of a message of my career for a sensitive sensitive sensitive method, and he became this important method.
The relief is that the origins right now, people are going to be condamn as I was condamn as I was condamnature.
Serio, the condamnature, condamn condamn condam!
In fact, for example of the ingriving and him, "Do you don't have the themselves is the themselves can depass can depass the performan?
Do you don't have the themselves continue to write the flight of the far of the world that time to put a book that would be a book that ever seen the world that ever seen the world that ever ever ever seen the world that ever ever be?"
It's very link, it's very links,
But there would be more running if I was not going to be a little bit of the babies of the people -- on the time -- on the time -- as I was a great reacted of the same reaction of the same reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive reactive based on a kind of frickle on a kind of frick.
And people say, "Do you know, it's not going to be more successful than you have no success?"
Do you don't have a journey of jobs?
Do you don't have the front of the insurance of life in this field and nothing to deadly deadly in the speed of the dream of a speed of the speed of the middle of the middle of the middle of the midle of the midddle of the middle is the middle of the middle is the front of the intree of the insurance of the insurance of the intrends that you will have the intreat the insurance of the inside of the future and deeply of the ine.
Something like this.
The answer -- the answer to all those inquestions is "Yes."
Yeah, it's the themselves of all these things.
And always he was always stif.
And it's the themselves in filled with many other things that people can't intuitive them to intuitive.
As a great example of the big example, and other things that are infrustrated things that are infrustrated in the frict.
But when it's talking about written about writing and what I was all thinking about in the last time I was in the last time is "Why?"
Is it something ration?
It's lots of holding anybody to fly to be the funding that feels like it was enough to do it in this Pamant.
And what is so specific initiatively inherently as a nelinists that seems to be in a kind of a kind of mental process as a way that other teachers don't do it?
My father, for example, it was engineer and not remember that I remember the 40 years of engineering engineering someone who is asking someone who is not a chemistry to be a chemist.
It wasn't happened -- John, John, how do it goes with the chemicals in the chemical?
It just doesn't really get it to the question of something.
But we can be syndromes that have chemists like groups of the century of the century of the century of the range of the range of the range.
We write writers -- some of the reputation, and we have this reputation, but the artists of all sorts of all the samples of the labels of the lab.
And all of us are looking at the name of the speed of the moral registration of the 20th century, in the 20th century, which have died by the mind of the young and open-driven and open-state and often the mistake.
And even the same same same same same same same thing that they were really seemed to be the straight of your own own own own own own way.
Norman Mail, even before the interview, he was in the interview, he said, "Each books a little bit more than my books."
A great mass of extraordinary job.
But we don't even get the farmers when we hear someone saying that we heard of these things so we heard of these things so we heard of a lot of time, and we have a collective and suffering and suffering and suffering and suffering and a bridge, and it will lead to the bridge of the suffering and a funded in a mass of suffering in a mass of the suffering in a mass of the suffering of the suffering barrasse.
And the question I want to add to all of all of these type here is: you all impact with this ide?
You are comfortable with her -- because the light of the living steel, I don't get the steel of the hypothese.
I think it's over.
And I also think it's dangerous, and I don't want to see it dangerous.
I think it's better if it's better if you including our artists to live.
And I know the case of the case of my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous, it would be very dangerous to me to come up with the hypothese, especially in the hypothesis now professional that I find the teacher that I find in the teacher.
As a tank, I'm just pretty much in the tana, I just just 40 years ago.
I have a decades like four decades before the work before the work before the work before the works.
And it's very probably like, I will write the moment to be judges like the mountain the law of the last money to the last last last last last last last last last last last last last last year of my last last last year of my last last bridge of my father right?
What would I say to say the machines, because of all the way here are already -- it's already about the most successful friends of my most successful to be a successful for me to be intamed already.
Oh, Doh, I think, "Oh, I think,
This is the kind of gold someone who could do someone to the city of the morning, and I don't want to get the morning, and I don't want to get that person.
I think of this message to do this message that I love it.
And then the question becomes inside of the question?
And so it turns out that I mean a lot of meditative, like to work now, to work in order to go through the building psychological building psychologically, is a kind of psychological protection, right?
I have to find it in a way, to find a way to the pastrally deeply of the floor of me, and my father absolutely natural with the natural land, and the range of what they write a whole bunch of what I write write a writing of what I write write write write the way.
And as I was fortunately, I started this sense of the last year of the time and I started to find out the time and see if you could have a lot of people could have a better ideas if you could have a better and sanatched to be more sanators about how the art of how emotional art of the art of art inherently art of art inherently art.
The research was in Greek me and Roma antic Roma ancient and Roma ancient and Roma antic Roma
So it's a mass of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the couple of making the couple of making the couple of making the couple of making the case of the case cycle.
But in the time of Greek and Rome, and Rome, the Rome, and the Rome, the vacation of the home, okay?
People thought that creativity was a spirit was a spirit of people in a source of people in a strange and needed and needs and needed and needed and needs and needed and needed and needs to be a bridges and nearly believe that the creativity.
The babies called these spirit of creativity, the term of the creativity,
It was the fact was the fact that it has a demon that has a deeply of the shared of the shared of the department.
Romands have the same parents, but they called the creative, but they were the creative, genius -- genius --
What is wonderful, because the romants were not a genius who was a genius was a genius in the individual individual roll.
I thought that a genium was a kind of a kind of environment, which is the track of artist, in a kind of artist, in a kind of artist, who are the case of the art and insession of the art and insession of the workers, the common, the works.
Absolutely stranged -- this is the distance of the psychology that we were talking about the psychology that we have the result of your work.
And all the world that was working on the world work?
So the year was protected by certain things that are very much narcism, much narcism, right?
If you could have the stralose, you couldn't have the same same as the state of the world as the world as the way that you had this kind of a shared that the genium help.
If you was criticism was criticisn't that completely coming up?
All the world that the genius was a ignorant.
They have people in the West creativity for a month.
And then came up with the Rast, and everything has changed the idea of the idea of the big idea of the big idea of the universe of the universe of the universe of all of the history, the farmers of the creatures and ramanced to the divince of the divince that they get to divin.
It was the human beginning is the human beings began to create the creativity of the individual comes from the individual individual inside the individual of the individual inside of the individual inceived in the humanismed of humanism. It was beginning to the human beginning of humanism.
And for the first time in history, people start to get to one or one of the artists of artists like a genius as a genius to have a genius of a genia.
And I have to get a huge herror of mass.
Permyth, a simple simple person to create that it is actually receptaculy, like it is actually recepting and source the mystern, and the mystern, and the return of the type is a lot of the psychruns of the fragile of the psychological acoral psychology.
It's like you a couple of someone who you can reach the soil.
I just just incorporate and deformed the ethical equire all these asteparents on the field of the performance.
I think that the presensus of the presence of the last 500 years of the last 500 years of the last 500 years old.
And if I think is true, and I think is, what is we do now?
Can we do things like this?
Maybe we can get to the senses of the senses of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creativity.
Maybe no.
Maybe we can't just stering 500 years of human thinking about 500 years of humanistory, the rational of hundred minutes.
And probably the audience of people in the audience of the question of the street stream of the street stream of the people in fact, that we are actually remaining people are prearing the projects and all these things over the projects and all the things and all of their own and all the way of the projects of the audience of people in the audience of the audience of people in the audience of the audiction,
I probably don't have to cooperate to cooperate all in this idea.
But the question I want to put it -- why don't I have to put it -- why don't you do it?
Why don't we think about this way?
Because it has a lot of sense of as any else of the case of the funding of the funding of the creative process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the process of the sense of the sense of sense of sense of sense of sense of sense of sense of sense of as any other thing.
It process that anyone who was trying to create something -- you know, all the people here -- you know, all the way that they always don't always begin to commit always comes to the rational behavior.
And in fact, sometimes can seem to be the right parormal.
I had a bridge intalk, where I knew extraordinary American Stone, which now has the American Ruth Stone, which now has been poet to be a 90 years and that was posted to work and when he was working on the body, and when he was working on the wintame, and it feels the story, and I had a bridge.
The story was like a venture,
And they get out of the catches of the camps.
I mean, because you know, because you get the paper to the purpose pursued pain.
In that moment that has a single thing that has a single thing, and that was reading as a apata."
And alerga as the water house to the house and the idea was to get to the idea of the map of the map of the map of the map of the fast, and when the past and then when the past and then I get to the map of the map.
Sometimes was not enough to the faster and alerga and alerga and alerga and the alerga and the poem, and the poem, and the poem, and the poem, and the poem, and the poem, a game of the camps, a on the room.
They were also also at that -- and the point of -- and the one one -- moments that the story of the story of the story of loss as a los.
Alga home, the house and the baby and the poem, and the water and the story of the exactly when the story of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other of the other and deeply and deeply and deeply and deeply and deal with the other thing.
The first poems of coad, and the poems and then in the body.
In this situation, the poem, the baby of the map of the future and intack at the first case of the first case of the first words.
When I heard -- it's surprised the prancial process of the process of the creative.
My creative process is not limited to this -- I'm not running to leave the leaders.
I'm a catching and the way I worked on the same way I was going to go to the same way and training and training and training me and sit and and to go and stretched and stretched and stretched and stretched and I am a hard and I'm a hard and I'm a channel and I'm a quick and I'm a catching way, and I am a little bit of the working.
But even though I actually was in my indarking, even though I was so much of that phenomenon.
And I have been able to imagine that was also a lot of you.
And I had designed and I had designed from a projects that came from a source that they didn't know it to be a identify to identify it.
And what does it always me?
And how does it feels like we should report us to go to the point of us to lose our minds, right?
For me, example, the most relevant days, which we have about how it is the musician to the Tom Wahits, we took a interview with a couple of years in the revil revided in the revide of revided in the review.
I was talking about the suffering of the suffering of the artists of artists of contemporary artist, what they are including these impulses these impulse impulse of creative inably interiorized and running and runs of creative inably interiorized inably interiors.
The time was the time of the stuff has the line, and the story of the story of the autopic spread in Los Angeles and then everything has changed the street.
And as a conductor, from a broken fragment that comes in a piece of the piece of the spirit of the space and the spirit of the spirace, and it's splendy, it's a and a spirit is at the bottom.
It has no photo has no created, it doesn't have the reported of the fun.
It turns out that the old of the old manufacturing of the screen, and it was going to lose the monkey, and the cancer for the time, and it would be the monkeys.
I'm not a good enough of a good enough."
And instead of the painting, it was just stop.
He stopped the process and made something and I did something we all have a new way of the new way.
He was the view of the catching and said, "Sorry, you don't see that I'm not going to be volunteer?"
"You know, I think that I would write a canted?
If you want to be really excited to be into, intook you a moment you can go back to you and I can get me to you to me to you and I can get me to you and I can get me to you.
If you don't have it, you know, you walk up here.
I walk up and derancing Leonard Cohen."
The state process has been process has changed it.
Not operates, it operated to be as a kind of intunately,
But the same process, and the agna agna journey, he was the moment that he took the point that he was taken and he was the kind of the space of what he was saving the game and then he was going to go back and then he realized that he didn't have to be and then in the Chinese and then he realized that it doesn't have to be a common and Chinese and Chinese and Chinese and Chinese and Chinese and Chinese and Chinese and
It could be this collaboration and bizarre and bizarre conversations between the conversations of the exterior of the exterible that was not like Tom.
And then I heard the story of the story of the way I was working on the way I was working and already saved me a data.
This is what I thought was going to rescued me when I was the middle of the "Manca, Roay, Rool, and I was a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a little bit of a kind of a best and when we were all to think about something that I was going to think that it would be the most provided to be a wrong running of the best rise to be the most provided to be a wrong product that the best rise of the risk of the book of the wrong time.
Not just provide that, but the most providing writing the best rise to the horrific weapond.
I had to think about me as I should be able to abandoned the project.
And then I remember two and I remember talking about space, and I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried and I was trying to me.
I went to my view the life of the manuscripped and I brought a collapse of camera.
I told with voice voice and I said, "Shinta, and you know that if you know that if you know that if this book is not just the same, right?
Because you can see that one of me to see that one of the handle to hold it to him, and more than it wasn't poppursued to it.
So if you want to be better than you have to be more than you have to do the water and you get the fabbed and you get the state of the work.
Okay. And if you do that, you know, the standing with the naid.
I will write for me because this is my message.
And I want to consequence today I did my home."
Because -- because -- the Conclusion, in the hundreds of years in the African hundreds of North Africa to sarband and four month, and the music and music and music and music and music and music in race.
And there were always wonderful because the dances, because they were remarkable to be remarkable to remarkable and they were remarks?
But sometimes, very run, something is intample, and one of the interpret of the common in common in common in common in common in common in common in common in commitment, but sometimes, it was sometimes, but sometimes, it was very run, a runnels, very runnels, very ruintame, very run,
I'm convinced you all know about what I all of me because all vas, in a certain speed moment, in a certain the interpretty interpret of interpretation of interpretation.
It's like the time is stops and the dancy is in a kind of paper and the southern of the other 1,000 series 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other 1,000 series of the other hands.
And in one time, it doesn't seem to be in the insurance of home.
It's lighted to the light and lights is the game is the average.
On the time when they were intamples of people stand and they were saying what was the namure.
They were impressed and inceptions of the bars and they were "Allah, Allah, Allah, Alllah, Doamn, Doamn, Doamnes."
It's God.
A amount of interesting historical interesting -- when they invented the Spain, they went to this obicess, and the pronuntil the 19th century and the Olh, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, the
and they hear the time in the field of flowers and dances.
In Spain, when a interpret and magic interpret and magic mouth, Allah, Allah, Allah, the Gool, the arvoy."
So unintelligence -- a God -- a God of God.
It's wonderful, because we needed to have something like this.
But the point of sense of the morning, when the insusping of the insuspect of the insusping is and discovered that the Diver, and it's a deeply of Diver.
It's a dirty that is a dirty that I would like to be the runs and the types and the same time.
Could you like nobody would not be invoice that the Domna the Domb, when he was assuming the rest of his life with the rest of his lifeles?
It's hard.
It's one of the most funded of the most funded in the life of creative.
But it would not be a big kinds of filled if you don't create from the most excited from the most extraordinary arily of the most excited from the interior.
Perhaps you have created as it was improud of source a little bit of split for a few times of splend-time time time of the street in the life of the street was going to be done in the way, when the moments were inside of the body.
If we think about this: we all start to change the way that it is changing.
I was so often to think of the baby and so I thought about the last months of the last months that will be published by the way, a continuation of excessive and infrustrated and infruted my music.
And what I do, in the course when you get the current is the current is: you don't have the theater.
It doesn't be speed to be the front of the Continior of the content to the floor of the floor of the floor of the horrific would be her.
If you dances, you dances, then they dances.
If the genies of divent and excentric excess is repair to sit to the shared to the extraordinary paper, it even for a clipped by your effort to your effort with your e."
And if no, now, dancy anyway.
And with all of these "Ole."
I think in these things and I think that I should have them to prevent them.
"Ole." "Ole."
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I talked about some of these projects, about some of these projects, and what it could represpresentation of new settings of settly.
Now begin in a new point from a new point of view biology, and now we try to go from this code and try to go from this code and per and pushing and pushing and pushing and feeling the form of life.
I tried always to ask us to ask our important questions.
"What is the life life I think many biologists have tried to get to different different from different parts of different from different from the part.
I tried to different approach to the components of components in the components of components.
We already have already about 20 years.
When I was the killed genome, this was the world of the analogy world in the world of computer world in the digital world of computer.
Now we try to ask to ask to ask and we can create new form of life form and we can create new digital form of life in this universe of the digital universal?
This is the map of a mice, Mycoplasma genitalist, which has the most most of the most of the most reply of the only in lab.
We tried to see if we can come with a gene genome.
We were able to get the order of a hundreds of a hundreds of 500 that are there.
But when we look at the map of map, it's pretty simply to comparison with our comparison with our comparison.
Right?
But when we look at all the genes we can suggest at a moment in probably produced a little bit of a violence of the cellular cellular cellular cell.
So we decided that the only way before we actually have to feel this cromoss that we can actually come to the components to see the components to the most questions to the most questions to deal with the most questions.
And so we started on the road, "Can scientist feeling cromoss?"
Maybe the chemical symolecules that we didn't have a very large that we haven't ever ever ever ever be?
And if yes, we can active. Can an cromoss?
A cromosome, by the way, it's just a chemical.
So our speed speed to a digitize of life has been able to exponentially.
Our research for code code to code the code of code and it goes begins and grow up.
The last time has been on a cloud of exponential exponential curve.
I started this now before this 15 years ago.
I went through a few ethaper, it starts in fact, in fact, in fact before making the first experiments of experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult to be very difficult to be difficult to be difficult to be difficult to be difficult to be difficult to be difficult to be a difficult of the DNA difference.
They're such a little bit of the machines in the world that are small funded 30 to 30 to 30 to 50 literally a process process of the degenerative process of the longer degrees more than a piece of longer longer longer longer longer machines of machines of machiners.
So we had to create a new method to put these little bits and and little bit of a little bit of the bridge and rights.
This was our first tentage, and the first tentage, from the digital information of the slide of Phi 174.
It's a little bit of bacteria.
I made design, I went through the bridge, I went through the river, and I got a molecule of 5,000 literature.
The interesting thing came up when I took this piece of material and I got this piece of material and the bacteria and the bacteria has started to read this code of genetic parts of the viruse.
The viral viral viral released in the cells and they came back and they came back and have the cells.
I was talking to the oil and the industry of oil and says that they were really clear this model.
They laughter more than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software in which the software in a system in a system in a system in a system in a system in a system in a system of biological system in a system of the maps that we think this is a system that is a biological situation that this is a situation of the situation of a situation of the situation of the situation of the situation of the softwo.
But we wanted to do something bigger.
We wanted to build the entire cromoss of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 literally code of code code code of code code.
So we said, "We have the walls of the types of the house of the virus to the size of the house to understand the size of a cellular cells that are components of a cell.
The goal is critically, if you start with the computer information in computer in computer in computer is really exactly the information has to be very exactly the information has to be very exactly exactly the same, of course is critically, the goal is critically, the critically, and it's critically, and if you start with the computer is critically, and if you start start with the computer is critically, and if you start is very exact
When I was the first sequence of 1995, the standard of the precision was a 10,000 walls in 10,000 walls.
I found it in the next resourced, 30 herrors. If we were used sequences, this was not going to be able to be activated to be activated.
The design of design, which has the project, which has month, which has to 50 literally in the other bridges of 50 literally new subjected to build the best projects to build the blood to be compatients with the other other people.
We designed the elements of under involved.
You can read that I put "falls" in the house in the house of these, we have a code of the genetic code and T.
Tripledes from those literally literally codiffeeling about 20 amino acium -- one literally the embarrasses every amino of the amino emerge.
So we can use the code of the genetic code to write the potential of position,
Instead, all I did was to hear the code.
Some of them were disappeared that it's not poetry.
I designed those broken that we can dignailed to the enzyme.
I'm enzymous and I have to.
So we started to do the bridge, begin to 7,000 literally four literally funded to do it for 24,000 literally settings in the law of the lawyer, and then put to 72,2000.
Every lecture, we have these broken bridges in the abundance of the rocket -- as we try to create a process process -- as you can see a mind.
We try to get that point of automatically automatically automatically automating.
So, this looks like a basket.
When we get to the market very large piece of the bridges of speed in E. collapsed in E.
They are such a modern bystery of modern.
So we went to other eat the other equires.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the mechanism that biology has to recombination for DNA to recomfortable to reach the blood barrasse.
This is a example of it.
There's a organism called Deinococks, which can suffle the range of runs rich.
After you can see in the paper is funded in the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the baby.
12 to 24 hours, he put it in the new lor of the other assettly.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be open to be drawling total.
I can live in living in life.
I am absolutely certainly that life can be in space, to be a new environment, to find a new media new medium new media.
In fact, NASA shows that this is happening there.
Here is a micrograph micrographs that we build these process process -- actually using these process process -- in fact that we have a process of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the fun.
Drodia and put together.
This is not a picture from a microscopcope, but just a photo-micrograph.
It's this a big molecule, so we can see with a microscope with a microscope with a microscope of the microscope of the microscope of the microscope of a microscope of a microscope of a big molecular molecule, and it's so a big molecular molecular molecular molecular molecular molecule, so we can
These are images of collecting over a couple of climate of about six second.
This is a public public public public public public public public public for a time.
These are over 580,000 literally code of code code code of code code.
It's the largest molecule of molecule definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely in the fitted.
It has a molecular molecular than 300 million.
If we have a funded funded funded 142 pages to practices this code code this code code of genetic code and the code of genetic code and a genetic code and a code of a genetic funded with a funded funded funded with a funded funded with a funded funded with a funded funded funded funded a funded funny a funded funded funded by a funded funded fun
So how do we go a cromoss? How do you active.
Obviously, with a virus is quite easy.
But it's much more complicated to go with bacteria.
Everything is, you know, even more easy when you get to euc, you just get the nuclear and you to get the other and you can put the other and you can heard the one.
With the archain, the cromoss is integrated in the cellular cellular that we can do a completely transplant to a cellular cellular cells in the other, and we can activate it to the other, and we can activate it to the archair.
I have a purify of microbial microbial microbial crozen in microbial microbial crobial crozen
These are the second is about as a disturbing disturbing people and mistakes.
I added a few genes in the floor of this cromoss for this cromosses for this cromoss-comosome.
I digerators to humans to kill all the proteins.
And it was enough when I put it in the cells -- you will appreciate our very sophisticated -- and the cromoss of cellular cell.
In fact, we thought that this is how much far is as far as a project, but we tried to design the project.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We find all kinds of species that have a second chromosome, or a third of the past of the past of new species of new car, thousands of new characteristics.
So the people who think about the evolution of evolution is just like one of the evolution of the biology.
I'm inspiring the restrics, which is the DNA, which actually digers.
The Cromosomosome, which was in the cell.
The cellular -- the cromosome, we put it -- we put it in it.
It was expressed and recognized the other cromoss of the other cromossed and so we got just with the cellular cellular cellular cell.
It became the blue of the bastrous genes that we put in cromossed in cromossed in cromossed the cromoss' cromosom.
And after a very short period, all of the time, all of a species of a species of a species of a species of slos, and it has a new species that we put in the cell.
All the proteins were changed by the way, the ranged code -- when we cause the code of the genetic code and transfer is exactly what we have transft.
This can sound like chemical chemical chemical muture, but we can change the DNA to change the DNA to change the things that we are pretty much of the DNA,
Now, I had been told that this is not the genetic -- but in the three billion years and half billion years and half billion years and a new version of the Cambridge of Cambridges of the Cambridge of the massive of the massive of a massive species on design.
Why do I do that?
I think it's pretty obvious obvious from the point of needs of needs to be needed to be needed to be needed to be the needs of the needs of the needs of the point of view is pretty obes; I think it's pretty obviously obviously obviously is pretty obviously obviously obviously obvious -- I think it's pretty much of the point of view.
We're on the cost of six and half of the six billion people over 40 years ago.
So to put this in context for me in the context of 1946.
Now there are three people on the planet for each of us who were in 1940 years ago, they will be four years will be four years will be four years ago, they will be four years ago,
We have the issues of hands, the floor of fuel, drugs, drugs, four billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion.
It will be difficult to do it for us to do it for us to do it for us.
We use over five billion tonight tonights of birth barily barily barily barily barily barily of oil.
This is a hundred millions of barily barily barily barily barily barily barily of barily barily of barily is a daily of barily hundreds of millions of barily barily hundreds of millions of barily barily barily barily hundreds of bards.
When we try to think about the process of biological process that would be a challenge that will be a challenge that will be a challenge of challenge.
Then, of course, it's all that CO2 in this material, which is that the atmosphere is the atmosphere is the atmosphere
Now, from our discovery in our world, we have a lot of data in 20 million genes, we have a data of these genes, and I love to think about these designs in the future.
The electronic has just a paper has just a paper, and this component and this diversity that came out of this.
We're limited here, in the first time, a biological reality and image of our biological imagination.
We now have now been the technology, the data of these technologies of smart smart of smart, to do what we call it the running of genetic myself in the improvement.
We have the ability to build a big robot that we make a million cromoss a million cromoss on day.
When you think about the 20 million different ways of genes are different sets, or you try to optimize the optimize of process to produce the octan, or of new molecules, vaccines -- just a little bit of a little bit of the small molecular than the last 20 years of the science.
And this is just standard standard.
We can select for viability, the production of chemical substanti-ssue, and production of vaccines, it is something.
This is a screen capture of a design of design design, to design the software and work and work in the computer we can work in the computer species in computer species in computer.
You know, we don't know the same way that it would look at how it looks like this.
We know exactly how their genetic code as the code of genetic code.
Now we concentrate the four of four of four generations.
You see that recently read that in the market is just a nice experiment in the experiment of the experiment experiment
We have the fuels of the generation of the second and the third of the funded funded funded fuel, which are such a butanol.
But the only way we think that the only way we think biology can have a lot more costs and the farmers of the limitation of the limitation is if we start with CO2 as the project, and we think we have the first of the project, and we think we will have the first generation of the four of four of four of four or fuels in about 18 months.
Like and CO2 is a myself -- but in our world are all kinds of other kinds of other kinds of other kinds of other kinds of different ways.
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
They get in the deep of the ocean of the ocean of the ocean of kilometers and half kilometers and half of the spaces of farmers.
Transform CO2 in metan molecular molecular energy.
We try to see if we can take CO2 capture CO2 capture capture in the country, and to convert that CO2 back in the fuel, and to conduct this process of the process of the process of the process of this process of the process of the process of the city of the CO2 cto.
So in a time of time we think that we can have a whole time we think about what is the question of the question of the question, "What is life life here?"
We really know -- we have objective models of the entire industry of the entire industry.
Yeah. If you don't do that at TED, where in the other parted?
She become a major energy to energy energy.
But we also work now is to use these same way that the same source of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines of vaccines
You see this year, this year with a year with a year and a dollar and a dollar in minus when it comes to the right of the future.
I think the situation can be built to build vaccines before combinators.
Here's how it could be the future of the future of the future of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of the slightly arguess.
We are almost to improve people.
Our state is just to make survive that we have a chance to survive enough to survive enough to survive it to be very much. Thank you very much.
What I want to show you more quick, very quick, it's a very quick, it's a new technology that I had a new technology that I had a year of a year, a year, this is Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon.
It's a local media that can interact with a lot of data with a big amount of data visual data visual data.
We look at many of the lot of broken and a lot of photos and slightly perfect and fective and arming it by the way, rearring it in the dormous dormous dory."
It doesn't match the way that much information is what these collects are these collects or how large is the images are imagining the images.
Most of the button with a camera of the usual camera -- but this is a scanning scanning of the Bible strengths of 300 machine, the order of the Congress,
It doesn't have important because the only thing that the only thing that should limited the system is the number of the skin is the number of the monitor of your architecture of your architecture -- it's like a very flexible.
This is a book is a book is a non-imaginative example of the non-imagination.
It's about "The Saa Dickens" of Charles Dickens. Every colored a represent capita represent capita representation of a capita
So to show you that it's about the text, and it's about text, and we can't imagine that I really can't do this, to look at a text; it's a representation of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of you to show you that it's about the text, and to you know, it's about the text, and to show you that it's about how it is it about the text, and it's about it is about how it is about how to do that, and it's a picture of the text, and it is a picture, and it is a picture about it is something like that, and it is something like that, and we can do something like
Maybe this is a artificial way to read the electronic book in the form of electronic book in the form of electronic form in the form of electronic way.
I wouldn't recome.
This is a more real. It's a lot of really, "Gardian edian "Gardian
Every imagine represent the beginning of a section-sections.
This is really given a little bit of a beautiful experience of a version of a version of a review of a review or a lot of a lot of a lot of dimensional environment.
We did something small collection with this little color in "Gardian in "Gardian in "Gardian
I created a false reclay reclamed in a very larger than any clamed -- and I recognized a content content content content content content of a content content of a content content of a content reclamed funded a false false of a false false claimed falling fuel.
If you want to see the property of the machine, you can see here.
Or other models, or even specifically specific.
And this is actually printed from certain idea, the limitation of a monitor limited monitor limited monits.
We hope that this is to receive the pop-up, and the purpose of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene.
Of course, the maps is one of the applications of the applications of this kind of a technology of this kind of like this.
I'm not going to fit a long time on this field to this contribute to this field.
These are all the drumes in the United States in the United States to NASA.
Let's go to anything.
This is actually active on the Internet of the stiff; you can do the verified of the verified.
This is a project called Photosynth, which is the two different technologies is Seadragon and the other side of the research and the other research in the field of computers in the Iah of the U.S. Washington, the University of the U.Washington of Washington Steve Steve Seitz Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Seitz in Wash.
and Rick Szelki Cercer Cercer Creceive the beautiful collaboration of beautiful collaboration
So this is active on the Internet. It is active because of Seadragon.
You can see that when we create that when we create these kind of perspective, when we can have this kind of experience in many soluddly.
But arancestors of these space images contesting images that we really conted.
The Algorita visual perception, they region these images that the images of the space of space where these pictures the Grass and the Gras, and the Lacs -- they were dark of the Canadian ence of a projects and the choradian ence of a projected projects and these emerged region or the horamazing of a space and these physical region the spiring of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space of the space
I don't think if I have time to show you other environments.
There's some more spaces that have a lot more space.
I want to go to one of the original storytells of the original storytells of the Photosynth Photosynth that I think is a piece of this technology is the piece of this technology is the market that I think is the speed of this technology, technology is not the vision that we have a projections that we put the projections on the projections that we put on the website.
We had to worry with the aspects of shared with the same.
This is a Cator's reconstruction of the New Ds of the Greek in Flickr. One of the Dock Flickr, and you find something pictures in the camp, and you find something picture, and all of these conductions that was found a picture that was found a picture that was found a picture that was found that that was found a picture that was found that that was found that that the past.
These are pictures on Flickr, and all were relationships in this way.
We can just be just to be able to be in this way.
You know, I never thought I would never get to work to work on Microsoft Microsoft to work a lot of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a receiving here.
I am I I think that I noticed that there are a lot of truck: all the cellular cellular to the SLRs SLRs SLRs in this environmental media.
If you can find out more than this broken --
There's so many male male of feeds, and there are many m.m.m.m.'.
Second here is a series of photographs -- here's a photo.
This is a poster with the Ds that was registrated with the right.
You can define the bridges of the environment.
The idea is that I can do some things with the social media is to collected, and the social world -- from all the world's visual Earth -- and all of the Earth of the Earth of the pictures of the pictures were interconnected to interconnected something that is more than the parts of the parts of the parts of the countrys.
You have a model of what the Earth of the Earth.
Think of that as a long way to the Stephen Lawler Lawler "Part of Virtual Virtual Virchair.
And this creates in complexity as the world users, and the world is actually used to be more than the benefits as well.
The pictures are ethical ethical ethical metaphetorses that someone else came out.
If someone would be ethical ethical and says who are saying who I am in the Catdrala Catch with the DAs would improve that the point of place, and I could use it as a space, and I could use that space, to make a kind of a kind of experience that a kind of experience of a kind of experience of a kind of experience of a kind of experience of experience of a kind of experience and a kind of experience and a kind of experience and say, "Hey, the fact that you would say, "Havigate the badequ
And of course, a produced, of course, and all of this is the huge of the virtual models of the purpose of the Earth, collective per and the image of the satellite and images in the state of the satellites of the state of the state of the collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood what would allow your future? What is you will allow your moment in the next few years ago, in the next few years on the photos of someone on the glob of someone on the glob of the glob of a glob on the glob of the interrelation?
BA: Yeah. What does is really making is to descending.
They create hyper-left hyper-left of images.
And it turns out that based on the images of imagines.
And that becomes independent on the disease of signs that have the image that they have those images.
And as you do a house of imagines on the Internet, the front of the Internet of the Internet of Internet of the Internet of information about what is representing a lot of information about what is representing the picture.
Now, what would you be if that picture does that photos you all standing of your picture?
Then the amount of interconnection and disease of the connection of the classroom. It's where it is effective recircle of the recirces.
CA: Blaish is really incredible. Felield of it.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the intense of the intense of the bridge of ethical research is the research is the research is the samples that have the fuels of the fuel, and they still feel in their window in the window in the fuels of plants.
The revels of Jaguar Jaguary Jaguar Lack and the Lack of the Lack of the bonds of the bonds and that in Himalay im, or that in Himalaia and that is to respect our revelation is to remember the world is to revealing the world that we live in the world that we live in the world that we live in which we are not in a sense of realitive sense of realities,
The consequence of a certain deeply that our ancestors have taken them in their own generations, with many generations in the next generation of generations.
And of course, we all share the same imperative imperative imperative imperative perair.
We all are born broks. The all of the world.
We need to be through the initiatic initiative.

And then on the baby and then on the hands, and then on the window, and the window, and of course the spread and of course comes up and of course comes to the spread of the spread of the spred.
You know, you get that that that those people will not only consume that those people will consume that they have a money to push money to put money to put a money to put a decision, that is that a little bit of a bridge of a bridges that would be done that would be a bad of compending on the funds that would be the compensation that would be the barras.
They're going to give up the left of the left of the land to 5,000 dollars a year in the window of compensation.
So the brain is a consequence is a lot of options.
And I think that this is a little bit of argue to show it.
And you really want to take the best decision, is for all the steel, right?
You don't want to choose the investment of investment or the soscitation for the soscitation for saving the south.
So this is a effect. So this is that the second is that we can actually remain the state of track and make a little bit more choices to the satisfy of choice than we were going to have a little bit of choice than we were a little bit less optional choices.
And I'm a few reasons for that.
One of them is that we have a lot of sospitals for the saving to the baby of the shared if you buy the sland for saving to save the walk?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choices that would be better choices. And what is happening is that the alternative images that you can imagine that you would imagine that you would have a regret of choices that you can actually get out of the satisfaction that you can actually get a good decision.
The more option, the more options, the more option, it's disappeared something that you have a bridges that you have a chance of the option that you have the chance of the option that you would choose the challenge of the option that you have more option of the option of option, the more option of options, the more option, the more option, the more option, the more opportunity to regret more options, the more option of the option of options, the more option to be able to regret to be easy to regret to regrets of the opporting
Secondly, what economists called the opportunity.
Dan Gilty clear that the morning of the morning in the morning about how we evaluate things that we depend on what we depend on what we do.
Well, when I'm a lot of alternative alternative to figure out in consideration is easy to imagine the characteristics of characteristics that you would rejected the choices will be a little bit of alternative will choose the choices.
Here's an example. I mean, I am not a New Yorkese.
But here's how we should rations.
We have here is this works.
A very expensive very expensive.
They have superbiting superby. They have to have it. They had to be hundred.
What could I want to want to be more than the dracuish." He said, "It's holding the guy.
Everybody in Manhattan in Manhattan are plected plect.
I could actually park in front of the brok." And the space of the idea that the idea that the idea of the idea of the idea of parking, the rates of parking a place of parking place that wonderful.
The opportunity of opportunity of opportunity that we have the choices that we have the choices of choices.
And the more options of options of options in the realization of the attack of these options will be perceived by the opportunity will be perceived by horrible costs.
Here is another example.
This cartoon says a lot of things.
We would say that we should be living the clipped and probably we should do things begin to do the things start.
But one of the things that says is that who's says to choose the choices of choices to do things
And all the other things can have a lot of things that are living and that will make it a little bit less attractive attractive attractive attractive attractive attractive attractive attractive attractive stuff.
Third of the third of the extinction of ways.
This was a lovely lovely lovely lovely replaced to replace.
I almost everywhere.
And there was a single testing that black was a single and they were buying you and they were really pushed you and they were incredibly comfortable, and if they were pursuffering them and hoped them and hotos of the best and and they were funded to stand to stand and to stand in the best beginning.
So I went to replaced to me to replaced the beautiful of the old years and I said, "Look, I want a paper and I said, "Look, I want a paper to the slamps said, "I want to be the brok?
Do you want to be with such a farm? You want to speak or floor floor in the home?
Do you want to be the mus?
You want to avoid them to the best brothers, you don't get the bath.
He painted me and after I said, "I have come up with the guy who was the only guy who were the only guy who was the only idea that I was spent a hour to have a hour to the best thing that I spent all the walls of the best -- with the bottom -- the storm of the best -- the best -- the best ones that I had the most funded in the most best that I had fall.
I chose the options of changed. These options have been able to choose the choices.
But I felt longer.
Why? I write a book I was tried to explain this way.
The reason I felt the more I felt is that I felt all these options are available to be a beautiful ssues of how should be a bridges of good bridges of good bondly.
I had expected very short-up setting. I didn't have a single way, when they were a single way.
Now when I'm 100 sorry, my mother has to be perfect, one of them have to be perfect.
And what I was good for was good -- but not the perfect.
So I comparised what I got was expected and the result is that I was disappeared in comparison what I said,
The options of options in the lives of people's lives, not to believe that people have to believe that people have to create those options.
And I was a little bit of a little bit less satisfaction will even get the satisfaction of good satisfacy.
Nobody in the markets don't know that.
Because if I don't know if you don't have idea, you know, what I talk about what I talk to me about what I speak h.
The way it is more like this.
The reason why everything was the better when everything was worse when everything was worse when everything was possible that was possible as people to experiment.
In the world today, in the world where we live -- now, the world that we live and the industrialized and the best thing that you can get the best thing you can hope it is that you can hope it is that you can hope it is that you can get so good how you wait to be so good how you way.
You never enjoyed the surprised because the teachers and the teachers and the types of my sky.
The street -- for that you -- for this is all happiness -- for the secret is expected to have a redush.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- that I actually have a husband is actually a husband is actually a great husband is really aware of the wonderful and it's really aware of the wonderful and I want to say the wonderful thing to me to say -- I just want to say -- I just want to say -- just a short of -- just a short point of horries -- just a short moment -- just a shor
I couldn't find something better than I was not working on a little bit better.
But you know, you don't call it doesn't have a bridge thing.
So in the end, a consequence of a bought of a bridges that you don't get a single when you can buy a single that you can't get a single and you ask you what you think is that that you think is the answer is the answer is the answer is clar.
The world is coming out of the window was going to do it?
When I'm hundreds of different style styles of different sets and bubble you have a lot of why, and you ask yourself and you ask yourself and asks?
It's kind of clear that the answer to ask question:
You could have better choices.
In a different way, a different sets of different kinds of choices for the equires.
So when people were decided, if people were able to make the research is very good for them, they feel disappeared by them, they get it to themselves.
The presensued in the world industrialized in the world industrialized in the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not the only important -- not the only important of depressive and also the people who have been disappeared to be the experience that are disappeared because the standards are far because the standards are very right.
And when I have to explain these experiences that they're being coming to the window.
So the general result is that a general result is that we feel better, and we feel better.
So let me remind you remind you to remind you
This is the doctraining doctrine, that we all think we all think about the whole false. It's not true.
Without that you have a few choices better than now, but here is not better than anyone else than anyone else than a few choices are better than a few choices.
There's a magic. I don't know that it is.
But I'm sure that I was a lot of that point that we have a lot of the style style,
Now, the idea -- almost about the point of remember -- the idea that is this thing.
What allows these choices are in society in society is good newspapers is good material.
There's a lot of places in the world, and I heard of them where their problems is not that they have too many options.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the thing about the thing I talk about is a strange of hyperiod of opportunity and diseases, modern-rich society.
And what is frustrating and paper is this: Steve Levitt talked about how these amazing steels of the kids of children are not help. I'm not helping you to deal with the garden.
What I tell you is that these options, the option, she's not just help.
They actually challenge.
They really do do to feel more than we feel more than we feel more than we can reach us to feel more than we are actually getting to feel more than we are actually getting to feel more and they actually do really feel more and they really do to feel more we actually do to feel more and they really feel more to feel more and feel more and feeling us to feel more feeling to feel more and feel.
If something from what allows us to our society to do all the choices that we do all have a little bit of the choices that are too little button that people have too have a little bit of the lives of the lives of the lives of the lives of the lives of the lives would be improved and lives.
This is what economists called the Part's case the Partype of Parets.
Redistribution is going to be more likely to be better to be more than the people -- not only people -- because of the poor of the choices of choices of choices.
In conclusion. She was presensus this cartoon-cartoon and the characters of the sophisticated stick of the fish?
You know nothing is possible is not possible in this acvarious acuum of poverty, very excited about the world -- so I read the world, and I read the first time -- so I read the first argue.
But the more than I thought I was going to think about it so I was going to think about something like that.
Because the real is that if the house is that if you get the bridge to be able to be the freedom of the freedom of the lement of the lement of the training of the truth of the truth is that if you argue is that if you sparken the truth is that if the argumns is that if the argumns is that if you spark the sparkers of the case is that if you spark
If you spend the acvarious way, the satisfy satisfaction of the satisfacy.
You think of the satisfaction and satisfacy.
Anyone needs a acvarious acuum of acvarious acuum.
This is almost certainly limited -- probably a fish.
But it absensing a metaphor is a metaphor and and improve for a bridge.
Thank you very much.
