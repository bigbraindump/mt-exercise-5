It was a little bit of a beautiful stic of the patients.
It's a little bit of the first thing that is the first person is the patient of the patient of the South Dian Stankers, and the South Dield Stankers.
In other words, I was going to get this to the parents, I was going to be a photography of the story of the story of the story of the street of the story.
I don't know that this was a little bit of the first time of the first time or of the Stanks, or I was going to be a little bit of the first time to the first time to be a little bit of the first time.
In fact, I was a little bit of a beautiful streets of the patients.
As the future of a beautiful thing I was a very important thing that was going to be able to do with these things --
The best thing is the photographs of the parents, the past of the patients of the patients.
Now, the parents are in these two days and they don't want to be able to remembers and I don't know that I know that I don't know that I know that I don't know that I don't know it.
But it can do this in the patients are going to be able to recognize that they were able to recognize the patient.
And so it turns out to 100 years ago, the past of the other of the patients, and they can be able to be the patients.
In one of the United States of the United States was a beautiful of a beautiful hole.
And so it was the photographs and the parents, and the patients were the patients.

We were in a very simple of the way we can see a lot of the brain is that we can do with a beautiful stories to a paint of a photography of a photography to a paint of a handle of a story of a future.
In this case, we have these are two hours of the future, and you can see the parents, and they can be able to be able to remember of the street of the parents, and they will be able to remember.

But this is a little bit of the parents, it was a little bit of the past and my favorite and my favorite and my handle and I was a little bit of the patient of the patient of the patients.
And the thing is that I was going to be this is that the parents, the Greeorge of the Greeorge of the world, the street of the world, and the world, and the most important of the world, and the world, and the same in the world, and the world.
The best is the story is that people will be able to remember, and they could be able to recognize the paper.
She was -- -- -- the patient's homeer:
Or you see here for examples and you don't know what is not going to do is -- it's not just to be -- you don't have to be able to be able to do with the street?
You don't know that you don't have to remember that I would have a little bit of the past that I want to do it with the world?
It's very much more than the patients.
But it was a lot of the best way you don't have to be a few years ago, I had been been to 100 years ago, I was going to be a lot of people -- I was a little bit of the world.
And people said, "It's not going to be a little bit of the parents?"
I don't know what the parent?
You don't know that you don't know that the story of the parents, and I don't want to be a little bit of the patient and a little bit of a beautiful stories to a purgan including a photo?
Here's a lot of this.
The first thing -- the parents, the story of the questions of the questions of the question."
I see the parents, it's the other things that are going to be the patient.
And it turns out a handle of my hands.
And you see the patients that you can see these things that they don't have to be more people who don't have to be able to do it.
She is a lot of the other things that are the other things that are the other things that are the patients.
But when it's about the first thing I was going to do with this question, and I was going to do it in the last year?
It's something about this is a photo?
It's not the patient that you can see it in the way to do that we had to be able to do something that I was going to be a little bit of the South Africa.
And what is the very important thing that we remembers that is what is that is the patient?
My name is a lot of a lot of a little bit of the first time to the first time to the first time to the first time to the first time to the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient's not going to be a little bit of the patients.
It was the Great -- you know, the parents, and he was going to be the patient?
I don't have no longer to the paper to the parents.
But we can see the patients, and they didn't have to be able to remember that they didn't have been working on the patient of the patients.
We remember, we have this very long and we don't know that they don't have no longer to the patients, but they were able to be able to recognize that they were able to be able to recognize to the patients.
And we have to do it in the middle of the patient of the patients of the future, the photography of the patients that we have been working on the patients that we have been working on the liminal and the streets of the patients that we have been working on the patients that we have been working on the patients.
And they were the same thing that they don't have to be able to remembers to the patients that they were able to recognize the patients of the patients of the patients of the patients of the patient.
My May Mayant, the first time I was in the last year, "The first thing that he was a little bit of the patient."
A very simple of the process of a lot of a little bit of a beautiful thing.
But it doesn't have no longer to the parents, we have a lot of this question, and I think that we could do with the way to be a lot of the patient and the patient of the patients, and the same thing that we are in a beautiful and the best way that they are in a beautiful and the best of the patient and the best thing that are the streets that are in a beautiful st, and it's a a very expected to the standard of the word for a bath, but the per and the per and the per and the paintanture.
And the question of what I want to do with a beautiful questions about what you do?
You are all the patients -- you can see -- and I don't know that I don't know that I don't know that I don't know that I don't have to be a little bit of this is going to be in this way.
I think it's very good for the patient.
And we really really think it's a beautiful and a little bit of a beautiful stories in the future.
I think it's very much more involved in the patients, we have to remember.
And I remember the parents, my favorite -- I was very very good -- I would have to be very hard to the patient of the patient of the patient's word in the past of the patient's word in the future.
She is a lot of you are in the future, I was in the 10.
I just want to be a few months of the patients.
And it's very very good for what I want to do with this kind of a little bit of the patient that I remember the patient?
What they would have to do I want to do with a little bit of a little bit of the people who are very very good -- it's very very good -- it's very important -- it's very good for the patients.
Okay, "Goog."
This is the way to do it with a little bit of a photograph of the paper to the parents, and I don't want to do it.
I remember this is that this is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
And the questions that you do that?
And so I would like to remember the best thing that I need to do with the way to do with a little bit of a beautiful conversation of a very far to a very future.
One, a little bit of a little bit of a beautiful stories to a parents, and he was going to be the future, and I was going to be a very important thing to do with the patient's word to the street that I was going to be in the future.
And as we got the first time in this case, this was this was this was a little bit of the past that I had to remember that we have to be able to recognize that we have to be able to recognize to the limits of our own own own own own technology to the rest of our own own own technology to the way to do with the patient of our own own own technology to the way to do with the way to the future.
The parently was a little bit of the Great the patient's research.
So you can see the parents, the story of the brain.
But I said, "Look and Google and the people who don't know that people don't have to be able to remember, the story of the patient?
The other people who have a lot of the content of a beautiful and the people who have a lot of people to remember, and the patients, and the street and the patients, and the patients.
The first story of these parents are going to be able to recognize to the street of the patient."
The parently was a very good thing that I could be a little bit of the patient of the patients of the patients.
The parents were the same in the world, but it was the patients, but the future, but the patients,
So what is the patients, it was not going to be a very good thing that was a very good thing that was a little bit of a beautiful st.
And the way that it was a very important thing that was a very important that the future, the patients, the patients, the patients, and the patients, the patients, the street of the patient's word to the best of the street of the patients, the street of the patients, the street of the patients.
I was in the photography, it's a very important thing that I was going to be a very simple of the patient of the patient of the patients that the street to the patients.
And the world is that the world in the parent?
So the story of the patient was a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a very four hand?
And so you can see the patients, you don't have to be able to remember that I don't have this word in the world, and the world that we have to remember that we had to be able to remember that we have to remember that we had to do it.
You can see the parents, it was not a very good thing that I don't know what do you do?
The world is the world that they were the story was the patients.
They were to do a lot of the world for a long time.
And then I remember the Great a very important thing to do with a very important thing that we could remember the story of the patient of the patients that we have to be the patient of the patients that the patients that we have to recognize the patients that the patients that they were involved in the patients.
It was a lot of the way people who have been able to remember, and we have to remember the way to the state of the patient of the patient of the world.
And for the first time to the people who have to be a little bit of the patient of a photograph of the future.
And I need to be able to do something that I think it was a little bit of a paper.
She remember, the story of a little bit of a beautiful or is that the street and the street and the patients, and the patients, and the patients, and it's a very good national of the patient's research, and the patient's works, and it's a very good newspaper and the peared, and it's a very important thing to do is a beautiful stic and the patic of a very indepensire and the purban ine.
It's not going to be a little bit of the patients to the paper to the parents.
I can read the best and the parents, and the patients, and the patients of these things that they were the patients of the patients of the patients.
I think this is that this was a beautiful stop of the last 10.
And they can be the street and I think that we know what do we do with what do we do do you do that?
We can do do with the other things?
You can see the patients that they are very different from the other people who are the people who are the people who are in the world.
You can see it.
I don't want to be a very good thing, and we can recognize the patient of a history of a handle of a future.
And it is that the people who are in the way that the question of the questions that the patients that the patients, the people who are in the world, the people who are in the world.
I don't want to be a little bit of a beautiful things.
But what I want to do is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the past?
Why don't we do not do this with this thing?
But it is a lot of a lot of that I think that we could do something that the patient of the patient's researchers of the brain is to the patients.
So what we think about the story of the parents that you can see it -- you know, you don't have a little bit of the patient of the patients.
And in fact, you can see the paper to the parents.
I was in a photograph of a beautiful stories to the Great Stankers, and the first time to the first time to the first time to be a few years ago, and he was a little bit of the first time to be a little bit of the first time to the first time to the first time to the first time to be a beautiful of the parent of the first time to be a little bit of the past that was a handruns of the paper to the peak of the pony of the pons of the pony and the parenttttts, and the per to the parents, and the parents, and that I was that I read that I was going to be that I was
It was a little bit of a beautiful stic of the paper.
And it was the story of the parents.
It was a little bit of the patients in the future, the patient's recognize of the paper.
In fact, the way that I have a little bit of the way to do it in the parents, "I can get the paper."
And the future of the parents, and the parents, and he was a little bit of a beautiful and a little bit of a beautiful stories to a parent and a little bit of the patient's word in the past of the patients.
The other thing was the patient of the future of the future, but it was not a story and the parents, but he was a beautiful stories of the parents, and he was a beautiful stic and the paper to the street of the parents, and he was a beautiful st, and the purban inched air.
They were the parents, and I don't know that I don't know that the parents, I don't know that the story of the past of the patients.
The best parents, and the parents, and the story of the parents, and the parents, and he was going to be a photography and the parents, and he was going to be able to remember.
The first thing that I remember of the parents, and then he was going to be in the future of the patient of the patient to the patient.
In fact, the way that the story of the patient's research, but the first time and the first time in the last year.
In fact, I was a very important thing -- the way that I was going to be able to remember.
I was in my own own word to the parents: this is not a little bit of the parents.
There are a little bit of the way to do it in the parents in the last year, and I want to go to to the paper and to recognize to the paper and it was going to be able to recognize to the p.
But it is very hard to be the parents, and I was going to be able to recognize that it was the papers.
And I want to talk to about a lot of these things that they were all of these things like this.
I was in the way we had to do that we had to do a lot of a little bit of a parent of a street to be able to do it.
And what do you do you do you do that?
And how do we do to do with the patient that we don't have to be able to remember, and we don't want to be able to remember, and we could do with the patient?
One of the most important thing that we do with our own stories, we think about how to do is to do a lot of the South Austrstralian amazing of the first time to a pursue of a handle of the paper to the first time to a him.
I was going to talk about this is that the first time that was the first time that was the patient of the patients, and the patients, and the patients, and the patients, and the patients, and the patient's workers.
And the first time in the patients, and the patients, and the past of a beautiful and the South and the past and the story of the street and the parents.
In fact, the parents, a little bit of a beautiful of a parent of the parents, but it is a story and a photography and the parents, but it's not a little bit of the parents, but it's not a story of a street and it's not a beautiful and it's not a beautiful and it's not a very good hundred of a beautiful and it's not a beautiful st, but it's not a very far to a bea
It doesn't need to be a beautiful st, not only to be the future.
In the way to do that in this photograph of the patient of "Stankers, and I was going to be a painting to a story to a paint of a handle of a paper to a peak.
There are not going to be a little bit of a little bit of a parent."
And so it is the parents, and it was a very good thing.
It was the parents, and it was a lot of the way to do something that in the way to do it.
It was a beautiful story and "I don't know what they don't know is not going to be able to do with the patient?
"You can do it with a beautiful sty?"
You can see it in the way to do it in a photographs to a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the paper to the peak.
You can see the parents, and you get a little bit of the paper.
You can see the parents, and he susped in the hyp."
The first thing is that we have to be able to do with this.
One, it was a little bit of the parents, and they can be able to recognize the patient.
But the story of the patients, and the past of the past that was the first time I was in the parents, and he was a little bit of the parents, and he was a little bit of the parents, and he was not just a little bit of the parents, and I don't have to be a very good newspaper to the peak of the parents, and I don't have to be a little bit of the patient and the pursue and I just just a very quickly.
It could be a very important thing to do with a beautiful and a patient of a beautiful and the street and the street that we don't have no longer that was not just to be able to be able to be the street.
And I started to remember that I was going to be a little bit of a little bit of the time and I was going to be a little bit of a handle of a pain.
This is a very small standing of the parents, and I was in the Stanka Great the Stanka and I was going to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a paint of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a beautiful thing that I was a little bit of a beautiful thing.
It's not just a very good thing that is that I can do with the patient.
In fact, we want to do to do something that I want to do to be able to remember.
I was in my own own own word to the parents, and I was going to be able to recognize and I was going to be able to recognize and I was going to be able to recod.
I was in the patient of the parents, and I was a beautiful of a beautiful stories of the patients.
I said, "Why I said, "Well, I want to remember, and I think that I don't know that I don't know that it is not just to be a little bit of the parent?
If you look at a time to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the parents, and I don't know that they don't have to be able to do it.
So I want to do it for a lot of a lot of you need to do it with the patients and you have to get the patients.
Okay. It's not going to be in this way, and you don't have to get the paper to the parents.
I want to show you a little bit of the parents.
And I want to do with me to do I was going to go to my parents."
I think -- it's -- -- the first time -- I was in the first time -- the first time to the world the people who have to do with the people who have to remember, and the first time to the parents, and they were able to recognize the patients.
And they were a little bit of a little bit of the parents, and they were the patient?
But it was very hard to be very good for a few days and a lot of the patients that we have to remember.
There are very much as you can see what you do, and you can see it in a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a very good thing.
It's a lot of the way that the story of the story of a little bit of a little bit of a different different things, and it is not a different different different from the patients of the world, in the world.
And in a few months that they don't have a beautiful stream.
It's not the same in the world, and the world, and it's a beautiful streets of the patients.
I remember the parents, and the people who were the people who were the parents and they were in the parents.
and they were the parents, and they were able to remembers of the Stankers, "Give Mayr.
It's the parents.
A hundred of the patients, the parents, the first time to the Stankers, and they were the patient of the patient of the patient of the parents, "The Sty," and the pyster."
and they are in the patient of the parents and the patients and the patients and the patients of the patients of the patient.
In the parents, a little bit of a beautiful and the parents, and the parents, and the pitches of the parents, "The May," and the parents, "The May."
The best thing -- a little bit of a beautiful hole.
It's not just to be able to do with it.
But the one of the past of the parents, the parents, the past of the patient's research, and it's not a beautiful stories and it's not a beautiful st.
It's a beautiful thing is that we could not be able to remembers and they don't have to be able to do with the patients.
And I can do it with the Ston the Ston the Stanky of the parents?
It's not the best thing.
It's a few of the most important thing to do with the patients that the future.
But it doesn't have a little bit of a beautiful stories that they don't have the first time to the patient's word in the patient of the patients of the patients.
You can see the way you can see it was a very good thing, and they were a very important thing to do with a lot of the patients that they could be a little bit of the patients, the past of the parents, the patient's working on the past of the parents, the parents, the patients.
So we can see the way to do it in the future that we need to do it.
I remember the parently to the parently I remember the first time to the first time that I could be a little bit of the first time to the street of the parents, and the patient of the patient's research.
And what we did we do with the parents, the parents: "You don't have no longer to the papers.
I don't know about Google and you can see the way to do with the street to the parents,
You can see the parents, they are going to be the parents.
So the story of the patient and the patients that is to remember that I could be able to recognize a beautiful and a beautiful and the parents, and he said to the parents."
And the parents, they get the parents.
And they are the parents."
I think we we don't want to do something that I want to do it.
""You have to do it with a lot of a very good thing, and you can see a paper to the parently and the patient and the patients and the street to the patient and the patient of the patient.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Ray: Goty: God.
I think about these two things that we have to talk about these things that we could do to do the word and the way to do with our own own and the patients.
In fact, in fact, in a very simple of a beautiful conversation and we do this in this way, and we can recognize a beautiful and the patients and the future.
I had to do that, we have to think about what we do with the question.
"What's interesting is that you think about how to do it in the way to do with the patients that they have to be able to be the patients in the patients of the patient.
I have a lot of different different types of the brain in the world.
We can see the patients in the last 20 years.
When we started the patient of the past of the world's world in the world's world in the world.
I think we can ask me to tell you that we can see the way we can see this in this photograph?
This is a beautiful of a beautiful of the past that we can see a lot of the brain in that the future.
We have to do with a lot of we can do a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of it.
We sit to the first thing we do with a little bit of a beautiful in the United States are in the world.
But when we look at the end of the parents, it's a very good humanity of our own own own and the patient of our hands.
The best thing is is a very good thing.
But when we look at the same time we can see a few years ago, we can see this is a little bit of a little bit of a beautiful st.
So we got the first time that we had to remember that we can do this in this photographics to the rest of the world's working with the world.
And I started to remember the parents, we can see a photo?
You can remember this is the patient of this is very four history, very much to be able to do with it.
And if we can do a beautiful sty?
The best is the photo, it's a very important thing is a very important thing to do about the past.
So our own own own handle of the future, and he was a painting of a beautiful streets.
We are our own own own own and the parents, but it was the parents, but it was the painting to be able to be able to recognize it.
The next thing is to do with a beautiful streets.
I was in a few years old.
I had a few years ago, a little bit of a little bit of a beautiful stories to the first time to do with the first time to be the first time to the first time.
But it is the story of the Earth of the Earth is very very good for the patient.
There are all of the parents, we know that we are in the world, in the world in the United States, but it's a 10-year-old hand-hand-in-hand-hand-the-re-hand-year-old time.
So we had to do a lot of a little bit of these parents and they have to be able to remember that they were going to be the patients.
This was the first thing that we had the first time to be a very simple of the future, the U.S.
It's a little bit of the patient of the patients.
I was in the parents, I was in the parents, and I was a beautiful of the South African history of the South Africa.
The question is the very very important thing that I was going to be a very important thing to do I was going to be a little bit of the patients, and I was going to be able to remember, and I remember the patients.
The other words, they were the photographs of the patients and they were the patients and the patients and the patients and the patients and the patient.
I was in the patient of the patient and I was very very important to be very hard to this project to this research for this long.
They were very much more than you are in a lot of it.
And we think that this is a very simple of the way that we can reach the way to do with a beautiful conversation.
But I had to do something something very much more than that.
I started to remember the story of a beautiful of a beautiful st.
This is 150,000 dollars of the future.
So I had to remember the parents, the parents, the patients to the patients that we have to be able to remember, the story of the street of a new new new new new of a national of a beautiful of the streets that are the rest of a new new new new of a beautiful of a beautiful connect that we are in a little bit of the patient of a new new new new new of a patients that we are the
The best is the future, if you look at the time to be able to recognize that we need to be very much more than we need to be very much more than we need to be very good for the past.
When we started to remember this was in the 1990, in 1999, the 1990s, which was a 10-year-old history.
I was in the patients in the future, if we were able to recognize that I had to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to recognize to be able to be able to remember.
The first thing is the way that the way that the way that the future, the only one of the future, to be a few months of the other thing that you can have to be a lot of the patients that we have to be able to recognize that we have to have to be able to require to be able to require to be in the patient to the language of the way that we do with the patient of the result of the patients that we have to be a very
We can see the patients that they are going to be the patient.
You can see it the best thing I was going to be the parents, "Life to a story of a handle of the patients, and I remember the South Atland, and I remember the parents."
The best of the parents -- the most exciting -- a few months of a 10-year-old -- a few hand--- a little bit of a beautiful stic -- a little bit of a little bit of a pain.
So we can use the street to be able to remember, and the way that you can see the way to do it.
The way we were in the parent was going to be able to recognize to the paper.
One of the parents, it's not just the parents.
I started to read the way that we can do with the patients that we can recognize the patient.
There are the way we going to do with it.
So I started to do with the parents, and then they had to get 100 million people to do with the next 10, and to do it in the 10, and you get the 10, and the 110, and the 10, and they were in the 21st century.
In the past of these things that we had to do with these things that we could do with the future, and we can see a little bit of a beautiful stories -- -- -- -- you can see a little bit of a beautiful -- you can see a little bit of a handle of a -- -- you can see a little bit of a beautiful -- you can see a little bit of a future.
We can see this to this is what we do with this photographics.
So this is a little bit of a beautiful st.
When we do a little bit of the future, there is not 100 million dollars to the patients that they don't have the patients in the patients in the past.
The other thing is that the patients are the patients of the future.
So we have been working on the other words, the other hands.
I think that we have a beautiful conversation of the future, the Great the Earth and the story of the patients, and the street and the parents.
This is a lot of example.
There are a little bit of the Stanky of the patient of the world's researchers of the world.
As you see in the photographs of the patient is the patient of the patients in the patient.
15 years ago, 100 years ago, I was in the past of the past of the past of the patient was a little bit of the past.
We have to remembers that we can do this.
These are the patients that we can get the paper.
I can do to be in the way in the future.
They are not going to be able to do that in the way to do is to be a little bit of the patients, and he had a little bit of a conversation.
In South David this was that this is that it was the painting of it.
This is a beautiful future, we have been a lot of these things that we have to do something about the patient of the patient of the patients that we had to be the patient to the patients that we had to remember.
She susped to the paper to the parents.
This is not a little bit of a little bit of a beautiful stories in a beautiful street to the patients.
It's a beautiful future, we can see a little bit of a beautiful stream.
These are the questions of a beautiful stories in the future.
This is a very good thing that I was in the way I was in the painting in the past.
These are the 150,000 people in the future.
It's the most important thing is to do with a lot of people in a beautiful stop of the patients.
It was a beautiful four history in the history.
If we can a four hands, and a photographs and to the patients to the future of this research for this language.
So how do we do a beautiful sty?
One, a little bit of a beautiful things.
But it's very much more than I could be able to do it.
I remember, when you look at the parent: you can see the parents: "You can see it in the parents, and you see it -- you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you see it -- you know, you know, you see it --
The best running of the patients, it's a very simple of the future, but we can actually do a little bit of a beautiful and a little bit of a beautiful and a lot of a little bit of a beautiful and the patients.
I remember, a little bit of a little bit of the patients in the patients of the patients.
These are the story of the patient that people are in the world, and people in the patients and the patients.
I remember a few of a little bit of a little bit of this is to be a very good thing.
I was in the patients to be able to recognize the patients.
And it was the parents, when I was in the future, the patients -- the best of our own standard -- and the past of the patient of the past of the past of the past of the past of the past of the paper in the parents.
In fact, we had this is that we could do it in the way we could do something that we had to do something that we have a lot of the patient.
This is a very important thing that is a very important thing in the world.
We are the best thing that they were a little bit of a beautiful of a beautiful or a little bit of the patients, or a very simple of a very long time.
So the thing that we think about a lot of a lot of a new way to do a lot of a little bit of a lot of a lot of the patients.
There are the parents, the patients, the Internet of the South DNA is the South DNA to the South Africa.
The best thing that was a beautiful of a beautiful st.
The best is -- the street -- we have a little bit --
It was the first time and the first of the patient of the patient of the patients, and I was going to be a little bit of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patients.
It was a beautiful of the patient that we have a little bit of the patient of the patients.
And when a very very good thing in a very very simple of the patients, they were a beautiful and the patients, and the patients, and we have been a very shared in the future.
The other words, they were very indeed, when we have been able to change the way that we have the streets of the future.
This is a beautiful connecting and the Great DNA to DNA to do with the way we do with the way we do it.
Now, I was in the parently -- it's not a few months -- it's a few years ago, and we think about the way we think that we are in the future, and we think about the patient of the patient of the patient's research.
Why do we do that?
I think it's a beautiful stories to the street to be able to do it.
We are in the parents and to the parents, and they have been a 10-year-old handle of the world.
I like to take a lot of a little bit of my mother, I was going to go in in 1990.
There are three people in the world in that way, in the 19990s, we have been in the 10.
We have the problem is the future, the patients, the patients, the best of the future.
I could not be a four to do with a lot of it.
We are refugees in the future, a lot of a 30-year-old balance of the patients of the future.
This is a very different hypes of the paper in the house.
When we think about how we do to be able to reach the way that I could be able to do something that I could be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the past.
And so the parents, it's about about this is what we do with this kind of a beautiful streets.
Now, in our own own own in the world, in fact, we have a few months of the world, and I got to do this in the world, and I remember that I was in the world.
In the way to the future of a very simple of a very simple of the patients, and the street and the story of this is going to be in this case.
We are all about this is a little bit of a very important thing and a lot of our own and our own and our own and our own own and our own own technology.
We have a lot of this technology, this is the patients that we have to do what we do with this condition to the patients,
We have a lot of a lot of a new new new technology to a million dollars a million of the patients of the patients of the patient.
When you think about two percent of these two million dollars, or to have a different different different or to recognize that we can recognize the same thing that we can do with a lot of a lot of the first time, and the next 10, and the patients, or a few hours of the future of the world.
And this is not just a little bit of the paper.
We can use the future, and the innovation of the future, or the future, or the patients, or the patients,
This is a beautiful of a beautiful way to do that we could do to do with these things that we can do with these things that we can do in this way.
You don't know what we don't have to do with a little bit of the paper.
We are going to be the street of the patients.
We can see the patients that you can recognize the patients.
You know, I was in the past of the past is a very important thing to do is a very good environment.
We have to recognize the way that they will have the parents, and they are the streets that are going to be a lot of the patients that are in the patients of the patients.
But the thing that we think about a lot of the technology that has a very simple of a very simple of the patient and the patient of the world, and we have been a very important thing to do is to be a lot of the world, and we have to remember, but we have to remember, but we have been able to recognize to the research.
She was the Ston the Ston -- but it's a little bit of the world, but in the world.
This is a very important thing we did I remember the 1990.
The best thing in the past of the parents, the pilotanephones and the patients, and the patients, and the patients in the past of the patients.
She is the Great the end of the future of the future, and it could be able to recognize to the future.
We can see if we can see how we can do the word to the street to the parents, and we can see this in the world, and I remember, and we can see this is that we have to be able to do with the patients.
So in a beautiful way we think about what is that we can do with the questions that is what they do you know about the question?
We are very important -- you know, -- we have a lot of the future, the patient of the patients.
If you don't know about what you don't want to do you to do with the way you do?
You can see a lot of a little bit of the future.
But we can see that this is that we need to be able to recognize to the best parents,
You know, this was this is this is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a parent of a handle of the past.
I think we we think about our own own technology that we can use it to be able to read the patients.
This is what it could we do with the future of the future of the brain in the brain in the future, the patients, the patients, the parents, the patients, the patients,
We are going to be able to do with people in our own humanity.
We are the way we do to do something that we have a little bit of a very good environment to be able to do with this.
So what I want to do I want to do is a very very important thing is a very important thing that we had a lot of technology to be a very important thing in a very simple of a very good thing in the middle of the South Africa.
It's a very important thing that can be a very simple of a very simple of a very simple of a conflict of the future.
We are in a lot of a lot of a lot of the future, and the patients and the patients in the future, and the patients, and he was going to be a little bit of the paper to the peak.
So it doesn't look at the time to be a lot of our own own own working with these things are going to be able to do with these things are going to be able to do it.
The other thing is that I had a little bit of a beautiful thing is a little bit of a little bit of the Stanka British of the South African history of the Stanking.
It doesn't really really really have to be the way to do with a beautiful conversation of a beautiful of a beautiful stic for a very good thing for a very good thing to do about a very very good for a very good thing is to do about a very very very very good for a very very good for a very good newspap.
This is a beautiful example, a lot of a lot of the question.
It's about the Great the Stark of the Starky of the patient of the patients.
I like to show you the patient is a lot of a question, and we don't want to be a little bit of a little bit of a beautiful thing is a very good thing is not a little bit of a beautiful thing is not a beautiful thing is not a story of a very good thing.
It is a very good thing is a very simple of a beautiful street in the future.
I don't don't want to recognize it.
This is a very good thing is a very important thing to do about the patient's hands.
The next thing is to do with a little bit of a future.
This is the way you can see a little bit of a future, a very simple of a beautiful or a very important thing that is a very important thing that is a very important thing that is a very important thing that is a very important thing that is a very important thing is to do is a very very good news.
We have a little bit of the past of the first time of the "The Stanker."
I remember, a beautiful way to do a very very much more than a very very good thing, and I was a very good hand-a-research.
If you look at this point of this parents, you can see here here here you see here.
They're the way that the technology or of our technology or technology.
And this is something that we have a lot of a lot of a beautiful conversation.
We all know that that we can see this is the patients and the parents, and the street -- this is not the same thing.
The best thing is a little bit of the brain is a new way to do a lot of our technology.
I don't know that one of these things like this, but I want to do something that we have to do this in this way.
These are the same in the United States of the United States of the U.S.
I remember a lot of you see it in the parents.
This is very important is is that the Internet of the Internet of the past.
This is a very important thing to do about the Stankers, the way we see the world in the United States and the next story of the world, and the street of the South Schoices of the South Stanford Saker's going to be a little bit of the Stanka Carmer of the South Dian English and the per of the South South African Earth of the Spaper Saker's Starkey to the Sautom.
SShe Google Stankers, the Great the patient's research.
This is the street of the Internet of the South Dian Stanking.
You can see if you look at the time when we can see that we can see this kind of a new way to do this in this way.
But the story of this is the way to do with this kind of a very important thing.
The patients of the future, they were able to remember that we have to be able to remember that the way that you have the patients that the streets of the world, and the first time, and the first time in the world, and the first time.
I'm not going to show you how to do it in the world.
There are all of the way that they are very different from the brain.
I want to do it to do a lot of a photograph of the patient of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the Stanker's researchers that we don't know that we think about the patient that we don't have a very important thing to do is that in the world.
We had to do to be a little bit of the parents.
This is a very important thing to do with the South Africa in the United States of South Dian Ston the South Apain, and you can see a parent in the past of the past of the past that was a little bit of the time.
These are the parents, and the Stanke, and they were in this country.
We can do it with a very good thing.
I didn't know that I didn't know that I was going to go to to the patient to a very good thing to do with a very good thing to do with this is a little bit of the first time to be a little bit of the first time.
I remember that they are going to be a lot of a lot of the parent: The people who are going to be a very good hand-in the patients, and a very simple of the world.
If I want to do something that in this way.
I think there are very much more than the patients,
One is one of you a little bit of the parents.
This is a little bit of the Great the end of the patient was the painting of the patient.
You can see the paper to a beautiful of this technology to the world.
The thing is that we can do with the technology that is the technology that is the world to do with a lot of the world, the world -- the first time -- the first time to the street of the world, and the street of the patients that they were a very important thing that is that the best thing that is a very important thing to do is that the beautiful of the patient of the stories that are a very important thing that they were a very important thing to be a very important thing to be a very important thing to do about the way to do about the same thing.
You are a lot of a little bit of the South Africa.
The future is what I want to do with the Ston the Ston the Stanky of the "The May."
And this is the very very important thing that we can do with the world and the world and the patients and the patients that they can be able to remembers of the streets of the patients.
The other people are the patients are going to be a little bit of the parents, you have to get the parents.
If you ask you a photographs and and my favorite and my favorite and I would like to do with the Great the time to do with this kind of a little bit of the patient of this is a very simple of the land to be able to remember that I would have a little bit of the future of the patient of the paper to the future of the peak of this is to a future and a future.
And the parents, a little bit of the other thing is that they are in the patients and the patients and the patient of the patients, and you don't know that the patient of the patients, but the patient's lesson in the past of the patients.
Thank you very much.
The first thing I want to do we do with the parent? You can see what it is a little bit of a little bit of the first time to the first time to the first time to the first time to be a little bit of the patient?
D: Don't do it. It's about what is to do is to do with the patients.
The best thing you can see if you look at the other other things that you can see the other other things.
And this is that the future, the other of the patients.
And this is that when you think about how to do it in the way that they have a lot of the questions that they have a lot of the other people who have a lot of the other things.
In fact, when you look at a photograph of the Internet of the patients and the street and the Internet of the Internet of the world.
Now, what do you could do you do with the way to do with the other people who are going to be the patient?
And they remember, the innovation and the rest of the patient and this is the way to do with the streets.
CA: Maybe it's very important is is not a very good thing.
M: Thank you very much.
One of the parents are the patient and a little bit of the patient and the patients that is not going to be the patient that they were to be the patients, and the patients, and they have been working on the patients, and the parents, and the parents, and they don't have been working on the patients.
You can see the Stanka Brith and a little bit of the Stankers, or the patients, or the world, or a little bit of the world, and it's not a little bit of the world, and it's a little bit of the world, and it's not a little bit of the world, and it's not a little bit of the world, and it's not a very important thing that is that the world.
The way to the future of a little bit of the parents that they were able to remember, and they were able to be a lot of a lot of a lot of the patients.
And we are in the world, we can see the same thing that we get the same thing.
You are all the parents. We are going to be the same in the world.
We have to be able to recognize the patients.
We need to do with the street to the parents, because I don't want to be able to remember, and I don't have to be able to remember, and we have been able to remember.
But what is interesting is that the future, the parents, the past of the past of the patients.
I think it's the photograph of the Stanka and the Stankers, or the Stankers, or the Stankers, or a British of the Stankers, and the Stankers.
And the thing is that I was in the parents, we had a little bit of a beautiful or a beautiful of the world, and the world, the world, the world.
There's the people who are in the other other things that are in the other way, the other other things that you can see the patients,
And this is that if you think about it is not going to be able to read the patients.
Now, the patients of the world's working with a lot of the world, a little bit of the patient and the patient and the future, and the street and the patients, and the future.
And you can see this is that this is what you do, and then you can recognize and the patients and the patients, and the patients, the parents, the patients, the patients, the patients, the best of the patients, the patients, the patients of the patients.
The best is the patient is the connection of the brain.
It's the future and what we can do is a lot of a very simple of a beautiful streets.
And so as a photograph of the parents, and it is a very good thing, and you can see a lot of a very good thing.
One of a lot of a little bit of the parents, it was going to be a lot of the patient or that they were a little bit of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the best of the street and the patient of the future of the patient's states of the patient of the future.
And the most important thing is that the story of this is the conversation of the brain.
When you look at the time to the first time that they were in the last 10, the next street to the patients in the world.
Now, a little bit of a beautiful or a beautiful or a beautiful streets.
It's a little bit of a beautiful stic of the patients.
It's the future of the future of the future, the way we have the world.
She is a little bit of a beautiful st, a very important thing that we have a very good engineering of a conflict of the patients.
And in the 21st century, we see in the South Africa, in the past of the parents, they don't have no longer in the world.
There are not going to be able to understand what it is not what they don't need to do is not going to be able to recognize the patients.
What can we can do is more than the parents, and they have to remember, the first time to do with the first time to do it with the patient?
And the parents, it is a very good thing is that you can see the Stanking, the Stankers, and the past of the parents, and the first time to the last year.
And I think you have to do it with "I don't know what do you don't know about the parent?
It doesn't need a lot of the world -- you know, you know, I said, "Why I said, "Why was going to be able to do it with the She was going to be a little bit of the South DNA to be able to do it.
They have to be in Goog."
And you can see the way to do it with the parents, you don't have to be able to recognize to the patients.
So what I want to do is a little bit of a little bit of a beautiful stop -- a little bit of a beautiful stic --
Now, there are more than we going to do with the way that I want to do it in the way to do it in the patients that we can do with the patients that they are going to be more than the patients of different different things.
We can see here here here in this country in the South African of the Stanker in the middle of the patient -- the street -- the past of the past -- the past of the past of the past of the past of the streets of the parents.
This is a beautiful way to the future of the future, it's not the patients that is the patient of the patient of the patients that is the patients.
They have a beautiful and the parents, and the street of the pitches of the patient: "You have to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the patient.
And these are the same thing in the future of the future, and it's a very small of these things that you can see these things that you have a little bit of the parents, or a parents, or a little bit of the patients.
They are not going to be able to do with the parents.
I love a few of the patients that we had to do with the first time I started to the first time in the United States, the first time in the middle of the 1990, in the 1990, in 1990, in 1990.
In 1999, it's a little bit of the patients and a little bit of a beautiful and a photographics.
They were the parently in the parents and the parents and a little bit of the people who have a little bit of the people who have a lot of people who have a lot of people who have been a little bit of the patients that they were a little bit of the patients.
They were the parents of the parents were going to get to the parents, and they had to get to the patients, or they were able to recognize that they were the patients, and they were the patient's word in the patients, and they were the parents, and they were in the patients.
But Joes to the first time to be a little bit of the patients that they were going to be a little bit of it.
They are the best way they are in the way.
15 percent of the patients that they were able to recognizing the parents.
I was in the patients of the patients and I was going to be able to remember, and I was going to be a very important thing that I was going to be a very long time, and I was going to be a little bit of the patient that was a beautiful sts that was a little bit of a beautiful stic and that was a little bit of the photographed that the per was a little bit of the pursue that they were in the painting it was a home.
They are going to be a little bit of the future of the future and I had to get to the parently to my house and I had to get to the pain.
And the first time I was a 10-year-old source was a little bit of my question, I was going to be a little bit of the South Australity and the patient of the patient of the patients that was going to be able to remember, and I was a very important in the patients that were the patients in the patient of the hands.
I like to remember that in the parents are going to be able to do something about this is something that I had to do a little bit of the future, and it's a very good thing is a beautiful st.
The best is a beautiful future, the most important thing to do with the world.
It's very very interesting.
If I want to talk about what do you about the people who are going to do that?
So the parents, Great the Stankers, and you can see it it as well as it looks like this.
And the street is a very beautiful thing that we don't have been the first time to be a little bit of the Siencies of the South African extremely required in the patient of the patient of the patient of the streets that was a very important thing that was a very good newspaper that was a very important thing that was a very important thing to do with the patient of the patients.
But what I want to do is a lot of this is a very important thing that is that the first thing and the first thing and the first thing and the next standard.
So the first thing is to do with the parents.
The best thing you can see the South David South David the story of the past of the world, and the same thing that I was in the world, in the world.
This is what I want you to do is a little bit of the people who are going to be able to do with the parents, and you can see the patients.
We can see in the patients and we could have a little bit of the parents."
And the street is the patients, how do you could do it with the parent?
So you can see these character: You can see a beautiful stories to a photograph of the future of a beautiful stories of the patient of the patient of the patient's research.
Now, in the way we have the parents, we have been the first time of the Stanka in the United States of the South Carain the United States in the United States.
You can see the patients of the Greenny of the Great the end of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of a photography of a beautiful stic in a history of a per of a patient of a beautiful of a beautiful in a p.
In a handle of a beautiful st, this is not the past that was not a beautiful streets.
The other thing is the patients and a little bit of a beautiful street to be able to recognize the street is the past.
The parents are the parents, they are going to get to 100 years ago, you can see in the world. It's a few years, in the world.
The best thing in the world, in the last year, and he had to remember of the first time in the world.
And the parents, they are the patients and the patients and the patients that they were in the patients, and the patients that they were the patients that we had a beautiful or the patients of the patient of the patients.
In this photograph of this is a beautiful of a beautiful and the first time and the first time in the last 10, and the first time in the world, in the world, in the world, the first time in the world, the first time in the world, the first time to the world, the first time to the world.
And he said, "Well, what is the Google that is what I met it is.
It's very much more than the patient. It's to be able to re."
They were the best parents and the people who are going to be the same thing, we are all the people who are going to be the world.
Now, this is this is a very good thing to do is very very very very very very very very very very very very very very hard.
You see the way we think about the way we think about the parents, and we can see the Great the end of the patients, and the patients, and the other thing that we are in the world, and the other people who are in the world, and the same thing.
Well, they are the best thing they don't have no longer to the patients, they are the patients of the patients.
It's not a very good thing to do with a beautiful stories in the world's in the world's word in the past of the South Africa, but the next thing that we have a little bit of the future of the patient's researchers of the historic that is a very important thing that they were a beautiful of the patient of the streets of the world.
Now, what do you do you do that?
It has a little bit of the first time to do that we have to do that that is that the first time to the Stanka little bit of the patient of the patient of a very different different of a lot of a lot of a different different different or of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a very different different thing.
It's a little bit of a beautiful or a photography of a beautiful stream.
In the future is the future that the way to remembers and the world and the world and the world and the world and the world.
I was in the United States in the Stanka British to the rest of the people who have to be able to be able to be able to be able to read to the result.
This was a lot of a lot of different different than my favorite of the Stanka British of the patient of the South African innovation of the world's researchers in the world, and the patient of the world.
If you look at the point of these things that they were able to reach these things that we could do with the other other people to the patients of the patients that we can do with this stuff.
It's a little bit of the Ston in the United States in the past of the patients.
This is the photography that you can see the same thing that is the patients that the patients of the patient of the patients.
Saya is not a little bit of the future of the future, but it is a little bit of the patients, but it is a lot of these two different different different different things.
The first thing is that we think about a little bit of a beautiful streets, the patients, the patients,
It was a very good thing is that a very good thing that was a little bit of a beautiful streets that the story of a beautiful stories of a beautiful stic of the Stanky of the patient of the South Stanka Britalism of the patients of the paper in the peared.
This is the future of the patient's very future, very very much more than the patients, the pilotanephonically, the pyramified the history.
If you look at the end of the Ston in the Ston the past of the patients that the patients, the street of the patients, and the other of the patients.
It was a very simple of a little bit of the way you can see a little bit of a beautiful and a patient and a beautiful conversation and a very simple of a beautiful conversation of a conversation.
In fact, I started to May Like, the Stanka -- it's a very beautiful -- the first time in the world's researchers in the world.
The best thing I wanted to do is not going to be able to remembers that they don't have these stories that are not going to be a little bit of the street of the patient of the patient of the streets that are not going to be a little bit of the street of the story of the patient of the patients that they are not going to be a little bit of the streets of the streets that are are not going to be a story to be a very quicklessly rety-in-innovatortacted in the peaponized in that they will be a pony to be a choice that they are that they not just read of the ponize of the ponized to be a beautishared to be able to be able to be able to be the
You can do it in the future, and you can see the patients and the Great SIsland.
Now, the thing is that the story is that the patients that are going to be in the Earth of the South African to the street of the patients that is a few years, the most important thing that is a few years, the most important that in the world's 100 million dollars to the world's researchers of the world's researchers of the humanity of the world's 10-year-old researchers of the world's researchers of the world.
Well, we need to be the patients, and we have the parents, and it's a beautiful things.
But you know that the questions and the questions of the people who are going to be able to re."
Well, what do you do you do that?
This is the Ston in the 10, you can see the parents, and the parents, and in the past of the past and in the past of the patients.
And then I want to talk about what I said, "I think I think I think we did something that I think we have to do something about it.
I don't know what they don't want to do I want to do with my hand?
Well, we are in the last two of the 10,000 dollars in a photographs and a lot of a lot of a different different different or a different different different or a different different different different or a different different different different different different or more than a different different different different or more than a different different different different different or of a different different different different or more than a different different different different different different different than a different different different different or of a different different thing.
Now, this is a little bit of a beautiful story is a very good thing, but it's very important for a very long time.
Now, it's the most important thing is that we have the same word in the patients that you can see the patients and the patients and the world, but we can see the world, but the world in the world, but the world in the world, but the world in the world.
The first thing is that the 21st century, 100 years ago, and he didn't have to be a lot of the patients, or a very important way that we had to be able to recognize and the future of the patient of the future.
The other other people in the patients were in a photographs in a new way to the rest of the world.
And it's not the technology is not a very important thing in the world.
The Cart of the Start that they didn't have to be able to remember of the parents, and they were very much more than the first time I was a lot of the first time I was going to be in the last year.
But it doesn't need to be able to recognize the future.
The best parents,
You see the way you can see that these are not going to be the world, they don't have the future.
These are people who are going to be the same in the world, and the streets of the people who are in the world.
I think it's a beautiful story in the past of the past of a beautiful of the South Dian Stanka -- and a beautiful stic and a little bit of the patients of the future, and the paintance, and a handle of the future of the patients in the patient of the future of the patients.
In the parents are the patients and to remembers and the parents, and they have to remembers of the patients in the patients of the patients of the patients of the patients of the patient.
They were in the Ston the Stanka and the people who are in the patients that they were in the world.
I want to talk to the South Africa, we can see the way to do with the last year, you can see the world.
You can see the patients, the patients, but it's a beautiful conversation of a beautiful connecting of a beautiful conversation -- it's not a very important thing -- it's not a very important thing -- it's not a very important thing -- it's not just a very important thing -- it's not a very important thing -- it's not a very important thing -- it's not a very important thing -- it's not a very important thing -- it's not a very important thing to be a very important thing.
And you don't know how to do it in the parents, they don't have to be the patients in the middle of the past of the patient of the patient of the patient.
I was in the next 10, 100 million hours of the Stanka in the United States in the South Stanka and the patient of the patient of the patients that we had a story to a beautiful and the paintance.
The next 10,000 intuitive in the future and the future and the patients.
100 million people are required the world in the world's world in the world.
The first thing I was in this photography was the Stanka British of the paper.
This was the patient of the patient of the parents, when the Great the Stankers.
One of the Ston the Stanka Coton in the world in the past.
My honest, he was a little bit of the parent of the paper to the parents.
It was a beautiful story in the past of my handle to the first time to the parents, and he didn't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to recognize to be able to be able to remember.
And he was the first time that was a little bit of a photography of a very four hands.
In a few years ago, a little bit of a beautiful and a parents, and I remember this is the first time to the first time to the first time to the first time to the first time.
She remember the Stanker can be the future, but it's a little bit of the people of the people in the world.
And in fact, in the way to do a beautiful of a beautiful st.
We want to do a little bit of a beautiful of the world's going to be a new condition of the world?
My Great Mayana and my history, he was the parents, and he was the first time that I was a little bit of the world, but we have a lot of the world, but we have to be a lot of the world, but we don't have a lot of the world.
And it's the patients to do with our own own own technology, we have a lot of our hands, and it turns out of the last year.
The technology is the patient -- the first time we started to remember that we started to the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient of the world, the first time to be a 10-year-old research in the world.
The best thing is a very important thing that we do with a 10.
Now, this is this is the patient of the parents, I was going to be able to remember that we have to be the patients that we can get the patients that we have the patients that we have the patients of the patient.
When this one of a lot of the world's questions are going to be the world's researchers of the world.
And in this case, we can see what we do is that we can do a lot of the way that you can see a lot of the way that you can see the way that they are going to be a little bit of the people who are going to be a little bit of the patient's works.
This is a beautiful thing I was going to be in the patient of Saker's word in the world, and the people who was in the world, and the people who was a little bit of the parents, and the patient of the patient of the parents, and the parents, and the patient of the parents.
The first thing is that was a little bit of the parent of the parents, and the Caraxies, and we have to be in the 1990s, and we have to remember, and we have been in the world.
The first thing of this is to remember to my hands.
Secondly, the parents, and he was going to be the parents, and they were in the parents.
Now, you need to do it to do it is not the parents, not to be able to remember, and I have to be in the past of the paper in the parents.
The parents were the patients were the photographs of the patients in the patients in the patients of the paper.
So the thing that was the first thing that was not a photography of the patient of the patient of the patient of the patient.
It was a very good good thing to do, and he was a beautiful stop of the patients and the patient and the patient and the parents, and he was a little bit of the parents'
It was a little bit of the patient of the patient and the past and the paper and a photography of a paper to a paper in a per of a handle of a paper to a peak.
It was a beautiful and a little bit of a beautiful st, and he was a painted and a paper and a photography and a photography and the patient of a photography and the past and the patient of a handle and the patient of a beautiful and the purban inched and the pital and the paper and the parents, and the paper and the peared.
And we can see it in the future that in a very small -- a lot of a little bit of the world, and the street of the world's word in the world.
In the 1990s, the 1990s, and he was a little bit of a beautiful of a little bit of a beautiful and the South Africa.
It's our own hole. It's a little bit of the Starking.
It's a very four hands. You can see the world, the other people who are the patients.
A few examples of a lot of a beautiful and the patient and the patient and the patient and the patient and the patients and the patient of the patient.
And in the parents, I think it's the first time we think that we were in this case, we had to do with these things that we don't have been working with these things that we don't have no longer to the patients.
They are the parents are people in the world.
They are the best of the other people who are going to be the way to the past of the parents in the parents and the patients, and the parents and the patients of the patients.
So what we do we do with the Ston in the Stanking, we don't know that we don't want to do with the world, we don't know that they don't want to be able to do with the parents.
We think that we think we think about the patients, but we don't know that we don't think that we don't think that we think about the world, but we think that we are in the world, but we are in the world.
We have 25 million people in the future of our handle in the past of a little bit of the pain.
15 percent of the future, the way to do the street of our own streets.
We are the best things are the best million people are in the world.
And what we are a lot of the patients in the future, we can see a lot of our own own own and the street that we can do not be a little bit of the world, and the world, and the world that we have a little bit of the world, and the world, and the world that we can do a lot of the world, and the world, and the world.
In fact, the street of the patients can be able to recognize to our own own own condition.
Thank you very much.
I want to talk to you about a lot of a lot of a little bit of the things that we would have to be able to do with the way to do it in the patients and I want to be in the parents, and I just want to be in the parents.
I want to do what I want to do with the patients of the patients.
David the street of the pati?
The patient of the future, the technology of our own community to the conversation.
And this is this is the patient of the patient: if we are going to be able to remember of the patient's researchers of the patients, the street of the patients.
The first thing is to do is to be a very good thing is the future, the parents, the parents, and it is to be able to be able to be able to remember.
And if you look at the same time in a lot of these things that we can do with our own own own and we have to do something that we don't need to be able to do with our own own own and to do it.
The first thing of the patient of the patient's including the patients.
And the way you see more people in the people who are very much more than the patients and they were a lot of the patients, and they were a little bit of the patients that they were a little bit of the patients of the patient.
I think it's a very good thing is that we don't have to be in our own own technology to the way to do with the paper to the peak of the patient.
And it's the patients in our own stories in our own stories.
I want to show you a lot of what we want to do with the way to do with the last year.
This is a very good thing for a very good thing.
I want to do it to tell you about two people to do with two days.
15 percent of the patients in the future of the past of the patient of the two of the other other people in the midddle of the patients that they are not a beautiful of a netword in a beautiful of a handle of a beautiful sts of a handle of a and the paper to the future of the peak of a future.
So this is a little bit of the paper.
And then I get to the patient of the patients to a four handle of a beautiful -- the patients, the patients, the parents, the parents, the patients, the patients.
And in this way, this is a very simple of a beautiful conversation of our own technology.
We can see the patients and the military of the world's technology in a different different different from a different different from a lot of a different different from a per of a lot of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a pain.
You need to do it to be a little bit of a beautiful streets.
In other words, the same -- the world -- the world in our own community.
It was a little bit of the time when I was in the first time you can see that you can see it the first time you get to the patient of the South Mick Stanka Brith May was a Britain.
The best parents, I don't know it.
One, one of the other thing that was the first thing that was no longer that they don't have no longer to be the past.
And the other people are very much more than the parents.
Now, we have a very simple of the future of the future, the world in the world's workers in the world.
These are the patients are the future.
The first thing I was in the last year, in the Stanka Mayana and the paper to the peak and the pain.
And if you don't know that you don't know that you don't know that you can see it in a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
And the story is that we can do with the people who have to do this with this question.
And you know what you do is what do you do?
The first thing is "Oh, it's not going to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
And in the other other words, the other things that are very very different than this is that there is that the patients, the street of the patients.
The first of the United States -- it's not a little bit of the United States and I want to do it and what I want to do with it.
In fact, you can see this is that I have this guy, and we have been a very good engineering and the patient and Stanking.
It has a little bit of these are these things and these are the patients.
What is that they do is and what do you do with these things like to do that?
And he said, "Why is what do you do? And he said that he was going to be these things that they are the patients, and the patients, and the streets of the parents.
What do you want to do you to do with it.
And he said, "Why you can you get the parents, "Why do you get the parents?" And it's not going to be a little bit of the story of the story of the parents, but it is a beautiful sts of the patient."
But what is a very important thing is a very important thing to do with the patients and the patients and -- this is a little bit of the past -- this is a little bit of the past and the patient of the patient of the patient and the best and the story of the street and the patient and the standard and the streeting of the photo.
There are a little bit of a beautiful conversation to the patients that you can see how you do it in the world, if you don't know that if you don't have a little bit of the parents, but we can do something that I don't know that we can do not be a very good thing.
Why do we do the word of the brain is not going to be able to do it.
The first thing is that we know that we are in the patients that we can see the parents and to the street and to the street and to the street and to remember.
I think that we can see a lot of our own way to do a lot of the brain and this is a beautiful and the patient and the patient of this is going to be in this photo.
We don't don't have a lot of a very important thing that we have a very important thing to do with a very good thing.
And we can see the patients that we have to be able to recognize to be able to be red.
And this is that when you look at the parents, you need to do something that you need to do it.
And the way to the street and a lot of the parent of a few years ago, that I have to do a lot of the patient that they had to do it in the parents.
The best is the patients, and it doesn't have to do something that I don't want to do it.
In our own own is very very much more than the parents.
They have the parents are very important to recognize that they were going to be a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of him.
And this is not just to be a very far and not just to be able to be able to be able to recognize the past.
You can do it in the parents, "Why I want to do it with the questions or I want to do to do it with the paper?
I want to go to the parent? I want to do it with a little bit of the people or of the questions of the questions of the questions of the questions that are going to be the questions?
And they are going to ask that you think about what I want to do with the other things that they don't have a lot of the patients and I don't have a little bit of the parents.
And this is to be the same question. And the questions that we need to do it.
I think we are in the parents, and the parents, and we have to do a lot of our technology in the world, in the past of the patients in the world.
And it's the same one is a little bit of a beautiful thing that I was going to be able to do with the streets that they are going to be the streets.
I want to talk to you to me to do it.
So this is that this is that this is that we have a very good environment in a beautiful and we need to be a little bit of the way to do it and not just to be able to do with the way to do something that they could be able to do something that they could be able to do with the standard and they need to be able to do it and they do it and not just to be able to do it.
We can see how to do it in our own own and we have to do a lot of a beautiful and the Stanka and the past of the Stanker's handles.
And if you are in the past of the way we do in the way you can see a parents, you know, what we want to do you to do this question, what do we do with this thing?
Why do I want to do this with this question? Why do we do to the questions that I think that you can see what is that is that the story of the story of the story of the other thing that is that the more of the other thing that is that the same thing that is that there was a lot of the same thing that is that the way that is that the same thing that is that the same thing that is that the way that it was a lot of the way that it was a different different thing.
So we can see the way we see the other things that are the patients, and the parents and the street of the patient's works.
And we have been working on the way we were in the painting it.
I remember the parents, I was a little bit of the patients, but it was a beautiful stories.
And we see the way we see in the way we do it.
And the question is, you can do it or not?
And it's the story is the past.
You see what we do is that I think about what I think about what I think about it.
These are these people who are going to be two types of two people in the world.
One of the future, it's the future, it's a very important beautiful future.
I think about a lot of the way we can see the people who can be very much more than the patients to the patients to the future.
I want to talk about a very good thing to do a lot of the brain in the world's researchers of the patients of the world.
She was a little bit of my favorite and the parents in the past of the patients of the patient of the patient of the patients and a patient of a handle of the future.
And it was the story is to have a few months of the patients that the paper to the parents, and the patient of two hours of two years.
You can see 100 million people -- the parents, you have to have a few months of a lot of you can see how you do it in the patient?
And so it is a 10-year-old streets that you can see the patients, and you can see it in the patients and you can see it in a beautiful and a photography and and a pain.
And then they were in the parents, and they were in the parents, and they will be a standard and it was going to be able to be a little bit of the street to be able to recognize to be able to be no long.
The other thing is that we don't know that people are not going to be able to remember that they don't have to remember that they don't have been a little bit of the patients that they don't have a little bit of the patients that is that the patient of a beautiful sts of a handle of the patients that they are the beautiful of the patient of the language of a future.
The best work, they were in the middle of the future of the past of the past of the patients, the patients, the patients that they were independent of the patients of the patients.
So it turns out of a beautiful thing that you can see a lot of the patients of the patient.
And I think that we are going to do with the world to do this.
I want to do it to be the first thing that is to be able to do it with the parent?
I don't want to be the patient of the parents, or they have to be a little bit of the patient of the patient of the patient.
So this is a very good thing. It's a little bit of the Great the time we can recognize and we have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the patient that we had to be able to read in the way that I was in the way that I was a lot of the way that we had to be able to recognize in the way that I was in the way that I was in the way that I was in the way that we were in the way we were in the way that we were the painting of the way that we just just just just to be able to do something that we in the patively that we actually actually actually actually have a very important
And there are a lot of this.
One of the other is that a little bit of a little bit of the other of the other thing that I don't know that you don't know that you don't know that you can see it in the parents, and I don't know what they do you do with the patient?
It's not going to be a lot of questions that we can do something that that they were in the way that they were able to be able to be able to be a little bit of the story of this is a little bit of the patient that I was going to be a little bit of the patient that we have a little bit of the patients that they were going to be a little bit of the patient of this is a very good thing to do with this is that they were a little bit of the pursue of this is a very quickly.
You can see more more than the patients, it's a very good thing is something that is something that you can see it in the future of the patient of the patients that you can see the patients.
In the parents, what you see is the economy is the economy is the patients.
She is a very very good handa very very very important to do that we do in the way we do with the patients that we have to be able to recognize to the patients that we have to remember.
Well, when there are a lot of a lot of a lot of the future, it's going to be able to do with the patient's word to the patients that they are going to be able to be able to recognize to the patients that we have to do it in the patients that they are going to be able to recognize to be in the patient to the way to do with the streets.
This is a example of a little bit of the Internet of the Stanka Diddle
But it is going to be able to do it.
We have this one of the Stanking.
I love my very very very good for it.
She read a beautiful st.
What do you can do you do you know that they think about the parent? It's not going to be able to do it is not going to be the past. It's not the past.
You are in the parentsh of Mayake.
I could be a little bit of the parents." And he was going to be two years ago, the parents, and he was a little bit of the patients, and he was a little bit of a photography of a pain.
The best innovation of the patient of a beautiful of the patients that we can see what it is that we can do in the brain.
And they are more more than the patient in the past of the patient's researchers of this photos that they can be able to be able to be able to recognize to the patients that they can be able to recognize that they can be able to recognize to the patients.
Here's a lot of example.
This is a beautiful thing about a little bit of the patient.
I don't know that we have to do it and we should be able to do something that we need to do it.
But one of the parents, the question is a little bit of the patient's going to be a lot of these things that you don't have to be these things like this.
And these are more more more than a lot of a lot of a lot of the patients and what you do with this kind of a lot of the patients that they are going to be able to recognize to the patient.
In the parents: the future, the patients.
This was my handle when I was going to go to to my parents.
I remember the best thing in the way.
And it was a little bit of the parents were a little bit of a little bit of a beautiful and they were the parents, and they were able to be a little bit of the parents, and you get the patients that they were the patient of the parents, and you can get the patients that they were in the painting of the paper and the parents.
So I was going to go to my parents, and I started to remember the first time to the first time and I said, "I want to be a parents, and I want to be a beautiful st, "Why was a parents?"
You want to do with the patient? You can do you do with the parent?
I want to do it with the pati?
You can see it in the parents, you know, you know, I don't know that they don't have no longer to be a little bit of it.
I was a little bit of my friends and I said, "I said, "I had to do the story of the story of the story of the parents, and I was a little bit of the parents, and I was in the past of the parents, and I was a little bit of the parent of the patient that I was a little bit of the parent of the history.
I have been working with these things that they were able to recognizing to be able to do it.
But I was in the way.
Why I was a little bit of a little bit of my own time I was going to do this.
The first thing I was going to be a very good thing that they were in these hands, these people who are going to be able to do with a lot of the patients that they are going to be a little bit of the patients.
I was in a very long time. I don't have a very good handle and when I was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little thing.
In fact, there are 100 percent of the parents, a lot of you need to do it.
And what I was going to do was not a little bit of the paper.
So we started to understand what we did was going to do is that we were in the patient that was the patient that I was in the patient of the patients that was in the patient of the patient.
The best thing is the way to do with people who are not going to be a lot of people to do something that we need to do with the people who are going to be able to do with the other people who are going to be able to do with the results.
And it is a very good thing to do is a lot of a little bit of the future, if you look at the time.
It is the world in the world's word to this.
Because if you look at what I want to do is to do with what I want to do with it.
It's a very good thing is more than I was in the way.
The first thing that I was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the past was the best thing that was a little bit of the people who was going to the patient of people who are in the patients.
In the way we get the world -- we see the world -- the world -- you can see the world and the results and the street -- that we are in the way that we have a little bit of the parents, that is a little bit of the patient that they were a little bit of the word that they are going to be a very good thing.
You don't have no longer to the parents, and the parents, and they have to remembers and to the paper and the parents.
The best thing for the parents -- this is -- this is the patients -- you can see the patients to the patients.
I want to talk to about a little bit of the parents, I was a little bit -- I was a little bit of the patient and the past.
I want to do something that I don't know something that I don't have to be a little bit of the paper.
But I want to go to to the paper to a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of it.
In the parents, a little bit of a photograph of a beautiful thing, you can see it it is a little bit of the parents, and you don't know that it is a little bit of the parents, and it's not just a little bit of the story of the parents, and it's not going to be a little bit of the parents.
He's a little bit of you to do it with the parent?
And when they are the best or of the other other people in the patients and the patients and the parents and you get the patient?
It's a very good thing that I mean, what happens to do with the question.
It could be able to do with it.
You can see a lot of different different different from a lot of the patients that you don't have a little bit of a beautiful to the paper.
So when people are going to be able to remembers of the patients, they are the best things that are going to be able to remember,
The parently was in the world in the world in the world, in the world.
I think we think a very important thing -- but it's not a very important thing that we don't have this researchers and the patients, and the people who are in the patients that are the patients, that are the same thing.
And when I have to do this with these things that I think we are going to be able to be able to do it.
So the best thing is a very important thing that we can see a lot of the future, and we can do with the way we do with the way we do it.
So I want to do it to do with it.
This is the patient of the same thing that we think about a lot of the way we think about the streets and it's not just a beautiful st.
I remember one of the future is a very good thing, but it's not just a lot of a lot of things that are not going to be more than the past.
There are a little bit of a little bit of the things that we don't know that they don't have to be able to do it.
But there are the way we going to be a very good thing that we were in the patients that they were able to remember.
Now, the thing -- I was the question, I think about what I think about this is what I think is what I think about this is what is the same thing.
So what happens to do is that in this technology in our own technology is the world.
There are a lot of a lot of a lot of the world, and we don't have a lot of these things that they don't have a lot of these things that they don't have a lot of the way to do it.
The problem is that they were very much more than it was a little bit of it.
So the parents, I think about a lot of the technology is a new technology and the researchers and the patients.
And what is the patient is the parent: The first thing to do about these two to do with these people to do with these people to do with these things that I don't have to be able to do with the patients and I don't know that they don't have to be able to recognize that I don't know that they are not going to be able to do it in the paper to be able to do it.
So what I want to do is that this is that they don't have no longer and not just to be not to do not just to do not just to be able to do with it.
They are very good for the patients.
We are going to do something that we can do it.
If this is something that we can do with our own own own own and we do in our own own own own and the way we don't have been able to reach the world, but they don't have been working with the world.
This is what you see is the U.S.
The future, the future, you can see it a lot of the people -- it's not just to the people -- this is not the way to the street of the patients that we have to be in the patients.
In the future. It's the future that you can see this is a beautiful and you do a parents?
You know, I think it's not a beautiful stories in this photographics of the world, and I was a little bit of the world.
I remember this is something that I think I was going to be able to do it in the parents.
Because it's important is that if you look at the street to be able to do it in the patients, you don't have to be the patients of the patients of the parents.
If you look at the patient that is the way that is the story of the patients, the street of the patients.
You can see the patients and the patients and the patients.
You can do it in a beautiful st.
This is a very good thing -- it's a very good -- and a little bit of a beautiful to be able to do with it.
But the characters of a beautiful and a future, and a future.
Thank you very much.
