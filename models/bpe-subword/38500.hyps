This is your couple of your second crows, the second Sracial Stampled in the previously Cracia.
One of the best of the bad of charges of the Cracies of the Cracies of the Cracies was this one.

That's why we are our principles is to spend a big slide for public effort to the public of public efforts to help us to help us to help us to help us and complicated the well-weather good.
The fact is that in fact, in fact, the best bad is not dirty bar.
We think it's currently -- and smells and well.
So it will not ingly ingriving for climate change for climate change.
You know, this is what we are in our time.

But this is the sounds of the best of the bad of bad good.
And as the good goods is one of the principles of the principles of global inquering technology that you see the bad of the bad that you see here is everything.
Look at the attention, this is the technology today of the case of the case of the course.

Thank you very much.
And the year I did a brand a LHC.
And we promised to come and give you a data and give you a data about how this works.
So here are the masse. And so the people who had no standing here, the largest experiment that was the biggest that was incertainly 27 kilometers -- Cirkilometers of the Stree, or is to recreate contains of a billion seconds of a billion seconds.
It's extremely ambitious.
This is under the Geneva.
We photographs "Big Bangs" inside of these decades.
I work on this one. It's called the ATLASSTASSSSSSSS -- Long a 22 metri a floor a photo the ATSD phocket in the ATSTATLSSSSTAT's work.
On the ptember, I started the paper for the first time for the first time.
And this image was made by ATLAS.
It causes a huge celebration in the room in the room of control.
It's a picture of the first fascle of the phases that the fashipping of the system of the system of LHC, the deliberately deliberated with a deliberate of LHC, though the detector.
In other words, when I was seeing that images a slide of 10 such such a big stive that the apart of functional works.
I don't know that if that was the largest ovacuums, or that someone went on on the page, and he sees the first page, and he sees that the first page.
It meant a cultural impact cultural impact of the impact of style impact of the state of the impact of the state of standard impact of the state that we were mainness that we were mainly a cultural impact of that we did a cultural impact of a cultural impact of cultural impact of cultural impact on the language of the cultural impact on the language of the impact of the impact of the impact impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact of the impact impact impact impact of the impact of the cultural impact of state impact of the pact of the cultural impact of the cultural impact cultural impact cultural impact
After about a seven a paptama per of the apart, which was actually a character that had been deal with these field -- these field floor.
These are being transport 13 thousands of maximes that are working on power to power in power of maximum in power of maximum
Now, the engineers in the room and say, "I can't transsport and say, "I can't transsport myself as a myself as a myself as a myself to the myself of the engineering of the street engineering in the room of the street engineers in the room of the streams in these days.
But I can do that when I'm at temperatures are becoming what they call the superconducted to be swimming that are swimming to be swimming
So as a two-two-two-sharing collected spaces of the star of the case of the case can transsport of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case in the way to be transports.
At one of the people between the people between the HC, was a LHC, was a fabricatic defeces.
So that the comes that the comes and the 13 thousands of both both of both electrics.
This was the result.
This is more presence when those magnets are making over 20 tons, and they are about 20 tons, and they are deplased almost 30 case of about 30 case of the farming of 30 degrees of working on the way of those is more presence of those are more presentially presentially presending those figuredly retirement to those magnetworks.
So we determine about 50 percent of the magntism.
We had to go affect affect affair, and we do.
I reconceived it all of the time, we repair it again.
And now we go back into the subteran.
The swapper at the end of the LHC will be like the LHC will be like a new silk of the same.
We will go back again, and we are so far we can get into the iuly, and we will continue to be in the house to the outside of the universe.
Now, of course, in a way, those of those reopen discussions of recognizing about the importance of the importance of stiff, it's been been to rejected to respect.
I think that because the fact is that this is so difficult to be difficult to experiment, is that the important of the experiments of the experiments like HC.
I'm going to lask that inches are a story of a stiinary scientists of a Britisphrase, when the inside of the protect of the protect of the protect of the protect of the mind of mines that are not more dangerous for the mind-dangerous mines are not ended, that we are not finally finished to assume that are not working lies are finally finisheriting in our mind."
Thank you.
I wish wish to remember the child-board, when you play with the bodies with the body.

So I think of research in the IT researcher of this inspired by this useful of physical objects -- I prepared -- I started with my consultaneously -- I started to get a Kalana Kalana -- I started to use a mouse -- I began to a computer, in place that you can use a mouse of this under of the mouth-handled with a finger and a fingerprint of this under and a little bit of a masss that we could be massssssslippping and to the whether you can be a map of the cushilk to be the purpose of the cancer in that we ken to be able to be able to be able to make it as if we can be the cancer IT caur IT chaving cushility of the cancer IT cil.
Addance how we want to wise?
This is what this fascinating was so fascinating that I decided to ask Siftables building Siftable.
On the short, a Sift computers is a slide of a bisco of a bisure.
They can be manufacturing to the recivil perceive the miscase of one of the food and a reless, and they have a reless.
The most important is that they're palpable is like the couples you can miss it as you just call it as you just approaching it.
And Sift example of an example of a new ecosystem of a new equital manipulation of the digital information of digital information
On the massource of the palpable to do more constive to the miscase of each other, and constive one of the active non-inceive active active and funny of the interactive and funny and destruction of interactive and funny and insand.
I'm going to start with some examples of example.
This Sift is configuring is configuring video in a direction of a direction, if you include in a direction, if you include in the other parts of the other parts of the other parts of the apot.
These portraits of interactive are constive one of the other ones of each other.
So if they put them together one language one language.
If I'm surrounded and that they can become confusions and that they can become confusions.
I can also feel and inclining and incline.
We realized that one of the involves of interactive involves is that we can use gestablishment to manipulate the culture of snaps, as we had a culture of a liquid culture as we had a license of a lhidden lhidden a lhidden of one of the implications of inactising one of the inactises of inter
In this case that we have three Siftables like galets like galetets and they can use them to be able to use them in the center where they will amest.
If we go too much, we can take a little bit of the inside of the case in the apotent.
There are also interesting to education, as possibility for education, like language, mathematical and logs that we want to give people possibility to figure out how things we want to see the results.
So here -- this is a Fibonacial Tibonacial programs.
Here we have a game of words, like combination of combination and Bogging and Bogging and Bogger.
In fact, every single target, you know, a literally in the intimes, and the massource of the masssource of the words of a dictionary.
Then after about 30 seconds of the literal resects and a new types and new positions and new possibility and new possibility of shared and unded.
Thank you.
These are nists that have children who came into the Media, and I had to do the Media, and I had to try to convince a material.
I love it to crazy.
And one of the interesting thing that kind of applies of this kind of applications is that you don't need to give people a lot of instructive.
All I must say, "For words, and they know what it is.
Here are some other people intritried to it.
This is the most tant, our tester in the right.
It seems like everything that he wanted to push it was to put the Siftable ones one over the other one over the other one one.
So to him there.
This is a targets across animates.
We want to build a tool of the people who are invented to the language.
And this is Felix.
He can get new character, just the stages of the Sift of the Sift of the Sift of the Sift of the characters.
Here is the sun.
Video: The race.
David Merrill: Now he brought a traction in the scene.
Video: The Tracks.
Good well.
When Sift Siftable and Siftable one language can make the character -- Video: Video: Video: Ham!
DM: I create their narrative and the narrative and the narrative.
Video: Hello.
DM: It's a story with the final story of how it will it drawing it will drawing the window.
Video: The pish.
DM: The universe that I showed today is a today and interpresence is a music and interpreted music and interpresented the music that we were built and all the Sift of sounds like Sift and bas the rhitm, bas the rhitm, bas well.
Each one of these four variative, different various various that you want to use it to use it to use it.
And you can inject the sounds in a successful that you can assemble that you can ask that you will.
You go to the sounds like Sift Sift Sift Sift Sift Sift Sift Sift Sift Sift Siftable silk.
There are effects that you can control the free of free and filter.
You know, you have a certain sounds and then including it sounds to help it with the hell it
It takes general effects like the tempt and the volume that the floor of the squiring of the Second HLet's sequence of the Spect.
Video: M: M: M: M: M: Mritm Siftables of successful Sift of a series of a serious series, I was rhyth.
Now I put a base.
Video: My by: I bring a little bit of a little bit of the percup.
Video: My D: And now I'm going to bring the filter of the philosphere the track of the leaders.

Now, under the sample, I can estomat intreated by the second Sift Sift Sift Sift in the stangle of the stang.
Thank you.
As I see my passion is creating new interfaces is creating new interfact that fuel better with the way that works better with the brain that works and our body body and our body body and our body body and the body body of the brain.
And today, I had a time to show a coordination of this new space, and a space, and a couple of possibilities that we were trying to get out of the lab.
The one that I would remember that I was in granted to this new generation with this new generation of instruments of instruments of instruments that will bring the digital rules of our information in our world of our rules of our rules.
Thank you very much.
Astt with you that you would all be with you all the type.
I'm writing.
He wrote the career, but it's like this, but it's more than it to.
It's all my big love and fascinates and fascinating.
And I don't walk that this is to change the time.
But these are these barrasses that the strange of recently in my career and in my career, which he determined me that I had a story of my works.
And the thing is that I written this is that I written this broken indness of "Manca, Rover, Rover, which is the deosphorus to deal with my character to the world for my characterious mega-based mega-based mega-by-sensor that motivate this very very bester international best megaga-sensor of the best beller balance of the world for a best.
The reliable is that everywhere where I go ahead now, people are conditions.
Serio--- condamnose, condamnature!
For example, and for example, and I say, "You don't you get themselves is the themselves that never will be performance you might never be performing that you might be performance you will reach that you would be performance of performance it?
Do you don't have the themselves you to write your state in your state lives, you ever make a little bit of a book that are ever going to be a little bit of a whe?"
It's very line links in real time.
But it would be more running if I didn't mean to remember 20 years, when I was 20 years, I started to be slowed to people -- as I was bringing to be adolish -- like I was in written the same spot of reactive reactive reactive reactive as a base of a way of frick.
And people said, "You don't you have no more you would never have succeed?"
I don't really walk that humiliness will kill you kill will kill you kill the ide?
Do you don't have your fear is your fear in this field and you don't have any opposed to be here, and nothing will be here and deadly deadly in a dead death with a dead death with the center of the equipped of the ecture of the ecture of the equire of the echo of the ecsize of your equire you will be your fairly in this especially you will go to this engineer and you will be in this field of your equire life in this fire life with your engineer and you will will be a dequarruit out.
Something like this.
The answer -- the slide on the short at all those insects are "Y."
Yeah, I mean, you know, it's all of those things.
And it always photo.
And it's just floating in the way that people who don't even have a lot of other things that people can't intuition.
As an example of the big algs that are infrared infrared of things that are infrared.
But when it's about written about written and I still thinking, and the last time I was asked in the last time, "Why is "Why is "Why is "Why is "Why are you while I was talking about?"
Is it something rational rational to it?
It's logic that anybody to have the top of that they were funny that they were willing to make it on this Pame.
And what is that is so specifically initiatively that seems like non-sanitation that is really nice in a way that other professional professional teachers don't do it?
My father was my chemist, for example, and it doesn't remember that in the 40 years of his 40 years of his 40 years of the chemical engineering to be a chemical engineer to be a chemist.
It wasn't happened -- John, how the chemicals in the chemical?
It just doesn't really get something happen.
But to be honests, the chemists that have chemists like group of the century of remarkable remarkable to be alcoholic maniaco-depressive maniaco-depressive.
We writers writers are this reputation, and not only writers and not only writers of all sorts of all kinds of all kinds of being powerful as they have a power of lab.
And everything we have to look at the number of morning the number of mortal registruggle in the century, in the Mind-magnificent murdesic and drawings and drawing of the young people and opened by the young people and drawing the man.
And even the same same thing that didn't call it to be really swim to really be the funny of your own talent about the state of talent about the street.
Norman Mailer, indeed to die, in the last person said, "Each one of my books my books had a little bit more of my books a little bit more of my bottom."
A great task about a great deal of a life of a life.
But we don't even even even when we hear someone saying someone saying that we heard that we heard so many times and buying things and a complete and a complete and suffered that creativity and suffered that creativity and suffer as an art, the weather and that arty, it will always be in a massive to the barrasses of suffering to the suffering.
And the question I want to add it today today I want to bring it today is you are with this idea: Do you have impatient?
You are comfortable comfortable as the as the light of the living with this babies -- I don't get this despair.
I think it's odias.
And I think it's dangerous and not want to see it in the future of the future.
I think it's better if it's better if you get the artists artists to live artists to live in.
And I know that I think of my situation -- in my situation -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to come to me to the character of this ipotuned of this hypothesis now professional because I find out the circumstant.
As an example, I'm pretty much about 40 years.
We probably have a four decades before the mountains before the mountains of works.
And it's very likely that everything I wrote with this moment to be the judged by the way, the babies of my work of the last last money to the last last couple of my last couple of my last couple of my last last bridge of my last couples of my last whole thing to be written that I will write everything I will write everything to write everything I will write a bad of the moment of my moment of my judgment that I would be judgment to be judgain.
What would be to say to the mappper in a way in a kind of one way of the friends -- it's very likely to be a successful way to be intamed to be a success.
Oh, my Gand: Oh, my Gand!
This is the gene gender that could make somebody to make somebody to get the nine to the nine of the nine of the nine of the nine of the morning.
I think it continues to do this message that I love love.
And then the question becomes inde?
And so it seems to be a lot of meditative meditative that we have to work now, to continue to write a kind of psychological building to the psychological protective protective protective protective protective protective protective and it is it to be a very well-to-land it seems to be a lot of meditative meditative meditative meditative to the way to do now,
I got to get a way, to find a way to pastrally a floor a distance, the ones that write, and my father, the ones that will be a nature, that will be reactive to what it written to what is written to what is written to what I write.
And as I was looking for the last year of this year of this sense of the time, and I started to find out the time, and I tried to see if you could have better ideas that would have better ideas that would have better ideas of how to be helped people creatively helped people creatively to make people creative.
This is this really led me in Greece, and Roma and Roma and Roma
So the mass of the case is inside the sharks.
But when Great Rome, and the Rome, and the Rome, the people don't believe that people don't believe that the human beings inside the human income inside of the human inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside of the Great Rome, and the Great Rommitical Great and Rome, and the Greantics and Rome.
People believe that creativity was a spirit of helps that the people in a source of people in a source of a source and unintelligence and unintelligence and unintelligence and unintelligence and unintelligence and unset.
The babies called these creativity, creativity, the term of the faimosphere.
Socrats was fairly because it believe that has a demon that the sepciple in the department of department.
The same spirit of the same pares, but they call that spirit of creative, yet they had that spirit of genius of the genius of the genius of the genius of the same disorderal relief had the same pareas, they had the same pared had the same pares had the same pared had the same pared of the same pares had the same pared of the same pared spirit of the same pared spirit of the same pared spirit of the same parea, but they were name that spirit was called that
What is wonderful, because the romants were actually not that a genius had a genius had a genius had a little bit of a little bit of windows.
They think that a genius was a kind of magics in the divince of the divince of the wall, in a way of Dobby, and in a way of Dobby, and insession and insession and insession and insession of the works, the myself of the works.
Absoliter -- this is the distances, it is the distances, that we were building the psychological result of your works.
And everything knowledge works, right?
So the artist was protected by certainly protected as much narcism, right?
If you could work was the strallowing of the street that you could have the state of the world that you had this genius that you had this genius that you had helped you to help.
If you had a criticism was not completely the critical of your works, right?
Everybody knows that the genius was pretty much like ignorant.
So they look at the West creativity for a long time.
And then he came out of Renast, and everything has changed with a certain the big idea of the big idea of the big idea of the universe of the universe and mystic weather and mystic growth for the dives, to be the dival for divince of divince of divince of divince of divin.
It was beginning to be human rational and people started to create that creativity that creativity of the individual income of the individual inside.
And for the first story in historic history of one or one or one or one or one or one or one genius as a genius as a genius of a genius of a genius of a genius of a genius of the bartists in the history of the story in history in history.
And it will be marty, I think it was a huge error.
And I put the person on a simple simple simple person or a simple sense of a myster and the source and the source and the source and the source of mystern, creative too much to a little bit of a little story of the psychological challenge.
It's like you someone who you have a so-hitcha so-like soar.
It's just incocket and deform cheeepting all these extended together all these extended inimaginable inimaginable inimaginable insand.
I think that the pressure of one of the palter of the last 500 years old.
And if I think it's true, and I think it is, the question is that we do now?
Can we do things like this?
Maybe we can go to the sense of the relationship between the people and the mystery of the mystery of the mystery.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't just stering 500 years of human thinking, we can be 500 years of a human rational discussion through a 18 minutes.
And it probably as the audience that would be the affect that would be the lawyer of stiintific stage, the people in fact, which is actually the people in fact, which they are in their projects and him.
It probably not going to cooperate on this idea.
But the question I want to ask is -- why not?
Why don't we think about this way of this?
Because it has send sense of something else as something else as something else of the case of the creativity of the creatively inner of the creatively of the creatively provide of the process of the process of the process of the way that has been in the way to be a sense of as any elderly as any other as difference as any other things.
It process that anybody else has been trying to create something -- you know, all the way here -- you know that it always -- you know that it always of always --
And in fact, sometimes can put the right of the parally.
Recently I had a story where I knew the extraordinary of the poet Mauth Stone, which was a 90 years ago, which was poet in the poet of the story of the story of the type of winning to work on the windness of Virginia, and it feels to work on the ropper and heard a poem and heart to the window.
The story that was like a val vantage of the ants of the air.
And they pravaling over the room.
The synthesis, because they are swimming the past.
And that moment that moment is a single thing is, and that is read, "To do it as a mes."
And the alerging to the house to the house and the purpose, and the paper and a charge of sufficient and a creating sufficient to a fast-bridge, when the past to put a bunch of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the house of the house of the house of the house on the house of poem, and the purpose.
Sometimes had no faster as the alerga and alerga and alerg, but it doesn't get in the house and the poem, and the poem, and the poem, and the poem, and the poem, and the poetry on the "other room of the "another room, I read the "other poethank."
They were also also at the point that -- and the parts of that -- when the story of that story is that the story of the story of the dead of the deep of the deliver of the deliver of the deliver that is also the story of the deep of that -- and they were also in the moments that -- and the points of that -- and this is not going to be this -- and this is that -- and this will never forget this one.
Alerga home and the map and the poem, and the poems of the exact and the story of the exact of the exact of the other that it was indeed with the other of the other of the other of the other and case it and the case of the other and same.
The poems of the poems and the source and the source of the massource of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the poem.
So in this situation, the map of the map of the map of the map of the case and intack at the first of the first word at the first word at the first word at the first of the first word.
When I heard -- it's supranatural -- it was exactly how my own own creative.
My creative process doesn't leave it at this -- they're not driving -- they're not driven dgum!
I'm a catching and working on the way I go every day and translate every day and track and track and track me and true.
But even I really was in my indarkness I was touched that phenomenon.
And I just imagine that they were and many of you.
And I had designed and I had projects that they had been coming from a source that I don't know that I don't know that I don't know it.
And what happens to do this?
And as it assumes that we should be able to lose us at this same way we don't lose our minds, yes, yes, yes, yes, we are satched to help us sanatosid?
For me, the most relevant of our dails, which we could do is that we are the musician Tom Waitt, the cartoon Waitt, the cartoon a couple of years in the revil of revival review.
I talked about this suggests that was almost everything was almost everything that was almost everything that is indeeply to control the artist, and find these involved, and find these incontrols these inably incontrolled and gestablished and inably interiorized by interiorized this completely interiorized this and all of the subjected and control of this and control of the artist.
With again and the line of the line story, and the story of a day in a day to Los Angeles Angeles and then everything has changed and then everything has changed.
While I drive from a bagment of a bagment that they come from a little bit of a mind that they come into the mind and amazing and a deset of inspiring and a will, it's splenda, it's not to be how to splenda, but it doesn't how to water.
It doesn't have no found, it doesn't have created, no reporto.
It indeed to be that the old anxiety of that I can lose the "A of a moment of the moment of the time for a little bit of the money for along the money for alone.
I'm not good enough to receive it to receive it.
And instead of the panic in the paintings stopped out.
He stopped the process and made something and made something and we all it.
He taught the water and said, "Scouple and said, "South, you don't see that I'm on the volunte?"
"You seem like I can write a chantest a cantest now?
If you really want to really be to be in a moment of a moment in a moment of a little bit of you.
If it doesn't even anybody else and it does somebody else.
They are going to make it on Leonard Cohen."
His is creative process that has changed this.
Not operates has continued to be as a such intuned as intuned as it always like this.
But the process, and the intreated around his agnosed around his job, the time that he took the spike, the genide that he was the kind of reach, and he had to get it to the cause of the today and he had to go back and then he had to be something that they don't have to be something so that they don't have to be something so that they don't have to be and Chinese and Chinese and Chinese and Chinese and Chinese and Chinese job.
It could be this collaboration and bizarre and bizarre and bizarre the exterior of the exterior of the exterible that was not too much like Tom.
And after I heard the story of the story that I was working and already a piece of the way I was working on a data.
This approach to me when I was at the mid-bag of "Manca, Rool, Rool, and I was like a kind of like a kind of samples that we are all of a kind of desperaring with something that we couldn't get a very best challenge, and you will be the best challenging of a wishing choose, that will be the best of the best rise to be the best.
Not just provide that the best shelf wish.
I had to think of me would be able to abandon, and I just would abandoned the project.
I remember the himself and I remember talking and I was trying to be and I tried and I was tried and I was tried and I was trying to get and I was certainly and I remember it.
I went to my view of the manuscripped my comments and I brought a collected collection of a collection of the camera.
I told with voice voice and you know that you and you know that if you know that if this is not just the extraordinary is not just the extraordinary will not just be the extraordinary will not just be the window is it?
Because you can see you just put one at the batain everything I would like to hear that I couldn't be able to do it.
So if you want if you want to be better than so much attempted to you and you have to do the floor your couple of the job.
Okay. And if you don't do this, you know, you are all of the bath.
You will write for this is my message.
And I want to conean that I did today I did my far today I did the floor of my job."
Because -- the conclusion is, in the way, hundreds of years in Northertural African people obsessed to sarbed to sarbiting and music and music through dances, the floor of the long races in races of races in race.
And they were always wondering, because they were the dancing and the advanced and they were remarkable and right?
But sometimes very rules, and one of the interpret of the interpret of coming from combat from common from common from common in common
I'm convinced you to know what I mean, because all of you see all the time, because all of you see that all of a certain time.
It's like the time is stopping and dancy and dancing is by a kind of slightly different than one of the other 10,000 series of other 1,000 series of each other 1,000 series of others.
On a time, it doesn't seem to be in the ingome.
It's the lights and light and light is the games and light is the divinced of the divinced divinced.
As time, when they were standing people standing what was the namples were and they said the name.
They were mainly impress and they were "Allah, Allah, Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, Alllah, the Doamn, Doamn, Doamn, Doamn,
It's God.
A historic historic -- when the maurt of Spanish had invented with this obile of Spanish and the pronuntil the pronuntil "Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah."
and they hear in the fights and dances, and dances.
In Spain, when a interpret and magic interpret and magic and magic myself and the gole, Allah, the arm."
So it is a slide -- a farms.
It's wonderful, because we need something like this.
But the parts of the second day is when the dancing dancing is that they are excited is that it's bad and discovering is not a light bulb and it's not a light bulb and it's not a light of Dield of Dield Dield Ciell.
It's a dirital disorders that they would like to be done and the task and the intimate that never could be inalulive to almost until it as inaluly in the time.
Could you be no one more invoice to the name of the name of the Dominoses that they should be sure with the restoration of his life with the restoral of his lifese?
It's hard to be hard.
It's one of the most painful acceptable in the creative life.
But it may not be a big character of that if you don't think about the beginning of your most extraordinary parts of your most extraordinary parts of your inside.
Maybe if you think about that you were imprised by a source of a source of a source of a source of a source of the splend-far pieces of the other of the body, when the moments of the case were inchanged.
If we think about this way, all of us so that it is happening.
I started thinking about this and thinking, and I thought about the last months of the last months of the last months that will be published to the book that will be published and infrared and infrastructure and infrastructure and infrastructure of my success and infrared of my success.
And what we do is I repeated when you lose the courage, you don't have the theater.
It doesn't be scared. I don't think you have the continier to the content of the content of the part, whether you would be doing.
If you're dancing, then dances, then dances, they dance.
If the genius and express the divine that you are repair to leave the decades that extraordinary to your extraordinary equal effort through your effort through your effort by your effort by the way, "Ol."
And if no, it dancing anyway.
And with all of this "Ole!" for you.
I think of these things and I think we should pre-pre-prepared to predate them.
"Only!" for you, you just have a love dragoes and incapital for the human participation and incapital to participate in continuation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
June Cohen: Ole!
I talked about some of these projects, about the human genome, and what the genome of the human genomes and new genes of genes.
Now in fact, from a new point: we have digitized biology, and now we try to start this code from this code from this code and sycoddness and synthesizing and symologists and synthesis of life.
We tried to ask us to ask us to ask questions.
"What is the life I think many biologists have tried to understand the diverse of different biologists.
We tried to different approach to the live of the components of the basic components of the basic components
We already already almost 20 years.
When I set the killed genome, this was the world of the world of the world of the world's digital world of the digital world of the digital world.
Now we try to ask to ask question, or we can create new forms of life in this universe, from this universe of this universe of this universe of this universe of this universe of this universe of the universe of questions we try to ask to ask to ask to ask to ask to ask to ask to ask to ask to ask to ask to ask them
This is the map of a small organism of genitalistic organism that has the smallest genomes for a single species that can reply the only lab.
We tried to see if we can come to a genome and smaller genomand smaller.
We were able to suddenly until a hundreds of genes in the room in the room.
But when we look at the map of map, it's pretty simple comparison with our comparison with our comparison.
I think of myself, that's simple.
But when we look at all the genes we can suddenly suit at a time, it's a little bit of the cells of the cells of the cell.
So we decided that the only way we decided to be able to synthesize this cromosome, so that we can see this components to the most fundamental components to the most fundamental questions.
And so we started the drumping, "Can we synthesize a cromosom?"
Maybe it allows to synthesize these molecules that we never ever made that we ever ever ever made that more we ever ever ever be?
And if yes, we can active a cromosome?
A cromosome, by the way, it's just a chemical piece of chemical material.
So our speed speed to digitize that the exponential of the exponentially.
Our opportunity to write code movement movement movement, but it grows up.
The last time has come to a close at a cloud curve at a very exponential curve
I started this better than 15 years.
I went through a few ethaper, in fact, with a bio-examination before the first experiments.
But it turns out that the DNA is very difficult is very difficult.
There are thousands of machines in the world that are small DNA, months of DN, months of the DN, but it's a longer than a decades of degenerative process, so why we built a piece of herrors apart.
So we had to create a new way to put these little way to put these little pieces together and right-bulls together.
This was our first tentage, our tentage, beginning from the digital shape of Phi 2174.
It's a little bit that human bacteria.
We made design, we went through the balance of the herrors, and we get a molecule of DNA molecule of DNA molecule of DNA five literally about 5,000 literally literally about 5,000 literal litertle.
The interesting interesting was when I took this chemical material that we took this chemical material and bacteria started to read this code began to read the code of the viruse.
The viral paper were then eliberated and eliberated the cells and they killed the cells of E. collected cells.
I talked to the oil of oil encourage and saying that they were really clearly and they were really understanding this model.
They ran to go to the weather than you.
And so we think this is a situation where the software that software the map of the map of the map of the map of biological system.
But we wanted to do something more like this.
We wanted to build the entire cromoss of a bacteria.
This is over 580,000 literal literally code code code code code of code code code
So we said to put the pursue in the house in the house of the size of the size of the size of the house of the house of a cells of a lives.
And the critical is is critical and if you start with the information in computer, that information has to be very exactly that information has to be very exactly the exactly the information has to be very exactly the exactly the critical is is that information is critical critical, and if you start with the critical, and if you start with the information is critically, and if you start with the information of the digital information is critical information of the dig
When I was the first sequence in 1995, the standard of precisely precisely in 10,000 per windows in 10,000 per wall.
I found the result resection, 30 of the original errors. If we were used to be used to be the original sequence of the original act.
The design is designing is designing the projector that has long gone that has to be south, which has to be south, which is far more to build sub-unities that are so much more to build so that the bad of each other.
We are projects too.
You can read that I put "watermarkets in the house in the house of this: we have a genetic code from four literally four literally and T.
Tripplewing -- those literally literally codifest about 20 amino acive acious acident, one literally -- one literally every amino acid.
So we can use the code of genetic words, to write words, thinking.
Only everything I did was to hear the code.
Some people were despairing that it's not poetry.
We designed those broken that we can digitally digitally digital with enzyms.
I'm enzyme and I have to give them and they play them together.
So we started to make a little bit of a little bit of a five to 7,000 literally literally literally to do these letters to make them a 24,000 literally literally setting of these sets in this lawyer, walking to 7.000.
Every every single stream, we have these baby bed that we could see, but we try to create a very extreme to create a bunch -- as you can see in a minute.
We try to get to that point of automatically automatically automatically
So this looks like a baskets of the baskets.
When we get it to the market in a bunch of 100,000 per per per purpose, not growing in E. cols.
They are all the tools of the biology of molecular biology.
So we went to other mechanisms.
I knew that there is a mechanism called the human mechanism that biology that biology that biology that they have DNA, and that unless broken barrasses that unless bad bully.
This is an example.
There are a Deinococcus called Deinococcus that can sustaining million radiation.
As you see in the paper peal is the cromosis is of his chromosome.
12 hours to 24 hours later, he put it out of the way it was at the beginning.
We have thousands of organisms that can do that.
These organisms can be drawling total.
I can live in living in living in living in living in living lives.
I'm absolutely sure that life can be in the extra space of extracted to find a new environmental environment.
In fact, NASA showed that this is happening.
This is a micrograph micrograph of a molecules that we build these process -- actually using these drages with designs of the dry of the adecisions that we put out of the adecisions I put out of the average of the average of a micrograph of a micrograph.
Drodia together automatically automatically automatically automatically
This is not a little bit from a microscope with electrons, but just a photo-micrograph.
It's so big molecule that we can see a microscooptical microscooptical microscope of a microscope of a microscope of a microscope of a microscope of a molecule this is so a big molecule that a big molecular molecule that we can see it with a big molecule molecule.
These are collecting collects over a six seconds.
This is a public public public public public public public public public public public public public public publisher.
These are over 580,000 literal literally code code code code code code
It's the biggest molecule of people, with a definitely structure of definitely defined structure.
It has a molecular molecular than 300 million million million million of it.
If we go with a funny funny, 142 pages and without spaces this code code of genetic code this code code of genetic code of genetic code with a genetic funny with a funny funny funny with a font funny funny and without a funny funny funny and without space,
So how do we go a cromosome?
Obviously a virus is pretty easy.
But it's much more complicated to work with bacteria.
It's also easy to get to the ekilling to ekill you just get to the nuclear and you to get the nuclear and you to put -- clone.
With the archain, the cromoss is is interested in cells, but we showed that we can make a completely transplant that we can make a completely transplant to a cell cells to a cell.
I pursue a crowd crowds.
These second are about as far as the distances, and small distances.
We brought a few genes in the rocket for this cromosome.
I digested it with enzymous and killed it all proteins.
And it was pretty amazing it in the cells -- you will have the very sophisticated the graph of our very sophisticated -- and the cromoss -- and the cromossed in the cell.
In fact, we thought that this is how far can go out and design, but we tried to design the process.
This is a major mechanism of evolution.
We are all kinds of species that have the second chromosome, or a third of the chromosome, or a new characteristic second-by-second second.
So the people who think about evolution just as one gene changing one gene of the biological moment of the biology.
I'm enzyme called the DNA.
The romosome that was in the cells that was not a cell.
The cells -- the cromoss we put them together.
It was expressed and recognized the other cromoss like material that material with the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cells of the cellular and it was recognized and recognized the other chromos, and he was recognomosis the other of the street and so the cells of the cell.
It became blue blue because of genes I put in the genes that we put in the cromosome.
And after a very short period of time, all of the time, all of the characteristics of a new species in a new species that we put on the software that we put in a new species that we put in the cell.
All proteins have been changed membranes have been changed -- when we recognized the code of the genetic code of the code of the code of the code of the code of the protein.
This can software that alchemistry mutual mutual DNA, to change the DNA, to change the DNA, to change the things that are pretty dramatic.
Now, we had been swimming that this is not genesis, but half billion years and a half billion years and a half billion years and we are the way to create a new version of the Cambriant, in which which has a new species of massive new design, in which has been designed by design, based on design design.
Why do that?
I think it's pretty obvious from the point of view of needs of needed to be need.
We are on the way we go from six and half of the million people over 40 years.
To to put this in context for me to me in 1946.
There are three people on the planet for each of 1946; in 40 years, they will be four-year-old people will be four.
We have the problems of fearing the slide of the potable floor fuel, fuel and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and half billion and a half billion and a half billion and a slightly problems of fears of the weapond,
It will be difficult to do it for new it.
We use over five billion tons of tons of books, more than 30 billion barrasses of oil oil oil oil
This means a hundred million barily barily barily of barily barily of barily barily is a hundred of millions of a hundred million of this means a hundred million barily of a hundred hundred million bariles a hundred hundred million barily of barily barily hundreds of million baril.
When we try to think about the challenge biological challenge that this is going to be a challenge that this huge will be a challenge.
Then of course, it's all that CO2 from this material, which is in the atmosphere.
Now, from our discovers around the world, we have a data of the data with 20 million genes, and I like to think about 20 million genes, and I love to think about the components of design.
The electronic induish is just a pain, or something like this, and this is the diversity that came out of this.
We are limited here, at the first range of our biological reality.
We now have the technology of these technologies, data of these synthesis to do what we call what we call that genic combinatoric combinatoric combinatoric combinatoric combinatoric in the improve of these things.
We have the ability to build a large robot that would make a million of cromosomes on day.
When you think you think you to think of these 20 million different genes or trying to choose products to optimize products to produce products of the octan, or a little team of a small team than a small team than a little team than a little team than the last 20 years, than a little bit of the last 20 years.
And this is just standard.
We can select for viability, making chemical production or chemical chemical fuels,
This is a screen capture of a software designing of a software we working on these species in computers in these species in computers.
You know, we don't know how the unlike this.
We know exactly how they look at the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the genetic code of the gendtic code is exactly what we know is exactly what we know is exactly how accelerated.
Now we focused on fuel fuel fuel.
You see recently recently that from the elder of the nine-stand-a-a-until you can recognize.
We have fueling fuels and the third and the third that are the samples that are amazing fuel or killing to fuel or killing to disease or killed by disease.
But the only way we think biology can have a major impact without more and the far costs and the far costs of the food and the floor of the first time to design the first of the cells to design the first generation of the cells of the fuel, and we think we will have the first 18 months of the fuel, and we think we will have the first 18 months.
The light and CO2 is a myself -- but in our world's discovering all the different kinds of other ways of different ways of other ways of different ways of different ways of different ways of different methods of different methods are silk and CO2 is a solar and CO2 is a solar and CO2 is a solar and CO2 is a disease and CO2 is a way --
This is a organism that I described in 1996.
It leads to the deep ocean, about two kilometers and half kilometers and half of the clouds of the clouds of fierror.
Transform CO2 in metan using molecular as the energy as the energy as well.
We try to see if we can take CO2 turns that can be able to take that CO2 c., and converted that CO2 back in the street of the CO2 hours to drive this process to drive this process of the process of the process of the CO2 cO2 sets that the O2 cO2 sets of the CO2 cO2 s-couple.
So in a short of time, we think we could die that we could discover the question of the base of the base of the life?"
We really know -- you know, you know -- we have objective models of the entire industry of industry of the entire industry.
Yeah. If you don't do that in another part. where in another part.
She become a major source of energy.
But we also work now is to use these same source to invent vaccines to invent vaccines immediately to invented.
You see this year with a year with a year with a year and a year when it comes to mind when it comes to the right of vaccine.
I think the situation can be changed the vaccines before the vaccines before before before before before before before before before before before before it before it before it was that the situation of the situation can be changed by the situation can be changed by the situation can be changed by the situation can be changed with combinately changed the vaccine of combinates can be changed by the vaccine before the vaccines before before before the before before before the vaccines before the vaccinating.
Here's how to stand to start to show the future of the future changes the evolution of evolution with bacteria with bacteria with bacteria and finally, the arch, and finally, the eukarch.
We are almost to improve people.
Our big, our biggest to us that we have a chance to survive enough to survive enough to survive enough to make you so much.
What I want to show you more quickly, it's a very quickly, is a fundamental works, a new technology that I brought to Microsoft as a part of a year. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon. This is Seadragon.
It's a local environment that can be local with a big amount of data visual data.
We look at a lot at many of the bulls and a lot of photos and drive in the continuous and driving through this doraming through this doraming with this doram.
It doesn't matter how much information we are looking at how much information are these large collected collections are these large images.
Most of the photos are a beautiful camera -- but this is a very useful stand, for example, is a scanne, the order of 300 megaps, the order of 300 megapixels.
It doesn't really important, because the only thing that the only thing that should be the number of a pixels of your baby of your babies of your baby at a very flexible.
This is a non-book is non-imaging book
It's about "The Saa a Saa Casican Dickens. Each one colored is a colored of a capital cell.
To show you that it's about text, and not imagine to you and not imagine to do something like this, we can really do something like this, it's a real representation of a real broken image of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of a picture of you to show you that it's not a picture of you show you that it's about it.
Maybe this is an artificial way to read.
I wouldn't recommend.
This is a more real case of "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian "Gardian
Each image is that the beginning of a sections.
This is really gives you a little bit of an experience of a love of a read of a read of a wall, which is inherent or a lot of the purpose.
We did something small collection with this number of "Gardian in "Gardian
I created a false reclaim at a very larger than any of the very larger -- much more than any of the usual content -- and we remember a content content.
If you want to see the property of this machine, you can see here.
Or other models, or even the technological specifications.
And this is actually from certainly enough to be the limitations of a limited monitor.
We hope that this is to resign the pop-ups and the other mizers, and the gene of this gene -- which are not necessarily -- which are not necessary.
Of course, the mapping is one of the applications for a kind of a gene of this gene.
I'm not going to fly long over this is just to tell you that we have to tell you that we have to tell you that we have contributed to this field.
These are all the way in the United States in the United NASA.
Let's go to something else.
This is actually active on Internet now.
This is a name of Photosynth, which is the second technologies is the Seadragon and the other one of the Auth, and the other of the visual visual visual visual University of the University of Washington, the University of Washington, I loved the U.W. Washington, I had Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Seath,
and Rick Szelki at Cerced Microsoft.
So this is active on the Internet. Here because of Seadragon.
You can see when we create that when we create this kind of perspective, when we can have this kind of experience in many soldier in many soldier in many soldiers.
But the arrange of these images that contest conted.
Algorithms of perception have been registrated these images that they have these images that they are the very very space where these pictures -- all these pictures -- they were doing these Grass -- they were made out of the Canadience here -- they were made these stable stabilized or painting here and these elements here here are the relationship of a stable projects here have been across the space of space projected inside of the space of the space.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you other environments.
There are some of some of the space.
I would like to go to one of the original sets of the original sets of the original cockness of a Photosynth that I worked in the various piece of this technology, technology that is the piece of this technology, technology that is not just the projecting projecting projecting projects that we put the projects that we have a projections that we put the projects that we have a projection of the original projecting on the paper of the pursue of the paper that we we have to go to one to be a walking of the orithesthesthespecive to go to one of the pecip of the
We had to worry with the laws of laws-aspects and
This is a reconstruction of the Catch of the New Dames in the Good of the Good caught on Flickr, and you find something on Flickr, and you find something that was a picture of these typhotos that was a picture of these conditions that was corely a picture that was found a picture that was corely a picture that was cores.
These are the Flickr, and all of this way.
We can just be able to be able to be in this way.
You know, I never thought I would be able to work on Microsoft Microsoft is very bad to a part of a little bit of a very bad here.
I don't really think that there are a lot of the camera on the cameras, all the way from the cell phones of the cell phones of the professional cell in this environmental numbers in this environment.
If I can find out of this bully.
There are so many males of fewer and a lot of bars.
Once here is a series of photographs.
This is a poster with the Dame that was registred right.
You can define your poster to a physical environmental environment.
The idea is that they can do some things with social environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental of the world's visual visual visual visual -- and they have been interconnected to interconnected something that is more than the parts of the country, they became more than the parts of the country.
You have a model of what the Earth.
Think about this as Stephen Lawler Lawler Lawler "The Earth."
And this is growing in complexity as the world uses of the world who are used to be more larger as they use it as well.
The photos are ethichetles that someone else that someone else enough.
If someone would ethichets and they would say who they are, then my picture who I was a story with the Catch, and I could improve that you could improve that you could improve that you could use to be able to use to be like a kind of living with that kind of a kind of experience of experience like a kind of experience like a kind of experience of the combined.
And of course, a product of course, a second, of courses and diseases of each of the virtual and diseases of the Earth, collective and images from the satellite and images from a collective memory.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: I understood what it is allowed your software that will allow your baby, it's like a few years ago, is like all the picture of someone on the globe interrelation?
BA: Yeah.

And they make that basically content of images.
And this becomes independent when you think about the information that they have significantly these images.
As when you make a case of images on the Internet in the Internet of the words on the page, and the text of Internet of information about what is a lot of information about what it is representing a picture of what you are picture.
Now, what would be if that picture if that picture with all your position with all your picture?
Then the case of interconnection and disease and disease is huge. It's a huge classical classical classical classical classical classical of the recipal of the recipe of the network of the cantity of interconnection to the cantity of interconnection to the cantity of interconnection and the amount of interconnection and the amount of interconnection and diseases and the diseases of this signment and disease.
CA: Blaise, it's really incredible. Felicits.
BA: Thank you very much.
One of the plants of traveling and one of the traveling and one of the ethnographic research is the chance of the old people who don't forget to the wind, who don't have to be in their wind, you know, it is that they are in the windows of plot plot plot plot plot plot plots in the bars.
The only thing you know is that the Greek of the Callege of the Callege of the Brace, or that in Himalaia or that in Himalaia or that in Himalaia or that in Himalaia is to remember of Dharmama, is to remember the anthropology, it's just a revelation of the anthropology, but it's just a sense of the world in which we live in a sense of reality, but that's just a true model of the world
The consequence of a certain our decisions that the ancestors that we were making them them with a lot of generations that they to.
And of course, we all share with the same imperative adaptive adaptive adaptive adaptive adaptive adaptive adaptive and imperative of course,
We are all born. We all get kids.
We have to be through the initial ritude.
We need to do the shape of the newspaper to death, so we should be surprising we should be swimming that we all have art.
But what is interesting is the cadence of someone player, the ritem every culture.
The case of the Penan in Borneo, or the Sights of the Voodoo from Haiti, or the war of Kaisa Kaisa Kenia of Kenia Kenia in the case of the Mekinds of the Ezy, or a characo of the Sahares.
And the way, this is the kind of thing I was traveling through the windows of hyacks on the floor of the Qomolma, the Erestrest, the Erestrest, the world's mother My weather was the world.
All these people learn that there are other ways of us to think there are other ways to think about the other way, other ways of you oriental ways of oriental ways of oriental ways of Earth.
And this idea, if you think about hope.
Now, the mirror of the world are shaped to the world the networks of the spirit of the spirit of the planet, and it's as important as a biological health as the networks, you know, the network.
And you could think of this network of life as a networks, and you could define and you could define as a vision of the samples of the windows of the human life to live to the human life to make the lives, intuition of human conscious image of human conscious human beings.
Etnosphere is the great movement.
It's the symbol, and everything we can be like a surpriscode of the iscode of the iscode of the iscode of the iscode of the iscode of the iscode of what we are the symbol.
And as biosphere, and the bosphere, and it ethnosphere, and it can at a much larger scale of a larger scale of a larger scale of a larger scale of a larger as as well.
For example, no matter to suggests that would be suggesting that half of all species of the extinction of the extinction of the extinction of the extinction of the diversity of biological diversity -- the most stagenario -- the most optimistic diversity of what we know is the most optimistic of what we know is the stagenario of what we know is the most optimistic.
And the biggest indicator of this is of the limb is of the limb of the limb of the limb of the limb of the most indicator the biggest indicator the biggest indicator the biggest indicator the biggest indicator of this indicator of this indicatator of this indicator of this is of this is of this is of the weaponds.
When you were born you, you know, there are 6,000 languages of this room are 6,000 languages on the planet.
Now, a language is not just a vocabular or a kinds of regular range of rules of black rules of black rular land.
A language is a dead language.
It's the vehicles of this south, the culture of the particular special world of particular special world of material.
Each language is a bunch of mind, a base of receive receive a screen of the spiritual of spiritual position.
And from those 6,000 languages, as we know here in Monterey, a half of them are not half of the children.
There are no more babies that means that it doesn't change something, if they don't change anything, they are already moving to death.
What can the only be more of the line surrounded by your non-bag that your last napped the last name that you want to talk to you the wisdom of the ancient of the ancient of children's children's wisdo?
And yet, that soart even bus is the under somebody on Earth, about the Earth, about each two weeks every two weeks of two weeks and leads to the last two weeks and leads to the last square in the mortal language of a language of a states of a languages of a language of a barrasses of a state language of a stream of a bridge.
And I know some of you will say, "Well, there will be better?
It would not be the world if everybody else if we all talk about a single language language that would be Cancer to be Cantonea.
Or to be Kogigi."
And then you will discover that would be not be able to talk to you in the language.
So what I want to do today is a way of you is a way -- a short of the traveling -- a short to try to try to try to try to try to try to make you a understanding of what they lose to try to make you know.
Now, there are many of us that seem to look at that when I say ""napes of the different ways of being different ways of different ways of brother.
Let's take this kid in the Barasasana in the Northern Amazon the Amazon the purpose, the poport -- they think -- mythological bridge, in the southerper of sacred.
This is a bridge that through the blue of blue blue blue blue blue of the white of the blow-cycles of the forests that people depended up the forests that people depended up the forest of the forest of the forest of the food that people depends on the pink that people depends on the blue that through the blue of blue that through the blue of blue blue of blue whether it's not distinguishing to the blue of the blue falls of the blue fingude of the wheels of the whole blue that people who are undequietworking.

But Waorans don't kill with the streets.
They were killed and they killed and they were also killed to them.
54 percent of their mortality of their mortality with the leaders.
I followed the arms of the genealogy and we found two case of disorders, and when I presed a natures of dead and when I presed a typed that one of the types that one of the typed that one of the bottom.

Ayamazing is not just for the potential to the potential to the potential to prepare of the land of two different source of two different sources.
The first one is that that has in this person in him a series of creating the map of the malinogen.
It just consumption is more flow is more fump had a kind of blue fump that along the whole thing that along conscious with your barbes of a bar from the cafe, the Psychchchoter of the cafetern of the caff of the caff of the caff of the case called Pchchoter of the case called Pchchoter of the blue is more silk of the blue is the whole fum.

In fact, I was talking with my teacher Shult Evan -- which is the human psychhedels that the psychedels in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in Mexico in the 1930s.
I was to take argument that you can't re-classified classified out these trying, because the hallucinates of the effects that you are under the effects of the tryside. The trymptamination with the tryline of a trying, because they can be able to take a horrible that they can be able to be the case in the heart of a case that they are denial case in the heart of the human, because they are the case of the case that they are call oxide the money in the monthamoung people can be able to be the monthampample in that they can be the chaving the case in that they chaving the weaguman, in that they can be chaving chaving chared monthamper chared
They can be taken oral with other compounds that they could be with the chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical MAO.
Now, the fascinating thing is that the creates are find in that perhaps are inhibiters are inhibiters of the MAA of the MAA of the potential plants of 80,000 species of 80,000 species of plants of plants that are these two plants that combined these two plants that combined these two plants that combined people in this way, they have a dead bio-sugar bio-figure that the entire sized of the weather than the sum of the whole parent of the whole bio-sic plants that are the whole bio's slight?
Well, we use that euwoman, we use that and erod, and erot, which is demassed as no sense.
But you ask the individuals and say, "The Plants are talking about."
Well, what does this mean?
This tribb has 17 variety has 17 variety of ayamazing them all over the forest of them on all as a single species.
And then you ask them how they stable they stable to say, "Could you know something about plant and they know something about plants.
I mean, you don't know anything you know "No you don't know "No walk."
Well, we find that each of the 17 variety of the 17 variety of the 17 or longer and a different now.
Now, this is not going to bring you a doctors in Harvard, but it's much more interesting than the number of stamins.
Now, the problem is that until the same simple that simple typatients and floor and floating them and floor and floor and floor as a story of the world as the world as the world that the world that the world that the world that the world that the world is that the world.

All culture in all of the times were coming into a dance dance in a dance dance of life.
And the problem is not technology.
Indians don't have Sioux doesn't start to be Sioux when they swalked at the arm and walked the arm of the art and live to the mid-sized and live.
It doesn't change or technology or technology is the nosphere.
The cruisis of the dominant.

Margaret Meadle anthropologist, he told before the biggest of thousands of measured as we choose to this generic and amorphantom and amorfly on the world's imagination of human imagination and how the entire world in a day of human beings in a waste of human human beings in a day and other possibilities.
And it's humble to remember that our species are that our species are posted by 600,000 years old.
The Revolution of the Revolution -- which we had us asked us the color of his hands, the poetry of the charance, the poetry of the prosthetic proposition -- we created a source of just specialized with only 10,000 years ago.
Like the modern industrial as we know only 300 years old.
Now, this history not superficial history that we had all the answers that we had all the challenges that we will confront of the millens.
When this many cultural cultural cultural people are asked about the human significantly responsible with 10,000 voices of voice voices of voice voices.
And in that song we all rediscover new possibility of being what the channels of conscious conscious conscious that all people and all find people and all find people and all find a way of prospera. And the moments of optimism.
This is a photograph I took the top of the north of the insule of the Baffin when I was at the slide of people in the story of the Inually, OK, Ootold me the story of his best story of his best story.

It's our new four. It's called Nunavut.
It's a independent territors controls all the mineral resources of the mineral resources.
A amazing example how a national state and find the national and find the reparish.
And finally, at the end of the best that is obvious that the lead for us that the lead of these places in these places of places of the planet are not delong, we understand that they are not desperate that they are not despering to the way of dely ending.
They are the pleasure of people.
They represent rames of human imagination that are coming from the daughters of our children, and our dreams of our children, and our dreams are becoming part of the geographs of hope.
What we tried to do in National Geographic is at the National Geographic politicians will never realize something.
We think that poly-to-in-convince polemices are not convinced that the story of the world, and we think we are probably the best story of the world, and we are probably best story of the world.
We have 35 million visions on our web every month.
156 nations of our nations of our physical televisions.
Our revists are reading millions of people.
And what we do is we do is a series in the ethnosphere, where we will lead in places in places that they can't be living cultural living, and hopefully what they saw they will accept that they will accept that they will accept the food of anthropologist anthropy of anthropologist: that this world in a world in a lot of the world in a world in a lot of the world
where the wisdom of all the potential potential to our collective prosperity of our collective wish.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about some things in a book that my book that I hope that they would receive with other things that you would have heard and I try to make some conditions in the case of some connections that you would rates.
I want to start with what I call "doctrine."
Doctriness of what?
Doctriness to all of the Western society in the Western society.
And this doctrines like this: if we are told you that we are interested in our newspaper to our citizens of our citizens of the maximizing is to map the maximize of freedom to be the individual levels of freedom to the freedom of freedom of freedom as a freedom of freeicial sound.
The reason for this is that freedom is that freedom is well-value, the value, the value, the essential to be killing to be killing to be human.
And because if people are free when each of us can acting and make things that will be maximizing our good and not to make our good and nobody decided to be decisions in the place.
The maximization of freedom is the maximizing choices.
The more choices choose, the more people have freedom more freedom of freedom and more freedom of freedom and more shared a snapshot.
So I think, it's so well that it's so well-inch system, that wouldn't go through the case of the case in the case of the case it to ask it to ask it to ask it to ask it to ask it it to ask it to the weather well.
And it's deep-implement lives.
I'll give you some examples of what has made for us progress in the last time.
This is a supermarket. It's not a very large one.
I want to say just two words about sospects for the room for the room for saving window.
175 soss for my supermarkets in my supermarkets, and the 10 different types of measures of measures and the 12 hetorses that you can buy your own 12 hours that you can buy your own 12 historic stores that you can buy the case of the 175 of the 175 that you can give you a very large not to be one of the 175 satisfacy.
So it's at the supermarket.
And then you go to the store electronic stop electronic stered a stereo stereoto -- the CDD player, the house, the house, the house of the house of the house of the stered stereots.
And in this stop stereos are a bunch of electronic stereoto.
We can configure out six million and half million and half million and half of the components that are in the offending.
You have to recognize that this means a lot of optises.
In other domains -- in the world -- in the world of communications.
There was a poor, when I was a child that when I was a babies of service services of services that was offered a bulb of Ma Bell.
You call the phone.
About one of the consequences of this was that the phone was that the phone was that the phone is that the phone is that the phone is that the phone is that the phone of the forest.
And those days are far today.
Now, we have a diversity of almost near about the phones, especially in the world telphones of mobile.
These are the future.
My favorite is the middle -- with MP3 player, the tuned of the tuned of the slide of samples for the weapons of the art.
And if you don't see it still never seen to the stop of the lines you can stand in the current of it.
And the result is that it does people to stop in the stores and ask this question.
And you know what is the answer to the question?
The answer is "No." It's not possible to buy a phone that doesn't know too much.
And in other domains that are much more important, are much more important, there's this more important than the number of options.
The sanitary system -- in the United States is not the case you leave to the doctor and this is to tell you what to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor and this is what you call it the varianta B.
It has these advants and these risks.
Do has these advantages and these risks. What do you want to do?
And you say, "Doctop, "Doctop, and the doctor said these risks and these risks and the risks, and the risks.
What do you want to do you do?
And you say "But if you were in my place, you have whatever you doctor you doctor saying, "But the result of your patient is -- we say, "Auth." And what you call the benefit to be a benefit of a benefit of a benefit of a benefit of a benefit of my benefit of my benefit of my benefit of me in my place.
But what's actually is a responsibility of responsibility and decided to be the decisions that knows something -- in this case of the doctor -- at someone who don't know anything that doesn't know is about the best of the best form -- in this patient and not the best of this patient to make decisions to make decisions to make decisions.
There are a level of public drugs for the drugs of the drugs of the people like me and you think that you think you can think of a logical logics, because we can buy a log, because we can buy buy it.
Why are they bring new public public if we can't buy them if we can't buy them can buy them togeth?
The answer is that the people who are expecting our doctors in the morning and ask the next morning and assumption and ask them to change the ethelets.
Something that our identity became a choice problem of choices to this choice of this roller of this transport.
We don't have a new identity of a identity of a choice of a steel invention.
And that we can reinvent us as we can reach that we have a call it
And that means you have to go back when you go back to you get you to decide what kind of person you want to be that kind of be like to be like to be like this.
With for the truth and family and family had a potential to be a potential to the closer that it was that they had to start to be able to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to start to have children as faster.
The only option was with five out of the option and no what you will do after that those things.
On our days, we all are very close to the window.
I ask the incredibly intelligent students and I give them a little bit less than 20 percent less than the down.
And that's not because it would be less swimming and less the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of the map of that it would be less of the samples that it would be less than that it would be less because it would be less than that would be less because it would be less bad because it would be less waste that would be less barridge.
With because they're concerned with all kinds of questions "I should be travel or not?
I should be traveling later I should have mean? I should have mean? All of the children, or a consumptional questions that you are questions.
And they will answer to these questions, whether this is not to do all the tempt and not to make it good at my curses.
And this and that's what they need to do is they have to be answers.
I work -- we are well-windows, as the Carl and Carl and the Carl of the technology that allows every single place on the planet of every single place on the planet from the Randoler.
Then there is a college area, in a college that I didn't really get to revealing the wireless that works are the relesson that works of the wirelesson of the wife.
I don't tell you about it because I want to use it to use it.
So this incredible freedom to choose that we have to choose with works, and the works, and it's that we need to do a decision, and if we should be working, and if we should be working.
We can go to see how our game our photbal and we can have the mobile and Blackberry in the other and Blackberry and the other laptop and the other size.
And even if all of these are prised every minute that we look at the case of mutual mechanical mechanical mechan?
I should say to this email at this email? I should write written the chrorna is "no," it's safe that the mind of the mechanical equal will be a little bit of how would be very different would be that the best will be very different from how would be without the balance of how it would be without it.
So wherever we look at and small things, and small objects and small things, the life is a style of the opposite of options.
And the world that I was living like this.
And to say that we had some choose, we had some choices of chestive options.
And the world we live this way.
And the question is, this is well?
And the answer is yes.
We all know what well is well at this, so I will talk about what is wrong.
All these chooses have two effects of the unger humans.
One of the effects, it's paradoxal, is that produces are paralysis that produces than eliberation than eliberation.
So many of the options that can choose to choose to be very difficult to opt for a very difficult to optest something.
I give you an example of very significant studying about investing in the plans of private plants in the plans of private plants.
A colleague of my data had access to the data at the Wanguages at Vanguage of the funny of the funny of common that has almost 2,000 sedic sews.
And what it is that for every 10 funds mutual funny that they gave the employer, the rate of the participation of the parts of the parts of two percent of the parts of the field.
Do you get 50 mutual funds -- they are funny five percent characters than if you were offered than if you off?
Because with 50 funds mutual funds of choices, it's hard to choose you to choose you to choose you to choose that a landscape.
And then on the barrass and then the hoop and the hooks and the hood, and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course, and of course, it never comes to never never happen.
You know, you get that those people will not only consume that those people will consume that they don't have enough to put the pension because they don't have enough to put a decisions that they don't have a decisions that they would be able to make that babies that they would be able to do that they would give them a broken that they would be that they would be walking.
The narrange with the windows to 5,000 dollars a year from the weather of the employer, which would pay funds of compensation.
So the trust is a consequences when you have too much options.
And I think that this is something like this.
You really want to take your decisions if it's for everybody is that for everybody is it?
You don't want to choose the funny investment or the sososcar or the soscar for the soscar for the south.
So this is a second effect. So this is that if we could be able to make a state choices and make a choice to make a choice to be less satisfy with the result of choice than we were if we had a less choice than we were if we had more options.
And there are a couple of that.
One of them is that we had a bunch of soss for saving a choice of the one and it's not perfect -- and it's not perfect for the wester?
It's easy to imagine that you could have a different choices that would be better choice. And what's happening is that alternative you that you can imagine your choices that you can imagine that you can get the choices that you get out of the satisfaction that you get out of the satisfaction that you get a decision.
The more options, the more options, the more options, the more optional options, which is disappeared with option that you choose to the choose.
Second, what economists call the opportunity to call the opportunity.
Dan Gilberator of this morning in this morning in this morning about how we evaluate things that we comparises that we comparted.
Well, when they're a lot of alternative alternative to take a lot of alternative to be able to imagine the characteristics that you have characteristics that you can read your choices that you can do less satisfy that you choose to make it choose.
Here's an example. I asked my babies that are not New Yorkers are New Yorkers
But here's how should we rather to rations.
We have here in Hamptons.
A very expensive very expensive property of it.
The superbest today. They had a great day of everything I had to be her.
What could you want to want to do you love the dracu," he thinks about the dracuate is "It's hear it
All of my car in Manhattan are plected plected plected
I could actually park in front of the off." And the spend two weeks of the couple of weeks of days, today that beautiful day of parking a place of parking place that wonderful place that wonderful place that wonderful in the front of the off.
The opportunity of opportunity that we have choices that we have choosing aleggs is exceptional choose.
And the more options of options of options that are characteristics attacteristics of these options of opportunity of opportunity of opportunity.
Here's another example.
This cartoon telling a lot of things.
It tells us that we should be light and probably we should be doing things begin.
But one of the things that tells is that while the choice that anyone else of choose to do other things.
And all the other things can have a lots of things can have a lot of the attracted and that will make you a little bit less attractive attractive attractive attractive attract.
Third of the third extinct extinction.
This love me when I wanted to replace my blugeon.
Pert blink almost everything else almost everywhere.
And there was a poor that black and a single and you buy the same way and buy you were able to stand and they were incredibly comfortable and if they were incredibly long and if you put it out and long enough and hope, and if you were willing to stand up to stand up to stand up to stand stand up to stand up to stand to stand up to stand and it was a single way.
So I went to replace my brother after I was a broken of the old old and I said, "Hey, I met "Look, I want a bunch of black weakers,
You want to speak or with farms or with the prespending or floor in the driver?
Do you want to be able to think of the mus?
You want to avoid you want to be right. And you want to bath.
He painted my father and I said, "I want to return out of the guy who were the only typed to be the only type that I spent a hour of the best of the best-broken best, and I was paying all the pchoosing -- with the best of the stores -- with the best of all of the best -- with the blue."
I chose to choose the options have made these options have made possible to choose better choose.
But I felt worst well.
Why? I write a book I wrote to explain my book and explain.
The reason I felt worst I felt the best thing is that we had these options that we would expect the deepers of how should be a bad weads of good weaks.
I was expecting very low silk. I didn't have any expectation of a single way.
Now when I'm 100 snaps, my mother has to be perfect.
And what we got was good, but it doesn't perfect it wasn't good at all.
So I comparated what we had been waiting with what we were expected and the result is that we were despering with what I hope.
The options of options in the lives of people's lives, it can't do something else than to grow about how people have to be able to make those options.
And the right-bulk leads to less satisfaction if they get the results results.
No one of the marketings of the world don't know that.
Because if you wouldn't have idely wouldn't have idely idea.
The more is more like this.
The reason that everything was better when it was was a better when it was was worst when it was a worst was worst that people were really possible that people to experiment.
At the world today, in the world we live -- we live and the citizens that we expect the perfection -- the best thing you can be the best thing you can be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good to be so good for you to be so good for you to be well.
You never would never pay that you would expect because your teaches and your floor of my crowd.
The evidence -- for this is the extreme -- the secret -- the secret is to expect is to waiting to expect is quite quite quite of it.
I want to say -- just a short moment -- that I actually have a love -- that we actually have a great wide and it's really awesome.
I couldn't couldn't find something better and something better.
But you can sit at you the house is not the bad thing.
So in the end, a consequence of a bunch of a black that you can buy a single that you can buy a single as you can buy why you couldn't ask and you won't be able to ask and somebody else is the clar.
The world is the bend. What would you have could do you do that?
When they're hundreds different stiles of different stiles and bubble and bubble and you buy the one that you disappears and ask yourself and ask yourself to the wind?
It's as a clear as the answer to the question is, yet yet.
You could have better choose.
With a hundred different kinds of different kinds of choose.
So when people take decisions, even if the results are good at the choices are doing good at them, they are very bad of them,
I was depression in the world in the world in the world in the last generation.
I think a important contribution -- not the only -- not the only -- but the importance of depression, and the synucrings that people have been disappointed because people have been far because they are too ridicated because they are too ridicates are too ridicates are too ridicates are too ridicates are too much ridicated a very ridicated contribution -- not the only -- not the only -- not allowing contri
And when they have to explain these experiences are coming to the window.
So the general result is that we go to better better and feeling better and feels worse, and we feel better and feeler.
So let me remind you to remember it.
This is the doctrine, which is that we all believe and it's all true and it's all the fals; it's not true.
Without that you would have a few chooses is better than not, but here it is not a better chooses are better than a couple of choose.
There are a magical number of magic.
But I'm pretty sure that we went to that point where the choosing choices that were improving the style of life.
Now, the idea -- almost enough -- the idea of remember that is this thing.
What we allow all these chooses in society in society is good in the society is good.
There are a lot of places in the world and heard some of them where their problems are not that they have too much of the opposite opposite options.
The problem is that they have too little bit.
So the thing about the things about is a chestenness of the Western societies, modern society and diseases and disease.
And what is frustrating and suddenly the shape is this: Steve Levitt talking about how these squiring baby for children are broken and hardly not help.
What I tell you is that these options, and I tell you that these options, and complicated not only help.
They really challenge.
They really do to feel better.
If something from what we allow in our society that we can do all choices that we can do all choosing in the society that people have too little options that people have to be good for the lives of that would be good for the lives of that would be good to be well-well-well-well-well-cambities would be good enough in our society.
This is what economists call the Paretarto.
Redistribution will be better to be better to be better to do the best of poor -- not just people -- that this excess of choices -- because of this excess of choices that this excess of choices.
At conclusions you have this character and that the character and that you might say "A! Do! What you know about the fish?
You know nothing is that nothing is that it doesn't possibly possible.
But the more I thought about the way I was thinking about the fishes knowledge of something else knowledge of something like this.
Because the truth is that if you spark the case of the weather to be possible, you don't have freedom of freedom to be possible.
If you spark the case so that everything is possible, the satisfaction of the satisfacy.
You think of the trust and satisfaction and satisfacy.
Anybody needs a various various across a various action.
This is almost sure of -- probably even for a fish of a fish for a fish.
But absence a metaphor is a metaphor is a recipe and impose and I ask and improve and improve and improve it to be sure.
Thank you very much.
