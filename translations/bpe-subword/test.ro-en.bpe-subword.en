A couple of years ago, here at TED, Peter Skilled Skilled a design of design.
And the idea is pretty simple.
She has to build four, we have to build the highest statement shared out of the spaghors of space.
She had to stand in the top.
And although it turns out, it's actually quite difficult because the people are very quickly to colabove very quickly.
And so I think that this is an interesting idea, and I recorporate in a significantly design.
And it was a big success.
And then, I knew about 70 signs of designs and design in designers and designers and designer and the architectures, and something in this exercise, and something in this exercise of this exercise, and I would like to shape the relationship of collaboration, and I would like to share.
So, normal people beginning through evaluate evaluation.
Two answer to it, he imagines how it will look at the power for power, and then they spend their time planning.
School and arrange and the arrange, and I speak most of the time, and then, and then the structure and then, even then, even then, and then somebody else.
They bring their work.
But what happens in fact, in most casually, in most of the case is that you turn into a "h," because it turns into a beautiful, because the whole thing to do as the entire structure.
And there's a number of people who have a lot of people who have a lot more times than otherwish" than others, and by the most indeeply of business.
They've losing the concentral concentration, and they make their structures.
And, of course, they have a lot more structures that have a lot more structures of the best, and the best graduate of the best graduates of graduation.
And it's pretty amazing.
As our Peter, not only do Peter, not only produced, but also the most interesting of all of everything.
So you want to ask to question: Why do it? Why do it?
And Peter like Peter said, "None of the children are not losing the time trying to be director of SR.
And I don't lose time for the power for power.
But there's another reason.
This is that the students are instrangers to find the only plan right now, right?
And I executive.
And what happens is that, when it turns on the top of the top, and what happens in the top, and what happens?
It's a crisis.
Do you know it?
What they do is differently, is that they are differently, is that they start with the beginning prototypes, and they build prototypes of successful prototypes to reprototypes to remediate prototypes to remediate prototypes.
So designers recognize this kind of collaboration as the essential process.
And every versize, children have a referring responses and what it works, and what it works.
So the capacity to build in the prototypes is essential to see how different commitment.
So the majority of most of the majority is about half of the students are about half a little bit better, but not with a little bit better, but not with a lot of adults.
Who is the best one?
Architects and engineers and engineering that I saw it that I saw 39 countries.
And why is this? Because they understand that they understand that their geometrical models and models are the key to the construction of the structures.
So, the directors general directors than environment.
But here it becomes interesting.
If you add teams a team from the administratively result results.
It's incredible. You see, you look at and says, "This is the equipper team.
Can you say that before. And why is this?
Because they have aptitudes of business.
I drive the process process.
And every team that monitorize and it's attention to work, and it's going to improve their performance.
Commers and business, and the combination and their combination and their combination.
If you have 10 percent of the team, you'll build in the six structures that will be in the painting.
And I tried something interesting.
I thought, let's growing up.
And I offered a 10-dollar premier of dollars in programs for teams.
And what do you think that happened with these students at design?
What was the result?
This is what happened.
No team not built a team not built in the legacy.
If a team would be built, it would be built, struck the structure of three centimeters, it would have been able to the premier.
So, it's not really interesting that myself have a powerful impact of power?
I repeated the exercise with the same students.
What do you think happen?
So now they realized the value of the prototype.
And the same equipped from the best result result results.
They have the most expensive structure in the highest time.
So here's a profound lessons for us about natures and about natures.
So you might ask yourself, why somebody wrote out of the problem?
And the reason is, I helped to create the instruments of digital team and process of the video games and video games and video games.
And what this makes this girls the says is that helps to identify the presence of assessment.
Because in fact, every project has project, right?
This produced us a common a community experience and a common community of a common the right building of the right building of the right building.
And so this is the value of this experience, this exercise of this exercise.
And for those people, you can access well-access wall of the blog is a blog where you can see how to build the blog where you can see how to build to build how to build.
They're and instructions step with this.
There are unusual unusual use, and the uses of how people are changing the system.
You can find in the world's global records.
And the fundamental lesson, I think it's the fact is that design is a contact.
We're going to dedicate the sards of all senses, and to apply that we have better achieved in thinking about ourselves.
And, one prototypes, a prototype of this experience is the only thing to transform to transform a moment to transform a moment.
And that can make difference.
Thank you very much.
Let's ask that we have here a machine, a machine, which is a machine, which is a little TED, which is a machine.
And everyone in this room, you have to go into this room.
You can go back or before or before you remains but you can't remain.
I ask yourself as you put them on my friends and I put them in the last time, and they all wanted to travel to travel.
I don't know. They're going to go back to the automobily of Twitter or "American Twitter or "American Idol."
I don't know.
I'm sure that there is a certain attraction of that.
But I have to mention that I don't do part of this group.
I don't want to go back to my time and not because I didn't spirit doesn't spread, but because I don't spirit doesn't run on this planet.
So, I want to go to the car and go to the car.
It's the best period of this planet of this planet in any point in any point you look at the health, the healthy descense of descense of descense of disease.
There was no longer than the period of period.
All of my streets have died before they died before 60 years.
My graduate to 70.
My parents are about 80.
So there would be good to exists in the beginning of the age that I'm going to die that I'm going to die.
But it doesn't measure is not about people also also also because it's much more important than that.
A kid who are born in New Delhi in New Delhi has a bigger than 100 years.
Think about it. It's an incredible phenomenon.
And why is it truth?
Varoly killed to kill a billion people.
It reprovides of demographics of planets in a neeeequal way.
Not me. It's not alone.
I wrote it.
In the disease, the diseases who have millions of people with only one generation.
Difter rubehind polio polio --
Do you know what's this?
Vaccines, the modern medicine, our capacity to feeding billions of people are triumps of people are triumps.
And I think that the scientific method, it turns to try to try to try and change if it works, it is one of the most accurate of the most accurate of humanity.
These are the good news.
Again, there's no longer because there are other problems, and there are other problems, one of them as many times, one of those people are living in a billion people, a billions of people are living in every day.
This number is growing very quickly and it's the condamn condam.
Not only that, but we used the image that we used to be completely this planet.
She potable, the young agriculture of tropical troopical tropics, the beneat: They're all on the windows.
If we don't invent a way to come out of this room, we're going to go out of this room.
The question is: Can we do this? I think yeah.
I think it's obviously obviously that we can produce footprint of people without available.
I think we can check this world with energy that's not going to distruggle.
And I really think that's not only a illustrates.
But here's what I couldn't sleep -- one of the night -- one of the things that I didn't leave me.
We never needed the progress of the science than now and we haven't have ever learned in the situation that we can do today.
We're in the practices absolutely absolutely unfortunately.
However, I think that we should go back with three hundreds of years ago, before the lights of Epockets, to discover a period that we took a lot of force and all of these things with now.
People are crampons fancy convingers, so you can release.
Not the true is not going to release.
All the world is the rights of an opinion; it turns out, but you know what you don't have an opinion of the progress?
You don't have the right right at your own true. I mean, but it seem.
And he took something time to figure out how to figure out.
As a few years ago, I wrote an article about vaccines for "The New Yorker."
I was looking forward, we were going to get together, again, and again, again, and it's the most efficient of health, is the most efficiency in the entire history of history.
I didn't know what to do, so I didn't know what I do, I wrote a article I wrote an article and I wrote a fartic.
And then I wrote, I wrote an article about genetics.
The same thing, only important.
People have to.
So I wrote a article and we couldn't understand why people believed that people believed that people thought it is the food of the molecule of molecules in a certain molecule in a particular way of nature.
But, as you know, I do what I do. I wrote what I wrote the article again.
They're just journalist; we go to the five to five to five to five to five to five to the rule.
But these articled articled me and I didn't realize why.
It was because those fanatal fanates that they were not in fanatical minds.
They were feeling people, educated, educated with their place.
They were exactly as people in this room.
And he derants me so much.
But then I thought, let's be thinking.
We're in the point where we don't have the same relationship with the progress of the progress now.
We're talking about he ambivalent.
We're talking about it in the terms of him, and we want to put it between the guys.
OK, there is reasons why we know that we know that these reasons.
We lost we lost in institutions, in the authority and sometimes even in science.
And we have the right to do it.
You can run a few numbers and people will understand.
Cernobby, Bhopal, Bhopally, you have Ethiox, the arms of the mass in the mass of the vots.
You can choose your own list.
There's the questions and problem that I had always that I always had always been right.
So you get circumspecies.
You ask the question, soliters,
You haven't do anything.
But here's the idea: when you get the idea, you have to accept them. We don't have to accept it.
And I can tell you because we're in the middle of an epidemic epidemic of the dimensions.
For 12 years ago, it has been published a great article that they made between epidemic and the vaccine, and the vaccine, the oreion.
Very job.
They made the discoveried to the verified whether this is true.
They really had to do the nurses of studies; it's a important problem is a important problem.
They came and the result and results.
British in the United States, from the U.S. Sweden, from the Canada and all of the same thing: There were no cheap, no neighborhood.
Not contains. Not contains in the serious world, we think about what we see, what we see, what we seem to feel that we seem to feel that we can feel what we do.
We don't believe a lot of the documenting of the government that government, and understand that, I think that we all understand that, I think that we all understand that, I think that we all understand that, I think that we all understand that we all understood that we all understand.
But you know what?
The results were disaster disaster and here's the United States is one of the United States.
And this is what we might have to be able to be rushing us should be run.
It's great.
So what happened here?
You know, even understand this:
Have here?
He saw somebody in the audience in the audience?
Not too much.
In this country is not happening at all, but it happened by 160,000 times in the world.
A lot of decades because of the pojob, 20 cases, 20 cases.
But, because we can't think about this and we can't think about this and people like Jenny McCarthy McCarthy McCarth, and ignorance with the Earry King and Larry Live.
And I can do that because I don't do the difference between cause.
They don't understand that these seems of the same thing, but not the same thing.
And we need to learn.
This guy, Jonas Sulk, it was a hero.
She went to one of one of the largest networks.
Without the beautiful, polio polio --
The midddle of the middle of the middle --
I call it the Paul Off.
The only developed a vaccine vaccine a rotavirus together with each other.
They're going to 500,000 lives of children in developing countries in the developing countries every year.
Bo result, right?
It's just good, only that Paul talk about vaccines and how people are predicting and how people should begin to begin to begin to begin to sleep.
And so it really forward.
So the Paul is a terrorist.
When the Paul talk in a audience of public audience without the footprint.
It's sound, because people like to love to tell people that I know that they knew that they knew my children.
Why? Because Paul made a vaccine.
I don't need to say that, but vaccines are essential.
If you define the disease, the diseases, and the diseases, and even that happens now.
In this country we have now rujeol.
This is where the worst of all, and the children are going to die, the children, it's just a problem is only a problem statistics.
And they're not only going to die.
How do the police with polielity? Let's have and so on. Why not?
Now two weeks ago, two weeks ago, and he said to me, and she said to me, and she said that I am about it and I was about about it.
No one more.
He wouldn't be able to vaccinated their children.
Not any case.
Okay.
Why? Because we don't have the polielite. You know what?
You have no polio exists in this country in this country.
Today, I don't know a guy, maybe a kind of morning.
It's going to aterize over two hours, and it will come and go to Long Bill and will come to the participate in one of these wonderful.
It doesn't know that it's infected with a disease that produced and we don't know.
This is the planet that we live. Let's not we predict.
We love to learn. We love to learn. We like this at neighborhood.
And he took all the audience of the morning?
Echine, a little bit of antioxious antioxide to work.
I knew that you did that for the U.S. is the U.S. does this day.
I have these things and appears and the alternatives and not constatement and not constates.
They're showing the same thing.
They make it more like to listen to listen to listen to listen to listen.
It's in rule, you want to pay for 28 billion dollars to listen.
You're not going to do it.
Light to listen to listening.
Why do that?
I think we understand -- I think -- I understood --
We have government. We don't have trust.
And we wouldn't have to have it. The public health public health.
It's crude million people.
It's incredibly required by hundreds of hundreds of hundred of the people who want to allow it.
And so we have him. And we sat it.
At in the arm in the arms of his arms.
It's fantastic fantastic. I love the birth.
But in fact, it's a very seriously seriously is some of the billions of dollars.
I am here all kinds of decades.
None of them. None of them -- the equip, the equip, and hacks, but I don't know what I mean, but I spend a billion dollars a billion dollars.
And you know what? When you say that, people look at me and say, "What are you going to do you have to make it feel well."
You know what?
because I don't spend my secret state from the Minister Minister Minister who says, "Hmmm, I wouldn't get to the experts of my experts with my experts of my experts on the mammographics to the patient that they wanted to treat the patient of cancer.
When you kill the jobs and the magic and the magic evidence and science and science and science and science and you want.
For Southern South Africa of Thabo Mbeki.
She killed 400,000 people insisted that the sfeck and the bubble and the ull and lantiretrovirally are much more efficiency that we knew that we knew that we knew that we knew that we knew that we knew that we knew the progress of the SIDS.
With thousands of thousands of thousands in a country.
I'm not going to tell you that there is no consequency for this.
There are always exist.
The most slides of sense of sense of sensing us now is this straight now is this strangers of degrees of degrees of the degrees of organic disorders.
It's a controverwhelmed controver. You have to start beginning.
It's a controver, a controver, at the metaphor.
It's not science.
Anyway, every disorder, every disease of the forest of the Bruxells was modified by Bruxells was modified by human.
In the group of the Edense didn't exist.
And you couldn't get galone.
There's no arm of County. We did.
I did this in the last 11,000 years old.
Some of them were in rule, you not.
I walked by the one.
Now we can do it in a better way.
Of course, there's a risks.
But we can push vitamin a million people, and this can help millions of people, they simply lives.
Do you want to do this?
I need to mean that I don't understand.
We're progressed together genetic genetic genetic genetics.
Why do we do this?
Well, we always hear things that we hear a lot of chemical chemical chemicals, monocultures, monoculture,
We don't want to be companies that make life.
We don't want the companies that are significant.
You know my answer to all this?
Yeah, you have right.
So we have a big problem with food, but that's not science.
This is nothing to do with science.
It's the morality, it's the morality.
You know that science is not representation is not a companies.
It's not a country.
It's not not a process is a process ideas.
It's a process that sometimes works, but the idea that we wouldn't have to always to allow their science is really deliver, because it is very depending on is very depending on is really depending on the road.
In the next 50 years later will have to produce with 70 percent more food than 70 percent of the present than the present.
70 percent.
This is what investment did in Africa in the last 30 years.
Rusinose.
They need that, and we don't have it, and we don't have it.
Why? Alhuhuge genetic genetic genetic genetic genetics.
We don't want to encourage people to encourage people to eat each other.
500 million people, 500 million people.
It's kind of a bottom.
It's just a quick. It's great.
It doesn't have a substanti-proteins, and it doesn't have to proteins, and people who are in this moment.
And then people may be able to be.
Don't be suffered and you know what?
It would be good. It would be like Panisse, but it would be good.
All I can tell us is: Why are we again?
Let's ask the question this: Why are we again?
Because we don't want to change the genes we don't want genes?
It's just about the genes of genes. It's not about chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical chemicals.
It's not about our passion of our passion for hormone, about the insistence of hundreds of greater dimensional dimensional dimensional dimensions.
It's not about the research for the little degree, but about the little people in life, and he came to understand what it means to understand what it means.
Because you know what?
If we don't do it, if we are going to keep us as we are going to keep ourselves, we're going to be willed by something that we don't think that we want to come to be a high-tech.
We can't describe something else.
It's egoist, it's under in our level and even we have to begin and even we have to start.
So, after this incredible discussion of this incredible discussion, you can say, "So you want to go into this carage, you want to go to the future to the future to the future?"
Sugue that yeah.
Now it's presented to the present, but we have an amazing opportunity.
We can program, we can program.
We can be where we want to do and we really want to do.
We need to get these discussing discussions and we need to think about the car, but when we go to the car and we go to be able to be that we do thank you.
I know that we can also and after the ground, I just just need the world now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
In one day Steve Lopet Los Angeles Los Angeles in Los Angeles in the center of when he heard a beautiful music.
And it was a home, a African-American African-year African hermen to the streeting of the street that had only two codes.
And I'll tell you a lot of you know a lot of you know that Steve Steve a lot of articles that became a movie, and the Robert Jert Jamie Jamie Jamie Jamie Jamie Fox Steve Lowney Ayand Jamie Fox Ayand Jaillian education of education to Jillian Steve Jillian Europe, and Jillian Steve Jillian Earth.
Nathaniel to school, he went to school, and it went through a job, and 30 years later, and 30 years later, without the Skid in the Skid Row in the center of Los Angeless.
And then you recommend to the Steve the book or to see the film or to understand the beautiful to understand the beautiful two people, but the music has helped to help the form of helping that music has been instrumental to help them to help to help Nathania hell hell help.
I met the Ayers in the Ayers in 2008, two years ago, at the Wother Disy.
Sometimes the interpretation of the sense of the sense of Beethoven, and he came to Beeethoven.
The guy in a very game and social and Hillary and Hillary Clinton, and Hillary Clinton, and how the Dodgers are never going to get into the end of the own, everything in the last left in the last level of the last left.
And I talked about music. I got a music. And I got a few days of Steve a few days later to Steve Nathaniel was really interested in with me.
Now, I have to mention that Nathaniel refused to do treat the time because when it was treatment because when it was treating and Thorgan and Thorder and Thorder, and he left.
But as a result result now, it's predisposed to these schizophred.
The most researchers can manifest, and he exploited it as well as well as well as well as well as well as the Skid Row, with the people in the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of the mind of his mind.
And Nathaniel was very agited when we started our first lessons of Wanother Disney had a kind of beautiful.
And he talks about demonstrates and yet, and if somebody in sleep.
And it was broken, not for me, but it was that I'm going to lose it was going to lose the windows, and that I'm going to begin to talk about the relationship of the games and the arm of the game and the arm of fishing and other forms.
So I began to play.
And I sat the first part of the concern for Beethoven.
And as I swimming that we wanted to understand that a change of Nathanieless.
It was like a drug influence influence of invisible, a chemical reaction of my music reaction was catalyzed by my music was catalyzed by the way.
And by Nathania Nathaniel was transformed in understanding in understanding and graphics.
And as a miracle, he went to his own life, and he began to play, and began to play, some of the concern for the own, Mendeath to completed, Mendel, Mendel, Mendel.
And we began to talk about music, from Bethoven, and Bruckner, and Bruckner, and Bruckner, from the Bartt, from the Salonce Salonce Salen.
And I understood that he didn't just knowledge of encyclopedical music, but it had a music with the music with music.
He talked about it with that passion and understanding and understanding with my colleagues from Los Angeles.
And while I interpretation and I speak the music was turned from a man in a human anjudged by the streets of Los Angeless, in this musician in this musician in this musician in this musician to Juillian educated one, educated at Juilar.
Mmusic is terapies.
And for Nathaniel, the music is health.
Because the music has allowed to their own thousands and illustrates and the creativity and creativity and creativity and creativity.
And that's a suffering of suffering.
And I understood that this is the essence of art.
This is the reason why we do music, we take a music that we are in our fundamental emotions, and with our artists, and with our creativity of artistic creativity and our creativity of emotions in reality.
And the reality reality of the expressions of us and impressions, and we inspiring us and inspiring us.
And for Nathaniel, the music has brought his friends.
The power of music to the music has brought his musicians and a musicians who understood that I understood the talent and recognize it.
I'm always going to do music with Nathaniel, whether we are at Wanother Disy Row, or in Skid Row, because I became a musician.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Thank you.
Robert Guth.
Robert Gupta: I want to play something that we stood from violone.
So, I love to him myself.
These are Jane McGonigal design.
I remembers of the games of 10 years already.
And my paper for the next decades is to try to be able to do the rest of the world's living in the games of the world in the games.
Now, I have a plan for that, and implant to convince more and include people here, to spend up here, to play on the player games and better.
So we spend three billion hours a week of hours on playing the game.
Some of you might think, "It's very long time."
Maybe too long time, maybe how many problems we need to solve in the real world.
But, the comform of my research, at the Institute of the Viitor, is exactly on the dose.
Three billions of hours hours is not on the game to solve enough to solve the world.
In fact, I think if we want to survive the future on this planet on this planet, we have to grow this planet.
I calculated all that we need to have 21 billions of player every week.
So, this is probably a little idea, a little idea,
So I'm going to tell you again, I'm going to let it.
If we want to solve the problems like phoamazing, poverty, very conflicts, the conflict conflicts, and I think that we need to play to play play to play to the play for the power to the level to the end of this decades. No. They're seriousness. No. They're seriously.
So here's why. This image to relief to relief why I think that I think that I think that I think the survival survival survival.
This is a piece of a picture called Phil Toledano.
He wanted to be able to capture.
So, he showed a camera in the player in the players, while they play.
And this is a classroom.
Now, if you're not a gamer could not lose a gamer part of this photographs.
It probably needed to the action, a little bit, but the concentration of intenses, but concentration for a very difficult problems for a very difficult problems.
If you're a playing player, you'll notice a few girls of the eyes of my eyes are significantly optimism.
And the spring centers are a surprised.
This is a gamer that is almost like a dozen.
Oh, you heard of it. OK. OK.
So we have some gamers,
A window is a result result that is so extraordinarily that you cannot believe that you cannot believe that you cannot believe that you can touch.
It was almost beyond the limitations of the image.
And when you get there, you so occurred to discover that you're really able to discover that you are a windows.
This is a player on the way to get a dozen.
And this is the fact that we need to see a millions of people who are solving the problem of people all of the world's future.
For someone who's against somebody else, is the way to get a dozen.
Now this is a statement that we see more than we see in life, as we see, as we see us in the day we see our emergency.
This is what I call me is what I call to live."
And here are actually making this failure, you can see it? Yeah? Yeah.
This is what I do I do with "I'm not very good at life."
Here's a piece of graphy in my neighborhood.
In Berkley, California, where I took my motivation about the reasons why we are better than in real life.
And this is a problem that a lot of gamers.
We feel that we are not as good in reality in real reality as we are in games.
And I don't refer myself as a successful component," even though it's a new component in the game, but when I say a myself, but when I say a refer and the reason to do something that matter, inspired to the collaborators.
And when we are in virtual world I think that many of us become the best version of our best version to help in a moment, the most probability to help a concentric probability to help a consequency problem.
In real life, when we are put in the fact when we confront when we confront with the obstac, we don't feel like this.
We're feelings.
We feel like anxies, maybe depressed or five or five or five anything.
I haven't have these sentimes that we are just not in the game is not in the game.
So, that's what I wanted to study when I was looking at when I was a collapse.
What is the game from the games makes impossible sentiment that is nothing that we can't do it?
How can we take these sentiments and applies and applied them in real life.
So I looked at the games of World World World World World World World to solve the problems.
And I began to see a couple of things that are dozens in the world.
So the first thing is that, whatever you get in one of the games in the World World World World World World World World World World World War.
But not any mission, but a perfect fourselves, you know, with your game. Right?
So, you can go to the fall to go to fill it.
I never give you a trying to be a trying to get a trying to fill yourself.
But this is at the limitation of what you can do. So, you have to stop a lot of it.
But there is no male in World World World World World
There's no statement and loss and loss.
There's something clear something clear something clear and important.
And they're also also also the collaborators.
And where you go, hundreds of thousands of people to work with yourself to work with you to go to your eth.
It's not something that is possible with very easily in real life, this sentiment that sense that you are your collaborators.
And with, it's also this story, this story, this story of inspiration about what we do.
And then I get this girls this girl positive.
I'll heard about the growth in and level and plus onto the power to the intelligence of intelligence.
We do not get constantly constantly in real life.
When I'm going to leave this scene, I'm not going to be plus to talk to the ideas to talk about ideas listen to the ideas lives.
I don't get these feedback in real life.
Now, the problem with environments like the World World World World World World World World World World Wide us to be able to spend us all the time.
It's just better as well as in reality.
So again, until now, in collective World World World World World World World World World Azern problems.
Now, this is not a beautiful thing.
It could sounds like a bad thing.
But to put this in context: 593 million years ago was the moment where our first statement when our landscape.
That was the first one was the first oned in the leg.
OK, so when we talk about how much time we talk about how much investing playing the game, the only way we have to think about it, is to talk about it, is to talk about the evolution of evolution, which is a extraordinary.
But it's also also the right is because it turns out that by playing through the game, we actually changing what we are able to do we have capable of human beings.
We evolve to evolve to a more collaborative species and more hearts.
This is true.
So, you take this statistic statistics.
It was published by a research of the Carnegie Mellon.
Media young people in the day of the day in a country with a powerful country with a strong-term cultures of playing games to the games of 21 years.
Now, 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of hours.
First of all, for children in the United States is the number of hours is the number of hours that you will spend the school in the classroom.
So we have a whole whole of education that happens where people spend the young people learn as a lot about what people are learning to be a lot about what the rest of the rest of the rest in school in school in school in school.
And some of you probably read the new book of Malcom called Malcom called Malcom called Ouswell.
So, you'll be heard of his theory theory about the success theory.
It's based on the same researching about the extraordinary of the cognition that if we can solve 10,000 hours of 10,000 hours to the age of 21 years, we're going to be specialists on that subject.
We're going to be as good at any other personalities in the world.
And so, what we're looking at now is a whole generation of young people who are players that are players that are players.
So the big question is, the big question is, "What is it becomes so goo?"
Because if we could figure out, we could figure out, we had an attention to human.
Here's some people have now in the world's world that I spend a day on playing games on playing games.
These are our gamers, we are our experts.
500 million people who are extraordinarily at something.
And in the future is going to have a billions of players that are extraordinarily at any time.
If you don't know itself.
The game developing game that consolutely consume a little bit of energy and work on the rainforests on the Internet of the Internet of the world, so they can connect in India, Brazil, China, Brazil, Brazil, Brazil, they can connect online.
They're still a billions of gamers,
This is going to bring us 1.5 billion players.
So I began to think about how we do these experts.
These are the four things I discovered. The first is the optimism is the optimism.
OK.
Optimism is the urgent is the desire to action in the front of an obstac, combined that we have a chance that we have a success.
The Gamers have always thought that a window is possible, and they always have always to try to try to try to try to try and works.
Very don't know.
The Gamer's experts are experts in a country.
There's a lot of study that shows that we like to play a game with them, even if we play with themselves.
And the reason is that it's really necessary to play a lot of connection to play.
We have learned that that that that someone will spend their time with us, that would play with us, that will play with the same guy, and they will be able to sit in the game and the end of the same way.
And so, playing together with a game with a game with somebody even building and tracks.
And as the result of social relationship relations.
I think of happiness. I love this.
You know, there's a reason why the World World World Warcraft game on a week, think about 22 hours, think about a partial.
It's because I knew that when we play a game, we are really happy working on a difficult or when we relaxing with friends.
We know that we are optimized to be humans to do a sense of sense.
And the players are available to work all the time, whether the right work.
Finally, sense of the sense.
I love to be attached to be the missions that inspired by the scale.
So, just a little trivial to help us to help ourselves.
So, we all know Wikipedia, the biggest of the world.
And the biggest one of the largest article is World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World World
For millions of people use a month.
They have more information about Warcraft of Warcraft by the Warcraft than any other subject in the world.
They fit a story.
They connect a resource of the Warcraft.
OK, so we have this four of powerful power in a single thing.
People are individuals and inside of hope.
They think they're capable of individuals who think they're capable to change the world.
And the only problem is that they think they're capable to change the world but not the world's world but not the world.
This is the problem that I'm trying to solve it.
It's a economist called Edward Castronova.
She is the genius. He studies study why people investing so much time and energy and money in the world and money in the world and money.
And he says, "We're martories that are concretes more than a virtual world than a virtual world than a virtual world and environments and environments.
He's a economist. So it's rational economist.
And he said, "I'm not like me -- I am a designer design.
But he says, that this is a sense that this is a sense that the players can get more in the world's life.
And they can have social relationship in the game than in real life.
They receive feel better and feel better and feeling in the game than in real life.
So, he says that now, it has a sense for playing a sense of virtually time in the real world.
Now, and I agree that this is rational, for moment.
But not but in any case, a optimal situation.
We have to begin to make the world more like a game as a game as a game.
So I was inspired inspiring about 2,500 years ago.
These are typical zeroes in the eye of an ownership?
Before we have extraordinary control of the justice of jobs.
And these represents the first equipment of the human beings.
And if you're familiar with the worker Herodot Herodo, you might know this story.
Which is the history that invent the games and why.
Herodot said that games, and in particular players, they were invented to the Lydia of the Lydia --
Aparently, it was so big that the Lydia Lydie was decided to do something needed to do something neighborhood.
People suffering.
It was an extremely extreme. They needed a very extreme.
So Herodot Herodo, they have invented games and defined a value policies and defined a value.
In one day, every one of them will eat.
And in the next day, everyone will play the world will play.
And they'll be so concentrated on the games of physics are so solutely solitely and learning so solving to a productive productive productive productive productivity that they didn't have the fact that they wouldn't be able to the fact that they were.
And so, in the next day they were played play games, they will eat.
And conform with Herodot, they lived this 18 years old, the survival gameters and playing gamets and playing gameters in the other.
Now, this is exact, I think is exactly what we use today.
We use the games to the games of suffering the world.
We use the games to the game for everything that's stricted in the environmental environment, all of our life, and we need in our lives.
But they don't have to finish here.
This is very interesting.
Herodot to Herodo, after 18 years olfound.
And so he decided that they decided that they would play a game play.
They divided the whole range.
They played a zero game, and the game, and the game received in an adventure adventure.
They want Lydia.
And they will go to a new place where to live a new place where to live with the exactly so many people as to survive with a little bit of the resource of the resources of the resources of otherwise.
Now, this sound, this sound isn't it?
But recently, the DNA has shown that they showed that the Roman, who have the same DNA and DNA and DNA and DNA and DNA and the old Lydie.
And so, the researchers have suggested that the story of Herodot could be true.
And the geologists have found evidence of a global warm that was able to be able to explain about 20 years, and that could be able to explain.
So, this story that story could be true.
They could even be able to actually play their playing playing play playing playing games, and then they were so inspired by 18-year-old, and they know so much about how to be so much about how to be able to bring the entire civilization in this way.
OK, we can do that.
We're playing Warcraft from 1994.
That was the first game, the first time in the World World World World World World World World World World
They play playing games for 18 years ago, we've played Warcraft for 16 years old.
I say that we are the game for our own game.
Now they had a half civilization of civilization that has been a new world.
So here is the 21 billion hours of hour.
Let's be able to convincing a half of us half of us to play a half of us to play a half of us to play games of life.
So now I know you ask, "How can we solve the problems of life in the game?
We have this money to our birds in the Palo and express our future, and our relationship with the future.
We don't want to try to predict the future.
What we want to do is create the future.
We want to imagine the best stage.
And then we want to get people to transform this scenario in reality.
We want to imagine, we want to imagine, and then we want to give people the middle of these windows.
I want to show you very short three of the games that we were trying to be able to offer people who have been trying to be able to create their own.
So, this is the Letrol.
I created this game in 2007.
This is a game where you try to survive the game of oil.
And the crisis is that fast, but we put in there, so we put up there, so you can believe that you can believe that you can live your life, and how we haven't live in this game where you live in this game where you live.
And then we transmit the video scientists in real time, which is what it looks like, how much cost, what it's not available, what it's not available, how it's affected to source the school, if they're protests.
And you have to imagine what you have to imagine if you live if you live your lives. And then you ask to a blog on a blog on to public a picture.
I tested this game in 2007 with 1700 with 1700 players.
And I watched three years ago.
And I can tell you that it's an experience that you transform your experience.
No one wants to make their living their lives, or because it's good for the world, or because it is good.
But if you include an advent adventure and they say, "We're going to remain."
This is a fantastic story and a fantastic.
Let's challenge to see how you have the survival.
Most of our players play their players, they had been taught their players that have learned in this game.
So, for the future that can save the world, we decided to keep the problem of oil.
I created a game called Superstructure Superstructure for Viita.
And the premiser was that a computer supercomputer has only 23 years of spent 23 years of spent on this planet.
Supercomputer is called the Global Global Sistem Sistem of synthetic consciousness.
I asked people to come online almost like Jerry Bruckheimerry Bruckheimer.
Jerry Bruckheimerry Bruckheimer, it turns out.
You've astronaut, the man scientist, and they all have some science and they all have some of the world.
But in the game, instead of people in this team is five people in this team, I said that everyone in your future to the future of the future, the future, the future of his future and his future and the future and the future and the future and the future.
We had 8,000 people who played this game for eight weeks.
And they invented 500 solutions that you can see if you can see whether you can see if you go and look at the Google.
So finally, the last game of the game is a great game in three big game is a collaboration with the Bancar with the Global Global Global Global Global Ivator of World World Bank Institute to 2010.
I work with universities in Africa, and they invites in Africa, and they invitation to learn to learn to learn to learn social innovation.
We have a roman graph. We have growth growing into the attribute to the atribus in the local condition, social listening and the capacity and the capacity and the capacity and the capacity and the capacity and the capacity to the resources.
I would like to invite all of you all of you to share with people in the world, especially in the world, especially that could benefits that could benefit in to try to imagine their own.
So, now I'm going to solve.
I want to ask you something.
What do you think is going to happen?
We're all amazing these amazing games, we have these games that are kind of versions that we could do, but none of the world.
They're going to agree that you will agree with me that players are a resource that we can use the world for the real world that we can use the games.
We all have these amazingly amazingly amazingly, the ability to keep a solider of social relationship of social relationship of optimism to have a sense of optimism to have a sense of a sense.
I hope I hope that we can play that we can play game to play game, to survive this planet to survive this planet.
And it's hopping that you will be able to create and play game and play games.
When I think about the future, I know two things that we can create any future of the future, and we can create any game.
So, I say to the game games that changes the game that change.
Thank you.
For some interests are interested in the placebo, which seemed for a magician, only if you think about it as I think about it as I think about it as I think, "something that I think about a real thing."
Although they said, the pasts with shared a measure effect in certain different ways, just because what you believe that what happens is a farmaceutical effect is a farmaceutical effect or something similar --
For pain, for example, if it's created with a measure is a measure effect called the effect effect.
Sometimes become something that someone in which somebody else.
In order to stop us with you to show you a trick of a very simple.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick that you can find in every book,
And I learned it from the Cub Scar in 1970.
I'm going to show you, and then I'll explain.
And then I'm going to explain why we explain.
So, here's what happens.
Cuth, which you can examine; the food, you can see.
I'm going to keep the country in the food.
I'm going to push food.
And to make sure yourself that nothing to be able to get out of my hand the Vottold you here.
Let me see that nothing you can't couldn't circulate on here.
And as long as long as well as well.
And it's pretty simple.
I'm going to open food, and I hope, and I hopefully good, the magazine.
In fact, it's so good that they can get the food, and the city of the food, and the chapter.
Not anything, nothing to or in the food, without fars;
Take you.
And it opens on my kids on the children in the magic of the magic connection, because you can learn a lot about the forest of the study.
You probably many of the people here.
This is what happens.
Britain in the food.
And I tell me that I'm going to share with my food with my hand to assure that nothing on there, it's a wonderful.
The reason why I keep myself is actually the secret is actually the secret of this illusion.
In the moment when my food is moving from my father and not see, and it's not going to see this finger is going to move to the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene of the gene.
Okay.
On the children.
So that's how it works,
And as I rotes, my finger, my finger, my fingerprint.
And we can talk about why you induce this in erot, why don't you notice that are only three degree, and the way that process process, and the way that process process of information.
But this is not everything.
Well obviousness there, not with the magnetism, but through a truckle, and he shows my show.
And then, when the same thing, the same thing, the same thing, as a retrage, the movement, the movement of my fingerprint.
I give me the food.
This guy can do that you can do friends and neighbors.
Now, what is the connection with the placebot?
I read a year with a year in the next year I opened my mind.
They're not the doctor research, so this is something amazing.
And it turns out that if you administer in the shape of the black of the white shape, just a black shape, just a measure.
But if you change the form in which you get a smaller pill, you give a smaller and the opportunity and the choices of a bigger.
And then, not one of these pasts don't have substanti-substantists -- they are pasted -- are the farmaceuture.
But the black is not as good as the blue as the blue.
Okay? This has left.
And yet, it turns out that it doesn't stop there.
If you take the capsule, they're more efficient than the tablets, in any form.
One of the colors of the galbeneath and the gald of the other is better at the end of the black is better than the black of the blue.
And with the dozen.
A paste of two times a day is not as good as well as a third study.
But the idea is --
and -- and the shape content.
And until and form has something to do with this.
And if you want to get effective effect, you have to go to home.
Yeah? You're inertains -- a couple of inert, and the injective and inject.
So it's a powerful picture so powerful, much more powerful.
It's really, recognize, well, I'll show you another time when I'm going to have the slides.
The idea is that the paste is not as good as the blue is not as good as the blue, and it's not as good as good as well as well as well as well as well as a well.
And it doesn't have a farmaceutical quality.
For only our research in our bodies in our body, and produce a more powerful effect.
And I wanted to see if I can apply the idea of a magic.
And they have something that is obviously a physics and make it a real.
And we know from that if you want to use that if you want to use the achievement.
This is a seven by the age of seven countries. It's very high.
And I'm going to steruse.
This is nothing. It's no artificial artificial.
This is my piece of Hollywood-Hollywood.
I'm going to find myself and I'm going to go with this home.
If you are senssible -- if you listen with a few friends -- I was doing this for a few friends in the hotel room, and they were, and they were, and a woman who don't know.
So, it suggests that if you are going to do require you to look at another part of the next minute -- in fact you know whether you know.
I'm going to see you, you'll see in another part if you want.
So, this is what I mean, in the game part of my arm on my arm in the game.
I seemed to be killing myself.
And now you go through the piece, and he put it on the other hand.
Now, we're pretty much at the same point as the same point as well.
And I was like this.
But now you can't be the number of fingers, here?
Well, let's show you a show you one.
Yeah, yeah.
I know what people think about people when I see that people see that.
Ssays, "Well, it's not so proud that they don't get us to figure out to take a few minutes a few minutes a few minutes.
How do we look at this good.
Yeah, you know. And the people in the backward." In fact, "OK, I didn't see the beginning.
Let me show you better.
This is my sky. It's not a special effect from Hollywood.
This is my book, and I can be success.
I mean, I mean, if you look at the point in another part, look at another part, you don't look at it.
In the background, or the people who want to look at the end of video will say, "E, well, it looks pretty sound, but if it would be really, but if it would be really, if it would be really, if it would be really, if it was really, if you were really, if you were releasing your blood."
Gate, here.
Normally, now I'm going to get home.
I wish my hand, and I would show you that I wouldn't show you that I haven.
But I believe in this context and the idea of field, and it turns into something really, and I'm going to let it out there, and I'm going to let the stage.
We can see a couple of days.
I hope that you expect. Thank you very much.
So, I met a lot of fish of life.
I loved just two.
The first was more like a passional business.
It was a beautiful fish, with the textbooks, a star star star of the men.
What fish.
Even before, it was raised to a farmer, it turns out the sustainability.
So you can feel well when you come.
I was in a relationship with this beautiful length of longer months.
In one day, the director of the company called me and asked me and asked me if I speak at a sustainability.
"Design, I said, "Design.
So here's a company trying to solve what it became that became this unimage for our cheese.
How do we stop the fishes on our men?
For the last 50 years ago, I went into machines and oceans.
It's difficult to sure the fuel.
90 percent of the fishes of fish that I love, the tone, the sleep, the sleep, the fisherbut, all of the sabuse.
Something they did.
So, at the well or well or vaculture, the fish of fish, it becomes our future.
There's a lot of controversial controver,
People are pollution, at least their fish, and they productivity, and they produced the tone.
A major deficians.
For the conversation has a conversation of the food.
This means that it must 15 lives.
It's not too sustainable.
And also, it doesn't have too laught.
So here, in the end, there was a company that trying to do good.
I wanted to shake it up.
At the event before the evening of the public relationships in companies in companies.
Let's called Don.
"Don," I said, "I just said, "just I'm going to put things on the point because you are so far as far as far as far as the pollution.
"Corect," says, "We're so far as far as fishermen from the fish is not concentrated, they're not concentrate."
And then he added it, "We're actually a new world.
All of the conversions of foot? He says.
"The best markets."
2.5 to five one.
"2.5 to something? What's the food us?"
"Protech sustainable, he said, "
"Grozad." I said, "I finished the connection.
And in that night in that night, and I thought, and I thought, what do is a sustainable protein?
So the second day, even before I eventually called Don.
I said, "Yon, yon, yet me left some examples of proteins sustainable.
Well, I talked to the telephone with a few people in companies.
I couldn't be able to give me a clear answer.
Finally, I talked to the biologist.
Let's called Don.
"Yeah, I said, "Yeah, I said, "Well, you have some examples of protein sustainable, and he mentioned some of fish, and then he said to him.
I said, "With you?"
He said, "Myd," I said, "Myd," the windows, the rest and processed and process."
I said, "What's the process in your foot is beautiful?"
By thinking about a couple of a couple of process.
"Well, it's about 30 to 30 percent him.
"Don, what is sustainable in the fisher?" I said, "I me."
It was a long long line, and he said, "I feel like it said, "I am too much in the world."
My broad for this fish for this fish.
No, not because I wouldn't be a following of a virtual and hypothese.
In fact, I'm actually there.
No, I felt this fish, I felt this fish, my God, after that conversation, after that conversation, that conversation, the fishes had gone.
The second is another guy is another type of love story.
It's the romantically, the romantically, the gene, the way you know.
I met him to a restaurant.
A friend journalist talking about this fish.
In a way we showed us the meeting.
And he came to a black color blue, almost slighting.
She found it very much.
At two times.
Surdel, it was yet delicious.
Who can we make a fish to have a fish when it was found too much?
I can, but this kind of poverty.
Let's called Miguel.
In fact, his name is his name.
And no, he haven't find the fish and he's not happy.
Something in the way you understand this.
He's a Veter at the Palma.
It's a farmer in the college of Spanish.
It's about the running of the Guadalquivir.
Until the 1980s was in the argentinids of argentlemen.
They grow up in the areas that was actually a machine.
They created it through the right?
They built this series of complicated cancer, and they put together, and they went back to the room.
But they couldn't be able to work for economics.
And the ecology was a disaster.
She killed 90 percent of the forests, which is a lot of forests.
So in 1982 companies spanied with consciously consciousness of the consciousness.
What they did.
They have inversed the sense of short water.
They comfortable.
Instead of the water appeared, they used canals to bring canal cans.
They indeed canals.
They created a farmed farming -- birth, baby -- babuse, baby -- and in this process -- and in this process process of distruggle and the company of the farmers.
Ferm is incredible.
I want to say that you wouldn't see something like this.
Take yourself to the horizont that is millions of farmers, and everything you see and the forest and the forest and the forest and disease.
I was there not a lot of Miguel.
And he is a black guys Charles Darwin and the Darwin and a part of Crocods.
In the regular? Here's us there before the machine, and I myself, and Migue, and Miguess, and Miguess, and Miel Mistry failure.
Here he shows a humans with humans.
Now the mineral needs of fitoplanctor.
And here's a guy in the group of the girls that we remember the girl.
I learned that Migue was that Miguys in the National Paris in the National Miki in Africa.
I asked them how we became a expert in the fish.
He said, "Look, I didn't know anything about fish? I didn't know.
I am expert in the relation."
And then they launched in many different discusses and rare and choices.
And don't understand myself wrong, it was really fascinating, you know, a kind of community community in direct.
It was great, but I was great.
And I was in that piece after that piece of fish, I found too much, which I found too much.
So I said, "Miguel. I said, "Miguel, what do your fish to be so such as well?"
He showed up to the algy.
"To knowledge physics, fitople, the relationship is amazing.
What do you measure your fish?
What is the conversions of conversions of foo?"
Well, he began to tell me that it's a system that is a measure, that the fishermen that would be food.
Biomasics, fitoplants, fitoplanctor, this is a fish of fish.
The history is so healthy is so health.
It's not necessary.
Have you ever heard of a farms that don't feed their animals?
More later in that days, I had the machine with Miguel, and I said, "For a nature, and I said, "For a nature."
In that moment, it was like the rule of a film of a movie.
And I gave the most amazing and I saw the most amazing and thousands and thousands of forests on their eyes.
"This is success," he said.
"Look at their jobs.
They wait."
Okay? I was completely unded.
And I said, "Miguel, but they don't hear the fisher?"
"Yeah, he said, "Yeah.
"We see 20 percent of our fishes in our fish and in the fish of fishing pounds of poverty.
Well, the year, this year, this property, this properties on it, more than 250 different species of different species of different species of different species of different species.
Today became biggest and one of the most important and one of the world."
Is I said, "Miguel, I said, "Migue population is not the last thing you want to be the last thing that you want to take a fish of fish?"
She clined his head, no.
She said, "We grow fishes extensively not intensively intensive.
This is an ecological network.
The flowers of flowering measure.
The reveals measure fitoplanctor.
So the more running is better system is better system is better system."
Okay, let's recap.
A farm that doesn't feeding their animals, and a farmers, and a success of their own animals.
And a fish of fish, but a sanctual sancture.
Oh, by the way, those foreign, no must be there.
They were in a city to 240 kilometers to 240, where the conditional conditional conditions.
In every morning, they are 240 kilometers to the farmer.
And every eventually, they are 240 kilometers.
They're because they are capable to follow the bottom of the bottom of the A92.
It's not a game.
I imagine something like the mass of penguins, so I looked at Miguel.
I said, "Miguel, they say, "Miguilometers at the farms, and then they farmer, and then they get back to the night?
I do this for their parents?"
He looked at me as I would have ready reading from a song from a song Houston.
He said, "No. I do, I said, "No.
I haven't mentioned my sketch, who was delicious, and the myself, and me.
I don't like the job. I don't like the can.
It has that gentlemen, as well as well.
When I find out at one of the almost every time.
However, when I gotten up to that restaurant from the Spanden, not have the fishing of fish.
He's a gone, and it turns out that you have taken a mushroom.
And I mentioned that Miguy and recognized it.
He said, "Pield acts as a bug.
This is the last approach to the body.
He evolved to above the impurition."
And then he added it, "But the water has no impurs."
Okay. It's a fish that they don't feed their fish.
A farmer, which measure the successful animals in the success.
And then I understood when he said, a farm that has no impursed a lot of stuff, because the water comes out of the Guadalism.
It's a rocket that brings all the things that the rules that are in the day's day.
And when they run through the system and the water, water is more currently than the window.
The stem is so healthy is so healthy water.
So, not only a farmer that doesn't feeding their animals, not only a farmers that are not only a farmer, but a successful, but a farmer, but a farm that is actually a fish, but it doesn't only for those fish, but also for those fish, but also for the fish.
Because when the appeared when the appeared in the Atlantic.
A paint paint in the ocean, but I have to do it, and so you should be doing, because this story of love story, because this story of loomantics, it's although instructive.
You could tell you that it's a retains for the future for the future that we speak or vites.
Which we need now is a concept of agriculture, one where the footprint, one where the good.
But for a lot of people this is a little too radical.
We are not true, we are not realists.
We are conditions.
We love we love the farmers.
We love we love small families.
We talk about local food.
We eat organically.
And when you suggering that these are things that are going to make sure the future and say, "With and says, "Homule, and I love love, but how do you see the world?
How do you fee?"
Can I meaning?
I didn't like that question.
No, not because we already produced more quite than the world.
A billion people will be flight today.
A billion billions -- this is more than any of the great inequalities in distribution in distribution in the distribution of the channels.
Now, I don't like this question because he determined the logic system of our last 50 years.
Let's living with the babies of the pesticides with pesticides, and all the business, and all the business, and all the business, and all the business, "How do we feed a little bit more people with more people with more with more people with less mone?"
This was motivation.
It was justification.
It was the businesses agricultures of Americans.
We should tell him in the name, a business, a business, a business that makes it possible.
This is not a business, and it's not agriculture.
One of our window is threatened today's not because of girl, but from the death, because of the resource of the final resource of the final fishing of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish of the fish of fisherms with their fishers, but not fishermen with their lands and not fishermeters with fishermen and fishing in and fisherits.
Do you want to eat light?
Let's start asking question: How do we feed our feeing?
Or better conditions that allow conditions that allows the communities of communities?
To do that, not look at the business model in the future.
It's very, very old and it's dangerous.
It's much capital, chemistry, and not produced a machine, and not produced.
Instead of that, let's look at model.
This is the one who are based on billions of years of works.
Look at Miguel, farmers like Miguel, farmers that are not only the world for themselves, farms that results that results that are not only listening instead, farmers, but the farmers, the farmers, but the farmers.
And if I really want to be a symmetry to be better than I have to be better than I ever want to be a better than I ever want to be a better than you would be a little bit of me.
You know, I mean, because if this is that if this is the future is the future will be delicious.
Thank you.
I grew up with a constant constants of Science Fick.
At a high school in school in school in school, and one of the day.
And I was always absorbed by a book, a book, a book, which is the mind of the world's mind me of the world's mind of a narrative form of curious, which is a narrativity that we have.
And you know -- you know, that curiosity is also manifesting in the fact that anyone in school, I was at the school, and colleague, and the broad, and the broad, and the samples and the windows, and the research, and the research, and the research, and the research.
I was a true in science in science.
But all of my connection with my trying to understand the world, to understand the world to understand the same.
And my passion for scientific scientific is actually seemed that they recognize what happens -- that's what happens -- that happens -- that happens -- and I was spent to the end of the oceans.
Jacques Coustick in our house in the subjects of hemistry of hemistry of a fantastic world that we couldn't be able to imagine before.
So, this seems like the entire scientific with the entire scientific science.
And I was a artist.
I could draw the painting.
And I discovered that, because there were not playing video and respect and respect of the CGGGod and all of the image of the environment, I had to create these images in my head.
You know, all of you had to read the children have to read a book and read books, and to ask something on the screen in the level of our heads.
And so my answer to all of these was to drawing creature, to paint creatures, all of these things, all these things, all these things.
I was always achieve to the mathematics of mathematics.
That happens because this creativity because this creative creativity had to find out how they find out how the windows.
And it happened to Jacque, the emissions of Jacques Coustanda very extra very extrater, extracted to the fact that there was an extract, right here on Earth.
I couldn't go to a really extra world world extracted world, in a navigate world.
This seems a pretty neighborhood.
But that was a world where we could really go in which we could really go here, and that was just on the Earth, and this was just as anything else.
So I decided that I'm going to become a fundraised at the age of 15 years.
And the only problem with this is that I lived in a little bit of Canada, at 600 miles of the most far away from the closer ocean.
But I haven't let me this really intimacy.
I put my father until my father until she finally, a clay claims in Buffalo, New York, exactly where we live.
And I actually became a fundamental disorder, in the middle in YMCA in Buffalo in Buffalo in Buffalo, New York.
And I haven't seen the ocean, a truly ocean in California.
For then, over 40 years ago, I spent about 3,000 hour, I spent about 3,000 hours and 500 hours, and 500 hours.
And I learned that environment, and even the oceans, and even the oceans, and even the oceans, they're so far as we can imagine.
Imagine nature is so limited by the limitation, in comparison with our position with human imagination.
I am completely amazed by what I see when they do these scure.
And my story of love with the ocean, and it's as powerful and it's as powerful as a powerful time.
But when I chose a book, as adult, that was a rizarre.
And this was the best way to be the best way to the best way to say that I needed with the needs to create images.
And, in children, I drawings, and so on.
So, the creation of films was the way to put together and the stories and the stories.
And of course, the stories, the stories that I chose to say they were stories: "Aliens" and "Aliens," and "Aliens."
And with "Abisull, I shared the dragoster for the landscape of the filmmakers and the creation of the creation of the creation of the creation of films.
Coming these two passions.
Something that was the result of "Abs" and that is solving a specific problem of a specific problem of this physics of the water of the water in the water of the water, CG.
And this has led to the first year that had ever been in a film.
And even though the film didn't do money, I should say that the above his investment, I was big investment, and that audience, which is that the audience of global audience of this apparently awesome.
You know, it's the launched of Arthur Clarke that any technology is quite impossible technology is impossible.
They see something magic.
So that made me become very excited.
And I thought, "Wow, this is something that must be adopted in art,
That's why Terminator, "Terminator 2," which was the next movie, I took a long time.
I work with ILM, we created with ILM, we created the metal lymetal successful in that film, the success of this effect.
And it worked. And we created me.
And we had the same result with audience.
I made a lot of money on this way.
So we live a line between these two experiences between these two experiences in the fact that this is going to be a completely new form of creativity to creativity for the artists of artists.
In the conclusion, I put on a companies with Stan Winston, my grandfather Stan Winston, which is the designer of Digital creature.
And the idea of the behind companies was that we're going to swimming processes and so on.
And I actually did that, what we did us a competition competition for a competition for a time.
But I got the 1990, I went to half the '90s in the '90s in the design of the creatures of the creatures, in fact.
And I wrote this piece called "Svatar," which had the role of the things that had the role in the visual effects of visual effects of visual effects.
And the main the main the Great C.
And the world was the CG.
But they didn't work.
And people from my company told me that we won't be able to do.
So we put the idea on the ground, and we made another film and we made another film that big film that big deal.
You know, I went and I went and I went to studio as "Romeo and Juliet."
I was going to be a romantics of proportion, a paint filmmaker.
In the secret, what I wanted to do was to do was to get to the real research.
And that's why we made the film.
This is the true. Well, I look like this.
But I was convinced. I said, "We're going to be able to move.
We're going to use that at the beginning.
It's going to be very important. I'm going to be an excellent for market."
And I convinced a expeditions.
It sounds good.
Because we actually created a reality in which six months later, I find myself in a rushes and a half of the Atlantics of the Atlants of Northern Titanic in a huge, not to a truth, not Hung.
Now, this has fascinated.
And he needed a lot of prepared, we had to build cameras and all kinds and all kinds of stuff and all of this kind of a deep demand it was asked to the deep of a deep space.
You know, where everything was powerful, and where the extremely extremely lots of extremely plant.
You put it in this capsule, you get to this dark environment, and stop where there is no hope that you can't rescued whether you can return if you can't go back to the next one.
And I thought, "Wow. And I said, "Wow, I live in a future.
This is really cool."
And so we were really working on the deep of the deep of the deep of the deep of the Earth.
Of course, by the curiosity of the scientific aspects.
It was the everything. It was adventure, was the curiosity.
And it was a Hollywood that Hollywood.
Because I could imagine a creature, and I could create a visual effect for it.
While I was a couple of expeditional expeditional ventilately, and sometimes, and sometimes have never seen the things that we haven't seen anyone who had never seen to the point of scientists that we haven't seen them and photographed them and photographics and photograph.
So I was completely quite this and I had to have a longer.
So I made a little bit of the curious decision.
After Titanically, I said, "I said, "I'm going to put a message, I said, "I'm going to do the messages of the movies of filmmakers and I'll be able to become a whole me."
And so we started to pay these expeditions.
And we got to go to Bismark and exploring it and exploring it with the help of robots.
We went back to the Titanic Titanic.
I took small robots that we have a little robot has grown on the physics.
And the idea was to come up with the idea of making a interial exploration.
No one looked at the paintings. They didn't have the middle of making technology to do this, so we created technology.
So, you knowledge me on the Titanically, in a submarine and looking at the poorest that I knew that I knew that I knew that I knew that I knew that I knew that I knew that I knew that the orchestra.
And I have a little vehicle a little robot in the city of the networks.
When I says, but my mind is in that vehicle.
I felt that I felt that I was thinking about the epissue of the Titanic.
And it was the worst of common common that I had ever experienced that I had ever been there, because I knew what was going to be there, before the lights of the vehicle to revehicle the vehicle to reveal my website.
And the scene was built as an exaction of the water plann.
This was a remarkable experience.
And he made me really do to make me really experience that you can actually have the experience that you can have these little robotics, when the conscience is injected in a vehicle, in this other forms.
It was a profound thing.
And maybe a short of what it might happen over a few decades, as we will begin to have the cyborg or for the future, or for the future.
So, doing these expeditional expeditions and beginning to get there,
They're in essential essentially live here, on Earth.
They live in an environmental environment, I am not survived in a light system on the light system as well.
So you see animals that live animals that live with the approach with the temperatures.
You think that you couldn't survive.
In the same time when I was very interested in science space, again, again, again, again, the scientific of scientific experiment.
And I walked in in the community of the internal community of space, very implicated with NASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASASA, and all these things.
And that was fascinating.
But what I got to do is I got to do is to bring people in the space of space.
And so it's played for them to play for them to have access to the scientists of scientists who were really interested in these extrems, and left people who were interested in the deeply and shared to figure out how to deal with instruments, and so forth.
And so so so we can do our documents, but actually, I was actually studying science.
I ended up completely with the scientific scientific scientific scientific and children, and you knowledge the babies of this room, and I learned very long discovered, I learned very much.
I learned a lot about scientists. But I also learned a lot about the art art art,
Now, you think that the regization has to be a leader, the leadership of the networks, and all these things.
I haven't learned about the art art the art to the art of the expeditions.
Because I needed to a moment, "What do I do this?
Why do I do this? What do you know from this?"
We don't do money with these nurses with these nurse.
The survival survival survival.
People believe that I went to "Titanic" and "Avatar," and I said, "Avatar" and I was standing to the beach.
I did all these files, I did all these movies for a very limitation.
Without the face, without money. What are you doing?
You do it for the work, for the project is the most challenge is the most challenge, for emotion and for the street and for the streets that are forming when a small group of people former forming a small group.
Because I was doing these things with a team of 10-hundreds of days.
Sometimes a big months for two months of days.
And in this condition, you realize that the most important thing you have to do for themselves, and that they didn't have a chance that you can't explain the way.
When you go back to the countries and say, "I had to do this, and we had to do this, and that and the other, and the other technology and the stuff that was implicated, and difficult to work, and difficult to work, and the aspects of works, you can't explain that you can't explain the mazing thing that could be able to explain something that they have, or people in some sense that they have.
It creates a condition, it creates a respect.
So, when I went back to my movie, and I tried to the movie, and I tried to the same principle, and I tried to the same principle, which is to respect your team in the same time and respect them in the same time.
And it really changed the dynamics.
So here's my team with a small team with a small team of a small team, and I said, "Avatar," which is no new technology, which doesn't exist.
About extremely interesting.
Extra challenge.
And I became a family, on a family of a four years and a half years and a half years and a half month.
And this has all changed the way to do the films.
So people have committed, well, you know, you well, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you have the oceans, and you have the oceans.
For me was more a fundamental way to do business, which has changed as a result that changed as a result of this fact.
So what can we feel in this?
You know, what are the lesson?
Well, I think that the first is curious.
This is the most powerful thing you do.
Imagine is a force that can manifestion that can manifest.
And the team of your team is more important than all the people in the world.
And the creators creators of filmmakers and say, "You're going to do this."
And I said, "I don't have limited you on yourself.
Other people want to do that for you, it doesn't do anything.
And so, so,
NASA has this preferred has this prefer is not an opportunity is not a opportunities."
But it must be an option has to be an option and in exploration, because it's a real stuff.
And there's no trying to get innocent innovation didn't have no risky.
You have to be disappeared to the risks.
So, this is the though, which is the thinking about whatever you do, which is that in ESTA is an option, but beautiful.
I would let with one idea today with a single idea, which is that the whole thing that the entire we consume that the entire we consume it is bigger than the surgery, instead of the surgery, instead of the way that information that we can use the pattern that we can use the patterns and see the pattern.
We're now looking at a mortality of the mortality of organized mortality after the criterial critery.
The game that we use here is the experiment, it is called Pivoted, and what I can do with it is that I can do with a certain a certain death, accident.
Is a different structure of another structure, different structure, differently.
This is in the middle here in the middle of their most active, and here because it becomes very fragile because it becomes very fragile because it becomes very fragile because it becomes very fragily.
And we do a step back and argue the database, and we see that diseases, and we see that diseases and cancer diseases, but not for all the principle, but not for all of the principle, but not for everybody else.
If we keep the film and the movie, let's say 40 years or less than 40 years old, we actually see that the accidents are actually delight.
And also, it's especially for men for men for men
You understand that this kind of visualization of visualization, it's like you in a degree of information.
And if we can't do that with simple data, why we don't have the same and contain?
Here we have the covers of the Sport Illustrates of Sports now.
They're all on the Internet.
You can try to try that home when you leave this home.
With Pivoted, you can get period.
Then you year.
You can go to a certain a certain subject.
I look at this -- I see this -- I see it in this ediation of sport.
There's a big fan Lance Armstrong, and this is all the numbers that brings me all the numbers where the numbers.
If I just want to look at them, can I go through my mind "What's going to be going to see what they have to see in general?"
I turned back and open it and open that.
I see Greg Lema Greg Lem.
And you understand you understand that when you navigate in the way, when you specifically go back and especially and then, they walk before I wouldn't be able to do.
You do something a little differently.
It's somewhere in the middle of the middle of the way that can be used to use information.
I want to go to a little bit of this idea that is a little bit of a little bit like this.
I took every page of the Wikipedia and I recognized.
The Russian is just a short of description and a chance that indicate that indicate in which produce.
I just show you only the first 500 pounds right here.
But even in this limitation, we can do a lot of things.
So we see that are suggests that are the most popular Wikipedia.
Now I'm going to select government.
Now I choose government, I can see categorize the Wikipedia and the most recent of the Earth.
And that's important because it's a important thing that was not contained in the Wikipedia.
You can discover you can only find that if you do a step back and look at all the simultaneouse.
Look at all of these particularly recognizing the concept of the Time -- Personal Time -- Personality to the surface.
And I look at these people, I see that most people come from government.
A couple of scientists in science.
How many times, and fewer in the business.
This is my cheap.
And this comes from music.
And it's pretty interesting, Bono is and a winter of TED.
And so we go to look at the TED.
You see, we can snavigate for the first website, and as well as well as a network, but not from a level of abstraction, but at a level of abstraction.
And I want to show you one thing that can be a surprised.
I look at New York Times.
People application -- I don't want to call it the browser, because it's not a browser, but you can see the pages of the website, but you use the technology of the website.
I can do a step back then, I can go back to a certain a certain section,
Why is important, because it's just access pages in this way, I can see my entire history, I can see the same way.
I can explore more in the details in different details.
This is actually the situation of this demo that we do now.
And I can look at the stuff that I did today.
And if I want to do a step back and look at all and I want to divide mystical history, for example.
Here I looked for Bing Live Live Live Pive Labs Pive Live Pight.
And here I can choose a page page and a land and a land to sit again.
It's a metaphor a metaphers, and every case in every case of bigger than the whole part.
Now, in our world, we believe that the data is a blue.
We fall out of the surgery surgery of the surgery.
We're saying that we sure.
What if we turn it all turns out, and we went back and the web, and the web, so we go to the next thing to the next thing to the next thing to go to the next thing to go to the next thing to do about more things.
If we do that, instead of data, instead of data, we could actually be able to extract information.
And instead of just a primary relationship with information, we could actually extract knowledge.
And if we extract knowledge, maybe it's wish.
Well, thank you, thank you.
Everybody talks about happiness today.
I asked somebody to call somebody who have the word "happiness of happines."
There's a huge amount of happiness for happiness.
It makes a lot of happiness for happiness.
All the world would like to do people more happy.
But, despite numbers of activities in this field, there is some cognitive characters that we have a picture of happiness.
My Prest today will do the reference today is cognitive.
There are so people used so that people used to think about happiness to happiness, and the research, and the researchers of happiness, it turns out that research, it seems like everybody else.
The first one of these ability to admit is retically, the complexity of happiness.
It seems like "happiness is not a word "happiness because we use it to too many different things.
It probably probably that there is a specific sense that we might have to retain it, it will be able to left this notion of a better vision and adopt and adopt a good vision.
And the second capita is a confusion between experience and memories: In fact, a confusion between the lifetime, and it would be thank in your own life.
There are two very different conceptual conditional concept of happiness.
And the third confusion is the perception, the fact that we cannot think we cannot think that we can't think about a good circumstancy that affects without the beautiful.
And this is a cognition cognition.
We're not just not going to perceive the bed.
I would like to start with an example of an example of a session of a question and answers and answer to the end of a significant.
Something that listen a symphony and that music was absolutely wonderful.
But at the end of the conditional conditioning a statement, and he brought a lot of awesome, and he brought him the entire experience.
In fact, it's not stricted experience, but remember of the experience.
The experience.
She had 20 minutes of music.
But they were released to zero because it was a measure.
Aminministry has alternature, and remember was all the way that it was all the way that it works.
The conclusive here is that we probably walking and the others with a shared and the others.
There's a remain a remain remain the press, and they live and lives in the past, but in terms of the past, but essence.
It's synthesized the doctors.
You know, when the doctor, "Tdoctor when you appear here?"
The other part of the other part of the memory, and synthese, and the bottom of our lives.
Is it the books are the doctor when you ask yourself, "How do you feel like you?"
or "What was the excursive in Albania.m.'.
These are very different entities very different entities and synthese, and the confusion between them and the confusion of happiness.
Sininmember is a story is a storytell.
The beginning with our answer to our responses, beginning,
We don't just tell stories when we stories.
Our history tells us our stories, and we precision, what we receive a living story.
Let me start with an example.
There's a old study about patients about patients that go through an experience.
Not in the detail. It's not rerocket today, but it was taken in the '90s.
The patients were asked to describes and description every 60 seconds.
We have a patients and their relationship and their relations.
The question is, "What's suffering?"
It's a very simple question.
Obviously, the patient's patient.
His his Colosmoscoped through every minute, he went through every mind and the patient and the patient of the A, the bridge.
But here's another question: "How do they perceived their patients."
And here we have a surprised source is that the patient is that the patient of a lot more nice than the patient colonoscopy than the patient B.
There's these colonoscopes have been differently because some of the crucial story.
None of the relationship is not memorable or grandmotherly one of them is one of them.
And the most news was that we were more intense was more intense was more intense to the end of it.
It's a black story.
Where do you know?
I asked these people after the colonoscopy, much later, much later, much later was proceduced it was proceded in the another.
In their memory of their patients, it was much better for the patient.
It's a conflict conflict conflict and synthese.
First of all, the experiment, it's clear that experiment, it's clear that the patient.
What we could do with the patient A, and we actually did with the clinical experiments that have worked, is to prepredicted to the patient of the patient of the patient to move it too much.
This is going to do the patient to suffering, so much less than before.
If we do that a couple of minutes of synelt experience of the A, but improvement of the A, but improvement in the way that we let him in the way we let him with a better memory because I left the patient of his experience.
What do you define a story?
And it's true for the stories that you will give them the memory, but also for the stories that we invent the stories.
What's defined a story is a changing story is change, and the end of the significant and the end of it.
The end is very, very important.
In this case, in this case, the end was hotter.
The moment and the moment and lives.
Is the moments of living in lives, and you know, what happens to do with these moments?
And the answer is very simple.
They're lost for always to always
Most moments of living -- and we calculator: The presence of psychologically, they saw that it takes about three seconds.
It means that in a life, we have about 600 million moments.
In a month, we have about 600,000.
Most people never leave it.
Most people are completely ignored by the memory.
And yet we have to have the impression that we should be conted, that what happens in these moments in these moments of living and life.
It's the rest resources that we consume in our ground.
And the way we spend a lot of relevant, but it's not to relevant, but this is not this story.
So we have symbol and synthese, which are distinct that are distinct.
The largest difference between them is the way between them is processed process.
For the point of view point if you pay in vacation and two weeks and two weeks is as good as well as well as well as well as the first two weeks better than the vacation of a few weeks.
For memory, things are not workers not working.
For memory of the memory, a two weeks is nesemistry than a better vacation than a week of a week of a week of us.
The story was not changed it.
And so, the time becoming variabove that distinguish that distinguishing memory.
It has an impact has an impact on stories.
Sinmembers don't just do only do their stories and tell the story.
It's actually the one that decision, whether a colonoscopy, for example, the second colonoscopes with two different surgery that is going to be the ones of the books will be the one, the ones that determines will be able to choose that determines that determine.
The experimental scientists has nothing in this choice in this choice.
We don't choose not choices, but between experiences, between experiences.
And even when we think about the future, we don't think about the future of experiences.
We're thinking about our future as a remember of the anticipation.
And essentially you can think of this thing, right? And the right, and you can think of the memory, and you can consider some of the experimental experimental experience of experimental experimental experimental experience.
I send that when we go to the vacation that when we go to vacation and this is really deliver, which is a very large, in a very large, in a very large, in the service of history.
And this is kind of justify justified me.
I mean, what do we measure ourselves?
This is one of the things that explains that explains the memory.
And when I think about this thing, I think about a vacation that I spent that I spent in Antarctica few years ago, which was a couple of years ago, which was the most beautiful way that I had been thinking about it.
And we probably consumed the member of that vacation three weeks of three weeks to say about 25 minutes in the last four minutes.
If I would be opened with the bump with the 600 pictures of the 600 pictures.
So we have one week, three weeks, three weeks ago, and a half of the other hand.
It seems to be a discredness.
I could be able to be a little extremely through the town that consumptions, but even if you consume them in a big measurement, the question, the question.
Why do we agree so many of the memories with the experience with experience?
So I wanted to think about a experiment to think about a experiment.
Imagine that yourself that the next vacation you know that at the end of the vacation of your vacation will be deployed in your pictures will be distracted to be a drug that you wouldn't remember that it doesn't remember anything.
Do you choose the same vacation?
And if you choose another vacation, there is a conflict of experimental conflict, and you have to think about the conflict, and you have to think about this conflict conflict, and if you take a critical response.
And if you take remembers like criters, you might have another answer.
Why do we choose the vacation that choice?
It's a problem where we confront with an experimental choices between experimental and the memory.
People experimental and symbol makes a different notion of happiness.
There's actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply, one for each other.
So can you ask the question: How do you have experiment?
And by the other parte: How farmers are moments in my life,
And they're all happiness.
It's a pretty complicated.
What are the emotions that can be measure?
And by by the way, we're now in measure a pretty good ideas about happiness of happiness,
Instead, happiness, it is a completely different thing.
It's not about how happy they live their life.
With as well as well as it was this person when they think about life.
It's a very difference.
Who doesn't do the distinct between these notions, and it will compromises in a group of a group of the good researchers that have the compromise of happiness for a lot of time in this way.
The degree of happiness of happiness and satisfaction and satisfaction was recognizing in the last few years ago, and they do now do the efortunately.
Organization Galls makes an opinion of opinion in the world of half a million people have been thinking about half a million people who think about their lives and their experiences.
And they were still made and other similar fortunately.
So in the last years we began to learn some of happiness.
And I think the lessons I learned that I learned it, it's the fact that they're really different.
You can satisfied by their life, and this is some of their life with their life, and this is not a lot of happiness.
Just to give you an example of the costs is about 0.5 is about 0.5 is about 0.5 and you say, "Oh and you say, "Oh and you say, "Oh my daughters is intimacy of this person?
Well, you know something about inaltimacy, but there are very many inaltimacy, but there are very lot of incertainty.
If I said that somebody says that somebody says that evaluated on a scaling scaling on a lot of incertain research.
So this is smallpox.
We know something about what that is controlling control of happiness.
We know that money is very important, stops are very important.
We know that happiness meaningful to be satisfaction to be satisfaction, to spend with people that we love the time with people that we love.
There are other places, I met these are dominance.
So if you want to maximize happiness to be happiness, you'll get different different things.
The conclusion of what I said here is the fater that we should actually go to the happiness of happiness.
It's a completely different.
Now, very quickly, another reason, another reason that we cannot go on happiness about happiness is the fact that we don't want to think about the same thing.
So if you ask you a simple question about as happy as happy as happy is the people in California.
When you put this question, you have to believe that people have to be more happy in California yes, for example, you are in Ohio.
And what happens is that when you think when you think about the California, you think about the California, you think about the California, and other people, and the fact that this contrast is like this contrast is the fact that this contrast.
It turns out, it turns out is not very important, and it's not really important, and it's not really important to synthesize that they decided how happiness.
But, because of the fact that the reflection of reflection is at least -- some people could get -- some people could get to the California.
And it's pretty interesting to go back to the people who are going to come up with people who are moving in California in California.
So, their experimental experimental isn't going to be happy.
We know that.
But one thing is going to come up. They believe that there are more happy.
Because when they go to this work, and they remember, and they'll remember in Ohio was time in Ohio decision.
It's very difficult to think about good, and hopefully and hopefully a difficult image about how difficult it is.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have a question for yourself.
Thank you very much.
A couple of health, when I talked to the telephone, you've got a result result in the Gallup.
Can you think you can shared that you can share a few minutes?
Daniel Kahneman: Sigur.
I think the most interesting result of the Gallen is a number of the Gallen is a number of we haven't expected.
What I learned was referring to happiness to happiness.
We looked at the sense of the sense of the sentence.
and it turns out a hundred dollars a year, and this is a big number of American, and this is a big number of American representation, about 600,000 which is a great network of 600,000 dollars --
CA: 60,000.
DK: 60,000 dollars a year, people are neighborhood, and it becomes more unfortunately.
I mean, I want to saw a line that I also saw a plan.
It's clear that money, not aduate happiness, but their lack experiment, and we can bring this very happiness, and we can get this very exact.
At the other synthetic synthesis, we have a different situation.
The more money with more money with the more satisfacy.
This is not true in the case of emotions.
CA: But the Danny, the Danny, the dream of happiness.
If the world discoveries in seriously in the seriously, everything, everything that I believe what I believe the policy and so forth.
There's a chance of politics, as a general statement in general, to have a seriously constatement and elabove policies in the fields of politics?
DK: You know, I think there is a recognition of happiness in public policy research.
Again, it will be lense in the U.S., but in U.K, but in the U.S.
People realize that they should be thinking that we should think about happiness when they think about politics when they think about politics.
She's going to be the time, and the world will want to study happiness, or if they want to study experience, or whether they have to student, so we have to have to improve that we have to improve happiness, and if we think about happiness, and if we think about it, and if we think about it, and if we think about experimental.
This is going to influence policy, I think, in the next year.
In the U.S., they do the measure of happiness in the population of the population of this population or the next two decades or the next two decades, one of the statistics of CA: She seems to be the biggest ones of CA: It turns out, or the power of anothers.
Thank you very much, because you've been invented to the behavior.
Thank Danny Kahneman.
I'm going to talk about energy and climate energy and climate.
And that can seem a little bit of surprised because my work with normal funny to the funny of vaccines and significant things that we need to invent them to help the people who need to help the poorest of the poorest to live two billion lives.
But the energy and climate is extremely important for these people, even more important than anyone in the planet.
The climate climate means that many years old, and many years are not going to grow.
It will be too much, it won't be pretty much.
They're going to change in their fragile in their fragile environment.
And that goes to the food. You're at none. You're at the networks.
The climate climate climate for them.
And also, the price is very important for them.
In fact, if we could choose a single books to reduce the poverty to reduce the poverty, we choose to reduce the energy.
Well, the price has been reduced in time.
So even then, civilization is based on the progress is based on the progress.
The revolutional revolution has revolution and even in the 1990s and even in the 1990, and that's why we have a decline research, and we can create materials, and we can create materials.
And so we are in a wonderful situation of electricity in the disease.
But, once we have a cheap -- and trying to do two times -- we have to do two times -- we need to reject a new building, and this building to the CO2.
CO2 traveling planets, and the equation of CO2 is really simple.
If we bring the amounts of CO2 emissions, and this is the temperature of temperature, and the growth of temperature.
Effects over time, and maybe more degree, and maybe the ecosystems can adapt so that they can adapt can adapt to the collapse.
Well, measure exactly the CO2 and the CO2 and where the U.S. and where there are reactions and where the inverse of the inverse reactions that recognition, but not very large.
And there are certaintains about how graphics are going to be extremely degree, but they're going to be extremely degree.
I asked people scientists in the repeat repeat repeated: We really need to reach always to reach alone?
Can we reduce about half or a shared or a shape of a shape of a slight?
And the answer is that, until we're going to get almost non-temperature.
So we have a big problem.
It's not always with a four camera that we have to go to the four and we could buy a bridge that we could buy the way that we could buy the home.
Here we have to reduced to zero.
Now, we emphasize a dioxide of carbon every year, over 26 billion tons.
For every American are about 20 tons.
For people from the poor countries is less than a tone.
In the environment in the planet are about five tonight.
And you buy, you know, we have to do that at zero.
He grew up constants.
Next changes economic changes have produced, so that we have to go from a very fast, so we have to go to a very quick, and the shared to fly to zero to zero.
The research has four.
She can listen.
So, we have something in the left, CO2, which is going to get to zero, and this is going to be based on the number of people, and the energy that each person, and the energy for each service and the CO2, and the CO2, and the CO2, and the CO2 and CO2, and the CO2,
Let's look at every one of them and see how we can get to zero.
It's probably one of these number one of these numbers will have to be a lot of zero.
Well, this is from the algeek, but let's take a high school.
I mean, we have the population.
Now, the world today has 6.8 billion people.
And it goes back to about the new billion billion.
And if we do a great deal with our vaccines and healthy services and healthy services and health, we could go to 15 percent or 15 percent or 15 percent or 1.3.
The second factor are the service that we use it.
This include including that we eat him, the television, the television, the television.
These are very good, and it turns out the poverty, very poverty saving these services on the planet.
And it's a great thing to grow this number to grow.
In the disorder, maybe in the first billion, we probably could be able to use less than we can use less than each year in the environment, so in the environmental services are going to grow some people will grow some of the people will grow.
Here we have a very elementary.
Do you have light in the house can read you?
Well, these kids don't hear it, so they don't hear the light and I read the light of light at light.
Then efficiency, E, E, E, and the energy, we have a good news.
We haven't grow.
By different inventions and different ways of helps and different kinds of cars, different types of buildings where you can reduce the services where you can reduce the services that you can reduce the sustainable services, even to 90 sustainable to 90 percent.
There's other services, for example, for example, or how we do it or how the air, where it is much less and improvement, where it is much less and improvement.
So, in the environment, if we are optimistic reducing a reduction of three to reduce, six times.
But for these three factors until now, we get from 26 billion of the best hour, maybe 13 billion tons, and this is not enough, and this is not enough.
So let's look at the fourth of four -- this is going to be a key factor -- which is the city of CO2 emistry.
And the question is: How can we reduce it can we reduce it?
If you arguess, no.
If you argue naturally, no.
And almost every way to produce electricity to produce electricity today, with exception of the emergency and nuclear renews.
What's going to have to do global scale is to create a new system.
So, we need miracles of energy.
And when they use the term of the miracle, I'm not impossible.
Microprocessing is a miracle is a miracle is a miracle.
The Internet and services are a miracle.
People here have contributed to the creation of the miracles.
Normal we don't have a terms of a miracle of a certain to a certain to a certain a certain it.
You're just waiting and some ways.
This is a case where we really need to accelerate to the maximum and get a miracle in a pretty short.
I thought, how could I say this: How could I say, what do I do?
Is there a natural illustration of natural demonstration that could stimulate image?
I thought I was the year, I brought the countries and it seems and it turns out.
Even it involved in the idea, you know, they're people who live with countries.
Well, all with energy, everything we could find out that I could find out.
I thought, I'll think about a few kinds of licorder to be my contribution to the environment.
So here we have some of the natural natures.
I was told that I couldn't be able to do.
Now, there are all kinds of solutions like this, but they don't have who knows what value.
We need solutions, one or more solutions, one of the incredible scale and they have a big scale and people look at a lot and people look at a lot in many directions, and I see the big numbers.
I left the energy fuel energy fuels, the geoter, biofuels.
They might be able to contribute to contribute and if they want to ask myself.
But what I want to suffer here is that we need to work on every one of these five five and we cannot let any of them even if it turns out, because it turns out.
Let's look at the arm of the fossil fuels of fossil fossil fossil of nature.
What we need to do here, it seems but it's not to take CO2, and he showed the CO2, and he showed him her horn, let's put it on it and hopefully and however, and however.
So now we have some stuff that we do this at 60 to 60 to 80 to 80 to 80 to 80, but it growth, this is going to be very difficult to understand where to understand where this is going to be able to understand where this is the problem is the problem is the problem is the problem of CO2, but the problem is the problem.
Who would it be sure?
Who is the garants of something that is literally bigger than anything you can think about anything you can think about whatever you can think about what?
It's a very big volume.
It's a difficult problem.
The next day would be a nuclear energy.
She's three problems.
Cost, especially in countries.
The problem safety, to be the line that nothing can happen to be able to happen to humans, although human operators are not going to be used for the arms.
And then what do you do with resident?
And even then, even though we are not very much.
People have to feel well in with this.
So there are three problems that might be very difficult problems and so we should be working to them.
The last five of three of the five them together.
These are the world that people called the world renewable.
But they really don't need -- even though they don't need the fuel, they don't need the disadvantage.
One is that the density of these technologies is much smaller than an electrical centers.
These are farms, we talk about a lot of kilometers, a surface of thousands of times bigger than a normal from a normal.
All of these are intermitem.
It doesn't stop all the daughter and not strangers and not standing every day.
If we depend on these source, we have a methods to get energy in those periods in the time is not available.
Here we have big problems.
We have difficult with transportation.
For example, to say that a source of energy is affairs, but you have to exposure, but you have to exposure, you have to exposure.
And, finally, there is the problem is the problem.
And to understand the dimensions of the dimensions, I took all the types that are produced the machine, land, land, language.
I compared that we compared that a consumption of the world and we discovered that all the batteries that we could reach less than 10 minutes.
So, in fact, we need a significant progress here, a hundreds of times better than what we have now.
It's not impossible, but it's not easy.
And this problem when we want to intermitself to be the pest, 20 percent of the consumption, 20 percent of the consumption.
If we based on it for 100 percent, we need a mirac.
Well, how do we go to the right way?
Is a Manhattanhattanh?
Well, we need a lot of companies that are going to work on this, sudden.
At every five drums, we need the leap of 100 people.
And in many of them will look and you'll tell you that they're neighborhood.
I think here in the TED group, we have a lot of people that already.
Bill Gross a couple of companies, which has a big companies, which has a terms of excellent technology.
Vinine Kohospitals in the investment that are remarkable things that are doing, and they have the possibilities of interesting, and I try to suspect it.
Nathan Myhrvold and I even had a company that we had a surprising company to the nuclear.
There's some innovation in innovation in the nuclear in the nuclear of the nuclear is lying.
But innovation has actually stopped in this area, so many times, so many times, so it would not be surprised to be surprised.
The idea of TerraPower is that, instead of the urban, that is 235, and we decided to look at the 235, we decided to look at the 99 percent of the U.K.
It's a good idea.
It's actually been talking about it for a long time, but it could never feel simple or not.
Only because of the supercomputer disorders now can be able to be able to feel and see that it can be able to feel that works, it turns out.
And because they arrid of the 999 percent, the profile, the project.
In fact, we look at and we can use the rights and we can use all repressed all the reactors.
Instead of us for them, they use them. It's a great thing.
Inspiring the following as advantage. It's like a kind of world.
And you can see here, a kind of bug, called a progressive progressive progressive."
At the fuel, this is actually solving the problem.
I am here a picture in the Kentucky.
These are residents, the 999 percent of the 99 percent remained the part of the right now.
It's the money.
All the needs of the United States for hundreds of years.
And by the movies of movies in a big process in a process for the whole lifetime.
So we expect a lot of difficult a lot of difficult, but it's an example of hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to advanced.
Let's thinking, how we could we avoid?
How should we look at our book,
Well, let's see where we need to look at where we need to look at the intermediately.
For 2050 percent people heard a lot of people talking about 80 percent.
It's very important to get there.
And the 20 percent will be consumed by what happens in countries and over countries and over the country.
Let's hope that we're going to be the silick, the cyme.
In order to get the 80 percent of the developed countries, including countries like China, should be able to produce their production production.
The other note notice is if we apply this technology with emission, if we brought in all the countries of the world.
That's important.
This is a key element in completely new car.
We do a step up a step to the arm of the neighborhood?
Well, again, again, we should have two elements.
We should be appeared these measures of efficiency to begin to begin to begin to begin to begin to begin to begin
The more and more than the CO2 will the CO2 will the CO2 and the temperature of CO2 and temperature.
But in a way, new way that we haven't get things that we don't go to reduce things that we don't go to reduce a little bit less than the otherwise than the innovation of innovation, which is the progress.
These progress have to speak at the speech, and we can measure with companies, the projects that have been changed with companies that have been changed.
They wrote a lot of books,
Al Gore, "Al Gore, and our book and the book, "Energy MacKay, "Energy MacKay.
They were all at the food, and it creates and create a way that the world can talk about these things, because we need a suspect for it.
You have to be a lot of things to be able to capture.
It's a sleep.
It's a very concrete desire to invent this technology.
If I could be able to choose only one of the next 50 years ago, I could choose to the next 50 years old, I could choose a vaccine, and I could choose a vaccine, and I could choose the energy, or without the food, or without CO2, without CO2, without CO2.
I wish that I would choose that I would choose it.
It has the highest impact.
If you don't get this desire this desires, the division between the people who think about the long terms of the long terms of the United States, between the United States and China, between the poorest and China, between the poorest of those two billion people.
What should we do?
What do you love you run to do you have to do you get and put it in the move?
We need more funny research.
When the countries are connected to Copenhag, for example, it wouldn't talk about CO2.
It should talk about this innovation of innovations.
It would surprised how small squares are spending to these innovative research.
It needs and stimulate markets on the CO2, stimulate in CO2, so that the precision.
We need to spread message.
You have to be able to become more rational conversation, including measure, including the government.
It's a important desires, but that I think we can deploy.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Can to understand more about Terrather about TerraPower, you can give you an ideas about the scaling ideas about the scale?
Bill Gates: To make the software, to buy the supercomputer scientists, which is only a lot of scientists, which is just a millions of million.
Even when we test our materials in a rush materials, to be safe that our materials works, we will reach hundreds of million.
For the difficult is building the reactors of the reactors of a few billion of the authority of the building of the building of this.
After you build it on the first one, if it goes like in the days, then it's clear as light to the light of the energy of the useless, are very different from the black of the tool.
CA: How do we understand how to understand how to build build in the ground in the ground, of a vertical cycle, a nuclear fuel, this kind of urban, and then the project, and then the process beginning?
BG: This is what it is.
This is not good.
If you have very effect, if you have a very effect, you can let it and there is 60 years -- we can him, and you don't have the same complexity.
Only standing there and the arm of 60 years ago, and then it's gator.
CA: It's a nuclear is a nuclear that is and the process of elimine.
BG: Yeah. Well, what happens with residents, you can let them out there -- there is much less you can actually take a little bit less you can actually take a lot of resident.
And we begin with residents that are now in the basis now in the basis now in the reactors.
So from this fuel.
And the thing that represent a problem for these reactors is actually the maybe, and reducing the volume.
CA: But in discussions with different people all around the world with the possibilities, where you found the largest way to do something concrete to do something concre?
BG: I didn't chose a precision, and there are all these dival rulgirls.
We're interested in a lot of people in the company in Russia, China.
I met here I met here with the minister and I talked about the place, and I talked about the place,
I'm optimistic you know that the French and Japancer and the Japan,
This is a variant various variant.
It's a important developing development, but it's like a quick reactor, and so many countries that have built in the countries that have built a quick reactor that will be built the first between them.
CA: What do you see, when and what probability is going to be concrete?
BG: For one of the birds of large electrical dimensions that is very cheap, and then we have 20 years to involve it.
And this is the terms of the environmental environmental models.
And TerraPower, if things go well, which is a big desire, which is a big desires.
Now there are now from happiness, you need to be sustainable to be hundred of their researching for their reactors for their reacted to the reactors for it.
And it's the best if I could be able to be able to combine, because then we could combine.
We need to measure a measure.
CA: How do a changes possible, is this largest scale.
BG: A energy revolution is the most important thing.
It was even even no limitations of environment, but the limitations of environmental environment.
In the nuclear nuclear innovators.
You know, we don't know them as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as you go on to the other hand.
There's a license reactor, which seems a little bit of difficult, but maybe they say, but maybe they say to us.
So there is a variety variety.
The beauty is that a molecule molecule has a million times more powerful energy.
So if we can solve the negative, which is the radiation of the radiation of ecologically, the potential, the potentially and so forth, and so on.
CA: What if you don't work?
We're going to have to start to take measures of urgency to keep temperature?
BG: If we get in situation in the situation is like too much and you have a lot of the bottom.
And then what do you do you need to have the surgery.
There's a certain research in which the eye in which the eye of different techniques of different technique with 20 or 30 years, to organize with 20 or 30 years.
But this is just a police that is just a policy.
We don't need to need it.
Some people say that we must have not must work to work, because we might not be able to make sure the lenses, that we can do keep the surgery, because we knew that we knew that it will save us that we knew that it will save the church.
I don't believe that this is the wishing issue, but there are in the geopenings -- if we wouldn't have to get the police in the pocket in the pocket or whether this innovation.
CA: CA: The climate change, in a sentence or two, what do you say?
BG: At neighborhoods of different kinds of different table.
The people who have argument scientific argure are very little bit.
I tell you that there are effecting effects of invertising that modify works?
There's very few things that can tell things that I can tell you.
They have a million to a million to a million to have a million to have a right.
The problem here is about SIDA.
You're now wrong, and you pay for much later.
When you have all kinds of problems, the idea is the idea of a dozens now to have a dozen, and the field, and the field.
In fact, we actually have the IPCC, which is not reflecting the most people in the world, and there are people in IPCCCC and says, it's not so much like that.
In fact, in fact, we just need to motivate us to motivate ourselves.
But my dream here is to get an economic and simultaneously and simultaneously rejection and the limitations will tell me that I wouldn't be says, "I wouldn't be able to accept the CO2, but I would be able to accept CO2.
CA: So this would be the answer of Bjorn Lomborg, which says that if they consume that if you consume to solve the problem of the CO2, not to try to solve the world to try to get the poorest of the pooresources and alarity and alary, and alary, and others, and alarm that we have a best things like money.
BG: In actually spending for the research and developing and development -- to say that the United States should spend about 10 billion years ago -- I'm not going to spend about 10 billion -- I'm not so dramatic.
It wouldn't remain other involved.
The thing that you spend a lot of people spend a lot of people are resonably not be able when you try to fund something new, it's when you try to finance.
And so, for me, it's in a big rise of the situation of the situation and just financy and just financy and just financy to be very cheap.
I think we should be trying to try more things that have the potential to be much more cheap.
If we go to the compromison to massive energy can be able to do it.
Anyone between us here could pay here could pay for five times more on energy changing our life.
Devos is for those two billion billion.
And even Lompt has changed.
He's now is: Why don't they talk about the research?
because of workers in the third workers are associated associated with the table, but he realized that it's a very quick, but he realized that it's a researcher researcher research.
It's a funny of something right.
And the research and development and development, is a research.
CA: Bill, I support that I speak in the number of people here when you say that you look like you to look at you very much.
BG: Thank you.
I want to share you with a few months, while I wrote a few months, while I was writing.
When I wrote, I wrote, I always want.
But already I wrote by writing the article and I realized that I didn't look at the word "diabe."
Let me read definition.
"Drolled "Des," substantived, the networks, nonetheless, sagnes; the mutily, sleep, exually sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, barramoll, shadows, shadows, sourced, blood fespecially sourced, beautiful, source.
You see it and swimming and slab.
Antonym: healthy, powerful.
I read a friend and I read and I read it.
It was absurgery.
After I went to 'school, and he left me left me and I had to stop myself, and I had to stop my emotional produced.
My grandmother, my old old arm.
I thought that could be a lot of deliver.
But he came from the beginning of the beginning of the '80s, when I was trying to understand where I was trying to understand where I was trying to understand where my family and how to report my children, and the world around me.
The Dman that I haven't use a dictionary.
After this definition, it turns out that I was born in a world that I thought that someone has no sense.
But today, they're recognizing for the opportunities and adventure that my life.
So, I looked immediately in edian ediation of 2009, hoping a major modification of most of the majory.
Here's the new version of definition.
Again, it's not better with nothing.
The last 22 words, under "All of the All of the anonym."
Not only words are the problem.
It's what we think about people we believe in this way.
It's about the values from the words of the words and how we build them.
Our language thinking, and the way we see the world and the way we see the world and the other people.
In fact, many societies, includes and romans, and I thought I was a very powerful, because I had a very powerful, because when I said to be able to exist.
So what do we want to create it?
a person who has limitations or a powerful person?
So we actually call that we call a kid, we might call it might be able to stop.
Don't be better to open a dog?
And a man who opened me a doctor of my childhood, from my childhood, from the Wilmington of the Wilmington of Wilmington of Wilmington of Wilmington of Wilmington, Delawa.
His name is Dr.Pizzutillo.
American origin hospitalist, which seemed that it's too difficult for American pronunting.
So his Dr.P.
Dr.P. Ph.P.
I was at the time I was at hospital, except of the physics.
I needed to make exercise exercises with these benefits of benefits of listening to myself.
I was one of the southern benefits.
They too.
And then, I had five years, I was already trying to convince Dr.P.
In one day, he came to the window --
There were some girls and eventually --
And he said, "You know, you're a girl girl, you are so powerful.
But what he made it was to transform a new obligation in a new experience in a new experience in a new experience in a new experience.
And I ask me and today he said that he said that there was a powerful girl of powerful influenced me today I see today.
This is an example of the way of adults, which is the power can decline a child.
But by those definitions of dictionary, our language we don't allow us to create reality to create reality.
Our language is not at the house with our societies, many of them being produced technology.
Of course that, from a medical point of drug medical, the operation with my deficial for deficians, and the protect for deficians, which allows their abilities, which allows their abilities, which allows their abilities and shared to natform on their natforms on their natforms on their natforms that allow people to hear their natforms that allows the people who allow people to hear their own group.
Maybe that technology now that technology now that we always had always to be truth.
The thing that every man has something rarely and powerful and powerful society and the ability to adapt is the biggest to our bigger is the largest dog.
And the kinds to adapt is an interesting, because people want to talk to people want to talk about the forest of the deforests and I'm going to do a mistake.
I never enjoyed this expression, and I met the questions about it.
I think I started to understand why.
And it turns out in the problem of adversity and the idea that the successful or happiness means that the success of a great experience.
But, in fact, we have a big change. We have a big challenge or emotional.
I want to suggest that this is a good thing.
Adversity is not an obstack that you have to be able to live our life.
It makes our life.
I think it's a kind of beautiful.
Sometimes a lot of lots of lots of love, but it's always like me.
I don't try to give you the impact the impact with the adversity.
In life, there is adversity and provocation is not if you have this adversity, but the question isn't if you have this adversity, but the way that you will react.
And so our because our data is not just to protect the adversity that I love the people that I love to prepare with it.
We're doing a kid, when we do a children, when we make it feels incapable of adapts.
There's a important difference between the fact that I suffered that I suffered a society and the opinion of society, if we have or not diable.
And to be syndrome, the only disorder that I confront was the fact that the world belief that the world can be described by those definitions.
For our desire to the protect of the people you who love them on the future of the future of the future of the future of the future of the future that we have to be able to deal with somebody to feel inherite.
The thing you see that it's in neregulating with yourself can be much more dark than four.
Because we don't treat the person in the totality and they don't recognize the resistence, we transmit the other problem of the other problems.
We have aevaluating the importance of that in society.
So we have to see the things that is capable of stuff that is capable of home.
And, especially formed a partnership between those deficians, and the biggest ability of creatures.
We don't have to become figuring or to get these difficult moments and avoids, but let's get the opportunities, but to find the opportunities.
The idea that I want to sublue is not only to deploy is not only to get advertising, but let's open to him, to make it a terms of it, to use it a term terms of him, can actually dance with it.
And maybe we're going to see something as naturally, consists and use, something that we don't have in job.
In this year, Charles Darwin 200 years ago, and now 150 years ago, and the Darwin on the evolution, Darwin a really human character.
For affair, not the most powerful species of survival survival species and not adapt to change.
The conflict generates the creation.
Darwin of Darwin, and we can see that the ability to see that the ability to survival to survive and to survive the human, from the human, from the conflict.
All right, transformation, adaptation is the largest attribute is the biggest one.
And maybe until we're testing, we don't know what we are capable of what we are capable of what we are capable of what we are capable.
Maybe this is an advertis: a simple sense of synthetic knowledge of the power of the power of power.
So we can do alone.
We can define the adversity as much more than small.
We can see it as a change.
Adversity is changing that we haven't adapt.
I think the biggest adversity that we created is the idea of normality.
Who is normal?
There's no normality.
There are living his community lives, but not and not normal.
And you really wanted to know?
I don't think.
If we can change this paradigm in the aspig, to normality or force to be able to tell a little bit more, we can run a little bit of children, and we can release the kinds of valuable valuable networks.
Antropologists tell us that the only thing that we have asked the community of the community was to be used to be used to contribute to contribution.
He found that people in Neanderthal Neanderthal people with 60,000 years old, and the books, and maybe their deficians, and maybe their experience of survival to survive the survival.
They're not seeing these people like incompanies like incompanies.
They were considered and values and value.
A couple of years ago, I was in a nature, in the nature, in that area, and I looked at the Likvania, and I looked at a bottom.
It was wants in the pants. I was in the pants.
I heard the voice of a men in my backward to be the Aimmediately, if it's not Aimee and I saw a lot of the bott." And I saw a bottom.
I said, "I said, "Don't remember it? Not knowledge myself." And he said, "I don't remind me of my father told me to be mind."
"When we knew that we just known to help your mother."
So he was it.
And I remember.
And the man was the Dr.Kean, a man I knew that I just knew that my mothers, because of my mother, because of my mother, I came to the world with a meeting of two weeks.
And the doctor of my mothers.
So the one that held helped to the world was a street for my parents.
And because I was born, I was born and because I had a successful and only a few degree and only a couple of deliver.
And he said, "I had to say, "I had to say they had to say that you haven."

Dr.K.
He understood that there is a difference between the diagnostic, and the way that somebody reacts to him.
And my mentality has changed over time.
If you have asked me to 15 years if I would ask for a legacy of the book, and I wouldn't have a second-second.
At the time, aspiry at that kind of normality.
If you ask me today, I'm not so sure I am not so sure.
And thank you." And thank you for the experiences that we had with them and they weren't with them and "
Maybe this changes from me because I was exposed because I was exposed to more people who have drawed me in the front.

If you can give you somebody else the cheese, the spirit is so receiving the power -- if you can do, you open a crucial moment to a crucial moment.
You learn how to open it up.
In fact, the word "The word of educat."
It means to put it in the first person in the first potential value of potential.
So what can we do, what can we have to do in eviden?
She did a study in the Britain, in the '60s, when they went to the schools in the schools of the buildings.

They're separated with A, with A, with A, C, with the teeth.
People had a better programmed programming programming program.
First of three months, students with new students have been received A, he said that they're A, he said.
After this period of three months, they had been performance.
My Reverse was that the students was that students had been told you that I am said that I am was not.
And that happened after three months.
Some of the schools were in school.
The crucial crucial of this study is that and the teachers were forests.
They didn't know that changed something.
They told them that students have been D.
And they treated themselves.
I think the only hands is a spirit is a spirit has no longer hope.
Not beauty.
It has no longer nature, and the ability and the ability and the ability and image.
If you change it, we can determine a spirit of a human spirit of a beautiful, to see the beautiful and see the power of the power of the power of imagination, means that we should use the power as well.
When a spirit has those qualities, we can create new realities, we can create new reality.
